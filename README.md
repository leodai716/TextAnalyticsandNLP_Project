# TextAnalyticsandNLP_Project
Application of Text Analytics and NLP in Brexit-Sentiment-Driven Financial Indicators

## Motivation 
The United Kingdomâ€™s departure from the European Union has been delayed multiple times due to failure of political parties in reaching compromises of Brexit deal. Parliamentary approval of the bill is critical to the Brexit process. As the outcome of Brexit divorce deal has major implications to the global financial market as well as investment strategies, we particularly interested in collecting public opinions that would be reflected in the investment decision of the public.  
In this project, we will be capturing the public's sentiment through analyzing news articles of British media with Natural Language Processing Techniques. We aim to find correlations between public sentiment and market movemen.

## Steps  
1. Data collection   
2. Data preprocessing  
3. Running Machine Learning Model   
4. Applying Model to classify previous events  
5. Back test results with financial data to find correlation
