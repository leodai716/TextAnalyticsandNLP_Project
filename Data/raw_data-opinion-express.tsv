JAN3	The Home Secretary is right about the migrants - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE Home Secretary has questioned whether the people attempting to cross the Channel are genuine asylum seekers: it took no time at all for the usual suspects to start screeching the place down.  His words were "utterly disgusting" yelled Labour MP Stella Creasy: oh no they were not. “Europe cannot close its borders," warned Jeremy Corbyn: oh yes it can and the Leader of the Opposition might not have noticed this, but it is Europe's porous borders that have caused a crisis across the continent. Its slowness to act has made a parlous situation even worse.
JAN3	Diary of a lifetime is still a work in progress, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	IT'S THAT special time of the year again, when you unwrap a little box to find a jewel-coloured trinket lurking inside – yes, it's time to open the new year diary. Apparently the use of actual paper diaries is falling, due to digital versions on phones and laptops, but seriously, there is nothing to beat the traditional variety. And call me a Luddite, but unlike a computerised models, a real one won't break down.  It's a joy opening a brand new diary: all those empty pages to be filled with life events yet to be lived.
JAN3	The rail network has become a national disgrace, says LEO McKINSTRY	SPEAKING on New Year's Day, the embattled Transport Secretary Chris Grayling tried to deliver an optimistic message about the rail network: “I want passenger journeys to be as good as they can be, punctual, reliable and fairly priced.” But his words will have been greeted with a sarcastic laugh by train users.  For at the very moment that Grayling extolled his vision of a brave new world of travel, brutal rises in fares came into effect, bringing more misery for passengers after months of chaos on the system.
JAN3	Fine patients who do not turn up to appointments- EXPRESS COMMENT	WE ARE constantly told that the NHS is the jewel in the national crown, the institution to be revered and protected above all else, the very foundation stone on which the welfare state is built... but it seems that over 15 million of us are not getting the message  That is the number who missed appointments last year, costing £216 million annually and causing no end of inconvenience for the medics while also penalising other patients who are being made to wait weeks for an appointment of their own.
JAN3	Foster parents are the unsung heroes of family life, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	AMONG the unsung heroes and heroines of our society are foster parents. A very large group of them came along to the pantomime last week and with them the children, black and white, large and small, bright and special needs. They all looked happy, clean, well-fed and were prattling about the show.  They were indistinguishable from the other children but each and every one of them had a background of anguish, which these temporary parents were quietly teaching them to handle.
JAN3	We must rally round to save the UK’s high streets, says TIM NEWARK	I HAVE so many happy memories of HMV that it was sad to hear it go into administration just before Christmas. Hours spent flipping through album covers and then CDs but now my music comes as downloads for a fraction of the price. I miss the accumulation of discs but they are just one more object that has been digitised and yet another familiar part of the high street gone for good.  If 2018 was bad enough for the high street, that trend looks set to accelerate this year.
JAN3	My top 20 for a joyous 2019, says VANESSA FELTZ	Gentle reader, A very Happy New Year. May I wish you all you wish for yourselves in 2019 and hope you luxuriate in tip-top health, a generous dollop of wealth and unlimited portions of joyful felicity.  Here, as much for my own clarification as your information, are my New Year's resolutions for 2019.
JAN3	It's time to turn the page and start a fresh chapter - EXPRESS COMMENT	ENOUGH of this doom and gloom. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JAN3	Glimmer of hope in battle with scourge of dementia - EXPRESS COMMENT	AS THE new year dawns, dementia remains one of our most urgent priorities. In the UK alone, about 850,000 people live with the disease in its various forms, with numbers expected to rise to more than a million by 2022.  It is an immense and growing challenge. But there are glimmers of hope, particularly as the policy emphasis moves towards prevention, helping future generations to guard against its onset. For example, there is already a 20-minute health check available to anyone aged 40 and over that looks at risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease and how they can be controlled.
JAN3	Stop this migrant taxi service in the English Channel, demands LEO McKINSTRY	DITHERING seems to be the default mode of our enfeebled Government. A mood of timidity and impotence prevails about so many issues facing our country, from Brexit to knife crime. The same weakness can be seen in the disturbing crisis over migrant boats in the English Channel.  Due to prolonged inaction by British and French authorities, the problem appears to be escalating.
JAN4	The people will at last be listened to, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	IT IS always pleasant to draw a bow at a venture and later observe the arrow has hit the target gold. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JAN4	Prisoners should not have telephones in their cells - EXPRESS COMMENT	WHEN this newspaper revealed recently that prisoners were getting phones in their cells people were rightly shocked. But it now seems that insult has been added to injury and the Government has negotiated cheap rates for lags to make their telephone calls.  It is worth remembering that the Government has only just got round to scrapping the exorbitant rates charged to people calling NHS helplines. It took years of pressure to end the 55p-a-minute rate for people who had been given a misquote on their Universal Credit. Yet without any pressure at all ministers have decided to offer a low-cost service to some of the most undeserving people in society.
JAN4	Deal or no deal, Britain will thrive outside the EU, says ROSS CLARK	I COULD not blame anyone who is stockpiling food and medicine. The admission by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay yesterday that the Government is now making very serious preparations for a "no-deal" Brexit will leave many people scared. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

JAN5	Inside Politics: May's big freeze set to continue	TORY MPs head back to a chilly Westminster next week with little sign of any thaw in the icy relations between the supporters and opponents of Theresa May's Brexit deal.  With the Commons debate on the EU withdrawal agreement set to resume on Wednesday, Downing Street aides have warned the Prime Minister not to expect an outbreak of new year goodwill from Eurosceptic party rebels. "The mood has not altered one jot. As the Prime Minister might say herself, nothing has changed," one hardline Brexiteer MP told me yesterday. Two weeks away from the febrile atmosphere of Westminster for the festive break has not calmed those MPs intending to vote against the deal in the so-called "meaningful vote" in the Commons scheduled for the week beginning January 14.
JAN5	Watch this space for inspiration, say RICHARD AND JUDY	R- SLIM pickings at this time of year for most newspaper columnists. Some use the old trick of recalling the passing year's highs and lows, which is fair enough, but seeing as it's already January 5 it's a bit late for that.  Others serve up pre-prepared, reheated dishes that were clearly written weeks ago as a hedge against the expected Christmas/ New Year news drought. Again, fair enough, but for some perverse reason I quite enjoy the element of risk in leaving one's weekly page open to inspiration and events. Or at least I thought I did.
JAN5	Enjoy a drink or two but be aware of your intake - EXPRESS COMMENT	WHETHER it is a quick gin and tonic, a glass of wine with dinner, a tipple of sherry or maybe a pint at the local, many of us enjoy a drink over Christmas and at other times of the year. And, of course, there is no harm in it in moderation.  But the effects of excessive drinking and alcoholic addiction are clear to all, and NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens is right to say that it can destroy lives and families. So, as many people prepare for “dry January” to recover from the excesses of the festive period, it is a good time for the NHS to launch its blitz on problem drinking with a new long-term plan. The introduction of alcohol care teams in the 25 per cent worst-affected areas is good news. 
JAN5	Obesity is no disease: it's a bad lifestyle choice, says STEPHEN POLLARD	LAST night my wife made an apple crumble. I haven't got an especially sweet tooth - I'd rather have a plate of cheese any day instead of dessert. But I do make an exception for apple crumble. It was so good I went back for seconds. Even as I was eating it I knew I shouldn't be.  While some people can eat anything and everything and not put on a pound, that's not me. At this time of year, when most have us have overindulged, many of us realise that we really do need to lose a few pounds. We need to take action to do something about it. For myself, it's more than a few pounds. To be blunt: I aS m obese. In a line-up of sumo wrestlers and me, you would be pushed to spot the odd man out.
JAN5	The people will at last be listened to, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	IT IS always pleasant to draw a bow at a venture and later observe the arrow has hit the target gold. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

JAN6	This is the REAL reason Corbyn has been so silent about Iran, says NIGEL FARAGE	PROTESTS in Iran about the regime’s economic problems, political repression and appalling corruption are spreading. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JAN6	We Leavers aren't stupid whatever TV's elite believe, says TIM NEWARK	HISTORY is written by winners, goes the quote often attributed to Winston Churchill but, in this case, the story of Brexit is being dramatised by the losers in tomorrow night's Channel 4 TV movie, Brexit: The Uncivil War - and it shows.  Remainer film and TV star Benedict Cumberbatch says that we'll be surprised at how balanced it really is but then says with faux sympathy how sad he is that Leave voters will be disappointed by Brexit when it happens.  Cumberbatch plays the Brexit campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings. "Cummings is honest," said the Sherlock star in a recent interview. 
JAN6	Screen time advice makes me scream, says ANNE DIAMOND	ARE YOU becoming allergic to experts on this and gurus on that telling us what to do, changing their advice, and using statistics to deny the blinking obvious?  There were a lot of very vocal experts over the festive season, with their edicts on curing the obesity epidemic, advice on alcohol consumption, smoking, sugary drinks, exercising, reading aloud to our children and singing nursery rhymes. Now comes more advice on how to deal with the Scourge Of Our Modern Digital Age "screen time". Well, I had thought it was a scourge - we've been warned for years about letting our children have too much. But now we're told those fears are unfounded.
JAN6	Jerry Hall makes way for Richard Gere, says ADAM HELLIKER	WHEN Jerry Hall married media mogul Rupert Murdoch nearly three years ago, her former love Sir Mick Jagger generously agreed she could remain in the £14million house in West London that had once been their family home.  But now the Rolling Stone, who is renowned for his financial shrewdness, has taken back full ownership of splendid Downe House in Richmond and has promptly begun making money from the Georgian property by letting it to actor Richard Gere. The 69-year-old star of American Gigolo and Pretty Woman is using the house as a base while he films an eight-part drama for BBC Two called Mother, Father, Son. Living with him is Alejandra Silva, 35, the Spanish entrepreneur whom he married last year and who is expecting their baby in the spring.
JAN6	Train bosses have gone off the rails, says NICK FERRARI	AS MANY of you are probably preparing for a return to work tomorrow - although spare a thought for the emergency services, hospital and retail staff and many, many others (including even journalists!) who have toiled through the lengthy break - here's a question to get your thought processes flowing again.  Can you name the service that has slumped to a 13-year low in punctuality, costs five times more than its European counterparts, has hiked pay to its hapless bosses by, in some instances, more than 20 per cent and yet has just announced the biggest price rise since 2013? Go straight to a first class seat, complete with complimentary hot breakfast, if you said our creaking, clapped out and almost comedic rail service. If prizes were handed out for bare-faced, brazen cheek both the rail network and the Government that sanctions its demands for more of our cash would be sure-fire Oscar winners.
JAN6	Mental health boost will benefit millions - EXPRESS COMMENT	BACK in 2012 this newspaper launched a crusade to revolutionise mental health services in this country which had been woefully neglected. To describe them at that point as the "Cinderella service of the NHS" severely understated the parlous state that mental health support had got into.  So something big had to be done. Today's announcement by Theresa May marks a major victory for the Sunday Express after more than six years of highlighting the need to put mental health on a par with physical health. Millions of people will receive better support and treatment as a result and that, in turn, will help the country as a whole. The Prime Minister should be congratulated for doing the right thing and seeing through her own pledge on improving provision.

In a line-up of sumo wrestlers and me, you would be pushed to spot the odd man out.
JAN7	A shot in the arm for the NHS that's badly needed - EXPRESS COMMENT	POLITICALLY motivated it may be, but news of life-saving investment in the NHS is hugely welcome.  Plans to tackle killer conditions will save almost half a million more lives over the next decade, in a world-class, cutting-edge health service. More than three million patients will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services, the Government says. And then there's the extra mental health help for 345,000 more children and young people through community-based services, including in schools.
JAN7	We must be bold – Brexit must unleash our economy to boom, says TIM NEWARK	MAKING Britain a bolder, richer, go-getting nation is what Brexit should be about, unleashing us from a stultifying bureaucracy that hampers innovation and frustrates a buccaneering attitude to grabbing a bigger slice of global trade. It's good to see Chief Secretary of the Treasury Liz Truss setting out such a vision.  Fully embracing Brexit, she said yesterday: "This year's Spending Review will set government budgets from 2020 – and it's vital we use it as a catalyst to unleash the economy."
JAN7	This is the REAL reason Corbyn has been so silent about Iran, says NIGEL FARAGE	PROTESTS in Iran about the regime’s economic problems, political repression and appalling corruption are spreading. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

JAN8	Helping families in debt would boost confidence - EXPRESS COMMENT	JANUARY is always a cruel month for household finances, and a report from the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has found that families across the UK are suffering from unprecedented debt levels: an average of 30.4 per cent as a share of household income.  Aside from mortgages, unsecured debt in the latter half of 2018 saw a rise of £886 per household on the previous year, with total debt adding up to an astonishing £428billion, compared to £286billion in 2008.
JAN8	There are always casualties when divorce becomes a war of attrition, says VANESSA FELTZ	YOU'RE reading this the morning after Divorce Day. You know, that chastening date in the calendar when overexposure to your other half during the festive period has been less "comfort and joy" and more internecine warfare. You contrast the wretchedness of your own rotten marriage with the contented couples wearing co-ordinating pyjamas and blissfully carving turkeys in every twinkling Yuletide telly advert.  You gaze enviously at younger relatives waltzing arm in arm through the honeymoon period, locked in eternal embrace beneath the mistletoe, still burning with the belief that they will live happily ever after.
JAN8	University can be wonderful but it’s not for everyone, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT IS now so normal for school leavers to go into higher education that it is often difficult to remember how recent a phenomenon this is. In previous generations, a university education was the preserve of a small minority. Today, 49 percent of people under 30 have been on some kind of advanced education course – with one in three 18-year-olds starting a degree course in 2017.  We are now almost at the level that Tony Blair floated in 2001 when he set in train the expansion in higher education, saying, "there is no greater ambition for Britain than to see a steadily rising proportion gain the huge benefits of a university education as school standards rise, meeting our goal of 50 percent of young adults progressing to higher education".

JAN8	Jerry Hall makes way for Richard Gere, says ADAM HELLIKER	WHEN Jerry Hall married media mogul Rupert Murdoch nearly three years ago, her former love Sir Mick Jagger generously agreed she could remain in the £14million house in West London that had once been their family home.  But now the Rolling Stone, who is renowned for his financial shrewdness, has taken back full ownership of splendid Downe House in Richmond and has promptly begun making money from the Georgian property by letting it to actor Richard Gere. The 69-year-old star of American Gigolo and Pretty Woman is using the house as a base while he films an eight-part drama for BBC Two called Mother, Father, Son. Living with him is Alejandra Silva, 35, the Spanish entrepreneur whom he married last year and who is expecting their baby in the spring.
JAN8	Train bosses have gone off the rails, says NICK FERRARI	AS MANY of you are probably preparing for a return to work tomorrow - although spare a thought for the emergency services, hospital and retail staff and many, many others (including even journalists!) who have toiled through the lengthy break - here's a question to get your thought processes flowing again.  Can you name the service that has slumped to a 13-year low in punctuality, costs five times more than its European counterparts, has hiked pay to its hapless bosses by, in some instances, more than 20 per cent and yet has just announced the biggest price rise since 2013? Go straight to a first class seat, complete with complimentary hot breakfast, if you said our creaking, clapped out and almost comedic rail service. If prizes were handed out for bare-faced, brazen cheek both the rail network and the Government that sanctions its demands for more of our cash would be sure-fire Oscar winners.
JAN9	Phone home: FERGUS KELLY looks at the latest Ofcom study on phone use	The latest Ofcom study, which found that time spent on landline telephone calls has halved in only five years was no surprise in itself. The majority of us today are reliant on our mobiles. Virtually the only callers on the landline we keep in the house are the con artists with their fake recorded messages about our internet connection being about to go down.  More significant were comments from focus group members participating in Ofcom's research.
JAN9	Cowards are hiding behind chaos theory, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	WITH almost three months to go until the deadline for leaving the EU, you would think the Government actually wanted chaos. We hear nothing but scare stories from ministers about what will happen if we "crash out" of the EU. Anyone would think they have no clue as to what will happen next. Yet the reverse is true: for two years contingency plans have been formed, with civil servants working to ensure a smooth transition to World Trade Organisation terms.  A responsible government would tell us this, would want to reassure the nation, would give proper information about what is planned.
JAN9	Rebel Remainer alliance deserves to live in infamy - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE unholy alliance of 22 Tory Remainer MPs, Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems who succeeded in pushing through a Budget amendment yesterday to block spending on a no-deal Brexit have attacked the core of British democracy.  These MPs are the embodiment of the Remainer elites who talk of a "people's vote" but actually hold the electorate's wish to leave the EU in contempt. Let us be in no doubt: they are determined to do everything to stop Brexit from happening and prevent the will of the people from being implemented. This has been their game since the establishment was shocked by voters on June 23, 2016. And what excuse did these MPs such as Yvette Cooper and Anna Soubry give?
JAN9	The NHS needs to be run like an efficient business, says TIM NEWARK	IT'S GREAT news that the NHS is getting an extra £20billion under the Government's new 10-year plan, but with that enormous sum of taxpayers' money comes the responsibility to spend it wisely and effectively. Too often now the NHS is like some soft-hearted parent willing to indulge every little complaint from their spoilt children as though it is life-threatening.  Obesity is generally not a disease that needs costly care. I lost two stone in three months by eating and drinking less and exercising more.
JAN9	Helping families in debt would boost confidence - EXPRESS COMMENT	JANUARY is always a cruel month for household finances, and a report from the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has found that families across the UK are suffering from unprecedented debt levels: an average of 30.4 per cent as a share of household income.  Aside from mortgages, unsecured debt in the latter half of 2018 saw a rise of £886 per household on the previous year, with total debt adding up to an astonishing £428billion, compared to £286billion in 2008.
JAN9	There are always casualties when divorce becomes a war of attrition, says VANESSA FELTZ	YOU'RE reading this the morning after Divorce Day. You know, that chastening date in the calendar when overexposure to your other half during the festive period has been less "comfort and joy" and more internecine warfare. You contrast the wretchedness of your own rotten marriage with the contented couples wearing co-ordinating pyjamas and blissfully carving turkeys in every twinkling Yuletide telly advert.  You gaze enviously at younger relatives waltzing arm in arm through the honeymoon period, locked in eternal embrace beneath the mistletoe, still burning with the belief that they will live happily ever after.
JAN9	University can be wonderful but it’s not for everyone, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT IS now so normal for school leavers to go into higher education that it is often difficult to remember how recent a phenomenon this is. In previous generations, a university education was the preserve of a small minority. Today, 49 percent of people under 30 have been on some kind of advanced education course – with one in three 18-year-olds starting a degree course in 2017.  We are now almost at the level that Tony Blair floated in 2001 when he set in train the expansion in higher education, saying, "there is no greater ambition for Britain than to see a steadily rising proportion gain the huge benefits of a university education as school standards rise, meeting our goal of 50 percent of young adults progressing to higher education".
JAN9	A shot in the arm for the NHS that's badly needed - EXPRESS COMMENT	POLITICALLY motivated it may be, but news of life-saving investment in the NHS is hugely welcome.  Plans to tackle killer conditions will save almost half a million more lives over the next decade, in a world-class, cutting-edge health service. More than three million patients will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services, the Government says. And then there's the extra mental health help for 345,000 more children and young people through community-based services, including in schools.
JAN9	We must be bold – Brexit must unleash our economy to boom, says TIM NEWARK	MAKING Britain a bolder, richer, go-getting nation is what Brexit should be about, unleashing us from a stultifying bureaucracy that hampers innovation and frustrates a buccaneering attitude to grabbing a bigger slice of global trade. It's good to see Chief Secretary of the Treasury Liz Truss setting out such a vision.  Fully embracing Brexit, she said yesterday: "This year's Spending Review will set government budgets from 2020 – and it's vital we use it as a catalyst to unleash the economy."
JAN9	This is the REAL reason Corbyn has been so silent about Iran, says NIGEL FARAGE	PROTESTS in Iran about the regime’s economic problems, political repression and appalling corruption are spreading. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JAN10	The Speaker must remain unequivocally impartial - EXPRESS COMMENT	ONLY Speaker John Bercow knows why he ignored official advice and overturned centuries of precedent to change arbitrarily the rules of Parliament with no consultation or warning in a move that aided those who wish to stop Brexit from happening.  But we do know that he has spoken in favour of Remain and there is a bumper sticker on his wife's car supporting the Remain cause. All this gives a strong impression that Bercow has abandoned the tradition of impartiality in his role and is an active part of the ongoing establishment plot to overturn the referendum. Whatever his motives, Bercow's actions were a shameful abuse of power and he is not fit to hold the great office of Speaker.
JAN10	Dry January is enough to drive you to drink, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	HERE is my message to anyone opting for a dry January: you are insane. Yes, we've passed the shortest day of the year, spring is on its way and after excess over Christmas many feel the need to clear the system. But still.  Alongside all those people sanctimoniously refusing to allow a glass of beer or a sip of wine to sully their lips – and shouting to the rooftops about it – are the ones reaching for the phone to get on to a lawyer to fi le for divorce, as this is the month the majority do.
JAN10	There is no excuse for this negative approach to Brexit, fumes LEO McKINSTRY	THE 2016 referendum was the greatest voting exercise in the history of British democracy. After intense debates and a record turnout, the electorate sent a clear instruction to the Government for the return of our national independence from the European Union.  Yet shamefully our politicians have failed to act on this decisive verdict. Rather than implementing the people's will, they have indulged in endless delays, twisted propaganda, legalistic manoeuvres and enfeebled negotiations in their bid to thwart our departure.

JAN11	John Bercow: so petulant, pompous and profligate, says ADAM HELLIKER	The Speaker commissioned a portrait of himself for £37,000. He loves nothing more than a freebie to Wimbledon. And he spent £367 on a cab to lecture MPs on expenses.When will this absurd figure leave the stage? This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JAN11	How to deal with immigrant crisis, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	Border Force and Government have been driven to distraction by a sudden influx of small boats trying to cross from Calais to Kent bearing entire families of immigrants claiming to be refugees from persecution and even death. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JAN11	Single word that sums up Corbyn's Brexit shambles - EXPRESS COMMENT	SOMETIMES all it needs is a single word to sum up an issue. And we feel confident that Michael Gove spoke for the vast majority of the nation when he described Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit policy as b****cks.  Normally this newspaper does not condone rude language from senior public figures but today we congratulate the Environment Secretary for his plain speaking. So, unusually, we too are happy to repeat that Labour's policy on the most important political issue since the Second World War is b****cks. Under Corbyn's leadership the number of flip-flops on Brexit have been so high that people have stopped counting them. It is beyond a joke.
JAN11	Manufacturing is actually a huge success in the UK, says ROSS CLARK	AS SURE as the sun rises every morning, you know when you turn on the BBC's Today programme that you will be spun some tale of economic woe attributed to Brexit.  So it was yesterday with the news that Jaguar Land Rover is to cut 5,000 jobs in Britain, mostly administrative roles. Remarkably, presenters continued to push the line that Brexit was behind the job losses even after Lord Bhattacharyya, an adviser to India firm Tata Motors that owns Jaguar Land Rover, said the cuts have very little to do with Brexit - they are more to do with the company wanting to move more of its operations closer to overseas markets, especially China. What we don't hear about so much is that overall, UK manufacturing is undergoing a renaissance after decades of decline.

JAN12	Jeers will turn into tears, Anna, say RICHARD AND JUDY	LOST in the fury of hate-mongers screaming their abuse outside Parliament this week was another, even more disturbing noise. The sound of chickens coming home to roost.  MP Anna Soubry, so long the face of Brexit avoidance and denial, has been playing with fire ever since the British people decided, by the clearest of majorities, that they want out of Europe. This week, she got burned. (Well, let's be honest, more singed. Worse abuse features most weeks at Premier League football games). I am not for one second justifying the crude, aggressive language used by the ragtag far-right mob gathered outside the House of Commons. 
JAN12	Inside Politics: It's crunch time for battling PM	LIKE a First World War infantryman preparing to go over the top and march into the barbed wire and machine-gun fire, Theresa May is preparing for her big Commons vote this Tuesday with a sense of duty and foreboding.  The opposition forces lined up against the Prime Minister's EU Withdrawal Agreement appear insurmountable. Her strategists are focused on winning a few feet of political ground rather than achieving the breakthrough towards ultimate victory. Ahead of the Commons division about supporting her deal with Brussels, her generals are already plotting future battles amid expectations that she will have to return for a second and possibly third attempt at rallying a majority behind the package.
JAN12	Consultation on checkout treats is a welcome move - EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS cynical of retailers to put food and drink with a high sugar and fat content at checkouts where they know parents will come under pressure from their children to buy it.  It seems that pester power from children is too much for most parents to resist. The problem of childhood obesity is now approaching epidemic levels, health professionals have warned us. And much of the blame for this is the amount of unhealthy food that children are consuming.
JAN12	Trans rights do not trump all women's rights, says STEPHEN POLLARD	I HAVE always thought that the single most important line in the Bible is: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."  In other words, treat people with respect, whatever you might think of them or how they live their lives. That's surely a form of basic human decency. But you hardly need me to point out that it is not always observed. Far from it.

JAN13	Andy's tears are a sad lesson to us all, says ANNE DIAMOND	DESPITE his millions, highflying lifestyle and the expert team that surrounds him, one sentimental thing Andy Murray dreamed of giving his children was something money can't buy.  He wanted his two daughters to have the precious memory of their dad as a champ, at the top of his game, perhaps at Wimbledon winning another title. He wanted them to have witnessed the vision of their father as Britain's top sportsman, the best tennis player we've ever had, an absolute winner. Sadly as we now know, he cannot serve that up.
JAN13	Brexit: The wives' tale, says ADAM HELLIKER	THE NEW YEAR failed to bring forth any resolutions from David Cameron about forgiving his enemies.  He continues to rebuff conciliatory approaches from his former close friend Michael Gove, even though their wives have overcome their differences and are speaking again. Nearly three years after he called the EU referendum, Cameron continues to be in no mood to forgive what he saw as Gove's "two-faced treachery" over not supporting his Remain campaign. Gove's wife, Sarah Vine, has said Cameron was "shocked and hurt" when her husband decided he would back Brexit.
JAN13	May must stay strong and deliver on Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE Prime Minister is absolutely right to warn today that a failure to deliver Brexit will be a catastrophe for this country and destroy trust in politics.  Those Remainers who hope that defeat of the EU deal on Tuesday will bring about a second referendum to block Brexit should heed Mrs May's words. But the PM should also note the result of our poll, which shows that her deal as it stands - with its controversial backstop - is unacceptable to those polled, not just the vast majority of MPs. People in this country are prepared for no-deal and support it, despite the Remainers' Project Fear nonsense.
JAN13	If we believe in true equality we must help boys, says MARTIN DAUBNEY	IT'S BARELY mid-January but already we have a contender for the "Least Politically Correct Study Of 2019 Award" - a powerful research paper that has completely flipped the telescope on gender inequality.  Called "A simplified approach to measuring national gender inequality" it dared ask the forbidden question: might it be men and boys who are at the bottom? And, sensationally, it has concluded that in 68 per cent of countries, that is precisely the case. The study arrived at such a contra-narrative conclusion by devising a new - and more egalitarian - way of measuring equality than is the accepted norm.
JAN13	How can our police ever beat the MPs? asks NICK FERRARI	THE IRONY should be lost on no one.  Year after year, our politicians have presided over the criminal castration of our police forces, leaving many of us in fear of walking the streets, or even being alone at home at night. The police were even accused of "crying wolf" over staffing levels and finances by the most senior politician of the lot, Prime Minister Theresa May. It was also the PM, home secretary at the time, who warned police in 2014 they should review the practice of stop and search as it was discriminatory against young black men.

JAN14	This is a time for honour and hard-headed realism - EXPRESS COMMENT	POLITICS has long been a treacherous business.  But has it ever been quite as sordid as in Westminster now? There are traitors in all directions as the countdown begins to the most important parliamentary vote since the Second World War. Former attorney-general Dominic Grieve, Speaker John Bercow, ex-prime minister John Major, Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and the hopeless Jeremy Corbyn are all putting their own agendas or ambitions first and the future of this great country second.
JAN14	There is a cynical plot to take back control from the people, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE coup against Brexit is approaching its ugly climax. The prospect of national independence and the very existence of our democracy are in peril, thanks to the machinations of the pro-EU brigade. As the Commons prepares for tomorrow night's vote on the Prime Minister's Withdrawal Agreement, a large section of the political elite plans to exploit the turmoil at Westminster and overturn the result of the 2016 referendum.  Such a step would be an outrage. Parliament is meant to implement the wishes of the people, not subvert them.

Called "A simplified approach to measuring national gender inequality" it dared ask the forbidden question: might it be men and boys who are at the bottom? And, sensationally, it has concluded that in 68 per cent of countries, that is precisely the case. The study arrived at such a contra-narrative conclusion by devising a new - and more egalitarian - way of measuring equality than is the accepted norm.
JAN14	How can our police ever beat the MPs? asks NICK FERRARI	THE IRONY should be lost on no one.  Year after year, our politicians have presided over the criminal castration of our police forces, leaving many of us in fear of walking the streets, or even being alone at home at night. The police were even accused of "crying wolf" over staffing levels and finances by the most senior politician of the lot, Prime Minister Theresa May. It was also the PM, home secretary at the time, who warned police in 2014 they should review the practice of stop and search as it was discriminatory against young black men.
JAN14	Jeers will turn into tears, Anna, say RICHARD AND JUDY	LOST in the fury of hate-mongers screaming their abuse outside Parliament this week was another, even more disturbing noise. The sound of chickens coming home to roost.  MP Anna Soubry, so long the face of Brexit avoidance and denial, has been playing with fire ever since the British people decided, by the clearest of majorities, that they want out of Europe. This week, she got burned. (Well, let's be honest, more singed. Worse abuse features most weeks at Premier League football games). I am not for one second justifying the crude, aggressive language used by the ragtag far-right mob gathered outside the House of Commons. 
JAN14	Inside Politics: It's crunch time for battling PM	LIKE a First World War infantryman preparing to go over the top and march into the barbed wire and machine-gun fire, Theresa May is preparing for her big Commons vote this Tuesday with a sense of duty and foreboding.  The opposition forces lined up against the Prime Minister's EU Withdrawal Agreement appear insurmountable. Her strategists are focused on winning a few feet of political ground rather than achieving the breakthrough towards ultimate victory. Ahead of the Commons division about supporting her deal with Brussels, her generals are already plotting future battles amid expectations that she will have to return for a second and possibly third attempt at rallying a majority behind the package.
JAN14	Consultation on checkout treats is a welcome move - EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS cynical of retailers to put food and drink with a high sugar and fat content at checkouts where they know parents will come under pressure from their children to buy it.  It seems that pester power from children is too much for most parents to resist. The problem of childhood obesity is now approaching epidemic levels, health professionals have warned us. And much of the blame for this is the amount of unhealthy food that children are consuming.
JAN15	Don't open the door to a Labour Party land grab, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT IS not exactly the boldest prediction ever to suggest that when MPs vote tonight on the proposed Withdrawal Agreement, the issue isn't whether it will be defeated but by how much.  However, while we can be certain of what will happen tonight, no one has a clue what will follow tomorrow or afterwards. Not a single political commentator, not a single MP, not even the Prime Minister. Indeed, thanks to the Speaker tearing up the House of Commons rule book last week, Mrs May doesn't even know if she will be in charge of Brexit any longer.
JAN15	This is a time for honour and hard-headed realism - EXPRESS COMMENT	POLITICS has long been a treacherous business.  But has it ever been quite as sordid as in Westminster now? There are traitors in all directions as the countdown begins to the most important parliamentary vote since the Second World War. Former attorney-general Dominic Grieve, Speaker John Bercow, ex-prime minister John Major, Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and the hopeless Jeremy Corbyn are all putting their own agendas or ambitions first and the future of this great country second.
JAN15	There is a cynical plot to take back control from the people, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE coup against Brexit is approaching its ugly climax. The prospect of national independence and the very existence of our democracy are in peril, thanks to the machinations of the pro-EU brigade. As the Commons prepares for tomorrow night's vote on the Prime Minister's Withdrawal Agreement, a large section of the political elite plans to exploit the turmoil at Westminster and overturn the result of the 2016 referendum.  Such a step would be an outrage. Parliament is meant to implement the wishes of the people, not subvert them.
JAN15	Andy's tears are a sad lesson to us all, says ANNE DIAMOND	DESPITE his millions, highflying lifestyle and the expert team that surrounds him, one sentimental thing Andy Murray dreamed of giving his children was something money can't buy.  He wanted his two daughters to have the precious memory of their dad as a champ, at the top of his game, perhaps at Wimbledon winning another title. He wanted them to have witnessed the vision of their father as Britain's top sportsman, the best tennis player we've ever had, an absolute winner. Sadly as we now know, he cannot serve that up.
JAN15	Brexit: The wives' tale, says ADAM HELLIKER	THE NEW YEAR failed to bring forth any resolutions from David Cameron about forgiving his enemies.  He continues to rebuff conciliatory approaches from his former close friend Michael Gove, even though their wives have overcome their differences and are speaking again. Nearly three years after he called the EU referendum, Cameron continues to be in no mood to forgive what he saw as Gove's "two-faced treachery" over not supporting his Remain campaign. Gove's wife, Sarah Vine, has said Cameron was "shocked and hurt" when her husband decided he would back Brexit.
JAN15	May must stay strong and deliver on Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE Prime Minister is absolutely right to warn today that a failure to deliver Brexit will be a catastrophe for this country and destroy trust in politics.  Those Remainers who hope that defeat of the EU deal on Tuesday will bring about a second referendum to block Brexit should heed Mrs May's words. But the PM should also note the result of our poll, which shows that her deal as it stands - with its controversial backstop - is unacceptable to those polled, not just the vast majority of MPs. People in this country are prepared for no-deal and support it, despite the Remainers' Project Fear nonsense.

JAN16	Anna Soubry makes me want to throw things at the telly, says FERGUS KELLY	I might feel a compulsion to throw things at the TV whenever Anna Soubry appears on screen, but she is no more a Nazi than the Crystal Palace and Wales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JAN16	Lazy cop-outs sum up modern policing, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	TWO stories at the weekend provide an eloquent comment on the state of policing in this country. In the first, an 80-year-old dementia sufferer, Rita Taylor, was terrorised by a knifeman, who broke into her home and stole her handbag.  You might have thought that would have roused the indignation of every member of the force but the family was met with a mighty yawn when it pointed out that in the stolen bag was a dementia tracking device. The family was therefore able to watch as the bag travelled from London to Essex, stopping en route at a takeaway. In short it was obvious where the burglar was at any given time but the police did nothing.
JAN16	Brussels bullies must heed this vote and compromise- EXPRESS COMMENT	BRITAIN'S sovereign Parliament has spoken. And how it has spoken. The Government has lost on a scale that has not been seen since the 1920s. The thumping defeat for the Government - a majority against its deal of 230 - would in normal circumstances mark its end.  However, we do not live in normal times. It is the view of this newspaper that MPs should defeat the motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister Theresa May tabled by Jeremy Corbyn.
JAN16	We need to rebuild Britain through local communities, says GRAHAM DUXBURY	IT'S part of the Brexit narrative that one of the reasons for the referendum result was that many people felt their community was being overlooked and left behind, that their place was being hollowed out, left to decline, or worse becoming a dumping ground for social problems. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JAN16	It's time to get that wait off your mind, says VANESSA FELTZ	BRITONS are among the oldest parents in the world.  More forty-plus women are giving birth than teenagers and a new survey shows us merrily postponing marriage and children in favour of zooming around the world footloose and fancy-free. Those are the facts and your columnist is in the uncomfortable position of being thoroughly conflicted about them. I'm usually certain of my views. I'm roundly against, vociferously in favour, violently opposed or a passionate advocate.
JAN16	Don't open the door to a Labour Party land grab, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT IS not exactly the boldest prediction ever to suggest that when MPs vote tonight on the proposed Withdrawal Agreement, the issue isn't whether it will be defeated but by how much.

JAN19	Hold your nerve May and Australia will be OPEN for free trade, says ALEXANDER DOWNER	When the British people voted to leave the EU we Australians thought it was a pretty simple proposition.  As outside observers, we weren’t confused about what Brexit meant. We thought it meant leaving the political and economic structures of the EU. Surely, no-one on this planet thought leaving the EU meant leaving the political institutions - the European Council, the Parliament, the Commission, the Court of Justice and so on - but staying in the economic arrangements - like the customs union and the single market.
JAN19	Time is up for the stubborn Mrs May, says CAROLE MALONE	It's been a seismic week in politics and nothing much has become clear except one thing - Theresa May isn't fit to lead a Girl Guide troop let alone a country. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JAN19	Inside Politics: Will we have a hard or soft boiled Brexit?	WESTMINSTER is fast resembling the island of Lilliput from Jonathan Swift's brilliant political satire Gulliver's Travels as the Brexit confusion deepens this weekend.  In that 18th-century classic, the minuscule islanders are ferociously divided over whether a boiled egg should be broken at the big or little end. With Parliament's political parties splintering into factions squabbling over details of a baffling array of possible Brexit outcomes, some of the ideological differences look just as footling as the Lilliputian divide. An egg metaphor also seems appropriate for Theresa May's current dilemma as she ponders her next steps at her Chequers country residence this weekend. 
JAN19	May's futile one-knight stand, say RICHARD AND JUDY	RUDY: I'M beginning to wonder if Theresa May has the Black Knight scene from Monty Python And The Holy Grail on her screensaver.  You remember it. The fearsome Black Knight refuses to give way and surrender the bridge to King Arthur. Arthur chops the guy's arm off. Game over? Not a bit of it. "'Tis but a scratch!" the Black Knight sneers. "I've had worse!" Arthur cleaves the other arm off. "Just a flesh wound!" is the response. And so on until the Black Knight is chopped to pieces but still snarls impotent defiance.
JAN19	Damning verdict on our abused welfare system - EXPRESS COMMENT	JUDGE Angela Nield has delivered a damning verdict on our welfare system describing it as "cumbersome and too heavily reliant on claimants' honesty".  She warned that while the system is unique in the world it is too open to abuse. The judge was speaking at the end of a case in which 47-year-old benefits cheat Joanne Mole was found guilty of defrauding the taxpayer out of £73,000. She should have been forced to make amends as a deterrent to other would-be fraudsters.
JAN19	Corbyn betrays his party as well as the rest of UK, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IN 1940, at our nation's greatest peril, our greatest leader took the reins of power.  But it was not just Churchill who stepped forward. He was joined by the Labour Party leader Clement Attlee. It is a statement of the obvious to point out that the current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is no Attlee. 
JAN19	We must not risk closing Five Eyes, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	THERE are times in life when you get advice and the quandary then is: what to do about it. Accept or rebuff? This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JAN19	Corbyn's dismal legacy will go down in history - EXPRESS COMMENT	SOME people's names become so synonymous with an action that they are formally recognised in the dictionary.  The magnificent Delia Smith has given her name to a style of cooking while the 19th-century Irish land agent Captain Charles C Boycott's name came to mean a principled refusal to attend meetings. What will Corbyn come to mean after the latest act of iniquity by the Labour leader? Shameful or a person seeking destruction and disruption, or extremist, or enemy of the state? This is certainly the meaning we can draw from his refusal to engage in Brexit talks with Theresa May.
JAN19	There's no meat in this argument for going veggie, says ROSS CLARK	THERE was a time when science was about finding out the facts.  It was down to politicians, policymakers and the rest of us to decide what to do about them. But it is becoming increasingly hard to tell where science ends and environmental activism begins. Many people will have woken up yesterday morning to hear that "scientists" are telling us to cut drastically our intake of red meat, to no more than the equivalent of one sausage a week.
JAN19	Failed politicians scorn the people at their peril - EXPRESS COMMENT	ALMOST three-quarters of voters polled by ComRes for the Daily Express have lost confidence in MPs and Parliament, which comes as no surprise.  The poll in many ways serves only to confirm the growing feeling across this nation that our political classes have failed us. This is the result of a Remainer elite who make up the majority of Parliamentarians - both MPs and peers - who have worked tirelessly to ignore and overt urn the historic referendum vote to leave the EU. Too many MPs have poured scorn on the decent people of this country who had rejected their self-serving model for Britain to be run by a foreign power, suffer the results of mass immigration and see their hard-earned money sent abroad to Brussels.
JAN20	Our fate is in the hands of a bunch of mediocrities, fumes LEO McKINSTRY	THE BREXIT crisis is a unique moment in our history. Past rebellions have usually been conducted by the people against the elite. But today we are witnessing a revolt by the elite against the people.
Inebriated with their own self-importance, many MPs have decided they have the right to thwart Britain's withdrawal from the EU despite the clear outcome of the 2016 referendum.  Their stance is an undemocratic outrage, yet it is all too typical of a political class whose central hallmarks are epic incompetence and repeated disdain for the British public.
JAN20	Lifelong love affair battling the buffet on a cheap break, says MICHAEL BOOKER	As we all start thinking about fixing up our summer holidays, MICHAEL BOOKER can't wait for his favourite package deal  IT WAS the moment my inner skinflint saw the words "all-inclusive week-long holiday to the Costa Brava for £198 per person" that I knew I'd break my vow. It had been a solemn vow, one sworn to Mrs Booker after returning from our ill-fated family summer holiday to Majorca last year. The vow? Never to go all-inclusive again. It had been born out of the agony and exhaustion of last year's week-long "break" which had seen the seafood buffet night take silent but near deadly revenge on my wife and me - stealing two nights of Mediterranean luxury and replacing them with the fear that we'd never get out of the bathroom and see sunshine again.
JAN20	Age doesn't make drivers a menace, says ANNE DIAMOND	ACCIDENTS happen. It’s a miracle no one was seriously hurt and, of course, police will investigate the Duke of Edinburgh’s crash as they would any other.  Did either driver make a mistake, was the winter sunshine too dazzlingly low in the sky and ultimately blinding, as has been suggested? And, of course, serious debates have already begun about the fact that the Duke must indeed be one of the oldest drivers in Britain. He’s 97, for heaven’s sake!
JAN20	Whatever's happened to Night Manager Two? asks ADAM HELLIKER	THE LAVISH television production of The Night Manager was such a huge hit, attracting some 10 million viewers an episode and making a fortune for the BBC in overseas sales, that there was a natural presumption there would be a second series.  Indeed last year Elizabeth Debicki, one of the stars of the stylish adaptation of John le Carré's novel, dropped hints that filming was to commence this February.
JAN20	Another vote? One was plenty thanks, says NICK FERRARI	IT WAS a regrettably inevitable result of the cluster-shambles that was last week's botched bid to Brexit, but just as we are all left like bemused passengers clinging to the bus on a seemingly white-knuckle ride to nowhere, the most dangerous aspect of this nightmare appears to be gaining ground.  It is the insulting, supercilious nonsense that we should be forced to hold another referendum, or a "People's Vote" as some of the misguided campaigners choose to call it. By the way, who voted last time, cocker spaniels? Before you even deign to give this asinine tosh any semblance of consideration, remember this. 
JAN20	MPs will not get away with a Euro betrayal - EXPRESS COMMENT	STOPPING MPs' pay sounds like an excellent way to focus the minds of the political classes who have been far too intent on blocking Brexit to listen to the will of the people.  No wonder respondents to the ComRes poll backed stopping salaries by two-to-one, and eight in 10 of them did not feel that the politicians understand the views of ordinary people. Over the past week the country has been astounded at the ridiculous games being played in Parliament. It is clear from the poll that the only politician to come out with her dignity and respect intact is the Prime Minister, Theresa May.
JAN20	Blame Brussels for this mess... and walk away! says JOHN CAUDWELL	IT DIDN'T have to be this way.  Had the Brussels bullies not been set on punishing the UK for daring to exercise our democratic rights, and had Theresa May not drastically weakened her negotiating position in that disastrous election, it could all have been so different. A smooth, commerce-focused Brexit transition would have been possible, an outcome that remains in both parties' interests. Instead, after two years of negotiation, the Prime Minister's dreadful deal has been tossed on the garbage heap where it belongs.

It is the insulting, supercilious nonsense that we should be forced to hold another referendum, or a "People's Vote" as some of the misguided campaigners choose to call it. By the way, who voted last time, cocker spaniels? Before you even deign to give this asinine tosh any semblance of consideration, remember this. 
JAN22	MPs will not get away with a Euro betrayal - EXPRESS COMMENT	STOPPING MPs' pay sounds like an excellent way to focus the minds of the political classes who have been far too intent on blocking Brexit to listen to the will of the people.  No wonder respondents to the ComRes poll backed stopping salaries by two-to-one, and eight in 10 of them did not feel that the politicians understand the views of ordinary people. Over the past week the country has been astounded at the ridiculous games being played in Parliament. It is clear from the poll that the only politician to come out with her dignity and respect intact is the Prime Minister, Theresa May.
JAN22	Blame Brussels for this mess... and walk away! says JOHN CAUDWELL	IT DIDN'T have to be this way.  Had the Brussels bullies not been set on punishing the UK for daring to exercise our democratic rights, and had Theresa May not drastically weakened her negotiating position in that disastrous election, it could all have been so different. A smooth, commerce-focused Brexit transition would have been possible, an outcome that remains in both parties' interests. Instead, after two years of negotiation, the Prime Minister's dreadful deal has been tossed on the garbage heap where it belongs.
JAN22	Hold your nerve May and Australia will be OPEN for free trade, says ALEXANDER DOWNER	When the British people voted to leave the EU we Australians thought it was a pretty simple proposition.  As outside observers, we weren’t confused about what Brexit meant. We thought it meant leaving the political and economic structures of the EU. Surely, no-one on this planet thought leaving the EU meant leaving the political institutions - the European Council, the Parliament, the Commission, the Court of Justice and so on - but staying in the economic arrangements - like the customs union and the single market.
JAN22	Time is up for the stubborn Mrs May, says CAROLE MALONE	It's been a seismic week in politics and nothing much has become clear except one thing - Theresa May isn't fit to lead a Girl Guide troop let alone a country.

JAN22	Inside Politics: Will we have a hard or soft boiled Brexit?	WESTMINSTER is fast resembling the island of Lilliput from Jonathan Swift's brilliant political satire Gulliver's Travels as the Brexit confusion deepens this weekend.  In that 18th-century classic, the minuscule islanders are ferociously divided over whether a boiled egg should be broken at the big or little end. With Parliament's political parties splintering into factions squabbling over details of a baffling array of possible Brexit outcomes, some of the ideological differences look just as footling as the Lilliputian divide. An egg metaphor also seems appropriate for Theresa May's current dilemma as she ponders her next steps at her Chequers country residence this weekend.

FEB1	Why do MPs seek to betray the UK? asks FREDERICK FORSYTH	LOYALTY is a strange beast - much admired in theory but in practice it has responsibilities.  One of these is reciprocity. A general who expects loyalty from his men had damn well better give his loyalty to the ranks. In the armed forces this is known and accepted. But in politics?
FEB1	Don't let fake news blind us to benefits of statins - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE term wonder drug is sometimes overused but the latest evidence from Oxford University again shows us that it certainly applies to statins.  Yes, like other medications, there is always a risk of side effects. But this drug is literally a life-saver and the research by Professor Colin Baigent and others shows that wider use of statins could save thousands more lives, particularly among the elderly. It is estimated that a third of over-75s are on the medication but perhaps, on the back of this report, the NHS should consider increasing that number.
FEB1	We must tackle terrible epidemic of knife crime now, says ROSS CLARK	LET us hope that Sajid Javid's proposal to introduce Asbo-like powers for anyone aged over 12 who becomes involved in knife crime will be given at least a cautious welcome - or even just acknowledged as a serious attempt to tackle a grave problem that has brought misery to dozens of families.  But I fear the worst. The Home Secretary had hardly delivered his proposals - which would involve offenders being subjected to curfews and blocked from social media - than the usual voices were out trying to score political points. According to Diane Abbott: "The Tories have rushed out this measure late in the day because they are completely failing to tackle knife crime and serious violent crime of all types." She failed to suggest any solutions of her own.
FEB1	Ross Greer is a Green idiot just out to shock over Churchill, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	IS IT ignorance, stupidity, malice or an incredibly childish desire to shock that makes Ross Greer behave in the way he does? Mr Greer is the Green Party MSP who has called Sir Winston Churchill a "white supremacist mass murderer". It has since emerged that he previously asserted "Imperial Britain was happy to live with Hitler".  There was much else along these lines, such as wishing that Buckingham Palace would burn down and, pre the actual event, that Margaret Thatcher would die.
FEB1	We need action straight away to curb knife crime - EXPRESS COMMENT	KNIFE crime in this country is totally out of control.  It seems that scarcely a day passes without news of another young life cut tragically short, and so it has been in the case of Nedim Bilgin, a 17-year old north London boy who died when teenagers tried to steal his bike. One can only imagine the devastation of his family and all the other families who have lost their children in similar circumstances and so the news that the Home Secretary is granting new powers to the police to tackle this menace is very welcome. These powers include curfews, knife crime prevention orders and targeting retailers who sell blades to children, all of which are well thought out initiatives.

FEB1	Disturbing increase in career politicians damages us, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	THE most damaging aspect of the shenanigans surrounding Brexit has been the appalling estrangement of the people from their parliament. Most Brits are now utterly fed up with MPs, with their treachery and machinations and, above all, with their sheer incompetence and indiscipline.  The cry I hear most often is “where are the big beasts, the heavyweights, the history-makers, the born leaders? Why have we got this bunch of dunderheads?”
FEB1	Hysteria about a no deal is getting totally out of hand, says TIM NEWARK	NO-DEAL hysteria has reached yet another peak of nonsense this week with normally sensible food suppliers saying we face dire shortages if we don't fix a deal with the EU. Why on earth would we stop food – and medicine for that matter – coming across our borders into our country? This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

FEB3	Social media has connected us all but it has to be controlled, says MP	SOCIAL media has become a major, unavoidable part of everyday life.  Recent figures from Ofcom indicate that 70 percent of 12- to 15-year-olds have a profile on social media, while the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reported in 2015 that 95 percent of 15-year-olds in the UK used it before or after school. Social media clearly has some huge benefits. Yet if the reaction to this week's report from my committee, the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, has taught us anything, it's that there are growing concerns about its effects on our children.
FEB4	David Davis on Brexit: Theresa May's great achievement	THE size of what was achieved last week by Prime Minister Theresa May should not be underestimated. On January 15, the Government suffered the heaviest Parliamentary defeat in the democratic era after MPs rejected the proposed withdrawal agreement by a resounding majority of 230.  Last week, MPs backed a revised proposal by 317 votes to 301 to pass the Brexit deal provided the Irish backstop is removed. This was larger than the Government's House of Commons majority even with DUP support.
FEB8	We have a duty to honour legacy of Sir Robert Peel - EXPRESS COMMENT	WE SHOULD all take the Chief Constable of Bedfordshire Jon Boutcher seriously when he says that he and other senior officers are "not crying wolf" about the problems of police budgets.  It was Boutcher who shockingly revealed that his force "literally ran out of officers" after seven stabbings, the murder of a 16-year-old boy, four rapes and a prison riot in a single day. So while it is easy to dismiss public sector leaders for demanding more money for their services, we need to remember that good policing and the protection it provides affects us all. Britain is not a banana republic but the country that through the great Sir Robert Peel invented the concept of a modern police force.

FEB20	Staggering misjudgment by Begum and her lawyer - EXPRESS COMMENT	AS THE Shamima Begum case develops, it moves through the looking glass into a jaw-dropping world of moral distortion. This teenager - her attitude part recalcitrant, part vacant - is losing any sympathy she might have had as a self-styled "victim" with each utterance. She admits she knew of IS atrocities prior to leaving the UK. She has named her new-born son Jerah, the name of an infamous 7th-century warlord. She believes the atrocity in Manchester should be seen as retaliation for the multinational bombing of IS-held sites. This is a modal window.
FEB20	No soft option in the fight against terror, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	HORDES of barbarians. There is no other way to describe the terrible forces of Islamic State, who beheaded and crucified, raped and slaughtered thousands of innocent souls who happened to be in their path.  They tore down historic monuments, having as little respect for beauty or wonder as they did for man, woman and beast. The movement grew out of Al Qaeda which attacked the twin towers in America, killing nearly 3,000 people and injuring 6,000 others. Killers such as Jihadi John gloried in videos showing him cutting off the heads of aid workers with a knife. In more than 1,400 years since Islam began these terrorists have not progressed an inch in anything except technology.
FEB20	It would be mad if Tories joined the Magnificent Seven, EXPRESS COMMENT	LABOUR is in crisis - that is not in dispute. Sunk into a cesspit of its own making, in particular due to Jeremy Corbyn's total and repulsive failure to deal with antisemitism within his party's ranks, it is utterly unfit for government and we salute the seven MPs who made a stand against this horror.  But Tory MPs should not be tempted to join this new endeavour.
FEB21	Fanatical worship of Brussels is the real motive here, says LEO McKINSTRY	AMOOD of turmoil has gripped Westminster.  A major realignment in the British political landscape seems underway. The traditional two-party system between Labour and the Conservatives, which has prevailed for almost a century, now appears to be crumbling. Both the Prime Minister and the Labour leader, already beset by growing rebellions and dwindling authority, are now facing significant splits in their own ranks.
FEB23	Women, you must go to Westminster, says FRANCES SCOTT	IT MAY seem that with a female Prime Minister the UK has it cracked, but the corridors of power still lack female voices. In the House of Commons men outnumber women two to one, and in the Lords it's three to one.  Given it has been 100 years since women won the right to vote and stand, these ratios are shocking. To put it into harsher perspective, of the 5,000 MPs we've had since 1918, fewer than 500 have been women and at the last election only 12 extra women gained seats. At this rate it will take more than 50 years to get gender balance.
FEB25	Now is the time for Theresa May to hold her nerve says LEO McKINSTRY	ALMOST three years ago, the British people gave our rulers a clear mandate to deliver independence from Brussels.

FEB25	Shamima Begum: Rewrite our laws to punish treason, says Nick Ferrari	HER REACTION was surely the most telling thing. Loathsome jihadi bride Shamima Begum was "shocked" when she learned she was being stripped of her British citizenship and denied any right to return to the UK.  However, she cheerfully informed us a few days earlier that she was "ok" with IS victims being decapitated and "wasn't fazed" the first time she saw a severed head in a basket. Let's get this straight: she has no problem looking at the head of someone who has been executed in the most brutal fashion by a gang of barbaric, medieval terrorists. But a country exerting its right to bar the return of someone who opted to sneak abroad to support a jihadist organisation responsible for the murder of many knocks her for six.
FEB25	Campaigning groups fight to keep tax bills down for us all, says TIM NEWARK	IT'S a shocking fact that British taxpayers are handing over a higher proportion of their hard-earned money to the Government than at any time since Labour's Harold Wilson was in power.  That was the 1960s, a period of swingeing taxes that led Ray Davies of The Kinks to open his song Sunny Afternoon with the line "The taxman's taken all my dough". With a Marxist Labour Party keen on re-nationalising industries and bringing back sky-high taxes if they ever got into power, we could indeed be heading back to the 1960s and '70s - but without the fabulous music. It's good news, then, that the TaxPayers' Alliance (TPA), the campaigning group set up to battle for fairer taxes in this country, is celebrating its 15th anniversary next month. Without it chipping away at various taxes we could be paying even more.
FEB25	As a terror attack survivor, I think jihadi bride must be banished from UK, says GEOFF HO	In June 2017, Sunday Express City Editor GEOFF HO was caught up in the London Bridge massacre, which saw eight people murdered.

FEB25	Brexit: United Tories can beat Labour and win EU war - EXPRESS COMMENT	AS Labour implodes around Jeremy Corbyn, warring Tories can’t seem to stop picking at the frayed threads of Brexit.  While they should be banding together to complete Labour's downfall, they launch a series of civil wars every bit as pointless and obscure as they are unwinnable. The Prime Minister is going to Egypt in an effort to bang EU heads together for an improved deal for Britain. But back in Westminster, without even waiting to see what Mrs May brings home, splinter groups are already busy tearing her apart.
FEB26	We should cheer this push to teach good mental health, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT WOULD be easy to respond to the news that primary school pupils are going to be given mental health lessons with a weary sigh.  After all, the traditional British stiff upper lip response to mental health issues is that people just need to pull themselves together. So when Education Secretary Damian Hinds announced yesterday pupils will be taught from next year about "self care" and "mental wellbeing", some will doubtless have dismissed it as typical "snowflake" generation nonsense. But the sad truth is that things are different today and modern children have all sorts of pressures and stresses that those of us from an older generation - I am 54 - never had.

FEB28	How can an MP with an electronic tag not resign? Says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	SAY you were starting work in a new job. you look down and notice that your colleague is wearing an electronic tag, signalling that they had just been released from prison.  It would give you quite a jolt, would it not? Make you wonder about probity of the firm you'd joined, because if their other employees had just done time in the slammer, what does it say about them? And yet that, unbelievably, is the situation our Members of Parliament could find themselves in, because Fiona Onasanya, MP for Peterborough, has just been released from prison after serving a third of a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice. It is entirely possible she will be attending the Commons for next week's Brexit vote; could politics get any more debased than this?
FEB28	For the sake of decency, Jeremy Corbyn should go now says LEO McKINSTRY	WHEN Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015, he promised "a kinder, gentler politics".

Corbyn's front-bench is an unhinged personality cult, with a dangerous, deluded Marxist at its head.

And she knows that you don't need to hammer your point home. Subtlety can be an even more effective technique.
MAR1	Jeremy Corbyn is right about some (okay, two) things – I'm not joking	NOT long ago I would have thought that if I agreed with the witless Jeremy Corbyn it would be time for the knacker's yard. Yet within a fortnight he has come out with two points of argument I cannot dispute.
Take that unlovely creature Shamima Begum, sitting whining in a Syrian stockade.  Like it or not she is indisputably British.
MAR1	Link MPs' pay to charade over Brexit and cut it! - EXPRESS COMMENT	MANY people in this country will be astonished that MPs are to be given an inflation-busting pay rise of 2.7 percent to give them an eye-watering salary of almost £80,000.  The increase seems utterly unjustifiable, especially at a time when services are still being squeezed as we come out of austerity following the financial crash a decade ago. Meanwhile MPs' staff, who earn much less, are being told to make do with 1.5 percent. It is perhaps time for the pay and expenses of our politicians to be performance based. The charade over Brexit suggests that if their pay was performance related MPs might be looking at a significant pay cut instead of earning even more at the expense of the taxpayer.
MAR1	How can an MP with an electronic tag not resign? Says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	SAY you were starting work in a new job. you look down and notice that your colleague is wearing an electronic tag, signalling that they had just been released from prison.  It would give you quite a jolt, would it not? Make you wonder about probity of the firm you'd joined, because if their other employees had just done time in the slammer, what does it say about them? And yet that, unbelievably, is the situation our Members of Parliament could find themselves in, because Fiona Onasanya, MP for Peterborough, has just been released from prison after serving a third of a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice. It is entirely possible she will be attending the Commons for next week's Brexit vote; could politics get any more debased than this?
MAR1	For the sake of decency, Jeremy Corbyn should go now says LEO McKINSTRY	WHEN Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015, he promised "a kinder, gentler politics". But he has achieved the exact opposite. Under his toxic leadership, Labour has become the truly nasty party, gripped by a culture of bullying, tribalism, intolerance and racism. Corbyn's front-bench is an unhinged personality cult, with a dangerous, deluded Marxist at its head.  As his party goes into meltdown as a result of discord and accusations of anti-Semitism, his magic grandpa act no longer works.
MAR1	Error of judgement is not always a resignation matter, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	WHEN the moors murderers (Ian Brady and Myra Hindley) were apprehended they were working, as a clerk and a typist respectively, in a small company.  Brady had been there six years and Hindley four when they were arrested for the multiple murders of children. Their colleagues were shaken to the core that two people with whom they had worked, chatted and taken tea-breaks could be capable of torture and killing. Most of us have occasionally been deeply shocked when people we know behave out of their assumed character. It happens somewhere every day.
MAR1	The PM must now break free from the enemies of Brexit, demands TIM NEWARK	HAS our Parliament ever been so at odds with the people that vote for it than it has over Brexit? Yet again our Prime Minister has had to come before it offering all kinds of permutations to win their support when all the rest of the country wants is for them just to get on with it. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR1	We should cheer this push to teach good mental health, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT WOULD be easy to respond to the news that primary school pupils are going to be given mental health lessons with a weary sigh.  After all, the traditional British stiff upper lip response to mental health issues is that people just need to pull themselves together. So when Education Secretary Damian Hinds announced yesterday pupils will be taught from next year about "self care" and "mental wellbeing", some will doubtless have dismissed it as typical "snowflake" generation nonsense. But the sad truth is that things are different today and modern children have all sorts of pressures and stresses that those of us from an older generation - I am 54 - never had. 
MAR1	Oscars 2019: Bang a gong for worthy winners, says VANESSA FELTZ	THERE must have been something in the champers.  A liberal dose of common sense seems to have seeped into the 2019 Oscars. Instead of the usual, gongs distributed with monotonous predictability to films so chronically unwatchable you wonder if the judges could possibly have endured the same tedious tripe you shelled out for at your local fleapit, the prizes went to the right corkers.
MAR1	Now is the time for Theresa May to hold her nerve says LEO McKINSTRY	ALMOST three years ago, the British people gave our rulers a clear mandate to deliver independence from Brussels. All too predictably, the politicians have failed to act decisively on that instruction. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR2	Inside Politics: Brexit mood is brightening	AS IF the stars are aligning as a harbinger of good fortune, the political forces are shifting in Theresa May's favour in her quest for a Brexit deal.  Tory whips have put MPs on standby for a possible "meaningful vote" to approve the EU Withdrawal Agreement on Wednesday. Downing Street officials have been trying to dampen hopes that UK and EU negotiators are on the brink of finalising the extra legal guarantees Mrs May is seeking. Yet within Whitehall the mood is brightening. "We are not quite there but things are moving quickly," one source close to the negotiations told me yesterday. "We could be on for a very busy week next week." It is Jeremy Corbyn's shift to demand a second referendum that has changed the game in Parliament. The hard-Left leader caved in to Labour's anti-Brexit Remainers in an attempt to halt the defection of dozens more MPs from his party to the newly formed Independent Group of former Labour and Tory rebels. His tactical switch to limit a Labour split has handed the advantage to Mrs May. Tory Eurosceptics appear more open to supporting a revamped deal to meet the threat of the growing alliance in the Commons in favour of a national poll staged to thwart Brexit. Now as long as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, parachuted into negotiations in the final stages, can secure the full legal guarantees against permanent entrapment in an EU customs union demanded by Tory Brexiteers and the Democratic Unionist Party, Mrs May may be able to win the Commons majority that has proved so elusive.
MAR2	Don't wave a white flag, Stace, say Richard and Judy	I WONDERED how long it would take - the Stacey Dooley backlash.  Just a few weeks after lifting the coveted glitterball trophy on Strictly, the popular Luton shop assistant-turned award-winning investigative reporter turned all round celebrity is getting it in the neck for being a so-called "white saviourist".

MAR2	NHS bean counters must show more compassion - EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS hard not to feel huge sympathy for little Ollie and Amelia Carroll who suffer from the rare degenerative genetic condition Batten Disease and have had the treatment they need refused by NICE.  Eight-year-old Ollie won over many people's hearts including that of Prince Harry at the 2016 Wellchild child awards and it seems utterly incomprehensible that medication which could ease his condition and that of his five-year-old sister is being blocked by the NHS. We appreciate that NICE has some difficult decisions to make and has to consider value for money but really there has to be some humanity applied to decisions over drugs proven to work.
MAR2	Dithering MPs are the problem not solution to Brexit, says TIM NEWARK	At a time when MPs have never been more out of step with their voters, it really is the last straw to see them each awarded £2,000 more of taxpayers' money for achieving so very little.  In fact, they should get no pay increase at all until they resolve Brexit to our national benefit. To get an inflation-busting three per cent salary rise in a year when they have continuously dithered, fretted and frustrated the national will is beyond amusement. Especially when their hard-working staff have received half that amount.
MAR2	The Royal Family is our bedrock in an uncertain world, says STEPHEN POLLARD	ONE of the Queen's great strengths is that she knows the value of silence.

What should have been an inspirational moment of national liberation has been transformed by our politicians into a long-winded saga of frustration and despair. In place of determination, patriotism and vision, there has been only inertia, incompetence and cowardice.

MAR7	America can teach us a few lessons about life, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	SOME years ago I was having a chat with a friend who contrasted the United States' get-up-and-go mentality with our own tendency to hope someone else (usually the state) will sort any problems out.  "Say the local school needs new books," he said. "The town would get together and hold a barn dance to raise the money." This conversation came to mind earlier this week when it emerged that state schools in the UK want parents to do exactly that. They are being asked for hundreds of pounds to fund books and salaries; cue uproar.

MAR7	Politicians need to stop waffling and do something about knife crime, says LEO McKINSTRY	CONFRONTED by the recent surge in knife crime, Home Secretary Sajid Javid bleated yesterday that "serious violence is a disease, spreading through our communities, infecting our young people". That kind of waffle is a perfect illustration of why the state is failing so miserably to protect the public.  The portrayal of butchery as a kind of contagious illness reveals an official mindset that treats dangerous offenders as victims of society, devoid of responsibility for their actions and in need of support rather than punishment.

MAR7	Council services are total rubbish – What are they spending our money on? asks TIM NEWARK	NEXT month's council tax rises look set to be the steepest in years but we seem to be getting less and less for more and more.  Council tax bills will increase by an average of 4.5 percent across England, pushing bills in some regions up to £1,800. As my bill goes up, my bin bag seems to get smaller. This year I may as well buy myself a hi-vis yellow jacket - not for future protests, though that could be useful - but because I am visiting my local dump, I mean recycling centre, more frequently than I've ever done before because my council is removing less and less rubbish.
MAR7	Workers' rights are a bellwether for Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	THERESA May's commitment to give guarantees on workers' rights is an important and significant announcement.  First of all, it is the right thing to do and the mark of a civilised nation that the people who work hard and make a contribution to this great country should have their rights protected from exploitation. It is also a clear signal that outside the EU Britain will not abandon its core values and turn into a western form of Singapore with deregulation put ahead of everything else. That does not mean there is no room for deregulation to make us more competitive, but it is a question of picking and choosing.

But crisis is an exact description of the current state of recruitment to the Armed Forces. Twenty-five out of 30 infantry battalions are under-strength. Overall, the Army is 5,500 troops under its 82,500 minimum. Army chiefs talk of being unable to carry out basic tasks as there are not enough new recruits.  There are many causes of this crisis.
MAR7	Forget another poll, our freedom is in sight - EXPRESS COMMENT	FORMER prime ministers normally keep their counsel after leaving office.  Not so John Major and Tony Blair when it comes to Brexit. Yesterday it was the turn of Blair to push forward his convoluted agenda during an appearance on The Andrew Marr Show. After reminding viewers that he won three elections, Blair called for an extension to Article 50. He said the delay should be for as long as is needed for people "to make up their minds" about the impact of the Prime Minister's deal.

MAR8	House prices defy all the gloom and doom of Remainers, says ROSS CLARK	WHAT fun it is looking through the archives to read what the former chancellor George Osborne, and many others, said in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum in a desperate attempt to discourage a vote to leave the EU.

MAR8	America can teach us a few lessons about life, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	SOME years ago I was having a chat with a friend who contrasted the United States' get-up-and-go mentality with our own tendency to hope someone else (usually the state) will sort any problems out.  "Say the local school needs new books," he said. "The town would get together and hold a barn dance to raise the money." This conversation came to mind earlier this week when it emerged that state schools in the UK want parents to do exactly that. They are being asked for hundreds of pounds to fund books and salaries; cue uproar.

MAR8	Politicians need to stop waffling and do something about knife crime, says LEO McKINSTRY	CONFRONTED by the recent surge in knife crime, Home Secretary Sajid Javid bleated yesterday that "serious violence is a disease, spreading through our communities, infecting our young people". That kind of waffle is a perfect illustration of why the state is failing so miserably to protect the public.  The portrayal of butchery as a kind of contagious illness reveals an official mindset that treats dangerous offenders as victims of society, devoid of responsibility for their actions and in need of support rather than punishment. 
MAR8	Stacey Dooley is great – David Lammys of this world should keep quiet says ANN WIDDECOMBE	IF EVER there were much ado about nothing, it is over Stacey Dooley and "white saviourism". This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR8	Council services are total rubbish – What are they spending our money on? asks TIM NEWARK	NEXT month's council tax rises look set to be the steepest in years but we seem to be getting less and less for more and more.  Council tax bills will increase by an average of 4.5 percent across England, pushing bills in some regions up to £1,800. As my bill goes up, my bin bag seems to get smaller. This year I may as well buy myself a hi-vis yellow jacket - not for future protests, though that could be useful - but because I am visiting my local dump, I mean recycling centre, more frequently than I've ever done before because my council is removing less and less rubbish.
MAR8	Workers' rights are a bellwether for Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	THERESA May's commitment to give guarantees on workers' rights is an important and significant announcement.  First of all, it is the right thing to do and the mark of a civilised nation that the people who work hard and make a contribution to this great country should have their rights protected from exploitation. It is also a clear signal that outside the EU Britain will not abandon its core values and turn into a western form of Singapore with deregulation put ahead of everything else. That does not mean there is no room for deregulation to make us more competitive, but it is a question of picking and choosing.
MAR9	Inside Politics: Philip Hammond on brink of victory	THE timing could hardly be more awkward. When Philip Hammond rises to the Commons despatch box next Wednesday to deliver his Spring Statement on the economy, the outlook for the Government is likely to be more uncertain than ever.  Barring a miracle breakthrough in the Brexit talks this weekend, the Treasury set piece is scheduled to come a day after another crushing defeat for Theresa May's EU departure deal. Opposition MPs can be expected to study the Chancellor's lips closely for any hint of a smirk. Mr Hammond has been unenthusiastic about breaking links with Brussels ever since the 2016 EU referendum campaign.
MAR9	Here's how to slash knife crime, say Richard and Judy	“ACTION this day." Churchill's scrawled note at the bottom of many a wartime memo issued from Downing Street. Winston was a fiercely intelligent man with a superbly analytical mind.  He could see the complexities of most situations at a glance and never underestimated their intricacies. But he knew when a bold, decisive stroke was called for. Were he in office today, his response to the horrifying rise in knife crime would have been succinct. "Action this day." I'm weary of being told how multi-layered the issue is; how tangled a knot it is to unpick.
MAR9	Shoreham air tragedy families deserve more - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE Shoreham air crash was a terrible tragedy. Eleven people died on that horrific day - a peaceful town in Sussex was turned into a charnel house. Another 16 had their lives changed for ever.  It was a terrible event that will be seared into the spectators' eyes for the rest of their lives. What should have been a happy day out for families turned into a horror show, with repercussions that will continue for decades. Those who lost loved ones or who suffered terrible injuries will never be free of what happened that day.
MAR9	Mum jailed in Iran is pawn in £300m debt extortion plot, says STEPHEN POLLARD	ON APRIL 3, 2016, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in Tehran as she was about to board a flight to London. She has been held in prison in Iran ever since. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was born in Iran but is married to a Briton.  She lives in London, holds dual citizenship and has a daughter, Gabriella, who was with her on a visit to her parents. Gabriella has remained in Tehran since her mother's arrest. Her case has become a cause célèbre. A project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the Thomson Reuters news agency, she was convicted in September 2016 of spying and plotting to topple the Iranian government.

Nor is a clear direction likely to emerge this week from the fetid bog of Westminster, where posturing and prevarication triumph over the national interest and the will of the electorate.

MAR15	The EU is making an example of us and we are letting it, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	OURS is an immensely rich language with literally thousands of adjectives.  Two of them are "stupid" and "cowardly". Can they ever be used together? Oh yes.  When someone in high office refuses over and over again to admit a stark reality because it is a disagreeable one, that merits both epithets. And those words precisely describe the behaviour of Parliament as we grovel our way to defeat and national humiliation over Brexit.
MAR15	Parliament has shown contempt for the people - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE British people are bewildered and exhausted by the machinations of our parliamentarians.  Few understand why it has been so difficult for MPs to deliver on a simple instruction for Britain to leave the European Union and end Brussels rule once and for all. At the end of a terrible week for British democracy, MPs have succeeded in voting down a deal that would deliver Brexit, taking our main negotiating ploy off the table by rejecting no deal in all circumstances, and have capped it all by voting to delay the departure date. Many will rightly see this as a betrayal of the British people and the 17.4 million voters who backed leave in 2016.

MAR15	The scientists who made Britain great are an inspiration to us all, says TIM NEWARK	WE often forget that in many ways Britain invented the modern world.

MAR15	We should not be ashamed of showing our grief, says HEIDI TRAVIS	IT'S a familiar scenario. A friend or colleague experiences a bereavement - and we get tongue-tied.  But why do we find it so difficult to talk about death? While seven out of 10 people in the UK have suffered a bereavement in the past five years, the "D-word" remains one of our society's final taboos. There's a conspiracy of silence around an event we will all experience. It's a subject being taken up by Miriam Margolyes in a new BBC Two series, Miriam's Dead Good Adventure. The actress, 77, is to examine her own mortality, and to look at why Brits have an issue with talking about death openly.
MAR16	Comet disasters haunt Boeing, says RICHARD AND JUDY	I WAS born in 1956.As I grew up, a series of catastrophic air crashes that took place shortly before I was born entered the national consciousness. Two words became synonymous and indivisible. "Comet", and "disaster".  The de Havilland Comet was the world's first commercial jet airliner, designed, built and tested right here in the UK at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. When it took to the skies for its debut flight in 1952, it was the focus of huge national pride. Sleek, breathtakingly fast for its time and available at surprisingly modest fares to passengers weary of sitting in throbbing, vibrating, colossally noisy propeller aircraft, Comet was a modern, even futuristic, marvel; the Concorde of its day. But while Concorde chalked up 30 years' safe operation before the now infamous Paris crash in 2000, Comet was commercially airborne for just months before everything suddenly went calamitously wrong. Inside a single year, three of the shiny new planes went down with the loss of all passengers and crew.
MAR16	Arrogant MPs don't give a stuff about us, says CAROLE MALONE	WHAT did the British people do to deserve a bunch of arrogant, self-interested, selfaggrandising MPs who have a seething contempt for the electorate and who've made it clear they don't give a stuff what we think about Brexit or anything else.  Worse - what did we do to deserve an incompetent PM who makes the Grey Man John Major look like a powerhouse and whose hard, Remainer heart has never been in this fight for Brexit. Britain, not to mention democracy, has been betrayed by this lack lustre PM and her traitorous Parliament and this once great country is now a worldwide laughing stock. As ex-EU president Herman Von Rompuy said sneeringly: "We have their backs against the wall." And he's right - thanks to those mutinous Commons votes this week when, unbelievably NO Deal - our biggest bargaining tool - was taken off the table. And MPs voted to extend our departure date which could be up to two years and cost billions. And I'm sick of hearing from deluded media sycophants how gutsy Theresa May is for pushing her hopeless deal and clinging onto power. It's her manic "clinging on" and her refusal to change that has wrecked our political system and stopped Brexit from happening. But then why did we ever expect this vapid woman to get a good deal out of Brussels when from Day One she's done nothing but cow tow to them.
MAR16	New Zealand attack: We must stand strong together against hate - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE hearts of every decent person in this country will go out to our friends in New Zealand after the appalling atrocities that have accounted for 49 lives. The victims were not chosen randomly but because of their Islamic faith by an extremist who could think only of his twisted hate for them.  Worse still, the gunman live-streamed his murderous rampage in Christchurch on social media, sadly so often the natural home of those who wish to promote their evil ideologies and disgusting acts. The Daily Express shares the view of Home Secretary Sajid Javid who has said he was "sick to the stomach" when he woke up yesterday to learn the tragic news. Mr Javid rightly says that just like the Islamist extremists responsible for the attacks in Manchester and London in 2017, the far Right racists represent a danger to freedom and democracy.
MAR16	Brexit talks: Week when our Parliament went into meltdown	HOW many times have we heard that Parliament was going to "seize control of Brexit"? Grown-up, responsible MPs were supposed to take over from a chaotic, indecisive government and show what can be achieved when a spirit of cross-party cooperation triumphs over narrow, partisan interests.  Well, this was the week when Parliament finally did try to take control. And what is the result? Still more chaos. Disgracefully, with two weeks to go until our projected leaving date, we still have no idea how or when we will be leaving the European Union. If there is one moment which sums up the whole fiasco that the House of Commons has become, it was when Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay stood at the despatch box on Thursday evening to make the Government's case for extending Article 50 - and then took advantage of a free vote in order to vote against the very motion he had been proposing.
MAR16	Inside Politics: Is Brexit vote third time lucky for Theresa May?	THERESA May heads to Brussels next week to take what should have been her final walk along the red carpet into the EU Council's Europa Building, at least as a leader of one of the bloc's member states.  The spring gathering of the EU elite has long been seen as the Prime Minister's farewell appearance at the heart of the European federalist project. Instead, Parliament's momentous decision on Thursday to request a Brexit delay means she cannot quite know when she will no longer have to endure the claustrophobic atmosphere, garish colour scheme and brain-frazzling hours of haggling that visits to the egg-shaped modernist structure always deliver. It is a prospect that should leave even the stoical Mrs May, who battled her way through another gruelling parliamentary week with a throat infection, longing for a duvet day. 
MAR16	The EU is making an example of us and we are letting it, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	OURS is an immensely rich language with literally thousands of adjectives.  Two of them are "stupid" and "cowardly". Can they ever be used together? Oh yes.  When someone in high office refuses over and over again to admit a stark reality because it is a disagreeable one, that merits both epithets. And those words precisely describe the behaviour of Parliament as we grovel our way to defeat and national humiliation over Brexit.
MAR16	Parliament has shown contempt for the people - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE British people are bewildered and exhausted by the machinations of our parliamentarians.  Few understand why it has been so difficult for MPs to deliver on a simple instruction for Britain to leave the European Union and end Brussels rule once and for all. At the end of a terrible week for British democracy, MPs have succeeded in voting down a deal that would deliver Brexit, taking our main negotiating ploy off the table by rejecting no deal in all circumstances, and have capped it all by voting to delay the departure date. Many will rightly see this as a betrayal of the British people and the 17.4 million voters who backed leave in 2016.

The EU said it could proceed only if it knew what Parliament's consensus was and we got one which was the deal with amendments to the backstop, whereupon the EU refused to give us the legally binding amendments we sought. That is how they play games and will continue to do so, throughout any extension of our membership - long or short.

But it would be nothing compared with the far greater threat facing Britain: that Theresa May's Government falls and is replaced with a Jeremy Corbyn administration. This is a modal window.

MAR22	Dumbing down Radio 4 is wrecking the station	IS THERE, deep in the heart of the BBC, someone conspiring to bring Radio 4 down from within?  f so, they're doing a jolly good job of it because the stalwart that has constituted almost my entire radio intake since I was in my mid-teens, is going down the pan. An unnamed senior BBC figure has said: "The risk for Radio 4 is that it becomes Ia victim of a culture of contempt for older audiences. [BBC Director of Radio] James [Purnell] is a Blairite through and through and they never value the old."
MAR22	May talks tough hoping for a third time lucky - EXPRESS COMMENT	AS SHE delivered her speech announcing an extension to Article 50 to the end of June, there was a quiver in Theresa May's voice last night.  She seemed genuinely apologetic to the people of Britain, for the mess that we have witnessed in the last two years and she offered "great personal regret". She has acknowledged that we have had enough. But even as she spoke, she still came over as resolute - determined to get her withdrawal deal over the line, and utterly withering towards its opponents, who have stalled her deal.
MAR22	Tories must end this squabbling and deliver Brexit, demands LEO McKINSTRY	IT IS now more than 1,000 days since the British people voted to leave the European Union. But during this period our politicians have miserably failed to implement the result. In place of any determination to restore our national independence, there has only been prevarication and posturing.  As MPs play their procedural games, the prospect of Brexit recedes ever further into the distance, heaping humiliation on our country and destroying faith in democracy.
MAR22	Brexit: Theresa May's dud EU deal is the lesser of two evils	IF, FOLLOWING the Speaker's intervention, Theresa May does secure another vote on her deal the choice is clear: MPs either accept Mrs May's surrender document or we stay in the EU for another two years, prolonging the uncertainty and with no guarantee of any further concessions.  The EU said it could proceed only if it knew what Parliament's consensus was and we got one which was the deal with amendments to the backstop, whereupon the EU refused to give us the legally binding amendments we sought. That is how they play games and will continue to do so, throughout any extension of our membership - long or short. Meanwhile one of the clumsiest PMs in history has upset the very people she needs to win over by calling them unpatriotic.
MAR22	Postcode lottery casts shame on health service - EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS reasonable to expect the National Health Service to be national and not regional.  That means it is wrong that the quality of care and access to treatment should be different depending on where you live. After all, we all pay the same taxes for it, so we all deserve the same access to treatment. Therefore, the latest revelations on the scourge of the so-called postcode lottery is another sad reminder of a variable quality of care.
MAR22	Speaker John Bercow is part of the plot to stop Brexit in its tracks, says TIM NEWARK	COMMONS Speaker John Bercow is just another establishment figure seeking to frustrate Brexit as MPs launch their last-ditch efforts to betray our democratic vote to leave the EU. Yet again he interprets parliamentary convention to suit the interests of Remainers – and no doubt to the delight of his wife who notoriously displayed a “B*ll**ks to Brexit" sticker on her car.  Earlier in the year, allowing arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve's Brexit-meddling amendment, he was happy to say: “I am not in the business of invoking precedent, nor am I under any obligation to do so.”
MAR22	Brexit March: Behind scenes with Farage in BATTLE to reclaim democracy – EXPRESS COMMENT	The Brexit march did not get off to a smooth start. A derelict pub on a wind-blasted strip of steely Sunderland coastline was swiftly swamped by an armada of 400 media and marchers. A man who lived opposite peered nervously out of his front door - no one had told him that his house was the starting point for the 250-mile trek to London. This is a modal window.

MAR22	Bercow stoops low with this Brexit ambush - EXPRESS COMMENT	COULD John Bercow be the most treacherous Speaker ever?

This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR23	Inside Politics: Is this the new face of Labour?	LABOUR frontbenchers have begun to dream of power as Theresa May's Tories threaten to implode over Brexit.  This week's open warfare in the Cabinet, with Brexiteers and Remainers scrapping over whether the country should leave the EU without a deal or opt for a lengthy departure has raised questions over how long her Government can survive. From the point of view of Her Majesty's Opposition, a Tory leadership contest this year is a delectable prospect. Labour MPs expect the looming battle for the Conservative soul between Brexiteers and Remainers to rip their enemies apart. And with the governing party expected to become ever more ungovernable, they suspect that a general election cannot be far away.
MAR23	End this Brexit nonsense now and listen to people - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE results of the ComRes poll this newspaper is running today is a damning indictment of our Parliament and proof that Theresa May was right to appeal to the public this week over the heads of MPs.  In many ways it is no surprise that 78 per cent of people polled blame Parliament for the delay of Brexit while almost half just want it sorted and do not care how. The legacy of MPs in this Parliament is one of grotesque failure. Worse than that, it is also one of conceit, arrogance and a complete disregard for the people of this country and its democracy. 
MAR23	Cheer up everyone - British economy powers on despite Brexit, says TIM NEWARK	AS politicians continue to make a dog's dinner out of Brexit, our economy keeps powering on. Latest figures show a leap in consumer confidence and retail sales last month, while employment is at a record high.  The only thing that could mess this up is if the Bank of England cuts interest rates because it fears Brexit "chaos". The last time it did that was immediately after the 2016 vote when the pound tumbled and inflation rose. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's dire predictions of economic turmoil proved worthless. Again and again, our failing politicians give too much weight to imagined concerns and experts forecasting catastrophe, when in the real world ordinary Britons are still working hard, earning and spending money so the wheels of the economy keep on turning.
MAR23	Where is OUR Winston Churchill in this hour of the country's need, asks FREDERICK FORSYTH	A STUDY of history is never time wasted. This is because such a bewildering amount of history actually repeats itself.

If you are in any doubt about the piercing aptness of those words, then just study the events of last week. Regrettably on too many occasions over the past 1,000 plus days we have all had cause to question the integrity and purpose of those we elect to serve us. Time after time they have allowed personal ambition, party loyalty or sheer fury at being told to get Britain out of the European Union, to dictate their actions. However, much of their meddling can at least be seen to have been voted through by a majority of the same politicians.
MAR24	Brexit: Back May’s plan or it could be chaos ahead - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE last thing this country needs is more political uncertainty and an even longer delay to Brexit. The prospect of a general election should make us all worry, not least because it opens the door to a hard-Left government led by Jeremy Corbyn which will wreak havoc on the nation’s finances and security.  But if there is another poll then it will mean Brexit has to be delayed even further and Britain will be trapped under Brussels’ rule for maybe another two years.
MAR24	Corbyn, it's time to stop dithering and deliver Brexit, says BRANDON LEWIS	BREXIT has undoubtedly raised passionate debate on all sides of politics, not least in my own party, where people have long and strongly-held views on our relationship with the European Union.  But there is a difference between principled and strongly-held opinion and cynical political game playing. This week, Jeremy Corbyn has the chance, once again, to put party politics aside and do the right thing for the country. He has called for compromise and for MPs to reach out beyond party lines. Well now it's time for Corbyn to put his money where his mouth is.

The decision to force all car-makers selling cars in Europe to fit speed limiters may on the face of it seem like a sensible move but, below the surface, it reveals everything that is bad about the EU. The decision again comes with no real debate or accountability which is the way of the EU.

Labour MPs expect the looming battle for the Conservative soul between Brexiteers and Remainers to rip their enemies apart. And with the governing party expected to become ever more ungovernable, they suspect that a general election cannot be far away.
MAR27	End this Brexit nonsense now and listen to people - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE results of the ComRes poll this newspaper is running today is a damning indictment of our Parliament and proof that Theresa May was right to appeal to the public this week over the heads of MPs.  In many ways it is no surprise that 78 per cent of people polled blame Parliament for the delay of Brexit while almost half just want it sorted and do not care how. The legacy of MPs in this Parliament is one of grotesque failure. Worse than that, it is also one of conceit, arrogance and a complete disregard for the people of this country and its democracy. 
MAR28	BATTLE FOR BREXIT: Today should have been historic, but it’s shambolic, says LEO McKINSTRY	TODAY was meant to be the inspirational moment when the country finally embraced independence after decades of rule by the European Union.  Instead, thanks to the monstrous irresponsibility and self-indulgence of the political class, we remain trapped in limbo, with the chances of Brexit rapidly disappearing. The stalemate at Westminster represents an appalling betrayal of the British people. In the EU referendum of June 23, 2016 – 1009 day ago – after the biggest democratic exercise in our history, the electorate sent a simple instruction to our rulers. 
MAR28	PM has always put the good of the nation first - EXPRESS COMMENT	FUTURE generations of young people will study this tumultuous chapter of our nation's story and see in Theresa May a leader who has exemplified integrity, intelligence, courage and self-sacrifice in the face of adversity, desertion and challenge. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR28	Give the Duchess of Sussex a break, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	What is it about the Duchess of Sussex that seems to arouse so much general all-round nastiness? Forget her ghastly family and look to these shores. Every five minutes another piece of waspish innuendo emerges. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR28	History is repeating itself but what will the outcome be? asks DAVID ROBSON	A PRIME Minister hanging on by fingertips, a minority government pitifully at the mercy of unbiddable Ulster MPs, a House of Commons in a state of passion and confusion. After months of shambles, members must cast votes that may affect the welfare of the nation for decades. That is a fair and sober statement of what is at stake now.  Uncannily, it is also a pin-accurate summary of this very day – March 28 – in 1979 when Jim Callaghan's Labour government was defeated in Parliament, leading to the election of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister.
MAR28	Another reason to get out of European Union - EXPRESS COMMENT	Is there no limit to the invisible hand of control of the faceless bureaucrats who populate the European Union offices in Brussels?  The decision to force all car-makers selling cars in Europe to fit speed limiters may on the face of it seem like a sensible move but, below the surface, it reveals everything that is bad about the EU. The decision again comes with no real debate or accountability which is the way of the EU. So while this newspaper would not encourage anyone to break the law and agree that people need to drive sensibly, there are times when drivers need to drive above the speed limit.
MAR28	A bright future is on the cards in this glorious spring, says TIM NEWARK	What a wonderful country we live in as spring settles in! As other parts of the world are struck by genuine crises, we are a prosperous, peaceful nation.  This morning I was sitting outside sipping a coffee, for a moment enjoying the spring sun, until I made the mistake of reading the latest news. From the headlines you would think the UK was embroiled in a national calamity that threatens to impoverish us overnight and bring down the very fabric of our society.  Our politicians really need to wake up to the reality of life beyond Westminster.
MAR28	It’s time to make care homes more accountable - EXPRESS COMMENT	WE have all heard the tragic stories: an old person is abused in care and the relatives only find out by chance.  So it’s good news that victims of abuse could have their grievances heard properly – a contrast to the current situation where complaints go to the homes themselves or to partisan local authorities. 
MAR28	Let’s purge the bigotry from ALL our political parties, says STEPHEN POLLARD	HERE'S a shocking proposal: No mainstream party should have bigots as members. You think that's not shocking at all? You think that should be a given? Then I have news for you. Because both our two main parties allow bigots to remain as members – even when their bigotry has been exposed and reported.
Take Labour.  After more than three years of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the party's wilful refusal to take action against its Jew-hating members has been so blatant that last month it forced one of its Jewish MPs, Luciana Berger, to leave.
MAR28	Plotting to force Theresa May from No 10 will never help rescue Brexit, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE coup against Brexit is unfolding just as the Remainers planned. Democracy is being subverted before our eyes. This coming Friday should be the moment when Britain begins the journey back to independence after decades of subjugation to Brussels. Instead, our departure has been lost in a fog of prevarication and paralysis. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR28	Politics: Can't we order the Speaker to shut it, asks NICK FERRARI	IT MIGHT not be one of his best known quotes, and it's not on the same par as the one about fighting them on the beaches, but that venerable sage Winston Churchill got it spot on when he declared: "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others."  If you are in any doubt about the piercing aptness of those words, then just study the events of last week. Regrettably on too many occasions over the past 1,000 plus days we have all had cause to question the integrity and purpose of those we elect to serve us. Time after time they have allowed personal ambition, party loyalty or sheer fury at being told to get Britain out of the European Union, to dictate their actions. However, much of their meddling can at least be seen to have been voted through by a majority of the same politicians.
MAR29	Have the Dirty Seven played dirty tricks? asks FREDERICK FORSYTH	ABSOLUTELY nothing would give me greater joy this bright spring morning, 29th of March, year of grace 2019, than to assure you that at 11pm today we shall withdraw from membership of the European Union. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR29	This Brexit betrayal and humiliation must stop - EXPRESS COMMENT	TODAY is truly the darkest hour for British politics since King Charles I marched into Parliament with armed soldiers in 1642 to arrest four MPs. Of course, King Charles's attack on democracy led to years of civil war and ultimately him losing his head, although if the Queen did it today quite a few people might welcome her intervention. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR29	This could be the beginning of the end for Brussels, says ROSS CLARK	WHEN I heard yesterday the story of a woman who apparently can't feel pain, I did briefly think of Theresa May.  Few of us could have endured a fraction of the punishment she has suffered in her three years as Prime Minister without cracking up. And yet, after each Commons defeat, she has still managed to bounce up to the despatch box. Her announcement that she will step down if her deal is passed was not quite a resignation - it didn't quite rule out the possibility that she will seek a longer extension to Article 50 and plough on for months more.

MAR30	The people have spoken: we must get on with Brexit	In the 2016 referendum there were two options that were never on the table: the status quo, and perfection. The EU is changing, and if we had voted to remain we would need to change with it.  But leaving the EU was never, on its own, going to address the concerns, anger, or frustrations of the millions who voted Leave. Politicians from all parties need to recognise this and stop promising either “no change” or “perfection”. What is increasingly clear is that our constituents are ahead of us on this. Support for the deal struck between the UK government and the EU has been increasing. 
MAR30	Brexit: Time for our MPs to leave Wonderland - EXPRESS COMMENT	NOT long after she dropped down a rabbit's hole and ended up in Wonderland, Alice met the Cheshire Cat, who gave her a piece of advice: "If you don't know where you want to go, it doesn't matter which path you take," he said.  We have long since passed the point where the bizarre Palace in Westminster has become an Alice in Wonderland Parliament locked in its own reality completely detached from that of Britain outside. But the words of the Cheshire Cat sadly reflect the impasse in which our MPs have left this country. They seem unable to decide what they want to do apart from that they don't want to do anything.
MAR30	Donald Trump investigation is fake news that has foxed the world, says Nick FERRARI	IT WAS meant to be Watergate Part Two. Instead it turned into a washout. After 40 full-time FBI staff spent two years and $30million, with enough subpoenas, arrests and searches to fill a score of Hollywood movies, the outcome was plain: Donald Trump is in the clear.  There was no collusion with Russia in the 2016 election. How the liberal elite hoped against hope that the Mueller Report, headed by special counsel Robert Mueller, would discover the smoking gun that would point to the door of the Oval Office. Their desire was fuelled by one desperately simple motive: to show they weren't as hopelessly out of touch with what real Americans were thinking as the election of Trump seemed to demonstrate.
MAR30	I had feelings of dread about 9/11, say Richard and Judy	RBRNNNGG! It is my boss at the Daily Express. "Freddie Forsyth has written an amazing piece about seeing Nelson's ghost," she tells me.  "We're asking all our other columnists for their personal ghost stories.Three hundred words, please."
MAR30	Joy that turned to anger over big Brexit betrayal, EXPRESS COMMENT	MANY thousands of people filled Parliament Square this week. They wanted to be there to celebrate Britain's freedom from the EU but instead they had to express their anger at the failure of this country's political class to enact their wishes. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR30	Inside Politics: Feuds will dog leadership race	LIKE Mafia bosses in a gangland feud, the heads of the warring Tory factions are preparing for the day when all family business can be settled. Theresa May's announcement this week of her plan for an early departure from Downing Street has started the race to find her successor.  Already, anticipation of that contest has intensified the thirst for vengeance. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker summed up the current angry mood among Tory MPs in an extraordinary speech to his Eurosceptic colleagues in the European Research Group shortly after the Prime Minister confirmed her resignation plans on Wednesday evening. "I am consumed with furious rage," he said, adding: "I could tear down this place and bulldoze it into the river."
MAR30	Let the grassroots Conservatives pick their next leader, says TIM NEWARK	WE LIVE in a great country and the next leader of the Conservative party must embrace our best traits of courage, ingenuity and independence. He or she must be proud of our nation because patriotism and optimism wins over voters whatever their social background.  The 2016 referendum freed us from old party loyalties and the majority of voters chose a positive vision of a free and dynamic nation. They shrugged off the anxiety of Project Fear better than any nervous ninny politician. What a wonderful moment for a victorious leader of the Leave campaign to carry on that momentum and unite a clear majority of Britons behind them, whether they had voted Labour, Tory or Ukip.

MAR31	Dangerous message on tackling knife crime - EXPRESS COMMENT	THIS has been a bloody year so far on the streets of Britain.

This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAR31	A general election could be the death of the Tory party, says LEO McKINSTRY	BITTERLY divided and gripped by panic, the Tories are now staring into the abyss. Their continuing failure to deliver any kind of Brexit has turned a political crisis into a national catastrophe. It is a disaster of their own making, driven by ineptitude and poor judgment.  The Government's negotiating strategy with the EU was far too defensive, reflecting the establishment's view that the Brexit process was a damage-limitation exercise rather than a journey towards national freedom.
MAR31	We failed to treat vote as opportunity to be embraced, says PRITI PATEL	THIS weekend should have gone down in history.

APR3	A general election could be the death of the Tory party, says LEO McKINSTRY	BITTERLY divided and gripped by panic, the Tories are now staring into the abyss. Their continuing failure to deliver any kind of Brexit has turned a political crisis into a national catastrophe. It is a disaster of their own making, driven by ineptitude and poor judgment.  The Government's negotiating strategy with the EU was far too defensive, reflecting the establishment's view that the Brexit process was a damage-limitation exercise rather than a journey towards national freedom.
APR3	We failed to treat vote as opportunity to be embraced, says PRITI PATEL	THIS weekend should have gone down in history. Friday, March 29, 2019 was supposed to be the date that we finally left the clutches of the European Union and pursued a bright future as a self-governing nation. This is a modal window.

APR3	The people have spoken: we must get on with Brexit	In the 2016 referendum there were two options that were never on the table: the status quo, and perfection. The EU is changing, and if we had voted to remain we would need to change with it.  But leaving the EU was never, on its own, going to address the concerns, anger, or frustrations of the millions who voted Leave. Politicians from all parties need to recognise this and stop promising either “no change” or “perfection”. What is increasingly clear is that our constituents are ahead of us on this. Support for the deal struck between the UK government and the EU has been increasing. 
APR3	Brexit: Time for our MPs to leave Wonderland - EXPRESS COMMENT	NOT long after she dropped down a rabbit's hole and ended up in Wonderland, Alice met the Cheshire Cat, who gave her a piece of advice: "If you don't know where you want to go, it doesn't matter which path you take," he said.  We have long since passed the point where the bizarre Palace in Westminster has become an Alice in Wonderland Parliament locked in its own reality completely detached from that of Britain outside. But the words of the Cheshire Cat sadly reflect the impasse in which our MPs have left this country. They seem unable to decide what they want to do apart from that they don't want to do anything.

APR6	Tories must elect a new leader soon or Corbyn will triumph, says TIM NEWARK	THE Newport West byelection results show that the 2017 Corbyn bounce is over and Ukip is gaining ground after its election wipeout. The message is clear for the Tories, that if they can get their act together quickly over Brexit they have everything to gain at the ballot box and we can avoid a Marxist government.  To be honest, I'm amazed anyone can be bothered to walk to a polling booth these days, as the endless wrangling over Brexit has cast serious doubts that Parliament will honour the result of the biggest exercise in democracy of recent years. The number of people voting in the South Wales poll was down nearly half to 37 per cent. Unsurprisingly, all candidates faced voter fatigue when they knocked on doors. "Never seen such anger and frustration," said the Tory candidate. "People just want clarity and I've seen no appetite for another referendum or general election." Politicians are under the illusion we can't wait to cast yet another vote, but the reality is we pay them handsomely to run the country and don't want to keep being asked our opinion. We've already told you, now get on with it. Drilling down into past election figures for this constituency reveals an interesting shift in support for the main parties, which could well be reflected across the country and it's not good news for Jeremy Corbyn.
APR6	We applaud Chancellor Philip Hammond's upbeat take on economy, EXPRESS COMMENT	AMID all the doom and gloom being pumped out from Remainers in Parliament it is wonderful to hear today from Chancellor Philip Hammond about how great this country is and how well prepared it is for Brexit.  Mr Hammond and the Treasury have been criticised over warnings they made about a No-deal Brexit, not least by this newspaper, but today we congratulate his optimistic assessment about the great shape this country is in as it prepares to quit the EU. Mr Hammond and the Conservatives should be recognised for fixing the economy, broken more than a decade ago by the selfishness of the big banks and the policies of the Labour Party. It means, as the Chancellor notes, he will be able to continue to cut taxes and provide more support for the hardworking strivers and carers who make this country great. As we look out on the rest of Europe, we see that despite Project Fear propaganda from Remainers, Britain is flourishing, with Brexit on the horizon offering an even greater future. We have the best employment rates, the lowest unemployment, the highest growth and the biggest investment from overseas. Despite the anguish over our politics, our streets are not being torn apart by rioters in yellow vests as is happening in Paris. There is much to look forward to and we should have confidence in our country.

APR6	How did we end up in this Brexit mess? Two words – Theresa May, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	It is hard, nay impossible, to deny we are witnessing the last days of the worst premiership in living memory, perhaps for centuries. some public sources, perhaps impelled by misplaced gallantry, are lavishing pity upon Theresa May. Sadly this is wholly misplaced. In a world of gender-equality, a Prime Minister is still a Prime Minister and this one has been an unmitigated disaster. There was no reason why this had to be.

APR8	It's time we all heeded the dire warnings over care crisis, EXPRESS COMMENT	A REAL issue with Brexit is that it is eclipsing other pressing matters. Take the care crisis.  This is one of the most crucial problems facing the country and despite our ageing population, it is gravely neglected. As we report today, many among us are not saving for our futures and still think the state will provide - although we won't necessarily be eligible for local authority support. Indeed, only 14 per cent of us have made provision for the time when we can't look after ourselves. It's a looming disaster for ordinary families and older people's needs could consume the NHS. So it's vital we all become more prepared. Sadly, the Government hasn't covered itself in glory. The Department for Health and Social Care has delayed its long-overdue Social Care Green Paper six times, fiddling while Rome burns. So let's demand the changes we want: mandatory CCTV safety monitoring in care homes, an NHS Dementia Fund, greater funding - and also all start playing our own part by planning for the future.

APR8	A soft Brexit will prove the hardest lesson for Tories, says LEO McKINSTRY	The Tory Government’s Brexit strategy is in tatters.

Theresa May has often spoken of the need for an “orderly” Brexit but nothing could be more disorderly than the decision to hold eleventh hour talks with Labour.
APR8	Teachers can't stop knife crime, says NICK FERRARI	IT'S IMPOSSIBLE to overstate the level of lawlessness and violent crime that is plaguing this country right now.  The number of people who have been fatally shot and stabbed this year has already outstripped the figure we were at last year, and hospital A&E units across the land are treating, on average, at least 21 young patients a day for knife or gun wounds and other serious assaults. Last weekend, the rate of stabbings nationwide was at an unprecedented level. Just as in the world of policing there's an old adage, "When in doubt, form a squad", so the rule runs in government, "When in a crisis, call a summit or appoint a Tsar". And so the drearily predictable "youth violence crime summit" went ahead at the start of last week, with the boast that it would hear the views of "more than 100 experts". What, precisely, does that mean? What makes you an expert in "youth violence"? Being an NHS surgeon who's battled to save countless youngsters as their lives have ebbed away in front of your eyes, or perhaps being a police officer who's received a dressing down for stopping too many suspects of the wrong colour?
APR8	Generous aid shows we're a global player	HOW refreshing to hear from a politician who actually celebrates this country's achievements, embraces Brexit as an opportunity - not a problem to be solved - and recognises that we are a global nation making an important contribution to the world.

It also underlines the lie at the heart of the Remainer misrepresentation of this country - that Brexit has turned us into an inward-looking nation, withdrawing from the world. Look at our extraordinary generosity as a country to the devastated victims of the flooding in East Africa. The British public alone out of their own pockets have provided more than three times the amount of aid that the rest of the EU put together has given, and well done to our readers who have made a major contribution themselves to easing this tragedy.

APR14	Sorry about the blip... I'm still a Brexiteer	BLAME Charlie Sheen. And you can't help but think those words have been said more than once before! Last week, my utter frustration with those who seek to thwart Brexit boiled over and I came perilously close to giving up for good.    During the first hour of my breakfast radio phone-in show, I suddenly lost all patience with the whole clustershambles that is Brexit and said I simply didn't care. The towel was in my hands… but I didn't throw it in. If it puts an end to the whole sorry saga, I added, let's just stay in - adding the important caveat that it would mean we could then get on with tackling vital issues in this country that seem to be in desperate need of attention, such as spiralling knife crime and youth violence, the demise of parts of the NHS and our education system. The sham that will be next month's European elections will cost you, me and other taxpayers £109million. Allowing for the fact that pretty much the minute those MEPs are actually selected they break for the summer recess, the harsh reality is they will probably only be at work for about six or seven weeks prior to the latest October 31 deadline being met, and come home for good. It just seemed to me there are so many better ways to spend those millions than on that farce.
APR14	Majority will prevail over the defeatists, EXPRESS COMMENT	WITH no apologies for misquoting the great American author Mark Twain, this newspaper would like to make it clear that reports of Brexit's death have been greatly exaggerated.  We would go as far as saying that suggesting Brexit is dead is a case of wishful thinking from those who would rather our break from Europe does not happen. There has been an obvious reluctance in the Remainer dominated Parliament and in the civil service in Whitehall to see through the wishes of the people and grasp the new prosperity on offer to this country. And it is true to say that things look bleak at the moment. Along with an anti-Brexit Speaker, we have Remainers frustrating proceedings in Parliament and being dead set on hindering talks with the European Union. They are working hand-in-hand with an EU bureaucracy that has always wanted to crush the bid for freedom from a nation state.
APR14	The arrogant elite stuck two fingers up at the people, says NIGEL FARAGE	THIS is not a bad dream, I'm afraid. It is a pitiful reality. On May 23, Britain will once again be asked to go to the polls to return 73 MEPs to the European Parliament in Brussels.  After 25 years of campaigning to get the UK out of the EU, I am the last person who wanted our country to be in this position. Frankly, I think it is an unforgivable state of affairs. But the refusal of the political class in Westminster to honour the referendum result of 2016 means that this unwanted election is upon us. We must make the best of it. Having said all of that, I wouldn't want anybody to think I am despondent. Far from it. And none of the 17.4 million men and women who voted for Brexit should be either. Before us all is a brilliant opportunity to bring about a revolution in Britain's political system. To that end, I want to emphasise with every fibre of my being how important it is that as many people as possible turn out next month and vote for The Brexit Party. I know that many reading this will be sceptical, thinking their vote won't make a difference.

APR15	Deluded Brexit ‘purists’ are killing off their dream of leaving the EU, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE DREAM of British independence is fading. Due to bungling by our political class, the quest for national liberation has been turned into a nightmare of procrastination and paralysis.    Last week, the Brexit saga plumbed new depths of humiliation, as Theresa May was forced not only to beg the EU for a further delay in our departure but also to plead for support from the Labour Party in a desperate attempt to break the current stalemate.
APR15	Sorry about the blip... I'm still a Brexiteer	BLAME Charlie Sheen. And you can't help but think those words have been said more than once before! Last week, my utter frustration with those who seek to thwart Brexit boiled over and I came perilously close to giving up for good.    During the first hour of my breakfast radio phone-in show, I suddenly lost all patience with the whole clustershambles that is Brexit and said I simply didn't care. The towel was in my hands… but I didn't throw it in. If it puts an end to the whole sorry saga, I added, let's just stay in - adding the important caveat that it would mean we could then get on with tackling vital issues in this country that seem to be in desperate need of attention, such as spiralling knife crime and youth violence, the demise of parts of the NHS and our education system. The sham that will be next month's European elections will cost you, me and other taxpayers £109million. Allowing for the fact that pretty much the minute those MEPs are actually selected they break for the summer recess, the harsh reality is they will probably only be at work for about six or seven weeks prior to the latest October 31 deadline being met, and come home for good. It just seemed to me there are so many better ways to spend those millions than on that farce.
APR15	Majority will prevail over the defeatists, EXPRESS COMMENT	WITH no apologies for misquoting the great American author Mark Twain, this newspaper would like to make it clear that reports of Brexit's death have been greatly exaggerated.  We would go as far as saying that suggesting Brexit is dead is a case of wishful thinking from those who would rather our break from Europe does not happen. There has been an obvious reluctance in the Remainer dominated Parliament and in the civil service in Whitehall to see through the wishes of the people and grasp the new prosperity on offer to this country. And it is true to say that things look bleak at the moment. Along with an anti-Brexit Speaker, we have Remainers frustrating proceedings in Parliament and being dead set on hindering talks with the European Union. They are working hand-in-hand with an EU bureaucracy that has always wanted to crush the bid for freedom from a nation state.
APR15	The arrogant elite stuck two fingers up at the people, says NIGEL FARAGE	THIS is not a bad dream, I'm afraid. It is a pitiful reality. On May 23, Britain will once again be asked to go to the polls to return 73 MEPs to the European Parliament in Brussels.  After 25 years of campaigning to get the UK out of the EU, I am the last person who wanted our country to be in this position. Frankly, I think it is an unforgivable state of affairs. But the refusal of the political class in Westminster to honour the referendum result of 2016 means that this unwanted election is upon us. We must make the best of it. Having said all of that, I wouldn't want anybody to think I am despondent. Far from it. And none of the 17.4 million men and women who voted for Brexit should be either. Before us all is a brilliant opportunity to bring about a revolution in Britain's political system. To that end, I want to emphasise with every fibre of my being how important it is that as many people as possible turn out next month and vote for The Brexit Party. I know that many reading this will be sceptical, thinking their vote won't make a difference.

Now it emerges that Amazon has been adopting Big Brother tactics of its own by eavesdropping on homes up and down Britain via its digital personal assistant product Alexa. And it is not alone. Apple and Google are also said to be listening in on their customers via their Siri and Google Home products.

APR15	Meghan, Royal life is no free ride, says CAROLE MALONE	I’ve never queued up to see a royal do anything in my life. But there are millions who do and get huge joy out of it because it makes them feel close and connected to a family they care about.  Then along comes Meghan Markle – dragging Harry behind her – and slaps those good people in the face.
APR17	The knife crisis will still be here after Easter – EXPRESS COMMENT	THE Government's cash injection of £51million to help the police tackle the added risk of knife crime over the Easter holiday is an investment in lives. Anything that helps the police regain control of our streets and wrest them away from the gangs and thugs who have blighted and ended so many lives in recent months has to be welcomed.    But while the Easter bank holiday weekend is a particular risk because of school closures, all-day drinking and the good weather, we have to remember that this problem is not just limited to a few days in April.
APR17	Booming economy is something to celebrate – Brexit will make it better, says LEO McKINSTRY	IT WAS not meant to be like this. Before the 2016 EU referendum, an army of politicians and experts told us a vote for Brexit would be a disaster for the British economy. According to this doom-laden narrative, unemployment would rocket, the country would slide into recession and the property market would collapse.  So far all those predictions of catastrophe have proved baseless. Contrary to the hysterical propaganda of Project Fear, the economy has proven astonishingly resilient.
APR17	Notre Dame: A part of all of us died in the fire	YOUNG architect Christopher Wren was picking his way through the ruins of Old St Paul's Cathedral after it had been destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666 when he came across a stone from the original building etched with the Latin word "Resurgam" - "I shall rise again".

APR17	Heartless evictions shame our care homes – EXPRESS COMMENT	ONE of the ways we judge a society is how it treats vulnerable elderly people, so the revelation that some care homes are using so-called "revenge evictions" to move some of their elderly residents is truly shocking. We should remember that the reason most older people go to a care home is that they need round-the-clock care and attention and are unable to look after themselves.  The idea that a care home which has taken a dislike to one of its residents, or finds them difficult, can then just turf them out with a mere 28 days notice is appalling.
APR17	We must not hold youthful midemeanours against people, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	Shila Iqbal, an actress in Emmerdale has been fired because six years ago, while a teenage student, she used the "N-word" in a tweet.

The quotes go back to 2012 when she was 16 and, when asked which book everyone should read, replied: "the Koran, because then there would be an Islamic takeover". 
APR17	Statins: It's worth sticking to the script - EXPRESS COMMENT	STATINS have now been with us long enough to do long-term studies of their effects - and it's a measured thumbs-up.

APR22	We must rally to help the people of Sri Lanka – EXPRESS COMMENT	THE news coming out from the beautiful island of Sri Lanka is terrible and terrifying. Hundreds dead, many hundreds more injured, in attacks on Christians and Westerners in the holiest week of the Christian calendar. The scale of the barbarity is almost unimaginable, the wickedness almost too horrible to contemplate. And yet contemplate it we must, because this is a ghastly reminder that this type of terror attack can strike out of nowhere anywhere in the world.    We might be beating back the evil of the Islamic State in Syria, but many of those highly dangerous and radicalised men and women are prepared to bring their murderous intent elsewhere.

APR22	This Easter, think how we can all help the children, says ROB WICKHAM	THE SUN is just rising, and you are sitting in the park with a few friends. You are all tired, but then you notice an angry group of young men coming towards you with knives and clubs.    They are up for a fight. Their target is your best friend. You have been friends for years, and you want to protect him. The altercation begins. There is shouting, jaunting, jibing, and they begin to aggressively and angrily grab your friend. Anger boils up inside you. You must save him. You must act now. You draw your knife and you thrash out in anger. You then see someone's ear, now cut off, fly through the air, with a young man screaming in pain, hands clasped over the side of his face, doubling over on his knees.You have inflicted this pain.

APR22	Idiots are insulted by an actual compliment, says CAROLE MALONE	WHEN I see the words "cultural appropriation", they're usually attached to a news story that I know is going to make me want to rip my eyeballs out.    And so it was this week when Gordon Ramsay was accused of this 21st-century, politically incorrect crime because he'd dared to open a pan-Asian restaurant that hasn't got any Asian chefs. He was slaughtered by one particular female critic who whined that at the launch of Lucky Cat she was the only Asian person in a room full of 30-40 journos. She also made a snide comment about head chef Ben Orwood's missus, referring to her as "the token Asian wife". I'm sorry, but Gordon Ramsay has earned the right to open whatever kind of restaurant he likes and employ whoever he likes.

APR29	Jeremy Corbyn’s stand on Donald Trump’s visit is shameful hypocrisy, says LEO McKINSTRY	A NATIONAL catastrophe now looms on the horizon. As the broken, divided Tories face electoral meltdown, Jeremy Corbyn's chances of becoming prime minister continue to grow. It is a terrifying prospect. After almost four years as Labour Leader, this quasi-revolutionary Marxist remains unfit for the highest office.    His toxic ideology, serial incompetence, lack of judgment, and contempt for our country's security all leave him badly unqualified for the role.
APR29	Our cowardly MPs are paralysed by a 16-year-old's pigtails, says NICK FERRARI	QUESTION: who do you suppose is in ultimate charge of who does and, just as importantly, who doesn't, get to address our Parliament and our politicians?    Last week saw the unedifying spectacle of a gaggle of desperate MPs queuing up to be berated by that Princess of the eco-activists, teenage Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. Such is this 16-year-old's meteoric rise that, since she started the "school strikes" movement last year, she has had a private audience with the Pope, then got to lecture the Italian senate on its lack of action over climate change and also addressed the World Economic Forum at Davos. As there is now talk that she will address the UN, it's drearily predictable that her fan club includes the likes of Barack Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio. With such a "right on" following, it was to be expected that our politicians would be prepared to crawl over broken glass to get "an audience" with this modern-day Joan of Arc. But the lengths to which they prostrated themselves was gutwrenching in misplaced reverence. 
APR29	Councillors are not to blame for EU betrayal, EXPRESS COMMENT	THE CRISIS facing the Conservative Party is entirely of the leadership's own making.    The failure to deliver on its promises over Brexit and to leave the EU - despite Theresa May promising more than 100 times that we would be out on March 29 - has rightly been seen as one of the great betrayals of British democracy. Voters are right to feel utterly disgusted and it is of little surprise that major donors are abandoning the Tory party. However, we need to remember that the elections on Thursday are not about Brexit but how much council tax you pay and the quality of services you get. It is not right to punish hard-working councillors for the failures of MPs. The statistics are also clear. Conservative-run councils in 2019/20 in England charge on average £93 a year less than Labour controlled councils on a Band D home, and £137 a year less than Lib-Dem-controlled councils.
APR29	Voters must make a vital choice this Thursday, says BRANDON LEWIS	WHILE all eyes in Westminster may have turned back to the issue of Brexit after the gloriously sunny Easter weekend, this week people across the country will be going to the polls to vote in local elections.    From Bolton to Basildon, Swindon to Scarborough, on Thursday you will have the chance to choose whom you want to run your local council. They decide on everything from how often your bins are collected and how well your street is cleaned, to how often your roads are repaired and how local businesses on your high streets are supported. They also decide how much you have to pay in council tax. These are key decisions that affect people's everyday lives. That's why I started my political career as a local councillor. When you compare Conservative-run councils to Labour-run councils, our record of success couldn't be clearer. Across the country, it's Conservative councils that have consistently managed people's money carefully and provided better local services.
APR29	Brexit is simple if we just get off our knees, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	IT SEEMS we helpless, betrayed, let-down taxpayers and voters have no choice but to sit and watch a bunch of idiots and cowards destroy our ancient and hitherto trustworthy constitution.    We are told the Brexit problem is immensely complicated and hence the chaos. Rubbish. At root base Brexit is very simple. A clear majority of us, voting in the biggest democratic exercise in history, wished our homeland to leave the EU and recover sovereignty in full. Our prime minister by default, the incompetent Theresa May, spent 30 months commuting to Brussels to negotiate what we assumed would be a fair and reasonable new relationship, based on mutual advantage and reciprocal cooperation with the EU. But the Michel Barnier team were slackjawed with stunned amazement as the world's worst negotiator frittered away ace after ace, concession after concession and advantage after advantage.
APR29	Real-life horror stories are a travesty of justice- EXPRESS COMMENT	FAMILIES who have been terrorised by a paedophile should be able to look forward to a fresh start when the monster is put behind bars.    But a mother was dismayed to discover that her jailed ex-husband could still wield power over her children's lives. Her account of how he stopped her taking them on holiday abroad will trigger revulsion. He has fought to prevent her selling their home, where abuse took place, and sought to stop the children changing their surnames. It is bad enough that he can exercise his supposed parental rights while serving a jail sentence for the sexual abuse of children. But it is scandalous that he has reportedly enjoyed legal aid while the children's mother has been saddled with fees of more than £40,000.
APR29	Hands off pensioner perks, says ROSS CLARK	THE reputation of our Parliamentarians has taken a battering over the past few months as they have failed to find a way of enacting the wishes of the British people over the Brexit referendum result.    But the need to rebuild trust with the public seems to have been lost on some members of the House of Lords Yesterday the so-called Select Committee on Intergenerational Fairness and Provision published a report demanding that pensioners be made to pay more tax and have their free bus passes and winter fuel payments curtailed - all, apparently, in the name of making life fairer for the young. Under the plans, to which the Government has yet to respond, pensioners would have to wait until at least the age of 72 to receive a free bus pass or winter fuel allowance. Worse, pensioners forced back into the jobs market to make ends meet would have to pay National Insurance Contributions (NICs). At present, liability for NI stops when you reach state pension age, with people who work on liable to pay only income tax.

They decide on everything from how often your bins are collected and how well your street is cleaned, to how often your roads are repaired and how local businesses on your high streets are supported. They also decide how much you have to pay in council tax. These are key decisions that affect people's everyday lives. That's why I started my political career as a local councillor. When you compare Conservative-run councils to Labour-run councils, our record of success couldn't be clearer. Across the country, it's Conservative councils that have consistently managed people's money carefully and provided better local services.
APR30	Brexit is simple if we just get off our knees, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	IT SEEMS we helpless, betrayed, let-down taxpayers and voters have no choice but to sit and watch a bunch of idiots and cowards destroy our ancient and hitherto trustworthy constitution.    We are told the Brexit problem is immensely complicated and hence the chaos. Rubbish. At root base Brexit is very simple. A clear majority of us, voting in the biggest democratic exercise in history, wished our homeland to leave the EU and recover sovereignty in full. Our prime minister by default, the incompetent Theresa May, spent 30 months commuting to Brussels to negotiate what we assumed would be a fair and reasonable new relationship, based on mutual advantage and reciprocal cooperation with the EU. But the Michel Barnier team were slackjawed with stunned amazement as the world's worst negotiator frittered away ace after ace, concession after concession and advantage after advantage.
APR30	Real-life horror stories are a travesty of justice- EXPRESS COMMENT	FAMILIES who have been terrorised by a paedophile should be able to look forward to a fresh start when the monster is put behind bars.    But a mother was dismayed to discover that her jailed ex-husband could still wield power over her children's lives. Her account of how he stopped her taking them on holiday abroad will trigger revulsion. He has fought to prevent her selling their home, where abuse took place, and sought to stop the children changing their surnames. It is bad enough that he can exercise his supposed parental rights while serving a jail sentence for the sexual abuse of children. But it is scandalous that he has reportedly enjoyed legal aid while the children's mother has been saddled with fees of more than £40,000.
MAY1	We have to put ourselves in the line of fire for Britain, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	There is a town in Norway called Flam. It has rather a pleasant fjord and some cheerful shops but I shall forever associate it with the moment I looked down from the hill which I had climbed, felt in my pocket for my mobile phone and called Nigel Farage.    By the time I had descended once more and rejoined the boat on which I was travelling, I had jumped ships in a very different sense. 
MAY1	I can’t bring myself to vote ... thanks to the liberal elite, says TIM NEWARK	FOR the first time in my life, I am ashamed to say, I am considering not voting at all in the local elections this week. Thousands of servicemen have died in two world wars to preserve our democracy but I feel I cannot bring myself to vote for any of the mainstream parties at a national or local level.    They have failed to deliver on the biggest exercise in democracy in recent years and they continue to disappoint on so many fronts.
MAY1	Resuscitate the NHS and recruit new talent - EXPRESS COMMENT	TODAY the Daily Express reveals the shocking scale of staff shortages in the NHS. There are 100,000 vacancies - almost half of which are doctors and nurses - adding up to almost one in 10 posts in the NHS workforce of 1.1 million. In addition, the majority of GP practices in England are falling short of at least one doctor. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAY1	It's time we healed the rifts in our divided society, says STEPHEN POLLARD	FOR my sins, I am a habitual – far too habitual, according to my wife – user of social media. I love the interaction that sites like Twitter offer and I enjoy the freedom to post whatever I want, whenever I want. One minute it's Brexit, the next it's Spurs.    But for all the good of social media, it has played a huge part in poisoning public life. 
MAY1	Keep babies away from all screens - telly, tablet and phones, says VANESSA FELTZ	I’m not going to let it lie. I can’t and I won’t. It’s the news story most adults would love to be allowed to forget.    Last week the World Health Organisation released an unequivocal warning: ban all children under the age of two from screens. These pre-verbal babies and toddlers should, it declared, be protected from all exposure to any screens. 
MAY1	Controversial, but care reforms are a must - EXPRESS COMMENT	IT'S been a long time coming but the Conservatives are finally facing up to the crisis in social care. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAY1	Jeremy Corbyn’s stand on Donald Trump’s visit is shameful hypocrisy, says LEO McKINSTRY	A NATIONAL catastrophe now looms on the horizon. As the broken, divided Tories face electoral meltdown, Jeremy Corbyn's chances of becoming prime minister continue to grow. It is a terrifying prospect. After almost four years as Labour Leader, this quasi-revolutionary Marxist remains unfit for the highest office.    His toxic ideology, serial incompetence, lack of judgment, and contempt for our country's security all leave him badly unqualified for the role.
MAY1	Our cowardly MPs are paralysed by a 16-year-old's pigtails, says NICK FERRARI	QUESTION: who do you suppose is in ultimate charge of who does and, just as importantly, who doesn't, get to address our Parliament and our politicians?    Last week saw the unedifying spectacle of a gaggle of desperate MPs queuing up to be berated by that Princess of the eco-activists, teenage Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. Such is this 16-year-old's meteoric rise that, since she started the "school strikes" movement last year, she has had a private audience with the Pope, then got to lecture the Italian senate on its lack of action over climate change and also addressed the World Economic Forum at Davos. As there is now talk that she will address the UN, it's drearily predictable that her fan club includes the likes of Barack Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio. With such a "right on" following, it was to be expected that our politicians would be prepared to crawl over broken glass to get "an audience" with this modern-day Joan of Arc. But the lengths to which they prostrated themselves was gutwrenching in misplaced reverence. 
MAY1	Councillors are not to blame for EU betrayal, EXPRESS COMMENT	THE CRISIS facing the Conservative Party is entirely of the leadership's own making.    The failure to deliver on its promises over Brexit and to leave the EU - despite Theresa May promising more than 100 times that we would be out on March 29 - has rightly been seen as one of the great betrayals of British democracy. Voters are right to feel utterly disgusted and it is of little surprise that major donors are abandoning the Tory party. However, we need to remember that the elections on Thursday are not about Brexit but how much council tax you pay and the quality of services you get. It is not right to punish hard-working councillors for the failures of MPs. The statistics are also clear. Conservative-run councils in 2019/20 in England charge on average £93 a year less than Labour controlled councils on a Band D home, and £137 a year less than Lib-Dem-controlled councils.

MAY2	Lessons learned from a ladyboy and a cat will help you in life, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	I RECENTLY spent a long weekend away. On my return my cat, Mrs Peel, greeted me with the mixture of fury and grudging relief that so many feline lovers will know so well. At first she refused to speak to me.    Then, when I did what I always do the second I return from anywhere and fed her, there was a reluctant admission that she might be pleased to see me. And I reflected that like so many of her kind she was selfish, manipulative, greedy, self-obsessed, wilful and exasperating. Also adorable. Ladies, we have a lot to learn from this.
MAY2	Security leak impacts on all at heart of Government – EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS an important maxim in politics that the first duty of government is to protect its citizens. This certainly came to the fore last night when Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked over the leaking of a national security briefing to a newspaper.    We acknowledge that Mr Williamson has strongly denied neither he nor anyone else from his team was responsible, but judging by the angry letter written to him by the Prime Minister she is absolutely convinced he was responsible for the leak.
MAY2	Why we must halt the relentless march to a cashless society, says LEO McKINSTRY	JACK WELCH, the US business executive, once famously said that "cash is king". Yet his words now sound increasingly outdated. Cash no longer reigns supreme but has been kicked off the throne by virtual commerce. We are living through an online revolution, one that could eventually mean the disappearance of notes and coins.    In 2017 debit card payments, fuelled by contactless technology, overtook cash payments in Britain for the first time. Several transport providers, retailers and even restaurants now refuse cash. To its starry-eyed enthusiasts, the advent of the cashless society represents an exciting new world of speed and convenience.

MAY3	Margaret Thatcher: Forty years on, what did she mean to you?	Four decades after she walked into No 10, our columnists give their verdicts of the indomitable Iron Lady.    Forty years ago tomorrow, a grocer’s daughter and mother of two from Grantham in Lincolnshire entered No 10 Downing Street the day after she was elected Britain’s first female prime minister.

MAY4	Rape case rules call is chaotic, says RICHARD AND JUDY	HOW absolutely and predictably typical it is that the latest plan by police chiefs and the Crown Prosecution Service to deliver more consistency in the way rape cases are dealt with has turned into a massive PR blunder.    Women reporting rape will be, we're told, required to hand over their mobile phones, tablets and laptops to police, together with their passwords.This will enable investigators to trawl through, examine and disclose any "relevant material" to the case. Of course, women's groups are furious. Allowing their private lives to be gawped at by police because they have accused a man of rape seems perilously close to the old idea that a woman's "moral character" - i.e. her sex life - will be taken into consideration by a court in deciding if she has indeed been raped.That revolting old "she was asking for it" chestnut muttered by ancient misogynistic judges in the latter half of the 20th century is still not forgotten.
MAY4	Inside Politics: Climate warnings open new rift	GREEN warnings of planetary doom are threatening to open a new rift among Westminster's already divided blues. With climate change dominating the Commons agenda this week, MPs across the Commons united to declare an official environmental emergency.    Yet behind the apparent cross-party consensus, some Tories fear environmental panic will lead to political catastrophe for their party. "Too many ministers are unwilling to question anything the green lobby says," one of the growing number of Tory MPs uncomfortable with Parliament's latest obsession told me. "The climate fanatics are in charge and the long-term result will be bad energy policy." Debates in the Commons and the Lords and on the political broadcast shows this week were filled with demands for new curbs on diesel and petrol cars and orders to voters to turn down their central heating and eat less red meat. Ed Miliband even admitted to foregoing the beloved bacon butties that once caused him to be caught in an unflattering photo for environmental reasons. "Yeah I've given up the bacon," the former Labour leader said in a radio interview, before going on to encourage listeners to eat less meat, to recycle, and try to use a car less.
MAY4	Richard Osborn-Brooks is a hero to us all, says CAROLE MALONE	FINALLY the law has decided that brave pensioner Richard Osborn-Brooks is not a criminal.    A coroner has ruled that he acted in self-defence when he killed an armed burglar who broke into his house high on drugs and threatened to stab him with a screwdriver. Frightened for his own life and that of his frail wife Maureen, Mr Osborn-Brooks, 79, got in first and stabbed career criminal Henry Vincent in the chest with a 12-inch kitchen knife. And of course the police, slaves to political correctness, promptly arrested him on suspicion of murder. It's taken the law more than a year to decide Mr Osborn-Brooks is a victim, not a criminal - although most right-thinking people knew that on the day the police carted him off for questioning. But, this time the law has got it right and has backed the victim of the crime rather than the perpetrator of it. And you'd think that now the nightmare would be over for the pensioner. But it isn't.
MAY4	We shouldn't sneer at aspiring to be middle class, says STEPHEN POLLARD	FORTY years ago today, the then Mrs Thatcher had her first day as prime minister. You hardly need me to tell you how successful she was, winning three election landslides and rescuing the country from a decline that had seemed inevitable through most of the 1970s.    There were many factors behind her success but perhaps the most important was her instinctive understanding of the aspirations that drive most people. The Left portrayed society and politics as a battle between the rich and the poor, and claimed that the rest of us could only prosper if the better-off were shackled. Mrs Thatcher, on the other hand, knew that most of us are not driven by jealousy. We don't want the government to punish success. We want everyone who works hard to be rewarded. Although Labour's failure to grasp this throughout the 1970s and '80s condemned it to opposition, one young Labour politician got it. The lesson Tony Blair learned was fundamental to transforming Labour's fortunes in the 1997 election. It is a political truth that remains just as pertinent today. But although most politicians pay lip service to the idea and claim to be on our side, Labour is now in the grip of Marxists and the Tories have lost contact with reality.
MAY4	The voters have spoken, now parties MUST listen, EXPRESS COMMENT	THE people have spoken. But we have to wonder how many times they need to deliver their message before politicians take notice.    Nevertheless the verdict of British voters is clear to both the Conservatives and Labour - they need to keep their promise and get on with delivering Brexit quickly. The British can be patient but the council results across England have emphatically shown that people have had enough. The loss of about 1,200 seats by the Tories is even worse than was expected. But Labour's losses of about 100 seats when they should have been picking up hundreds instead was equally catastrophic. Voters were obviously punishing the two main parties for failing to deliver Brexit. Do not be fooled by the Lib Dem gains, they have simply taken their traditional role for protest votes - the Brexit Party had no candidates so this was not a sudden conversion to Remain.

MAY5	Wellbeing's fine, just avoid the trampoline, EXPRESS COMMENT	LET’S get one thing straight: the men and women who are courageous enough to work as police officers in this country regularly show exemplary bravery.    As I have said on numerous occasions, whereas you and I run away from danger, in virtually every instance they race towards it. 
MAY5	Let's hope for a Euro deal to boost Britain, EXPRESS COMMENT	AFTER the drubbing they received from voters last week it is no wonder that minds have finally started to focus in the Government and the Labour Party on delivering what they promised: Brexit. People were right to be thoroughly disillusioned by Parliament’s failure to implement what the majority voted for in 2016.    But the prospect of a deal this week is extremely positive and we should welcome anything that delivers Brexit.
MAY5	We Tories are the natural party of working classes, says MP ESTHER MCVEY	The dire local election results show how far we have become detached from our supporters – largely but not solely due to our failure to deliver Brexit. They showed too how Labour have abandoned their traditional working-class voters, particularly in the North.    This presents us with a huge opportunity to get back on track and become the natural home for these voters.

MAY6	Call in Cobra to strike at the knife crime menace – EXPRESS COMMENT	THE airwaves in recent days have been full of demands from politicians and green protesters for an official emergency to be declared over climate change. Yet, while the planet certainly needs long-term protection, our society is facing a far more immediate crisis, as violent crime continues to spiral out of control.    Only yesterday, another murder investigation was launched after a stabbing in Manchester. Last month, it was revealed the police recorded 40,829 offences involving knives or sharp instruments in 2018, up 6 percent on the year before. At the same time, cases of murder and manslaughter rose by 12 percent - a total of 732 killings. The response of the authorities has been warm words and bureaucratic tinkering.
MAY6	It’s dangerous for the Tories to do a deal with Jeremy Corbyn, says LEO McKINSTRY	SPEAKING at the Welsh Conservatives' party conference on Saturday, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock made a ferocious assault on Jeremy Corbyn. "He is the most dangerous party leader this country has seen in 100 years. He is a threat to our security, to our freedom, to our prosperity, and it is our deep duty to ensure he never enters No.10."    But those words are meaningless. The Tory Government has already invited Corbyn into the heart of Downing Street. Panic-stricken by their catastrophic local election results and their spectacular failure to deliver Brexit so far, the Tories have gone on bended knee to the Labour leader, begging him for a last-minute deal. Their subservience is both pathetic and hypocritical. One moment, they are describing Corbyn as a revolutionary menace to our nation, the next they are asking him to decide the course of our national destiny.
MAY6	Wellbeing's fine, just avoid the trampoline, EXPRESS COMMENT	LET’S get one thing straight: the men and women who are courageous enough to work as police officers in this country regularly show exemplary bravery.    As I have said on numerous occasions, whereas you and I run away from danger, in virtually every instance they race towards it. 
MAY6	Let's hope for a Euro deal to boost Britain, EXPRESS COMMENT	AFTER the drubbing they received from voters last week it is no wonder that minds have finally started to focus in the Government and the Labour Party on delivering what they promised: Brexit. People were right to be thoroughly disillusioned by Parliament’s failure to implement what the majority voted for in 2016.    But the prospect of a deal this week is extremely positive and we should welcome anything that delivers Brexit.
MAY6	We Tories are the natural party of working classes, says MP ESTHER MCVEY	The dire local election results show how far we have become detached from our supporters – largely but not solely due to our failure to deliver Brexit. They showed too how Labour have abandoned their traditional working-class voters, particularly in the North.    This presents us with a huge opportunity to get back on track and become the natural home for these voters. 
MAY6	Rape case rules call is chaotic, says RICHARD AND JUDY	HOW absolutely and predictably typical it is that the latest plan by police chiefs and the Crown Prosecution Service to deliver more consistency in the way rape cases are dealt with has turned into a massive PR blunder.    Women reporting rape will be, we're told, required to hand over their mobile phones, tablets and laptops to police, together with their passwords.This will enable investigators to trawl through, examine and disclose any "relevant material" to the case. Of course, women's groups are furious. Allowing their private lives to be gawped at by police because they have accused a man of rape seems perilously close to the old idea that a woman's "moral character" - i.e. her sex life - will be taken into consideration by a court in deciding if she has indeed been raped.That revolting old "she was asking for it" chestnut muttered by ancient misogynistic judges in the latter half of the 20th century is still not forgotten.
MAY6	Inside Politics: Climate warnings open new rift	GREEN warnings of planetary doom are threatening to open a new rift among Westminster's already divided blues. With climate change dominating the Commons agenda this week, MPs across the Commons united to declare an official environmental emergency.    Yet behind the apparent cross-party consensus, some Tories fear environmental panic will lead to political catastrophe for their party. "Too many ministers are unwilling to question anything the green lobby says," one of the growing number of Tory MPs uncomfortable with Parliament's latest obsession told me. "The climate fanatics are in charge and the long-term result will be bad energy policy." Debates in the Commons and the Lords and on the political broadcast shows this week were filled with demands for new curbs on diesel and petrol cars and orders to voters to turn down their central heating and eat less red meat. Ed Miliband even admitted to foregoing the beloved bacon butties that once caused him to be caught in an unflattering photo for environmental reasons. "Yeah I've given up the bacon," the former Labour leader said in a radio interview, before going on to encourage listeners to eat less meat, to recycle, and try to use a car less.
MAY6	Richard Osborn-Brooks is a hero to us all, says CAROLE MALONE	FINALLY the law has decided that brave pensioner Richard Osborn-Brooks is not a criminal.    A coroner has ruled that he acted in self-defence when he killed an armed burglar who broke into his house high on drugs and threatened to stab him with a screwdriver. Frightened for his own life and that of his frail wife Maureen, Mr Osborn-Brooks, 79, got in first and stabbed career criminal Henry Vincent in the chest with a 12-inch kitchen knife. And of course the police, slaves to political correctness, promptly arrested him on suspicion of murder. It's taken the law more than a year to decide Mr Osborn-Brooks is a victim, not a criminal - although most right-thinking people knew that on the day the police carted him off for questioning. But, this time the law has got it right and has backed the victim of the crime rather than the perpetrator of it. And you'd think that now the nightmare would be over for the pensioner. But it isn't.
MAY6	We shouldn't sneer at aspiring to be middle class, says STEPHEN POLLARD	FORTY years ago today, the then Mrs Thatcher had her first day as prime minister. You hardly need me to tell you how successful she was, winning three election landslides and rescuing the country from a decline that had seemed inevitable through most of the 1970s.    There were many factors behind her success but perhaps the most important was her instinctive understanding of the aspirations that drive most people. The Left portrayed society and politics as a battle between the rich and the poor, and claimed that the rest of us could only prosper if the better-off were shackled. Mrs Thatcher, on the other hand, knew that most of us are not driven by jealousy. We don't want the government to punish success. We want everyone who works hard to be rewarded. Although Labour's failure to grasp this throughout the 1970s and '80s condemned it to opposition, one young Labour politician got it. The lesson Tony Blair learned was fundamental to transforming Labour's fortunes in the 1997 election. It is a political truth that remains just as pertinent today. But although most politicians pay lip service to the idea and claim to be on our side, Labour is now in the grip of Marxists and the Tories have lost contact with reality.
MAY6	The voters have spoken, now parties MUST listen, EXPRESS COMMENT	THE people have spoken. But we have to wonder how many times they need to deliver their message before politicians take notice.    Nevertheless the verdict of British voters is clear to both the Conservatives and Labour - they need to keep their promise and get on with delivering Brexit quickly. The British can be patient but the council results across England have emphatically shown that people have had enough. The loss of about 1,200 seats by the Tories is even worse than was expected. But Labour's losses of about 100 seats when they should have been picking up hundreds instead was equally catastrophic. Voters were obviously punishing the two main parties for failing to deliver Brexit. Do not be fooled by the Lib Dem gains, they have simply taken their traditional role for protest votes - the Brexit Party had no candidates so this was not a sudden conversion to Remain.
MAY7	Deluded Darcy can't write her own legacy, says VANESSA FELTZ	The mystery is solved. Darcey Bussell is leaving Strictly, not because she loathes Shirley Ballas, not because she can’t bear Bruno Tonioli, but because she wants her teenage daughters to remember her not merely as a judge on a TV show but as a classical prima ballerina.    Alas, Darcy is on the stickiest of wickets. Where on earth did our dancing dame get the idea you can orchestrate your own legacy? Only the deluded imagine you can dictate to your nearest and dearest how they remember you. Think of the distinguished diplomats recalled by their offspring as bad cooks or Monopoly cheats; the Nobel prize-winners dismissed by descendants as terrible tennis players or habitual headache sufferers. Poets imagine subsequent generations will quote their rhyming couplets yet all that lingers are tales of dandruff, mismatched socks and their aversion to rice pudding. 
MAY7	The ‘many’ will pay for a return to state ownership, says STEPHEN POLLARD	ONLY Jeremy Corbyn's most fanatical admirers would claim that he is intellectually gifted. But while Mr Corbyn may not be the brightest of sparks, his close ally John McDonnell is anything but stupid.
Mr McDonnell is the ideological brains of the Corbynites – and a formidable political operator.    Since becoming shadow chancellor in 2015 he has, rather brilliantly, managed to portray himself as an avuncular bank manager figure, concerned only with common sense and ensuring a steady hand on the tiller. I say brilliant because this is far from reality. Far from avuncular, he is a hardcore socialist revolutionary who believes the streets are a more legitimate arena for politics than Westminster and who plans – for he has repeatedly said so – a socialist economic revolution. But he is shrewd enough to know he has to have a veneer of moderation.
MAY7	Call in Cobra to strike at the knife crime menace – EXPRESS COMMENT	THE airwaves in recent days have been full of demands from politicians and green protesters for an official emergency to be declared over climate change. Yet, while the planet certainly needs long-term protection, our society is facing a far more immediate crisis, as violent crime continues to spiral out of control.    Only yesterday, another murder investigation was launched after a stabbing in Manchester. Last month, it was revealed the police recorded 40,829 offences involving knives or sharp instruments in 2018, up 6 percent on the year before. At the same time, cases of murder and manslaughter rose by 12 percent - a total of 732 killings. The response of the authorities has been warm words and bureaucratic tinkering.

MAY8	Farce of £150m bill for EU elections we don't want - EXPRESS COMMENT	Confirmation yesterday that the European Parliament elections will go ahead is a shocking indictment of our political classes for failing to deliver Brexit. It is not just the terrible waste of money - £150million-plus being spent on running the polls - but the fact that we shouldn't even be part of them.    Britain should have been out of the European Union by now and charting a new course as a free and independent nation.
MAY8	Needy Theresa May is being primed for failure, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	Just what is it about Theresa May that makes her so utterly dependent on her advisers? First, it was Fiona Hill, whom she was obliged by David Cameron to sack after some briefing against Michael Gove in an inter-departmental war. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAY8	Royal power: Revel in the soft power of the Windsors who fly the flag for Britain	AS NEWS of the royal birth makes headlines around the world, the Prince of Wales is right to fly to Germany this week to stress our common historic links with the most powerful country in Europe. In this bicentenary year of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's births, there is clearly much that binds us together, and the Royal Family can charm parts of the world that are frankly exhausted by our Brexit farce. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

MAY9	Tories are facing a meltdown in the elections of doom, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE political class has an imminent appointment with doom. Punishment will soon be inflicted on a brutal scale for its failure to deliver Brexit. This retribution against the traditional parties will come in the form of an almighty hammering at the European elections in exactly a fortnight.    If the Tories and Labour thought they did badly at the municipal contests last week, those results are nothing to the massacre that awaits them. The fact that these elections are happening at all is a graphic illustration of the establishment's ineptitude and contempt for the referendum result.

MAY10	It is time to discuss who really calls the shots, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	THE media will have it that Theresa May fired Gavin Williamson. Those who are a bit picky about accuracy (I plead guilty) know perfectly well it was Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill who swung the axe.    As Cabinet Secretary, running his prime minister like a clockwork orange, head of the National Security Committee and, by the by, president of the Special Forces Club, Sir Mark actually runs the entire country now. Add to that a passionate pro-EU fanatic.  Our emergence from the EU remains stultified. I think two and two still make four. Or have things changed since my schooldays?  So a conundrum for those with a taste for constitutional esoterica. Should any unelected mandarin have that much unchallenged power in a supposed democracy? As they say in exams: Discuss.
MAY10	The rise of populist politics is a danger to our nation, says DAVID GAUKE	WE live in an era of extraordinary political turbulence.

MAY11	Inside Politics: Odd couple face a lonely walk	HAVING talked the talk, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are preparing to walk the walk together through the Commons voting lobbies.    Senior Tories believe the Prime Minister and the hard-Left Labour leader are on the brink of agreeing a joint Brexit plan after weeks of negotiations between their two parties. Westminster's odd couple could soon be shaking hands on forming the unlikeliest of political alliances. "A deal is just about done," one minister told me this week. "The continuing negotiations are really just for show while we get the Euro elections out of the way." Complaints from the Labour camp that Mrs May is refusing to make a serious offer of compromise are said to be a cover to buy time. "The statements from both sides after each round of talks are carefully choreographed to make things look a lot trickier than they really are," the minister added.
MAY11	Feckless May faces annihilation, say RICHARD AND JUDY	R - IF Theresa May still has two brain cells left to rub together (questionable, given the multiple short-circuits inside her skull that have fizzed and popped and flashed away over months of serial setbacks, every one of them self-inflicted) she'll do a duck-dive and make herself scarce before the European elections.

MAY11	Britain's woeful record on dealing with rape - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE concerns raised by Baroness Newlove about the treatment of rape victims should worry us all. The Baroness is right to question why victims of such a brutal and damaging crime should themselves be investigated when they hand over their mobile phones for evidence.    The fact that if the police find something illegal or potentially incriminating on their phones these victims of a terrible assault can themselves be arrested is wrong. All that happens in a system like this is that victims are afraid to come forward or hand in evidence. Having suffered the terror of rape they then have to feel the fear of being judged or investigated themselves.
MAY11	Trump's trade war on China threatens to damage us all, says STEPHEN POLLARD	WHATEVER you think of Donald Trump's decision to increase tariffs on a range of Chinese goods to 25 per cent, the one thing that can't be said is that it's a surprise.

MAY11	It is time to discuss who really calls the shots, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	THE media will have it that Theresa May fired Gavin Williamson. Those who are a bit picky about accuracy (I plead guilty) know perfectly well it was Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill who swung the axe.    As Cabinet Secretary, running his prime minister like a clockwork orange, head of the National Security Committee and, by the by, president of the Special Forces Club, Sir Mark actually runs the entire country now. Add to that a passionate pro-EU fanatic.  Our emergence from the EU remains stultified. I think two and two still make four. Or have things changed since my schooldays?  So a conundrum for those with a taste for constitutional esoterica. Should any unelected mandarin have that much unchallenged power in a supposed democracy? As they say in exams: Discuss.
MAY11	The rise of populist politics is a danger to our nation, says DAVID GAUKE	WE live in an era of extraordinary political turbulence. Policies and politicians that, not long ago, could be dismissed as extreme, divisive or impractical are winning large numbers of votes. Mainstream politicians are on the defensive.

MAY11	Pensioners deserve freedom from fear - EXPRESS COMMENT	MILLIONS of people will share Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s conviction that you should not be forced to sell your home to pay for care in old age.    Today’s politicians must end the fear that haunts so many of us that we will have to empty our savings because we need help with everyday life. Voters want more than empathy from senior ministers. Rightly, they demand action.
MAY11	Tories are facing a meltdown in the elections of doom, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE political class has an imminent appointment with doom. Punishment will soon be inflicted on a brutal scale for its failure to deliver Brexit. This retribution against the traditional parties will come in the form of an almighty hammering at the European elections in exactly a fortnight.    If the Tories and Labour thought they did badly at the municipal contests last week, those results are nothing to the massacre that awaits them. The fact that these elections are happening at all is a graphic illustration of the establishment's ineptitude and contempt for the referendum result. By law, Britain should have left the EU more than a month ago – yet here we are, on the verge of voting in a key institution which will continue to hold sway over our country.
MAY11	Farce of £150m bill for EU elections we don't want - EXPRESS COMMENT	Confirmation yesterday that the European Parliament elections will go ahead is a shocking indictment of our political classes for failing to deliver Brexit. It is not just the terrible waste of money - £150million-plus being spent on running the polls - but the fact that we shouldn't even be part of them.    Britain should have been out of the European Union by now and charting a new course as a free and independent nation.
MAY12	Sorry Meghan, a baby photocall is just part of being a celebrity mother	POOR Meghan. She just can't do anything right at the moment. She has learned that, while everyone loves a baby picture, Mum (and Dad) can get it so wrong. So much so it can ultimately spoil baby's first outing.    I was with a group of girlfriends when the Sussexes brought baby Archie out to the cameras at Windsor Castle last week. We all flocked around the TV and I must admit there was an avalanche of criticism. Why is Harry holding the baby and Meghan clinging on to him like a limpet? Why won't they let us see the child's face - it is a photocall after all.
MAY12	EU negotiators dumbfounded by crass stupidity of UK Brexit team – Nick Ferrari	OUT OF time, out of touch and out of their minds. This has been the week that finally showed (if there was any doubt) just how wide the gap is between us, who expect some form of political leadership, and those charged with doing just that but have proved woefully unable to provide it and are also stunningly deaf to the nation's mood.

Westminster's odd couple could soon be shaking hands on forming the unlikeliest of political alliances. "A deal is just about done," one minister told me this week.

MAY13	No excuses... it’s time to take care of ourselves – EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS often said we are living longer and what a good thing that is. But the sorry facts tell a different story: not all of us are living longer. Indeed, for the first time in 50 years, deaths have risen among men and women under 75 as a result of heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, raised cholesterol and obesity.    According to the British Heart Foundation, the historic pace of progress in reducing deaths of the under-75s has "slowed to a near standstill". Chillingly, millions of us are living with undiagnosed conditions that increase the risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke.Which implies that we should be taking more responsibility for our health.
MAY13	We’ll pay a bitter price for Jeremy Corbyn’s politics of envy, says LEO McKINSTRY	WINSTON CHURCHILL once said that "for a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket, trying to lift himself up by the handle." The great man was right. The lesson from history is that excessive taxation always wrecks a country's economy by destroying the incentives for wealth creation.    Yet the experience of the past has not stopped the Labour Party from peddling its dogma that the rich should be hammered by the state. In the name of supposed equality, Jeremy Corbyn wants to wage a new class war, with confiscatory taxation and socialist control of enterprise as two of his prime weapons. This destructive ideology is so terrifying because a Labour Government has become a real possibility. As the Tories flounder in the polls, broken by their failure to deliver Brexit, Corbyn has power almost within his grasp. Understandably, the prospect of this Left-wing zealot in Downing Street alarms many wealth generators. That was clear over the weekend when the publication of the authoritative Sunday Times annual rich list was accompanied by dire warnings about the economic impact of a Corbyn premiership.

MAY14	Ludicrous tax on workers inflate salaries of the rich, says LIZ TRUSS	EVEN by the standards of Jeremy Corbyn, this is a truly ludicrous scheme.    Free money sounds great - but of course it would be taxpayers who picked up the bill. Under Labour's scheme, absolutely everyone would receive a benefits handout from the government - from Premier League footballers to investment bankers. Close to £2million a year would be paid to the highest-paid footballers in the country and nearly £13million a year to the highest-earning bankers, paid for by the rest of us.
MAY14	We should stop burying our feelings and be open, says VANESSA FELTZ	WE DON'T do death at all well in Great Britain.

Most of us are far too acutely self-conscious to offer the bereaved anything more substantial than a hard slap on the back or a meaningful handshake.

MAY14	It's time to get seriously organised against crime - EXPRESS COMMENT	IT SHOULD be a matter of national shame that the UK has become such a centre of serious organised crime - now giving rise to the menacing acronym SOC.    With 181,000 UK offenders linked to serious crime - the population of a medium-sized city and twice the numbers of the regular British Army - the National Crime Agency's latest report has torn a hole in any complacency. SOC includes money laundering, child sexual exploitation, people trafficking, fraud, slavery, "county lines" drug dealing and the violently defended supply of firearms - the kinds of crimes that were, until recently, not prevalent in this country. Much more should be done. It is one thing for the UK to be an open society, but it is the first duty of any government to keep its citizens secure.

MAY15	Cyber crime is a growing threat to all of us, says DOMINIC MIDGLEY	The smartphone messaging app WhatsApp has long traded on the security it offers customers by its use of end-to-end encryption.    This means that messages are only displayed in a legible form on the sender's phone or the recipient's device. And so the news that it has been the victim of a "targeted" surveillance attack is all the more disturbing. It turns out that hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on users' phones and other devices, such as desktop computers, by exploiting a hitherto unknown major vulnerability. The cyber attackers used WhatsApp's voice-calling function to ring a target's device and, even if the call was not picked up, the surveillance software would be installed. This would then enable the hacker to not only read the target's messages but view images and other media, scan documents and even identify the user's location.

The Oxford Union voted by a huge margin (224 to 49) not to support no-platforming and accorded a standing ovation to the case against.    Thus, in this age of snowflakes, offence-taking and twitterstorms a large turnout of our brightest and best students defied the current trend and voted overwhelmingly for the freedom to express controversial views. The Labour MP Naz Shah had withdrawn her participation in the debate, citing the presence of Katie Hopkins, who was appearing for the free speech side, as the cause.

MAY16	Daily Express wins Troubles witch-hunts – but the fight for justice goes on, says LEO	SOLDIERS who protect our nation should be cherished for their courage, patriotism and self-sacrifice. But today, sadly, too many veterans are hounded for their service. In a political climate where morality is regularly inverted, they are thrown to the wolves and ruthlessly targeted by money-grabbing lawyers.    The Daily Express has fought a powerful crusade against this outrage, calling for an end to the witch-hunts. Now our initiative has achieved a real result. This week the Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt proposed a new law to prevent soldiers from being investigated over incidents that occurred more than 10 years ago, unless compelling new evidence of wrongdoing has emerged. Nor will they be hauled through the courts, for there will be a "statutory presumption against prosecution" for actions in the distant past.
MAY16	Britain's war on cancer does the country proud - EXPRESS COMMENT	NEWS that a team of scientists in Britain will dedicate their time to finding drugs to stop the evolution of cancer and get ahead of this terrible disease is one of the biggest steps forward in human progress.    According to Cancer Research, in the UK alone 450 people died every day as a result of the disease between 2014 and 2016. That's about 166,000 deaths a year and many thousands of other people have also had their lives devastated by the loss of a friend, a spouse or a relative. As experts point out today one of the great barriers to tackling cancers is that they are resistant to treatment by drugs - so a new medicine that can prevent this will make a vast difference to mortality rates and the comfort of treatment for patients.

With 181,000 UK offenders linked to serious crime - the population of a medium-sized city and twice the numbers of the regular British Army - the National Crime Agency's latest report has torn a hole in any complacency. SOC includes money laundering, child sexual exploitation, people trafficking, fraud, slavery, "county lines" drug dealing and the violently defended supply of firearms - the kinds of crimes that were, until recently, not prevalent in this country. Much more should be done. It is one thing for the UK to be an open society, but it is the first duty of any government to keep its citizens secure.
MAY16	What are the big questions Nigel Farage faces if he wins the Euros? asks STEPHEN POLLARD	WHATEVER opinion you may have of Nigel Farage – and people either love him or hate him – he is undoubtedly one of the most successful and skilful politicians of our age. He may never have been elected as an MP but his dogged pursuit of Brexit, from long before the word had even been coined, is a remarkable political triumph. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAY16	No excuses... it’s time to take care of ourselves – EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS often said we are living longer and what a good thing that is. But the sorry facts tell a different story: not all of us are living longer. Indeed, for the first time in 50 years, deaths have risen among men and women under 75 as a result of heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, raised cholesterol and obesity.    According to the British Heart Foundation, the historic pace of progress in reducing deaths of the under-75s has "slowed to a near standstill". Chillingly, millions of us are living with undiagnosed conditions that increase the risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke.Which implies that we should be taking more responsibility for our health.
MAY17	Theresa May answers poignant 65 roses call for help - EXPRESS COMMENT	THERESA May yesterday took time to stand up for those suffering in society.    The Prime Minister's intervention in the battle to get cystic fibrosis sufferers life-enhancing drugs is an important intervention and one we hope the medical company Vertex will listen to. Mrs May is absolutely right to say that it is up to the American firm to put aside its demands and provide the life-saving drug Orkambi, which not only extends the lives of people with this terrible disease but also makes it a lot more comfortable for them. It took the brave efforts of mum Zoey Jones and her one-year-old daughter Eve to raise the issue to the highest of emotional levels by delivering a poignant message to Downing Street.
MAY17	Nature must not be allowed to run amok, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	THE quango Natural England which recently and wholly arbitrarily suspended the licences permitting farmers to shoot dangerous pests and predators is having that privilege removed from it. And about time too. Our lovely and skilfully managed countryside is beset by too many loons who do not know what they are talking about.    The problem is twofold. Nowadays you only have to stick the letters "eco" in front of someone's title and there is an automatic presumption that person knows all about Old Mother Nature and is on her side. A double nonsense. Add to that the growing dictatorship of the quangogracy over all of us. First things first. 
MAY17	It is dangerous to allow Huawei to be involved in the UK, says ROSS CLARK	JUST a few years ago the name Huawei would have meant nothing to the British public. Now millions of us have the Chinese company's smartphones in our bags or pockets. They have helped bring once unimaginable technology to the masses, allowing us to access the internet, play films while on the move and make telephone calls around the world. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAY17	Daily Express wins Troubles witch-hunts – but the fight for justice goes on, says LEO	SOLDIERS who protect our nation should be cherished for their courage, patriotism and self-sacrifice. But today, sadly, too many veterans are hounded for their service. In a political climate where morality is regularly inverted, they are thrown to the wolves and ruthlessly targeted by money-grabbing lawyers.    The Daily Express has fought a powerful crusade against this outrage, calling for an end to the witch-hunts. Now our initiative has achieved a real result. This week the Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt proposed a new law to prevent soldiers from being investigated over incidents that occurred more than 10 years ago, unless compelling new evidence of wrongdoing has emerged. Nor will they be hauled through the courts, for there will be a "statutory presumption against prosecution" for actions in the distant past.
MAY17	Britain's war on cancer does the country proud - EXPRESS COMMENT	NEWS that a team of scientists in Britain will dedicate their time to finding drugs to stop the evolution of cancer and get ahead of this terrible disease is one of the biggest steps forward in human progress.    According to Cancer Research, in the UK alone 450 people died every day as a result of the disease between 2014 and 2016. That's about 166,000 deaths a year and many thousands of other people have also had their lives devastated by the loss of a friend, a spouse or a relative. As experts point out today one of the great barriers to tackling cancers is that they are resistant to treatment by drugs - so a new medicine that can prevent this will make a vast difference to mortality rates and the comfort of treatment for patients.
MAY17	Cyber crime is a growing threat to all of us, says DOMINIC MIDGLEY	The smartphone messaging app WhatsApp has long traded on the security it offers customers by its use of end-to-end encryption.    This means that messages are only displayed in a legible form on the sender's phone or the recipient's device. And so the news that it has been the victim of a "targeted" surveillance attack is all the more disturbing. It turns out that hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on users' phones and other devices, such as desktop computers, by exploiting a hitherto unknown major vulnerability. The cyber attackers used WhatsApp's voice-calling function to ring a target's device and, even if the call was not picked up, the surveillance software would be installed. This would then enable the hacker to not only read the target's messages but view images and other media, scan documents and even identify the user's location.
MAY17	Scandal of our broken care system for the elderly - EXPRESS COMMENT	The lack of care home beds in a third of English postcodes is a truly shocking and disturbing state of affairs for this country.    It is imperative the Government gives serious attention to this national scandal.
MAY17	Oxford Union passes an emphatic vote for freedom of speech, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	LAST Thursday something important happened which was ignored by the press and media but which should give much comfort to those of us who care about freedom of speech. The Oxford Union voted by a huge margin (224 to 49) not to support no-platforming and accorded a standing ovation to the case against.    Thus, in this age of snowflakes, offence-taking and twitterstorms a large turnout of our brightest and best students defied the current trend and voted overwhelmingly for the freedom to express controversial views. The Labour MP Naz Shah had withdrawn her participation in the debate, citing the presence of Katie Hopkins, who was appearing for the free speech side, as the cause. 
MAY17	Ludicrous tax on workers inflate salaries of the rich, says LIZ TRUSS	EVEN by the standards of Jeremy Corbyn, this is a truly ludicrous scheme.    Free money sounds great - but of course it would be taxpayers who picked up the bill. Under Labour's scheme, absolutely everyone would receive a benefits handout from the government - from Premier League footballers to investment bankers. Close to £2million a year would be paid to the highest-paid footballers in the country and nearly £13million a year to the highest-earning bankers, paid for by the rest of us.
MAY17	We should stop burying our feelings and be open, says VANESSA FELTZ	WE DON'T do death at all well in Great Britain. We're mad keen on the stiff upper lip, putting on a good funeral spread and legging it back to work and resuming normal service asap.    Most of us are far too acutely self-conscious to offer the bereaved anything more substantial than a hard slap on the back or a meaningful handshake. "You OK?" we bark. Imagine the catastrophe if the mourner answered truthfully: "No! My heart is shattered into a million pieces. I can neither eat nor sleep. I am so lonely I can hear the digital clock ticking and I fantasise about drowning myself in the bath."
MAY18	Inside Politics: Tories must adapt or die	NIGEL Farage is a week away from an electoral triumph that is already forcing Tory MPs to question whether their party can adapt or die. When the results of Thursday's Euro elections are declared next Sunday night, his Brexit Party is almost certain to be the winner. For Theresa May's troops, electoral annihilation looms.    An average of four opinion polls yesterday gave the Tories an expected 12 per cent share of the vote in the contest for seats in the European Parliament forced on the country by her failure to deliver Brexit on schedule. A defeat of that size would be the worst Tory result in a national election since the Prime Minister's political idol Sir Robert Peel founded the modern Conservative Party in 1834. "Our party is quite simply dying," one former Tory minister told me this week. "Breaking our promise to leave the EU on March 29 has been catastrophic. Remainers blame us for Brexit and Leavers hate us for not delivering Brexit. We are not offering anything to anyone."
MAY18	Jeremy Kyle show canned for its cruelty, say RICHARD AND JUDY	J - NOW that The Jeremy Kyle Show has been permanently taken off air by ITV, it's timely to remember that the genesis for this type of programme (described by a judge as a "human form of bear-baiting going under the guise of entertainment" and the president of the Royal Society of Medicine as "the theatre of cruelty") was The Jerry Springer Show, a daily trailer-trash punch-up hugely popular for years in America.    And yet, controversial as it could be, Springer's show was never as inhumane as Kyle's. We met Springer years ago when we were presenting This Morning. He was delightful; a man of enormous charm. He always refused to defend his programme, but in fact The Jerry Springer Show - funny and often shocking - was never full of the sheer hatred, cruelty and aggression that characterises our now-cancelled UK version.
MAY18	End these sacrifices on reality TV's altar, says CAROLE MALONE	UNLESS you've been living down a pothole you'll know the Jeremy Kyle show has been axed. For 14 years this toxic circus saw the vulnerable and mentally challenged paraded on our TV screens as sport. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAY18	Prince William shows his calibre as a future king - EXPRESS COMMENT	PRINCE William has shown his true calibre as a future monarch by bravely opening up on the problems of mental health and the challenges he has faced personally.    Many people will know exactly what he meant when he talked about the loss of his mother Princess Diana as a "pain like no other pain". The loss of a parent, a loved one or a close friend hurts us all and is a cause of many mental breakdowns and illness in people. But it is no good our leaders just being vocal about mental health issues, we need political action to tackle this problem in society which is close to being an epidemic.
MAY18	We need a new Tory leader who can heal the whole country, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT WAS the least surprising political news of the decade. On Thursday Boris Johnson confirmed: "Of course I'm going to go for it." Speak to Conservative members and the same message comes back every time: if he makes it to the final ballot, Boris will stroll to victory.    No other candidate comes close to his popularity with Conservative members. But it's a huge "if", because for all his popularity with members, it's impossible to be sure that his fellow MPs will make him one of the two final contenders to be voted on by members. Many observers think it's more likely that they won't. All of which means that the leadership is wide open. Barely a day seems to go by without one or other Tory MP posing in their kitchen or living room for a newspaper profile designed to flag up their leadership credentials. To date, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey and Rory Stewart have joined Boris in confirming they will run and it's pretty much guaranteed that Michael Gove, Matthew Hancock, Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab will join them - along with the likes of Steve Baker and perhaps a dozen others who don't realistically expect to win but want to make a point by standing.

MAY19	Don't laugh, there's a real lesson here.. says NICK FERRARI	MANY of you reading this won't need telling that last week saw most primary school children taking their SATs tests. These are exams in English and maths, and are currently taken at the end of Year 2 and Year 6, although the Government has agreed they are to be scrapped for seven-year-olds.    They are supposed to be a measure of the performance of the school and its teaching practices but they have been allowed to be seen as a test of the pupils' ability too. And that's where one head teacher got into trouble. The crime? The head wished pupils well, offered support and checked that everything was going well.Yup, you did read that correctly. While you'd be excused for thinking this was a head acting in a professional and caring manner, it was actually causing the children undue anxiety. Or at least so said the chief inspector of schools Amanda Spielman, who expressed concern about schools "inadvertently ratcheting up" stress levels. She added: "I was in a primary school not long ago and saw something that did concern me, where the head was going around clapping the Year 6 on the shoulder and saying 'Are you feeling OK about the tests, is everything going well for you?' "It was well meaning but maybe subliminally it was encouraging children to feel anxious."
MAY19	MPs must STOP the games over Brexit, EXPRESS COMMENT	THERESA MAY will this week unveil her final "big, bold offer" to MPs in what feels like one last attempt to get them to agree her deal to deliver Brexit.    This is more than just a gamble. The livelihoods of people in this country, the future of this great nation, respect for democracy and the fate of Brexit all hang on Mrs May's success or failure. So when MPs are presented with her revised proposals they need to look at them carefully and must do what is best for this country. However, if she fails to win over the doubters and get enough support in the Commons, then there must be a change of direction. First of all, it is clear from our poll today that voters want a real Brexiteer on the negotiating team and hanker for Nigel Farage to be given a chance to lock horns with Brussels.
MAY19	We need a unique touch to bring our high streets back, says SIR JOHN HAYES	AS I GREW up on a council estate in south-east London, my mother, like so many others, spent the housekeeping at the local parade of shops. Mrs Baines, the chemist, was a valued source of advice on ailments while Mr Alexander, the grocer, looked after his customers because he knew that if he did so they would be back.    How different from what you see in such places now. At best, you might find a burger bar, a bookmaker and a pound shop where the family butcher or greengrocer once epitomised skill, service and quality. It is not just our high streets that lack originality. The places we live are going the same way. Housing estates look the same in every part of Britain and supermarkets have replaced local shops and markets. When Napoleon called us a "nation of shopkeepers", doubtless he had in mind the family grocers, butchers and bakers that once adorned our isles. Now, sadly, they are too often replaced by monolithic superstores or high streets dominated by souless supermarkets. Rather than the result of individual choice, dull uniformity is actually the consequence of market failure.

MAY20	Will politicians get the message about Euro poll? EXPRESS COMMENT	WHAT a pointless charade the European elections will be this week.    Yes, the ballot gives those who feel betrayed over Brexit a voice for their anger and, yes, Remainers who refuse to accept the verdict of the majority can pretend they are re-running the 2016 referendum. But we should not still be in the EU, and any opinion poll could equally tell the politicians they are out of touch. Still they continue to pontificate as if their opinions matter. They don't. They are in power to represent us, not themselves, and yet, whether on the Left or the Right, MPs refuse to back a deal, then blame Theresa May for not securing one.
MAY20	If politicians ignore voters don't be surprised by what comes next, says STEPHEN POLLARD	UNLESS the polls are seismically wrong, the Brexit Party is going to dominate Thursday's Euro elections. The latest polls have it on 35 percent, with Labour on just 15 percent and the Conservatives on a dire nine. Most obviously, a huge number of us feel betrayed by the Government's utter failure to deliver the Brexit for which we voted in June 2016. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

MAY21	The Great British public will be the real losers of the EU referendum	IRRESPECTIVE of who wins the EU referendum there will be one big loser: the British public.   GETTY It is the most important decision facing us in generations. Yet the process has descended into a farce with politicians on both sides of the debate making increasingly spurious, apocalyptic claims about our future. 
MAY21	Time to shake off this violent political craze – EXPRESS COMMENT	THE political mood of the country is fraught. Canvassing for the Euro elections has become hazardous and shamefully, the new craze for milkshakes to be thrown at politicians is becoming entrenched. Yesterday, in Newcastle, Nigel Farage was the latest to be targeted.    Let us not be in doubt. No responsible person should encourage this political violence. It might seem amusing when directed at opponents, but it should be deplored, because unchecked, it will escalate and become a fixture across the political arena.
MAY21	Kate Middleton is right to show her children the delights of gardening, says VANESSA FELTZ	As I write this I’m poised, in flowing floral chiffon, to pop off to preview day at the Chelsea Flower Show. I adore it.    Like most ladies of a certain age I have succumbed body and soul to the gardening bug. I dream about tradescantia, polish my geum, wrestle with seven different varieties of rampant clematis and insist that visitors inhale the aroma of my flowering jasmine. 
MAY21	The lesson from Australia – don’t rule out the quiet majority, says DOMINIC MIDGLEY	THE late US president Richard Nixon called them the "silent majority". Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister who on Saturday pulled off a miraculous win in that country's general election, refers to them as "quiet Australians". But they both meant the same thing: the large number of voters who feel disrespected and ignored by the elites who run the country.    In the weeks and months leading up to polling day Down Under, all the opinion polls indicated that Mr Morrison's conservative coalition government was set to be given a hiding by the opposition Labor party. But in the secrecy of the voting booths, the silent majority found their voice. And yesterday afternoon, the alliance between the Liberal Party and the National Party was on the brink of passing the threshold of 77 seats that would give them a majority in the House of Representatives. It is a stunning victory that has some stark lessons for the leaders of our own political parties. Not least the dangers of forgetting the primary concerns of ordinary working people.
MAY21	Will politicians get the message about Euro poll? EXPRESS COMMENT	WHAT a pointless charade the European elections will be this week.    Yes, the ballot gives those who feel betrayed over Brexit a voice for their anger and, yes, Remainers who refuse to accept the verdict of the majority can pretend they are re-running the 2016 referendum. But we should not still be in the EU, and any opinion poll could equally tell the politicians they are out of touch. Still they continue to pontificate as if their opinions matter. They don't. They are in power to represent us, not themselves, and yet, whether on the Left or the Right, MPs refuse to back a deal, then blame Theresa May for not securing one.
MAY21	If politicians ignore voters don't be surprised by what comes next, says STEPHEN POLLARD	UNLESS the polls are seismically wrong, the Brexit Party is going to dominate Thursday's Euro elections. The latest polls have it on 35 percent, with Labour on just 15 percent and the Conservatives on a dire nine. Most obviously, a huge number of us feel betrayed by the Government's utter failure to deliver the Brexit for which we voted in June 2016. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAY21	Don't laugh, there's a real lesson here.. says NICK FERRARI	MANY of you reading this won't need telling that last week saw most primary school children taking their SATs tests. These are exams in English and maths, and are currently taken at the end of Year 2 and Year 6, although the Government has agreed they are to be scrapped for seven-year-olds.    They are supposed to be a measure of the performance of the school and its teaching practices but they have been allowed to be seen as a test of the pupils' ability too. And that's where one head teacher got into trouble. The crime? The head wished pupils well, offered support and checked that everything was going well.Yup, you did read that correctly. While you'd be excused for thinking this was a head acting in a professional and caring manner, it was actually causing the children undue anxiety. Or at least so said the chief inspector of schools Amanda Spielman, who expressed concern about schools "inadvertently ratcheting up" stress levels. She added: "I was in a primary school not long ago and saw something that did concern me, where the head was going around clapping the Year 6 on the shoulder and saying 'Are you feeling OK about the tests, is everything going well for you?' "It was well meaning but maybe subliminally it was encouraging children to feel anxious."
MAY21	MPs must STOP the games over Brexit, EXPRESS COMMENT	THERESA MAY will this week unveil her final "big, bold offer" to MPs in what feels like one last attempt to get them to agree her deal to deliver Brexit.    This is more than just a gamble. The livelihoods of people in this country, the future of this great nation, respect for democracy and the fate of Brexit all hang on Mrs May's success or failure. So when MPs are presented with her revised proposals they need to look at them carefully and must do what is best for this country. However, if she fails to win over the doubters and get enough support in the Commons, then there must be a change of direction. First of all, it is clear from our poll today that voters want a real Brexiteer on the negotiating team and hanker for Nigel Farage to be given a chance to lock horns with Brussels.
MAY21	We need a unique touch to bring our high streets back, says SIR JOHN HAYES	AS I GREW up on a council estate in south-east London, my mother, like so many others, spent the housekeeping at the local parade of shops. Mrs Baines, the chemist, was a valued source of advice on ailments while Mr Alexander, the grocer, looked after his customers because he knew that if he did so they would be back.    How different from what you see in such places now. At best, you might find a burger bar, a bookmaker and a pound shop where the family butcher or greengrocer once epitomised skill, service and quality. It is not just our high streets that lack originality. The places we live are going the same way. Housing estates look the same in every part of Britain and supermarkets have replaced local shops and markets. When Napoleon called us a "nation of shopkeepers", doubtless he had in mind the family grocers, butchers and bakers that once adorned our isles. Now, sadly, they are too often replaced by monolithic superstores or high streets dominated by souless supermarkets. Rather than the result of individual choice, dull uniformity is actually the consequence of market failure.
MAY21	Inside Politics: Tories must adapt or die	NIGEL Farage is a week away from an electoral triumph that is already forcing Tory MPs to question whether their party can adapt or die. When the results of Thursday's Euro elections are declared next Sunday night, his Brexit Party is almost certain to be the winner. For Theresa May's troops, electoral annihilation looms.    An average of four opinion polls yesterday gave the Tories an expected 12 per cent share of the vote in the contest for seats in the European Parliament forced on the country by her failure to deliver Brexit on schedule. A defeat of that size would be the worst Tory result in a national election since the Prime Minister's political idol Sir Robert Peel founded the modern Conservative Party in 1834. "Our party is quite simply dying," one former Tory minister told me this week. "Breaking our promise to leave the EU on March 29 has been catastrophic. Remainers blame us for Brexit and Leavers hate us for not delivering Brexit. We are not offering anything to anyone."
MAY22	Desperate May heads for a fall on her Brexit deal - EXPRESS COMMENT	IF YOU heard a giant crash yesterday afternoon, that was the sound of Theresa May throwing the kitchen sink in her last-ditch efforts to secure a Brexit deal. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAY22	A simple solution is beyond politicians – we voted out, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	THEY just don't get it, do they? Politicians tell us they want to remain in the EU. They seem to forget that was the question three years ago, not now. The nation said leave.    Next they tell us nobody realised how complicated it all is. Actually, it is pretty simple. The complications have arisen because Theresa May has made a consistent mess of it all. We did not have to join and we do not have to stay and it is no more difficult than that. Then they bleat that the future is uncertain outside the EU. The future is always uncertain and will be both inside or outside the EU but what we can say with certainty is that the prospects are very bright outside.
MAY22	This thuggish behaviour has no part to play in national politics, says TIM NEWARK	WE can all agree to disagree, but when did it become okay to assault politicians in the street? Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage drenched in a milkshake hurled at him is emblematic of a coarsening of politics in this country that cannot end well. Assaulting politicians is the slippery slope towards tyranny because it creates a climate of fear in which only extremism can flourish.    Everyone is entitled to their view in a democracy and if I see someone demonstrating about an issue I disagree with, I walk on past. I don't suddenly fling myself at them shouting vile abuse and yet this is beginning to happen every day on the streets of Britain. It's not the exclusive preserve of any one party as all sides have their fanatics who think that their strongly held views entitles them to break the bounds of normal behaviour. But it is particularly shocking when it is vented not on professional politicians, who are used to the rough and tumble of debate to a certain extent, but ordinary people who perhaps are stepping out for the first time to help campaign for a cause they believe in.
MAY22	The Great British public will be the real losers of the EU referendum	IRRESPECTIVE of who wins the EU referendum there will be one big loser: the British public.   GETTY It is the most important decision facing us in generations. Yet the process has descended into a farce with politicians on both sides of the debate making increasingly spurious, apocalyptic claims about our future.

MAY23	The Brexit Party is the real force for change in the UK, says LEO McKINSTRY	TWO events, two very different outcomes. On Tuesday, with polling in the European elections less than 48 hours away, the Brexit Party held an electrifying rally at Kensington Olympia in west London. Fizzing with excitement and energy, the vast hall was packed with 3,000 supporters, many of whom had queued for hours to get in.    The cheers of the eager crowd echoed throughout the arena as typically compelling speeches were given by the Daily Express's own Ann Widdicombe, now a Brexit candidate, and the party leader Nigel Farage, who vowed "to bring true democracy back to our country". The contrast with a much- hyped Change UK rally in the West Country last week could hardly be greater. Held at the cricket pavilion in the city of Bath, it had just 32 seats in the venue. Yet many of them were unoccupied at the start, while the media outnumbered supporters. The miserable atmosphere was captured by one journalist from a Left-wing newspaper, who wrote that "it was excruciating, like intruding on private grief".
MAY23	TV cooks should stay away from running restaurants, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	SO, to the latest Jamie Oliver restaurant to see what's on the menu. Only kidding! Jamie may have done some sterling work in the Battle of the Turkey Twizzler and he very bravely accessed his inner big girl's blouse by weeping openly on prime-time television when the Americans refused to listen to his diet advice, but when it came to pulling in the punters, his was a soufflé that finally collapsed.    Jamie's restaurant chain is going out of business and of course, you feel sorry for the people who will be losing their jobs. But of Jamie himself, what did he expect? Something very odd happens to cooks once you point a camera in their direction. Nigella Lawson makes food preparation look like something that should only take place between consenting adults and then only after the watershed. Marco Pierre White and Gordon Ramsay both look as if they're out on day release and Heston Blumenthal gives every impression of being a mad scientist.

Long elevated to the eminence of a national deity, it cannot be criticised and the only permissible response by anyone dependent on the public vote to its interminable problems is "More money". Meaning taxpayer money.    But let's go back to the origins of the NHS. It was founded by Labour minister Nye Bevan under Clement Attlee in 1948. Bevan was no Right-winger. On the contrary he was of the hard Left. Yet what did he write about his creation which became a template for the world? He said very plainly that he saw it as a safety net for those who simply could not afford private health cover.

We will not know the result of yesterday's European elections until Sunday but it is predicted that Nigel Farage's Brexit Party will be the clear winner. It is now just a question of by how much.

MAY25	Theresa May's tears made me cry too... for a minute, says CAROLE MALONE	I THOUGHT it would feel better than it did. I thought watching Theresa May walk out of No 10 towards that podium knowing the "resignation" word would finally be coming out of her mouth would make me feel happy, triumphant even.    But it didn't. I just saw a woman with tired eyes who knew this speech was in essence about her abject failure at being PM, desperately trying to hold it together. And failing. So yes, when she cried I did too. And while this shouldn't have been the case, I have no doubt I felt so sad because it was another woman standing up there who, as much as she wanted to, couldn't hide her emotions. All I could think as, weeping, she turned her hunched shoulders and hurried back into No 10, was that it should never have come to this. She could, and would, have saved herself that humiliation had she gone earlier.

Theresa May tried. Boy, she tried. If anything she was guilty of trying too hard.When Mrs May delivered her highly dignified speech calling time on her premiership, we discovered the true person.

Jamie may have done some sterling work in the Battle of the Turkey Twizzler and he very bravely accessed his inner big girl's blouse by weeping openly on prime-time television when the Americans refused to listen to his diet advice, but when it came to pulling in the punters, his was a soufflé that finally collapsed.    Jamie's restaurant chain is going out of business and of course, you feel sorry for the people who will be losing their jobs. But of Jamie himself, what did he expect? Something very odd happens to cooks once you point a camera in their direction. Nigella Lawson makes food preparation look like something that should only take place between consenting adults and then only after the watershed. Marco Pierre White and Gordon Ramsay both look as if they're out on day release and Heston Blumenthal gives every impression of being a mad scientist. 
MAY25	Desperate May heads for a fall on her Brexit deal - EXPRESS COMMENT	IF YOU heard a giant crash yesterday afternoon, that was the sound of Theresa May throwing the kitchen sink in her last-ditch efforts to secure a Brexit deal. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

MAY26	Theresa May needed to be tough, not stubborn, says NICK FERRARI	SUDDENLY, she became human. A woman who, more often than not, has spoken as an automaton, danced like a Dalek, simply couldn't read the mood of the room and seemed totally unable to empathise with anyone, displayed actual emotion.    Theresa May's voice crackled like a high-intensity power line in a gale and her eyes filled with tears as she named the date for her departure. It was, as friends and foes were quick to accept, "dignified". While that assessment is absolutely correct, tellingly what gave it that level of dignity was her performance until this point.
MAY26	Boris Johnson: Conservatives want a LEADER, not a priest	THERESA MAY famously promised to bring "strong and stable" rule to Britain. But instead, her time in Downing Street ended in tears and turmoil. Departing, she leaves the legacy of a Government in paralysed crisis, MPs in continuous rebellion and a party in the grip of record-breaking unpopularity.    Meanwhile, the task of delivering Brexit, which was meant to be the guiding mission of the Conservatives, remains hopelessly unresolved after months of acrimony and stalemate. Indeed, it was this failure which put rocket fuel into the surge of Nigel Farage's Brexit party, which is expected to annihilate the Tories when the results of the European elections are declared tonight. So deep is the current mess, there have been claims the Tories, for so long the dominant force in British politics, are finished. According to these doom merchants, what we now witness in the frenzied preparations for a leadership contest are the death throes of a once great movement.
MAY26	General election disaster brought down Mrs May, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT WAS the ultimate irony of Theresa May's time as Prime Minister that it took her resignation speech to show us the passion and emotions that have been buried throughout her political career.    Dubbed the MayBot after her robotic approach to interviews, it was only as she broke down delivering her final words, saying it was the honour of her life to serve the country she loved, that she showed what makes her tick. That speech brings us full circle from her first words as PM in July 2016, when she appeared to have made the perfect start. Her speech back then was exactly what was needed as she promised to fight "burning injustice".
MAY26	Brexiteer leader must put Farage on EU team - EXPRESS COMMENT	THERESA MAY'S departure is a bigger moment than merely signalling a change of occupant at 10 Downing Street. In effect Mrs May was accepting defeat for the efforts to find a compromise on Brexit and that means that a wholly new approach must now be taken by her successor.    So it goes without saying that the new leader, emerging from the large array of candidates, must be a Brexiteer with a clear policy to leave the EU on October 31. Priti Patel, who has a wealth of experience in both the Referendum Party and Conservative Party, is right to warn today that the "sense of betrayal runs deep" among voters and that they may abandon the Tories. The result of the European elections is likely to prove her point.
MAY26	Politicians have failed the public, says PRITI PATEL	The European elections should never have happened. Britons voted to leave the EU in record numbers and they expected Brexit by now. Instead we now witness the ghoulish spectacle of the public expressing their disgust at the political class and sending a message to the Conservative Party that it must change or die.    Not only is the party set to have its worst result in a nationwide poll in its 180-year history but we find ourselves competing with minority parties.
MAY26	Brexit Party needs to be strong for Brexit to happen, says NIGEL FARAGE	THE results of the European elections won’t be known until late tonight. The polls suggest that the Brexit Party has done quite well. But one result is already clear. The battle for Brexit has brought down a second Conservative prime minister.  Theresa May, like David Cameron (remember him?) before her, lost power because she could not deliver the Brexit backed by 17.4 million Leave voters.
MAY26	Theresa May's tears made me cry too... for a minute, says CAROLE MALONE	I THOUGHT it would feel better than it did. I thought watching Theresa May walk out of No 10 towards that podium knowing the "resignation" word would finally be coming out of her mouth would make me feel happy, triumphant even.    But it didn't. I just saw a woman with tired eyes who knew this speech was in essence about her abject failure at being PM, desperately trying to hold it together. And failing. So yes, when she cried I did too. And while this shouldn't have been the case, I have no doubt I felt so sad because it was another woman standing up there who, as much as she wanted to, couldn't hide her emotions. All I could think as, weeping, she turned her hunched shoulders and hurried back into No 10, was that it should never have come to this. She could, and would, have saved herself that humiliation had she gone earlier.

MAY26	The next PM must share May's love of country and deliver Brexit, EXPRESS COMMENT	Related articles    The endless prevarication and debate, posturing, the machinations of government that has exposed the very weakness of our political system, an inability to compromise and work in the best interests of all our people. Theresa May tried. Boy, she tried. If anything she was guilty of trying too hard.When Mrs May delivered her highly dignified speech calling time on her premiership, we discovered the true person. She held herself together until the fateful words about her "enormous and enduring gratitude for the opportunity to serve the country I love". And then she broke down.
MAY27	Number 10 contenders must learn from Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	AS the results of the European elections began to trickle in last night, it seemed likely that - as expected - there would be only one real winner: Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.    And we must hope that the lessons of its extraordinary success from a standing start just four months before election day are not lost on the growing pool of contenders for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Under Prime Minister Theresa May, Leave voters spent months watching in mounting horror as our EU negotiators were blocked at every turn in Brussels before eventually cobbling together a deal that was repeatedly skewered by the Irish backstop. MPs wrestled with increasingly contrived options, with exotic names such as "Common Market 2.0" and the "Malthouse Compromise", only to fail to summon up a majority for any of them.
MAY27	Leadership contest offers new hope for meaningful Brexit, says LEO McKINSTRY	ELECTIONS are the lifeblood of democracy and only faceless bureaucrats and power-mad dictators loathe them. So any responsible country or party should want its politicians to be held accountable at the ballot box. That is why the forthcoming Tory leadership contest is so welcome.    After months of depressing gridlock at Westminster, it will reinvigorate the political system, put the Government on a different course, and, above all, breathe life into the moribund Brexit process. But that is not the way the cynics see it. They argue that the contest will only deepen the current political crisis by fuelling prolonged internal strife in the shattered Conservative party. According to their gloomy narrative, the contest will be an exercise in self-indulgence, causing yet more paralysis in Parliament andWhitehall. But such claims are wrong-headed as far from being a distraction, the contest is the best vehicle for the recovery of the Government's fortunes and the prospects for Brexit.

MAY28	EU results are a wake-up call to get on with Brexit – EXPRESS COMMENT	The results of the Euro elections are a stunning and resounding wake-up call to the Westminster politicians who have squandered opportunity after opportunity to carry out the wishes of the people and leave the EU.    Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party have emerged with the biggest mandate from the nation for his uncompromising approach demanding withdrawal. His party did not even exist four months ago but look at it now. The other parties, who have dithered and squabbled, were hammered by the electorate with the Tory party and Labour the biggest losers. It may stiffen the resolve among Tory contenders for the leadership who will have to show who will actually deliver and even the pusillanimous Jeremy Corbyn will have to respond.
MAY28	Labour’s Euro vote disaster can mean only one thing: Corbyn must go, says DOMINIC MIDGELY	THE psychodrama over the Tory Party's relationship with its soon-to-be former prime minister over the past few months has meant that an equally hapless leader has avoided the sort of scrutiny he deserves: Jeremy Corbyn.    Voted in by a landslide mostly consisting of millennial party members who tend to be passionately pro-EU, the Labour Party leader has spent the past three and a half years facing both ways on the question that preoccupies them most. He has got away with it up till now because the Tories have been in such disarray that they have made the Labour high command look a model of stability in comparison. But his party's disastrous showing in the European elections has exposed the extent of the membership's disillusionment with its leader. It won just 15 percent of the vote, ending up with only 10 seats – half the number it won five years ago – and finished third behind the LibDems.

MAY29	We need a leader who can unite our fractured nation, says TIM NEWARK	TRADITIONAL politics is in disarray and our country is desperate for decisive leadership. Both main parties are in crisis, unable to deliver on the biggest democratic mandate in our history. Our next prime minister is crucial to defining our future as a major power. That person will need to reach out to parts of the electorate that may not usually vote for their party.    They need to inspire those disappointed voters who have given up on the democratic process. They need to bring the country back together but that does not mean trying to please everyone all the time. Theresa May tried to force through a Brexit compromise that would satisfy Remainers. Jeremy Corbyn tried to appeal to Remainers in the south and Leavers in the north. Clearly, that is impossible and both parties haemorrhaged votes. Our next prime minister should not be afraid to back the winners of the 2016 referendum. After all, they are the majority of the electorate and the EU elections only reinforced the reality that a clear majority of them back a no-nonsense Brexit.

MAY30	No love lost in this Tory melodrama, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	THE line-up for the latest series of Love Island has been announced: as always the contestants are groomed, tanned, glossy and manicured to within an inch of their lives and that's just the men.    Meanwhile, in other news, the round-up of contestants on Absolutely No Love Lost Whatsoever, aka the race to Downing Street, continues to grow. At the time of writing it stands at 11, many not even household names in their own home, but may well have doubled by the time you read this. So here's a tongue-in-cheek look at the five top runners baring their souls but mercifully little else, in the battle for Number 10.
MAY30	Tory leadership race ends policy drought - EXPRESS COMMENT	THANK goodness the Conservative Party leadership race has started to end the drought of decent policy ideas.    Esther McVey may not be a frontrunner but she has made a positive start to her campaign by announcing plans for a military covenant for the police plus £4billion to raise education standards. She is right to focus on these issues as the next prime minister has two monumental tasks - first to deliver Brexit and then to provide a vision for post-Brexit Britain. In terms of the ideas on the police, they reflect the rising pressure our forces are under in tackling crime, the knife epidemic blighting our streets and rise in cybercrime.
MAY30	Jeremy Corbyn has allowed vile anti-Semitism to fester and grow, says LEO McKINSTRY	LABOUR likes to present itself as a political force against intolerance and discrimination. The fight against racism is meant to be central to its purpose. But such claims are no longer sustainable. Under Jeremy Corbyn's toxic leadership, the party is drowning in a swamp of anti-Semitism. Labour is in the grip of a narrow Marxist sect that has enabled vile anti-Jewish prejudice to flourish in its ranks.    This week the party had to pay the price for the poisonous culture generated by the Corbyn mob, as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced that it is to launch a statutory inquiry into Labour's handling of a torrent of anti-Semitism allegations. In recent history, only one political organisation has previously been the target of a full EHRC investigation and that was Nick Griffin's notorious far-Right British National Party. For Labour now to be bracketed with such extremists is a dramatic indicator of how low the party has sunk under Corbyn.
MAY30	ESTHER McVEY unveils her Blue Collar blueprint to boost our Thin Blue Line	THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY needs to reconnect with those voters we lost in droves at the European elections, and also attract those who share our values but don't vote for us. That is why I have launched Blue Collar Conservatism and made it a key theme of my leadership bid.    Esther McVey [Stefan Rousseau/PA]

Voted in by a landslide mostly consisting of millennial party members who tend to be passionately pro-EU, the Labour Party leader has spent the past three and a half years facing both ways on the question that preoccupies them most. He has got away with it up till now because the Tories have been in such disarray that they have made the Labour high command look a model of stability in comparison. But his party's disastrous showing in the European elections has exposed the extent of the membership's disillusionment with its leader. It won just 15 percent of the vote, ending up with only 10 seats – half the number it won five years ago – and finished third behind the LibDems.
MAY30	Number 10 contenders must learn from Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	AS the results of the European elections began to trickle in last night, it seemed likely that - as expected - there would be only one real winner: Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.    And we must hope that the lessons of its extraordinary success from a standing start just four months before election day are not lost on the growing pool of contenders for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Under Prime Minister Theresa May, Leave voters spent months watching in mounting horror as our EU negotiators were blocked at every turn in Brussels before eventually cobbling together a deal that was repeatedly skewered by the Irish backstop. MPs wrestled with increasingly contrived options, with exotic names such as "Common Market 2.0" and the "Malthouse Compromise", only to fail to summon up a majority for any of them.
MAY30	Leadership contest offers new hope for meaningful Brexit, says LEO McKINSTRY	ELECTIONS are the lifeblood of democracy and only faceless bureaucrats and power-mad dictators loathe them. So any responsible country or party should want its politicians to be held accountable at the ballot box. That is why the forthcoming Tory leadership contest is so welcome.    After months of depressing gridlock at Westminster, it will reinvigorate the political system, put the Government on a different course, and, above all, breathe life into the moribund Brexit process. But that is not the way the cynics see it. They argue that the contest will only deepen the current political crisis by fuelling prolonged internal strife in the shattered Conservative party. According to their gloomy narrative, the contest will be an exercise in self-indulgence, causing yet more paralysis in Parliament andWhitehall. But such claims are wrong-headed as far from being a distraction, the contest is the best vehicle for the recovery of the Government's fortunes and the prospects for Brexit.
MAY31	It’s time to delve into your history books, Mr Cleese, says DOMINIC MIDGELY	When Julius Caesar anchored his fleet off the South Coastal what is now Deal in 55BC, Britain was a land of dirty and smelly Iron Age primitives who worshipped Celtic pagan gods. By the time the Romans left in 410Ad, there was a town called Londinium where people spoke latin, wore togas, watched chariot races – and took baths.    In the centuries between then and now the capital has changed hands numerous times, as first the saxons, then the Vikings and ultimately the Normans barged in and commandeered the levers of power.
MAY31	Patronising Barnier is good reason to quit EU - EXPRESS COMMENT	Once again Michel Barnier, the overpaid condescending official in charge of negotiating Brexit on behalf of the EU, has reminded us why we want to end Brussels rule in this country once and for all.    The Frenchman’s patronising description of Britain as a country that lives in the past and doesn’t want to abide by the rules is not only insulting but inaccurate.
MAY31	No love lost in this Tory melodrama, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	THE line-up for the latest series of Love Island has been announced: as always the contestants are groomed, tanned, glossy and manicured to within an inch of their lives and that's just the men.    Meanwhile, in other news, the round-up of contestants on Absolutely No Love Lost Whatsoever, aka the race to Downing Street, continues to grow. At the time of writing it stands at 11, many not even household names in their own home, but may well have doubled by the time you read this. So here's a tongue-in-cheek look at the five top runners baring their souls but mercifully little else, in the battle for Number 10.
MAY31	Tory leadership race ends policy drought - EXPRESS COMMENT	THANK goodness the Conservative Party leadership race has started to end the drought of decent policy ideas.    Esther McVey may not be a frontrunner but she has made a positive start to her campaign by announcing plans for a military covenant for the police plus £4billion to raise education standards. She is right to focus on these issues as the next prime minister has two monumental tasks - first to deliver Brexit and then to provide a vision for post-Brexit Britain. In terms of the ideas on the police, they reflect the rising pressure our forces are under in tackling crime, the knife epidemic blighting our streets and rise in cybercrime.
MAY31	Jeremy Corbyn has allowed vile anti-Semitism to fester and grow, says LEO McKINSTRY	LABOUR likes to present itself as a political force against intolerance and discrimination. The fight against racism is meant to be central to its purpose. But such claims are no longer sustainable. Under Jeremy Corbyn's toxic leadership, the party is drowning in a swamp of anti-Semitism. Labour is in the grip of a narrow Marxist sect that has enabled vile anti-Jewish prejudice to flourish in its ranks.    This week the party had to pay the price for the poisonous culture generated by the Corbyn mob, as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced that it is to launch a statutory inquiry into Labour's handling of a torrent of anti-Semitism allegations. In recent history, only one political organisation has previously been the target of a full EHRC investigation and that was Nick Griffin's notorious far-Right British National Party. For Labour now to be bracketed with such extremists is a dramatic indicator of how low the party has sunk under Corbyn.
MAY31	ESTHER McVEY unveils her Blue Collar blueprint to boost our Thin Blue Line	THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY needs to reconnect with those voters we lost in droves at the European elections, and also attract those who share our values but don't vote for us. That is why I have launched Blue Collar Conservatism and made it a key theme of my leadership bid.    Esther McVey [Stefan Rousseau/PA]
MAY31	Will these bitter losers never learn? asks ANN WIDDECOMBE. The Brexit Party won	THE map is a sea of Brexit turquoise following the Euro elections. Naturally, the other parties are full of excuses. If you add up the Green and Lib Dem votes then they claim the Remain vote wins. It is a dishonest argument borne of desperation at yet again losing the argument. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
MAY31	We need a leader who can unite our fractured nation, says TIM NEWARK	TRADITIONAL politics is in disarray and our country is desperate for decisive leadership. Both main parties are in crisis, unable to deliver on the biggest democratic mandate in our history. Our next prime minister is crucial to defining our future as a major power. That person will need to reach out to parts of the electorate that may not usually vote for their party.    They need to inspire those disappointed voters who have given up on the democratic process. They need to bring the country back together but that does not mean trying to please everyone all the time. Theresa May tried to force through a Brexit compromise that would satisfy Remainers. Jeremy Corbyn tried to appeal to Remainers in the south and Leavers in the north. Clearly, that is impossible and both parties haemorrhaged votes. Our next prime minister should not be afraid to back the winners of the 2016 referendum. After all, they are the majority of the electorate and the EU elections only reinforced the reality that a clear majority of them back a no-nonsense Brexit.
MAY31	EU results are a wake-up call to get on with Brexit – EXPRESS COMMENT	The results of the Euro elections are a stunning and resounding wake-up call to the Westminster politicians who have squandered opportunity after opportunity to carry out the wishes of the people and leave the EU.    Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party have emerged with the biggest mandate from the nation for his uncompromising approach demanding withdrawal. His party did not even exist four months ago but look at it now. The other parties, who have dithered and squabbled, were hammered by the electorate with the Tory party and Labour the biggest losers. It may stiffen the resolve among Tory contenders for the leadership who will have to show who will actually deliver and even the pusillanimous Jeremy Corbyn will have to respond.
MAY31	Labour’s Euro vote disaster can mean only one thing: Corbyn must go, says DOMINIC MIDGELY	THE psychodrama over the Tory Party's relationship with its soon-to-be former prime minister over the past few months has meant that an equally hapless leader has avoided the sort of scrutiny he deserves: Jeremy Corbyn.

JUN1	Inside politics: Boris Johnson is playing a waiting game	BORIS Johnson is keeping his powder dry as the Tory phoney war rages. With slick campaign films, wobbly mobile phone video chats and other social media gimmickry, his rivals in the race to succeed Theresa May charged into the online battle this week.    So far, the former foreign secretary and frontrunner for the job has been absent from the fray. Supporters of Mr Johnson's bid for the Tory crown think their candidate is wise to keep a low profile in the opening skirmishes."It's far too early to start sounding off," one backer told me. "There has been a lot of noise, but no one is really listening." When MPs return from their Whitsun break on Monday, the contest to win over the hearts and minds will begin for real. While the social media air war has been fought to gain the attention of Tory members and the wider public, it is the 313-strong electorate of the party's MPs that will be crucial to picking the next leader and prime minister. Mr Johnson is already way ahead of his rivals in terms of support among the Tory grassroots and public recognition.
JUN1	Frumpy old fashion is not so nice, says RICHARD AND JUDY	HURRAY! In just three weeks and two days it's midsummer's day, though my husband's having none of it.To him the summer solstice is, was, and forever will be on June 21, even though Google swears that this year it will be June 24.    Whatever. It's the happiest day of Richard's year because he's a sun bunny, loves light, heat and lying on a lounger until he's the colour of burnt toast (sorry dear, I mean golden honey). I love summer too, especially floaty frocks and holidays. We're shortly off to France where nubile young women will congregate on the Côte d'Azur, all golden flesh, long, beach-tangled hair and, when they're not in bikinis, will throng the beach cafés in gorgeous drifting sun-frocks, feminine and sexy, revealing long tanned arms, slender shoulders and those ever-discreet French cleavages. But what on earth has happened to summer fashion here in the UK? In every magazine, pretty young women are trussing themselves up like Amish grannies. From Zara to Erdem, Harvey Nick's to Rixo, the shops are full of calf-length high-necked dresses, like those awful pie-crust collar Laura Ashley frocks we used to wear in the 70s.
JUN1	Trump could boost rising influence of Nigel Farage, EXPRESS COMMENT	DOWNING Street has every reason to fear a meeting between President Trump and Nigel Farage next week. A photograph of the billionaire president with his arm around the leader of the Brexit Party could become the defining image of this controversial state visit.    Mr Farage's party hopes to win its first MP in Thursday's Peterborough by-election - a victory that would cause dismay in Labour and Tory ranks. Mr Trump's embrace of this arch-Brexiteer would be further proof that he is one of the most influential figures in our country's politics. The Brexit Party staged an electoral earthquake when it came first in the European Parliament contest, well ahead of third-place finishers Labour and the Conservatives, who limped in fifth.
JUN1	Not delivering Brexit is the one reason for all this chaos, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IF last month's European election taught us one thing, it was that nothing in politics should ever be taken for granted. The Brexit Party, which didn't even exist a few months ago, topped the poll with 31.6 percent. But if that result was seismic, yesterday's YouGov poll makes it look almost staid.    In the 2015 general election, the Lib Dems scraped together just 7.9 percent of the vote. In 2017 they did even worse, managing just 7.4 percent. Voters had clearly decided never to trust the Lib Dems again after their volte face on student fees as part of the coalition government. But "never" is a word which should not be used in politics. The Lib Dems have not so much risen, phoenix-like, from the ashes as leapt clear of the pyre. Of voters, 24 percent now say they would vote Lib Dem if there was an election - more than three times as many people as voted Lib Dem in 2017. And if that wasn't enough of a political transformation, the Brexit Party is second, with 22 percent. For the first time since polling began, neither Labour nor the Conservatives are in the top two. Both managed just 19 percent.
JUN1	Don't worry Boris, we'll back you, says CAROLE MALONE	SO Boris Johnson is being taken to court by some two-bob activist who claims that Bojo lied and misled the British public about how much money we give the EU every week.    You'd have thought a smart judge would have taken one look at Remain zealot Marcus Ball and seen that his rabid desire for "justice" is in fact a politically motivated plot to subvert Brexit. And if you're looking for lies, exaggerations and half-truths peddled during AND after the referendum campaign, what about those corkers from the Remain side - that Britain would be plunged into an immediate recession after a Leave vote, that house prices would rocket, mortgages would be more expensive, the City would collapse, jobs would be lost. Oh yes, and there was the little matter of us being catapulted into World War Three. So presumably after Boris, Ball will be going after Philip Hammond, Mark Carney, George Osborne, David Cameron and a whole lot more - all of whom peddled Project Fear with a vengeance.

JUN2	It's the lunacy that Labour must expel, says NICK FERRARI	THEY HAVE pulled off "Mission Impossible". After a national election that saw the Conservative party slump to the worst performance in a near 200-year history, the clueless dolts who run the Labour party ensured they were able to divert attention away from the tottering Tories and instead focus on the way their party was acting, as if it were in a frenzy of Pol Pot-style ethnic cleansing.    This was the perfect moment for Labour to seize on the entirely predictable failures of the Conservatives and highlight their inadequacies. Instead, they managed to shoot themselves... in both feet. And arms. It is nigh-on impossible to overstate the significance of the fact that Labour became only the second political party EVER to be referred to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the other being the loathsome BNP, over allegations of anti-Semitism. For month after month, year after year, Labour ignored what appears to be this growing and too frequently unchallenged problem. Due to calculated deafness or unlikely ignorance, Labour has staggered on through this self-inflicted crisis. The open goal to rightly attack the Tories closed. The moment was lost.
JUN2	Ignore the haters and welcome ally Trump - EXPRESS COMMENT	OVER the next few days you are going to be subjected to a stream of hate directed at the leader of the free world and Britain's best and closest ally.    Donald Trump's arrival for a state visit should be a cause for celebration due to our shared history, not least with the anniversary of D-Day on Thursday - when Britain and America ensured the safety of so many nations against Nazi tyranny. But instead, depressingly, the occasion is going to be used by Left-wing campaigners and many of our politicians to virtue-signal against what they perceive to be the ills of the current occupant of the White House. People who protest against him are often those linked to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's unpatriotic politics, which often takes the side of this country's enemies. Alternatively, it is Remainer politicians such as Speaker John Bercow, who has barred the President from addressing parliamentarians.

JUN3	Simple ways to defuse the dementia timebomb – EXPRESS COMMENT	DEMENTIA is cutting a swathe through our elderly population - it is the downside to the fact that we now have the science and medical expertise to help us live longer. But while we know the secrets to lengthen life, we don't know how to guarantee the quality of those longer lives. The clearest example of that is dementia.    It is society's timebomb. The number living with the condition in the UK is expected to rise to one million by 2021. That is a frightening figure but it is not inevitable. Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, has spelt out to the Daily Express how we could all help ourselves to avoid the illness with some simple lifestyle changes. They are hardly demanding. Among them are: don't smoke, don't overeat and don't drink too much. Some exercise can only do you good as well.
JUN3	Donald Trump: We should welcome US President – not support the daft protests against him	RARELY in modern times has the infantile Left been gripped by such excitement. A mood of thrilled anticipation is mounting among progressives at the prospect of protests against President Donald Trump's state visit to Britain this week.    The orgy of virtue-signalling will be led by the Stop Trump movement, which promises a "festival of resistance" tomorrow by more than a quarter of a million demonstrators to "bring London to a standstill". The plans for mass opposition on the streets are accompanied by a barrage of virulent condemnation of the US President. Typical of the self-righteous posturing was the outburst yesterday by the London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who compared Trump to the "fascists of the 20th century", claiming that he is a "threat" to "our hard-won rights and freedoms".

The Brexit Party staged an electoral earthquake when it came first in the European Parliament contest, well ahead of third-place finishers Labour and the Conservatives, who limped in fifth.
JUN3	Not delivering Brexit is the one reason for all this chaos, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IF last month's European election taught us one thing, it was that nothing in politics should ever be taken for granted. The Brexit Party, which didn't even exist a few months ago, topped the poll with 31.6 percent. But if that result was seismic, yesterday's YouGov poll makes it look almost staid.    In the 2015 general election, the Lib Dems scraped together just 7.9 percent of the vote. In 2017 they did even worse, managing just 7.4 percent. Voters had clearly decided never to trust the Lib Dems again after their volte face on student fees as part of the coalition government. But "never" is a word which should not be used in politics. The Lib Dems have not so much risen, phoenix-like, from the ashes as leapt clear of the pyre. Of voters, 24 percent now say they would vote Lib Dem if there was an election - more than three times as many people as voted Lib Dem in 2017. And if that wasn't enough of a political transformation, the Brexit Party is second, with 22 percent. For the first time since polling began, neither Labour nor the Conservatives are in the top two. Both managed just 19 percent.
JUN3	Don't worry Boris, we'll back you, says CAROLE MALONE	SO Boris Johnson is being taken to court by some two-bob activist who claims that Bojo lied and misled the British public about how much money we give the EU every week.    You'd have thought a smart judge would have taken one look at Remain zealot Marcus Ball and seen that his rabid desire for "justice" is in fact a politically motivated plot to subvert Brexit. And if you're looking for lies, exaggerations and half-truths peddled during AND after the referendum campaign, what about those corkers from the Remain side - that Britain would be plunged into an immediate recession after a Leave vote, that house prices would rocket, mortgages would be more expensive, the City would collapse, jobs would be lost. Oh yes, and there was the little matter of us being catapulted into World War Three. So presumably after Boris, Ball will be going after Philip Hammond, Mark Carney, George Osborne, David Cameron and a whole lot more - all of whom peddled Project Fear with a vengeance.
JUN4	Gay people don't need fixing or healing and it's wrong to say they do, says JULIE BINDEL	AT LEAST Ann Widdecombe has remained true to her convictions. When the newly elected Brexit MEP recently spoke with a journalist, she made it clear that she believes same sex attraction to be an aberration, saying: "The fact that we now think it is quite impossible for people to switch sexuality doesn't mean that science may not yet produce an answer at some stage."    Then again, perhaps it shouldn't have been too much of a surprise. The politician, columnist and staunch Catholic has, during her 23 years in parliament voted against every pro-gay piece of legislation, such as civil partnerships, the Equality Act, repealing Section 28. Some have interpreted Ann Widdecombe's remarks as moving dangerously close to what is known as "gay conversion therapy" usually carried out by fundamentalist Christians, where so-called counsellors attempt to "pray away the gay".
JUN4	Simple ways to defuse the dementia timebomb – EXPRESS COMMENT	DEMENTIA is cutting a swathe through our elderly population - it is the downside to the fact that we now have the science and medical expertise to help us live longer. But while we know the secrets to lengthen life, we don't know how to guarantee the quality of those longer lives. The clearest example of that is dementia.    It is society's timebomb. The number living with the condition in the UK is expected to rise to one million by 2021. That is a frightening figure but it is not inevitable. Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, has spelt out to the Daily Express how we could all help ourselves to avoid the illness with some simple lifestyle changes. They are hardly demanding. Among them are: don't smoke, don't overeat and don't drink too much. Some exercise can only do you good as well.
JUN4	Donald Trump: We should welcome US President – not support the daft protests against him	RARELY in modern times has the infantile Left been gripped by such excitement. A mood of thrilled anticipation is mounting among progressives at the prospect of protests against President Donald Trump's state visit to Britain this week.    The orgy of virtue-signalling will be led by the Stop Trump movement, which promises a "festival of resistance" tomorrow by more than a quarter of a million demonstrators to "bring London to a standstill". The plans for mass opposition on the streets are accompanied by a barrage of virulent condemnation of the US President. Typical of the self-righteous posturing was the outburst yesterday by the London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who compared Trump to the "fascists of the 20th century", claiming that he is a "threat" to "our hard-won rights and freedoms".
JUN4	It's the lunacy that Labour must expel, says NICK FERRARI	THEY HAVE pulled off "Mission Impossible". After a national election that saw the Conservative party slump to the worst performance in a near 200-year history, the clueless dolts who run the Labour party ensured they were able to divert attention away from the tottering Tories and instead focus on the way their party was acting, as if it were in a frenzy of Pol Pot-style ethnic cleansing.    This was the perfect moment for Labour to seize on the entirely predictable failures of the Conservatives and highlight their inadequacies. Instead, they managed to shoot themselves... in both feet. And arms. It is nigh-on impossible to overstate the significance of the fact that Labour became only the second political party EVER to be referred to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the other being the loathsome BNP, over allegations of anti-Semitism. For month after month, year after year, Labour ignored what appears to be this growing and too frequently unchallenged problem. Due to calculated deafness or unlikely ignorance, Labour has staggered on through this self-inflicted crisis. The open goal to rightly attack the Tories closed. The moment was lost.
JUN4	Ignore the haters and welcome ally Trump - EXPRESS COMMENT	OVER the next few days you are going to be subjected to a stream of hate directed at the leader of the free world and Britain's best and closest ally.    Donald Trump's arrival for a state visit should be a cause for celebration due to our shared history, not least with the anniversary of D-Day on Thursday - when Britain and America ensured the safety of so many nations against Nazi tyranny. But instead, depressingly, the occasion is going to be used by Left-wing campaigners and many of our politicians to virtue-signal against what they perceive to be the ills of the current occupant of the White House. People who protest against him are often those linked to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's unpatriotic politics, which often takes the side of this country's enemies. Alternatively, it is Remainer politicians such as Speaker John Bercow, who has barred the President from addressing parliamentarians.
JUN4	Left's vile smears will just make us Leavers stronger, says MARTIN DAUBNEY	THE LIBERAL Left has been radicalised by politicians and a media who paint all their opponents as Nazis or fascists. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUN4	Inside politics: Boris Johnson is playing a waiting game	BORIS Johnson is keeping his powder dry as the Tory phoney war rages. With slick campaign films, wobbly mobile phone video chats and other social media gimmickry, his rivals in the race to succeed Theresa May charged into the online battle this week.    So far, the former foreign secretary and frontrunner for the job has been absent from the fray. Supporters of Mr Johnson's bid for the Tory crown think their candidate is wise to keep a low profile in the opening skirmishes."It's far too early to start sounding off," one backer told me. "There has been a lot of noise, but no one is really listening." When MPs return from their Whitsun break on Monday, the contest to win over the hearts and minds will begin for real. While the social media air war has been fought to gain the attention of Tory members and the wider public, it is the 313-strong electorate of the party's MPs that will be crucial to picking the next leader and prime minister. Mr Johnson is already way ahead of his rivals in terms of support among the Tory grassroots and public recognition.
JUN4	Frumpy old fashion is not so nice, says RICHARD AND JUDY	HURRAY! In just three weeks and two days it's midsummer's day, though my husband's having none of it.To him the summer solstice is, was, and forever will be on June 21, even though Google swears that this year it will be June 24.    Whatever. It's the happiest day of Richard's year because he's a sun bunny, loves light, heat and lying on a lounger until he's the colour of burnt toast (sorry dear, I mean golden honey). I love summer too, especially floaty frocks and holidays. We're shortly off to France where nubile young women will congregate on the Côte d'Azur, all golden flesh, long, beach-tangled hair and, when they're not in bikinis, will throng the beach cafés in gorgeous drifting sun-frocks, feminine and sexy, revealing long tanned arms, slender shoulders and those ever-discreet French cleavages. But what on earth has happened to summer fashion here in the UK? In every magazine, pretty young women are trussing themselves up like Amish grannies. From Zara to Erdem, Harvey Nick's to Rixo, the shops are full of calf-length high-necked dresses, like those awful pie-crust collar Laura Ashley frocks we used to wear in the 70s.
JUN4	Trump could boost rising influence of Nigel Farage, EXPRESS COMMENT	DOWNING Street has every reason to fear a meeting between President Trump and Nigel Farage next week. A photograph of the billionaire president with his arm around the leader of the Brexit Party could become the defining image of this controversial state visit.    Mr Farage's party hopes to win its first MP in Thursday's Peterborough by-election - a victory that would cause dismay in Labour and Tory ranks. Mr Trump's embrace of this arch-Brexiteer would be further proof that he is one of the most influential figures in our country's politics.

JUN5	Education website launched offering free revision courses in English and Maths	WORRIED parents are spending thousands of pounds each year on private tutoring for their children in the hope of helping them to exam success. But it doesn’t work for everyone. The eye-watering cost means many mums and dads can’t afford to pay for tutors. And, even if they can, there’s no guarantee they are qualified to teach due to the unregulated nature of the market. In a bid to help former city trader Eddy Chan has launched an alternative – a free website offering all children preparing for their GCSEs free revision courses in English and Maths. Here Mr Chan, 50, from Surrey, explains why he thinks his website could be the key to solving the problem.    It’s exam time again, and in households up and down the country, countless children and their parents will be filled with anxiety during the SATs and GCSE exams that will continue until the end of June. As a father of three school-aged children, my family and I have regularly experienced the stresses that accompany this time of year. Over the past few weeks, I have read countless articles discussing the primary school SATs exams, a debate that never fails to emerge at this time of year. 
JUN5	D-Day 75: We must never forget the sacrifice of our heroes, says LORD DANNATT	SEVENTY-FIVE years ago tomorrow, nearly 160,000 Allied troops left our shores and crossed the choppy waters of the Channel to liberate continental Europe from the tyranny of the Third Reich. Overlord was an enormously ambitious operation, involving all branches of our Armed Forces in a meticulously co-ordinated attack on an enemy that had dominated France for four years.    Despite the extensive planning and thorough preparations, the expected casualty lists were high. In some of the fiercest fighting of the 20th century, young men and women were cut down as they advanced, inch by inch. By the end of the Battle of Normandy that summer, 22,763 British and Commonwealth personnel had been killed. Any death in war is a tragedy and worthy of great reflection, yet the D-Day landings have captured the imagination of the public for the last 75 years.
JUN5	Tories have gone doolally so they are picking the best of a mad bunch, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	THE party I used to serve has gone mad. Absolutely stark, staring, raving bonkers. As I write, there are a dozen candidates for the premiership and by the time you read this there will almost certainly be more. Michael Gove is said to be in a strong position. That tells you all you need to know because this is the man who wants to spend yet another year (three apparently is not enough) before leaving the EU.    That is despite the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who is no friend to Brexit, stating that business is 90 percent ready for a no-deal scenario. Probably what Gove is after is the Remain vote as anti-Brexit MPs view any delay as a chance to stave off the departure altogether. Actually, Gove is a competent chap who did a sound but not long enough job in both education and justice. His problem is that he cannot help plotting, which appears to be in his genes.
JUN5	Trump in UK: Left protests at US President but is silent over China, says TIM NEWARK	IT SAYS everything you need to know about Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his hard-Left acolytes that they'd rather protest against the democratically elected US President Donald Trump – our greatest ally – than stand up against China on the 30th anniversary this week of the brutal repression of their people at Tiananmen Square.    At his happiest among banner-waving demonstrators, he demeans his position as Leader of the Opposition by refusing to attend a state banquet and yet flocks to a crowd of EU fanatics, eco-warriors and pro-Palestinian Leftists to beat the drum of anti-Americanism. That's just his mark – the eternal student protester – still holding the same views he held half a century ago. Then, Left-wingers would throng outside the US embassy complaining of US imperialism. Strangely, though, they'd be very quiet about atrocities against citizens in the Soviet Union or communist China. A lot of noise about Vietnam but nothing about the Cultural Revolution in which millions of Chinese were persecuted and thousands executed.

JUN6	I may lust...but I'd never be unfaithful, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	TO the beautiful city of St Andrews, where William met Kate, as the locals never fail to remind you, and where scenery of all sorts leaps out at you in spades. The ruined castle! The magnificent cathedral! The miles and miles of award-winning beach!    And that's without the ancient university (though it's not as ancient as the one I attended). The place is positively bursting with history and culture. So what to see first? And so I did what any selfrespecting Brit would do - and headed straight for the nearest estate agent. It's what I always do, wherever I pitch up anywhere in the world, including some quite remote bits of Africa. Would I really want to live in Timbuktu? You never know. What a view! The array in the estate agent's window, I mean. There's a castle overlooking a loch and an old manse by the golf course and any number of chi-chi apartments nestling by the sea. After some consideration I've bought the lot of them, because a girl can't have too many dwellings. Then I catch sight of the prices and the whole dream falls apart.
JUN6	Brilliant Chernobyl series shows the dangers of the Left, says LEO MCKINSTRY	WE are living in a golden age of television drama. From the gripping British police procedural Line Of Duty to the brilliant American thriller Breaking Bad, the standard of entertainment on our screens has never been higher.    Yet for sheer emotional power, it would be hard to beat the epic series Chernobyl, which had its final episode this week. This show - made by US company HBO - told the story of the disaster that occurred at a nuclear plant in Soviet-run Ukraine in 1986, by far the worst such incident in history. It was a tale of monstrous, dogma-driven incompetence the fallout of which left vast swathes of eastern Europe contaminated by radiation and led to anything between 4,000 and 93,000 deaths over the long term. But amid all this horror, there was also extraordinary heroism. Putting their own lives at risk, emergency workers, soldiers, miners and scientists toiled fearlessly to cope with the explosion's destructive impact. In one remarkable passage, a group of courageous divers even waded into highly radioactive water tanks under the nuclear reactor to drain them, while other men went on to the roof of the damaged central building to clear away pieces of toxic graphite.
JUN6	One special man's courage was typical of a generation of heroes, EXPRESS COMMENT	IT TAKES a truly special individual for the Queen, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister to all take part in a standing ovation for them, but 99-year-old D-Day veteran John Jenkins yesterday was that man.    This day 75 years ago he and thousands of other young men sailed out from Portsmouth and stormed the Normandy beaches as the great liberation of Europe from the tyranny of Nazi Germany got underway.Their extraordinary bravery will never be forgotten. The victory in taking those beaches which led to the eventual defeat of Hitler ensured that Europe and the world could enjoy a future of democracy and freedom. It was not just a struggle for values, it was a fight to the death between good and evil. So it is right that yesterday in Portsmouth and today in France we should honour the men of D-Day. But their courage is not the only thing that marked that generation out. We should also remember their sense of duty and service.There are many stories of young men trying to ensure they were in the first wave or being afraid that the assault might be cancelled.

JUN7	Donald Trump is a much classier act than Jeremy Corbyn, says CAROLE MALONE	I SPENT the first half of this week feeling deeply ashamed of some of my fellow countrymen and the last half bursting with a pride so fierce I thought I might explode.    Because I realised we’ll never again see the likes of the D-Day heroes who fought so hard for our freedom. But first let’s look at our pathetic excuse for a Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and London’s joke of a mayor, Sadiq Khan. Neither is fit to lick the boots of those veterans and, yet they spent the week mocking, goading and insulting the leader of the free world who came specifically to honour them. Whatever you think of Trump - who Khan has ludicrously compared to those fascist leaders of the ‘30s and ‘40s who destroyed Europe and murdered millions - he is NOT a fascist or a tyrant. He IS Britain’s greatest ally and could, post-Brexit, save our backsides with a bumper trade deal. But that didn’t stop Khan tweeting abuse about him in the 48 hours before his arrival, then bleating about “childish insults” when Trump hit back by calling him a “terrible mayor and stone-cold loser” - which he is.
JUN7	They died for the future of their children - don't waste their sacrifice, EXPRESS COMMENT	ONE OF the many poignant images from yesterday's commemorations was that of six-year-old George Sayer standing alongside 95-year-old veteran John Quinn at Sword Beach. Young George was wearing the medals of his great uncle and namesake, a D-Day veteran who passed away 18 months ago.    The picture reminds us what those courageous men who stormed the Normandy beaches 75 years ago were fighting for.Young George has his life before him. He will hopefully grow up in a world free and peaceful and will have the opportunity to pursue his dreams. Those brave men who fought on D-Day and in the other great battles against the terrible tyranny of Nazi Germany were fighting for young George and all future generations. Their selfless acts all those years ago not only liberated Europe but meant that the future was one founded on democracy. While it was sad that the elder George Sayer did not live long enough to join these fantastic, truly moving commemorations, it is wonderful that the young boy who bears his name was there to represent him.
JUN7	THE END OF MAY: History will be kind to the PM who had an impossible task, says ROSS CLARK	AS Theresa May resigns as the Conservative leader today, how easy it is to declare her to be Britain's worst prime minister. Having deprived herself of her majority in an early election, she devoted herself to one thing alone – leaving the EU – and could not even achieve that.    Yet if we really think Mrs May deserves an ignominious place at the very bottom of the pile of British PMs, it proves only that we have very short memories.

JUN7	A Euro-fanatic enemy within is real danger, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	ADMIRERS of this page in the mandarinate of the Civil Service could probably hold their AGM in a phone booth, but one has one's squirrels who whisper from the foliage. The latest muted chatter is worrying.    It seems there may be a quiet conspiracy of senior bureaucrats trying to tie our country into the European Defence Union, a scheme to tangle us into subordination on defence issues even if Brexit succeeds – which they fervently hope it won’t. Their excuse is to secure us lucrative defence contracts into the foreseeable future.
JUN7	I may lust...but I'd never be unfaithful, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	TO the beautiful city of St Andrews, where William met Kate, as the locals never fail to remind you, and where scenery of all sorts leaps out at you in spades. The ruined castle! The magnificent cathedral! The miles and miles of award-winning beach!    And that's without the ancient university (though it's not as ancient as the one I attended). The place is positively bursting with history and culture. So what to see first? And so I did what any selfrespecting Brit would do - and headed straight for the nearest estate agent. It's what I always do, wherever I pitch up anywhere in the world, including some quite remote bits of Africa. Would I really want to live in Timbuktu? You never know. What a view! The array in the estate agent's window, I mean. There's a castle overlooking a loch and an old manse by the golf course and any number of chi-chi apartments nestling by the sea. After some consideration I've bought the lot of them, because a girl can't have too many dwellings. Then I catch sight of the prices and the whole dream falls apart.
JUN7	Brilliant Chernobyl series shows the dangers of the Left, says LEO MCKINSTRY	WE are living in a golden age of television drama. From the gripping British police procedural Line Of Duty to the brilliant American thriller Breaking Bad, the standard of entertainment on our screens has never been higher.    Yet for sheer emotional power, it would be hard to beat the epic series Chernobyl, which had its final episode this week. This show - made by US company HBO - told the story of the disaster that occurred at a nuclear plant in Soviet-run Ukraine in 1986, by far the worst such incident in history. It was a tale of monstrous, dogma-driven incompetence the fallout of which left vast swathes of eastern Europe contaminated by radiation and led to anything between 4,000 and 93,000 deaths over the long term. But amid all this horror, there was also extraordinary heroism. Putting their own lives at risk, emergency workers, soldiers, miners and scientists toiled fearlessly to cope with the explosion's destructive impact. In one remarkable passage, a group of courageous divers even waded into highly radioactive water tanks under the nuclear reactor to drain them, while other men went on to the roof of the damaged central building to clear away pieces of toxic graphite.
JUN7	One special man's courage was typical of a generation of heroes, EXPRESS COMMENT	IT TAKES a truly special individual for the Queen, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister to all take part in a standing ovation for them, but 99-year-old D-Day veteran John Jenkins yesterday was that man.    This day 75 years ago he and thousands of other young men sailed out from Portsmouth and stormed the Normandy beaches as the great liberation of Europe from the tyranny of Nazi Germany got underway.Their extraordinary bravery will never be forgotten. The victory in taking those beaches which led to the eventual defeat of Hitler ensured that Europe and the world could enjoy a future of democracy and freedom. It was not just a struggle for values, it was a fight to the death between good and evil. So it is right that yesterday in Portsmouth and today in France we should honour the men of D-Day. But their courage is not the only thing that marked that generation out. We should also remember their sense of duty and service.There are many stories of young men trying to ensure they were in the first wave or being afraid that the assault might be cancelled.
JUN7	Education website launched offering free revision courses in English and Maths	WORRIED parents are spending thousands of pounds each year on private tutoring for their children in the hope of helping them to exam success. But it doesn’t work for everyone. The eye-watering cost means many mums and dads can’t afford to pay for tutors. And, even if they can, there’s no guarantee they are qualified to teach due to the unregulated nature of the market. In a bid to help former city trader Eddy Chan has launched an alternative – a free website offering all children preparing for their GCSEs free revision courses in English and Maths. Here Mr Chan, 50, from Surrey, explains why he thinks his website could be the key to solving the problem.    It’s exam time again, and in households up and down the country, countless children and their parents will be filled with anxiety during the SATs and GCSE exams that will continue until the end of June. As a father of three school-aged children, my family and I have regularly experienced the stresses that accompany this time of year. Over the past few weeks, I have read countless articles discussing the primary school SATs exams, a debate that never fails to emerge at this time of year. 
JUN7	D-Day 75: We must never forget the sacrifice of our heroes, says LORD DANNATT	SEVENTY-FIVE years ago tomorrow, nearly 160,000 Allied troops left our shores and crossed the choppy waters of the Channel to liberate continental Europe from the tyranny of the Third Reich. Overlord was an enormously ambitious operation, involving all branches of our Armed Forces in a meticulously co-ordinated attack on an enemy that had dominated France for four years.    Despite the extensive planning and thorough preparations, the expected casualty lists were high. In some of the fiercest fighting of the 20th century, young men and women were cut down as they advanced, inch by inch. By the end of the Battle of Normandy that summer, 22,763 British and Commonwealth personnel had been killed. Any death in war is a tragedy and worthy of great reflection, yet the D-Day landings have captured the imagination of the public for the last 75 years.
JUN7	Tories have gone doolally so they are picking the best of a mad bunch, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	THE party I used to serve has gone mad. Absolutely stark, staring, raving bonkers. As I write, there are a dozen candidates for the premiership and by the time you read this there will almost certainly be more. Michael Gove is said to be in a strong position. That tells you all you need to know because this is the man who wants to spend yet another year (three apparently is not enough) before leaving the EU.    That is despite the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who is no friend to Brexit, stating that business is 90 percent ready for a no-deal scenario. Probably what Gove is after is the Remain vote as anti-Brexit MPs view any delay as a chance to stave off the departure altogether. Actually, Gove is a competent chap who did a sound but not long enough job in both education and justice. His problem is that he cannot help plotting, which appears to be in his genes.
JUN8	Statesman Trump has learnt value of global peace, says ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI	PRESIDENT TRUMP'S state visit to the UK last week provided a welcome glimpse of Trump the statesman – a unifying global figure who both fights for the American people and to protect the liberal world order. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUN8	Scientists in the dark over 'Moonquakes', says RICHARD & JUDY	LOOK to the skies, runs the saying. We certainly should be at the moment - some very strange stuff is going on up there. Let's start with the Moon. For about 40 years, astronomers have been reporting peculiar and inexplicable "Moon flashes"; random bursts of light which appear without warning.    They can last for seconds, minutes or sometimes hours. There is no previous historical record of these flashes - they were first officially noted in 1967 - which is odd, as there can be several such incidents in a single week. The bursts of light are usually reddish or pink in colour, and appear to be about 10 miles across.
JUN8	Would 'Snowflake generation' have war heroes' resilience, asks STEPHEN POLLARD	I DON'T know about you, but I found it impossible to watch this week's D-Day commemorations without welling up. One veteran - introduced as Eric - is still in my thoughts.    He described the sheer hell of Omaha Beach, how his best friend had died next to him after a bullet to the throat. It was his eyes that got me. You could see from them, and his doleful expression, that even though he was in his 10th decade, he was still reliving the exact moment. It's not for nothing that they are known as the Greatest Generation and we are right to honour them while they are still with us, however diminished in numbers. 
JUN8	Sally Challen: Justice must prevail in abuse cases - EXPRESS COMMENT	SALLY Challen's sad story is a painful reminder that there are still problems in our justice system that need to be resolved. It is obviously good news that she was told yesterday she will not have to face a retrial for killing her husband.    But it is clear Ms Challen was the victim of coercive abuse over many years and should never have been convicted of murder, for which she served more than eight years in prison. There are other cases now of women in a similar position that must be reviewed urgently to ensure that justice is done. There also seems to be a need to reconsider the guidelines of people who kill their spouse or partner in situations where abuse is alleged to have taken place.
JUN8	Donald Trump is a much classier act than Jeremy Corbyn, says CAROLE MALONE	I SPENT the first half of this week feeling deeply ashamed of some of my fellow countrymen and the last half bursting with a pride so fierce I thought I might explode.    Because I realised we’ll never again see the likes of the D-Day heroes who fought so hard for our freedom. But first let’s look at our pathetic excuse for a Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and London’s joke of a mayor, Sadiq Khan. Neither is fit to lick the boots of those veterans and, yet they spent the week mocking, goading and insulting the leader of the free world who came specifically to honour them. Whatever you think of Trump - who Khan has ludicrously compared to those fascist leaders of the ‘30s and ‘40s who destroyed Europe and murdered millions - he is NOT a fascist or a tyrant. He IS Britain’s greatest ally and could, post-Brexit, save our backsides with a bumper trade deal. But that didn’t stop Khan tweeting abuse about him in the 48 hours before his arrival, then bleating about “childish insults” when Trump hit back by calling him a “terrible mayor and stone-cold loser” - which he is.
JUN8	They died for the future of their children - don't waste their sacrifice, EXPRESS COMMENT	ONE OF the many poignant images from yesterday's commemorations was that of six-year-old George Sayer standing alongside 95-year-old veteran John Quinn at Sword Beach. Young George was wearing the medals of his great uncle and namesake, a D-Day veteran who passed away 18 months ago.    The picture reminds us what those courageous men who stormed the Normandy beaches 75 years ago were fighting for.Young George has his life before him. He will hopefully grow up in a world free and peaceful and will have the opportunity to pursue his dreams. Those brave men who fought on D-Day and in the other great battles against the terrible tyranny of Nazi Germany were fighting for young George and all future generations. Their selfless acts all those years ago not only liberated Europe but meant that the future was one founded on democracy. While it was sad that the elder George Sayer did not live long enough to join these fantastic, truly moving commemorations, it is wonderful that the young boy who bears his name was there to represent him.
JUN8	THE END OF MAY: History will be kind to the PM who had an impossible task, says ROSS CLARK	AS Theresa May resigns as the Conservative leader today, how easy it is to declare her to be Britain's worst prime minister. Having deprived herself of her majority in an early election, she devoted herself to one thing alone – leaving the EU – and could not even achieve that.    Yet if we really think Mrs May deserves an ignominious place at the very bottom of the pile of British PMs, it proves only that we have very short memories. Excruciating though the latter months of her time at Number 10 have been, we have had far worse incumbents. It is easy to pick apart her premiership, and not just over Brexit. Where are the grammar schools she promised? In what sense has she put right the "burning injustices" she mentioned in her first speech as prime minister? Whatever happened to the "lowest energy prices in Europe" she promised in her 2017 election manifesto (the latest comparison shows Britain 18th out of 32 European countries for domestic electricity bills).
JUN8	A Euro-fanatic enemy within is real danger, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	ADMIRERS of this page in the mandarinate of the Civil Service could probably hold their AGM in a phone booth, but one has one's squirrels who whisper from the foliage.

It seems there may be a quiet conspiracy of senior bureaucrats trying to tie our country into the European Defence Union, a scheme to tangle us into subordination on defence issues even if Brexit succeeds – which they fervently hope it won’t. Their excuse is to secure us lucrative defence contracts into the foreseeable future.
JUN8	I may lust...but I'd never be unfaithful, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	TO the beautiful city of St Andrews, where William met Kate, as the locals never fail to remind you, and where scenery of all sorts leaps out at you in spades. The ruined castle! The magnificent cathedral! The miles and miles of award-winning beach!    And that's without the ancient university (though it's not as ancient as the one I attended). The place is positively bursting with history and culture. So what to see first? And so I did what any selfrespecting Brit would do - and headed straight for the nearest estate agent. It's what I always do, wherever I pitch up anywhere in the world, including some quite remote bits of Africa. Would I really want to live in Timbuktu? You never know. What a view! The array in the estate agent's window, I mean. There's a castle overlooking a loch and an old manse by the golf course and any number of chi-chi apartments nestling by the sea. After some consideration I've bought the lot of them, because a girl can't have too many dwellings. Then I catch sight of the prices and the whole dream falls apart.

JUN9	The proud reason we are free to protest, says NICK FERRARI	WE HEARD the word "Nazi" quite a bit last week, but the stark difference in how it was used and what it actually meant was immeasurable.    Somehow, we've come to a position whereby if anyone says something that can be interpreted to be Right-wing in any way, they can immediately be branded a Nazi. And so it was at protests that greeted the arrival of US President Donald Trump to this country. Protester Siobhan Prigent, who is as disgraced as she was disgraceful, has quit her job within the NHS and reportedly gone to ground after repeatedly screaming "Nazi scum" at a Trump supporter at the rally in Parliament Square on Tuesday.
JUN9	PM hopefuls looking at life beyond Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	THERE is a misconception about the Conservative leadership contest. In many quarters it is being presented as whether we get Brexit or not.    As our interview with Jeremy Hunt today shows, once again it is clear that whoever eventually wins and replaces Theresa May will deliver Brexit. The only questions are how and when. The truth is that this is a contest about the future of this country beyond Brexit and whether the next prime minister has the vision, the radical policies and optimism to treat it as an opportunity for a much better future rather than as a problem.

JUN10	The two key tasks for whoever takes over – EXPRESS COMMENT	SILVER linings were few and far between for the Tories at the Peterborough by-election. The only plausible one was that the turn-out was so low that the same result would be unlikely at a general election. And, make no mistake, a general election within the next 12 months is highly probable.    When only a tiny fraction of the electorate (the 124,000 members of the Conservative Party) will decide who is to become our next prime minister, calls for a national vote understandably will be vociferous. So there are two overriding concerns for Tory MPs to consider. The next leader of the party must be able to deliver Brexit and must be able to defeat Jeremy Corbyn. The two go hand in hand. You can't have one without the other. Watching the Tory party disintegrate has been a grim spectacle and nothing except hard work and hard choices will begin the process of rebuilding it. We're not impressed so far by headline-grabbing announcements by the various candidates. We, along with millions of decent law-abiding people up and down the land, want to rally behind someone we can trust, someone who will put the interests of the country before his or her own ambitions. That means delivering Brexit and exposing Corbyn as a shallow Marxist, desperate to bankrupt Britain.
JUN10	Tory leadership: Failure to deliver EU election result is BIGGEST crime says LEO MCKINSTRY	THE Tories are about to indulge in another exercise of their favourite pastime: holding a leadership contest. After the resignation of Theresa May, nominations for her successor close today.

JUN11	Call time on this ageist viewpoint, says VANESSA FELTZ	IF like me you've been avidly watching the entrancing 63 Up on ITV you will be well aware of the Jesuit maxim behind Michael Apted's monumental project which has involved filming 14 individuals every seven years from their seventh birthdays in 1964: "Give me the child before the age of seven, and I will give you the man."    Of course, the sentiment applies to girls and women too, and aficionados of the programme will know that every syllable is utterly and vividly true. Despite "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune" our characters and personalities are formed before our seventh birthday. Cheeky chappies retain their chutzpah. Shy introverts never shake off their desire to withdraw from the throng. Outgoing opinionated souls spend a lifetime centre-stage declaiming their views to an enthralled audience. The serious and perplexed continue to question everything, while the assured and socially poised continue to make friends and influence people. Gentle reader, let me take this a little further and declare: age does not wither or change that seven-year-old inside us all. 
JUN11	BBC needs to rethink its duty to the core viewers – EXPRESS COMMENT	BBC beancounters have decreed that by 2020 the licence fee should be means-tested to those over 75, with free licences available only to those on pension credit. The move will gain the national broadcaster up to 3.7 million more licence fees and poorer pensioners will still have free television. And it would enable the organisation to continue expanding.    But it doesn't seem to have taken into account the special role that TV has for the elderly. 
JUN11	Time to get serious and lead us into a good Brexit, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IN 1806, following the death of Pitt the Younger, a national unity government was formed by the new prime minister, Lord Grenville. It was known as the Ministry of All the Talents. Whatever else happens before a new Conservative leader is installed next month, no one is going to label this as the Contest of All the Talents.    With a seeming cast of thousands, there has been a touch of pantomime and the occasional lapse into platitude.

There will be an absurdly crowded field at first but this will be whittled down in a series of votes by MPs to a final pair of names. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

JUN11	The proud reason we are free to protest, says NICK FERRARI	WE HEARD the word "Nazi" quite a bit last week, but the stark difference in how it was used and what it actually meant was immeasurable.    Somehow, we've come to a position whereby if anyone says something that can be interpreted to be Right-wing in any way, they can immediately be branded a Nazi. And so it was at protests that greeted the arrival of US President Donald Trump to this country. Protester Siobhan Prigent, who is as disgraced as she was disgraceful, has quit her job within the NHS and reportedly gone to ground after repeatedly screaming "Nazi scum" at a Trump supporter at the rally in Parliament Square on Tuesday.
JUN11	PM hopefuls looking at life beyond Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	THERE is a misconception about the Conservative leadership contest. In many quarters it is being presented as whether we get Brexit or not.    As our interview with Jeremy Hunt today shows, once again it is clear that whoever eventually wins and replaces Theresa May will deliver Brexit. The only questions are how and when. The truth is that this is a contest about the future of this country beyond Brexit and whether the next prime minister has the vision, the radical policies and optimism to treat it as an opportunity for a much better future rather than as a problem.
JUN11	Thank God for Queen! UK paralysed by MPs but Her Majesty embodies grace from bygone era	PRESIDENT TRUMP'S state visit to the UK last week provided a welcome glimpse of Trump the statesman – a unifying global figure who both fights for the American people and to protect the liberal world order. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUN11	Scientists in the dark over 'Moonquakes', says RICHARD & JUDY	LOOK to the skies, runs the saying. We certainly should be at the moment - some very strange stuff is going on up there. Let's start with the Moon. For about 40 years, astronomers have been reporting peculiar and inexplicable "Moon flashes"; random bursts of light which appear without warning.    They can last for seconds, minutes or sometimes hours. There is no previous historical record of these flashes - they were first officially noted in 1967 - which is odd, as there can be several such incidents in a single week. The bursts of light are usually reddish or pink in colour, and appear to be about 10 miles across.
JUN12	No one has the right not to be offended, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	Snowflake of the year must surely be Hadiatou Barry, a pupil who complained to the examiners because her GCSE English paper offended her. It contained an extract from a book in which a girl becomes pregnant after being raped by her employer, although the extract itself did not refer to this. "You have a vast amount of novels which you could pick from," she wrote, thus proving that her English lessons were not altogether successful.    "This exam may have very well acted as a trigger for underlying mental health issues, which could have undermined their performance within the exam." oh, dear, more bad english! wherever is the logic in this rot? To have any reaction at all to the text on the paper students would need to know how the story developed and therefore to have read the book. Miss Barry says she was "horrified" to discover how the tale unfolds but she certainly could not have discovered that during the test itself so how could it "undermine performance within the exam"? English and logic apart, such feebleness is unbelievable. Rape is present in great works such as Tess of The D'Urbervilles.
JUN12	Boris Johnson has a clear message but he must avoid chaos – EXPRESS COMMENT	BORIS JOHNSON will launch his leadership campaign today with an unequivocal warning that the Conservative Party is finished if the UK does not leave the EU on October 31. Senior Tories are lining up to back the former Mayor of London, calculating that he stands the best chance of both delivering Brexit and keeping Jeremy Corbyn out of Downing Street.    His message will resonate with millions of people across the country who are embarrassed and angry that Britain did not exit the EU as promised on March 29. Mr Johnson has kept a low profile in the leadership race so far but with brutal simplicity, he will lay out the consequences of a further delay to our departure. He will say: "Delay means defeat. Delay means Corbyn. Kick the can and we kick the bucket." Mr Johnson is intelligent enough to understand it is in the interests of both the UK and the EU that trade is not interrupted after Brexit Day – and the next PM will have a solemn responsibility to ensure we avoid job-killing chaos. But he is also right to recognise that Theresa May's successor must cut the cord with Brussels and lead the party and the nation in the hard work of building a richer yet fairer country.
JUN12	How dare BBC fatcats snatch free TV from over-75s says TIM NEWARK	AT a time when the very notion of paying a TV licence fee is in doubt in a world of multimedia channel choices, it seems perverse to penalise nearly four million loyal elderly BBC watchers who have paid more than their fair share of this TV tax over many decades.    By denying them their long-earned free TV licence they are being hit at their most vulnerable when many of them depend on their TV not just for entertainment but for company too. The reassuring rhythm of familiar programmes and a front-row seat at national events, such as the splendid D-Day 75th anniversary, can help alleviate hours of boredom and loneliness. It is the very least they deserve in their senior years. For many living on fixed incomes diminished by a decade of ultra-low interest rates, it will come as a very unwelcome extra financial burden.
JUN12	Call time on this ageist viewpoint, says VANESSA FELTZ	IF like me you've been avidly watching the entrancing 63 Up on ITV you will be well aware of the Jesuit maxim behind Michael Apted's monumental project which has involved filming 14 individuals every seven years from their seventh birthdays in 1964: "Give me the child before the age of seven, and I will give you the man."    Of course, the sentiment applies to girls and women too, and aficionados of the programme will know that every syllable is utterly and vividly true. Despite "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune" our characters and personalities are formed before our seventh birthday. Cheeky chappies retain their chutzpah. Shy introverts never shake off their desire to withdraw from the throng. Outgoing opinionated souls spend a lifetime centre-stage declaiming their views to an enthralled audience. The serious and perplexed continue to question everything, while the assured and socially poised continue to make friends and influence people. Gentle reader, let me take this a little further and declare: age does not wither or change that seven-year-old inside us all. 
JUN12	BBC needs to rethink its duty to the core viewers – EXPRESS COMMENT	BBC beancounters have decreed that by 2020 the licence fee should be means-tested to those over 75, with free licences available only to those on pension credit. The move will gain the national broadcaster up to 3.7 million more licence fees and poorer pensioners will still have free television. And it would enable the organisation to continue expanding.    But it doesn't seem to have taken into account the special role that TV has for the elderly. 
JUN12	Time to get serious and lead us into a good Brexit, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IN 1806, following the death of Pitt the Younger, a national unity government was formed by the new prime minister, Lord Grenville. It was known as the Ministry of All the Talents. Whatever else happens before a new Conservative leader is installed next month, no one is going to label this as the Contest of All the Talents.    With a seeming cast of thousands, there has been a touch of pantomime and the occasional lapse into platitude. 
JUN12	The two key tasks for whoever takes over – EXPRESS COMMENT	SILVER linings were few and far between for the Tories at the Peterborough by-election. The only plausible one was that the turn-out was so low that the same result would be unlikely at a general election. And, make no mistake, a general election within the next 12 months is highly probable.    When only a tiny fraction of the electorate (the 124,000 members of the Conservative Party) will decide who is to become our next prime minister, calls for a national vote understandably will be vociferous. So there are two overriding concerns for Tory MPs to consider. The next leader of the party must be able to deliver Brexit and must be able to defeat Jeremy Corbyn. The two go hand in hand. You can't have one without the other. Watching the Tory party disintegrate has been a grim spectacle and nothing except hard work and hard choices will begin the process of rebuilding it. We're not impressed so far by headline-grabbing announcements by the various candidates. We, along with millions of decent law-abiding people up and down the land, want to rally behind someone we can trust, someone who will put the interests of the country before his or her own ambitions. That means delivering Brexit and exposing Corbyn as a shallow Marxist, desperate to bankrupt Britain.

JUN13	Oh, oh heaven save us from wannabe Bonds, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	CRUMBS and crikey, lawks a mercy, who would ever have thunk? That nice Michael Gove, he of the rapier wit and conservative demeanour, turns out to have been a coke fiend, or at the very least an occasional partaker. Whatever next? Five-in-a-bed fun? Well, yes, according to a new book out about him.    That is exactly what once happened, although reading more closely it seems that in the Govester's student days there was an occasion when everyone got so hammered that they all dropped senseless on to the same bed and nothing, mercifully, seems to have gone on. Is this what Brexit has brought us to? Seemingly respectable politicians revealing lurid secrets about themselves that most of us quite honestly would have been considerably happier not knowing? It makes you wonder what else Michael Gove has hidden under his kilt. (Appalling thought. We shouldn't go there. Unfortunately, the book does.)
JUN13	The Brexit shadows are beginning to break up – EXPRESS COMMENT	If a day in politics summed up the difference between Labour and the Conservative Party, then yesterday was it.

JUN13	Tory leadership: Conservatives need to sort out this bizarre contest mess	I'VE worked in recruitment for more than 25 years – but I’ve never seen a hiring process as bizarre as that of the Tory leadership contest. To date, 13 Conservative MPs have declared as candidates, and another five had hoped to enter the race.    If a client came to my business to make a senior hire and we responded with a list of 13 people, that client wouldn’t be ours for long. No one has got the time to read 13 CVs or conduct 13 interviews. No wonder the public is failing to engage with the process – and that Tory grandee Ken Clarke branded it “a shambles”. The Conservative Party Board tweaked its own rules to insist on minimum levels of support. James Cleverly and Kit Malthouse then dropped out, taking the 13 declared candidates to 11.
JUN13	Sex scandal-ravaged Oxfam has changed from charity to politics, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE hypocrisy could hardly be more offensive, the sanctimony more hollow. In its latest annual report, the charity Oxfam boasts that "the importance of women's rights and gender justice is at the heart of our development work". But those words are just empty rhetoric.    Far from battling discrimination, Oxfam turns out to be an agent of institutionalised sexism and oppression in some of its operations, as demonstrated by the abuse scandal engulfing it.  In a damning report out this week, based on a comprehensive, 18-month inquiry, the Charity Commission revealed a catalogue of failures in dealing with cases of harassment, bullying and sexual exploitation by a number of its workers. Focusing on allegations of abuse by staff sent to help victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Commission found it tolerated "a culture of poor behaviour". Warnings were ignored, claims dismissed and misconduct charges went unreported, even though some cases may have involved children. It was not just overseas that women and girls were let down. Investigators have also found that in Oxfam shops in Britain there have been scores of claims of harassment by staff and volunteers, while at least nine convicted sex offenders have been recruited as voluntary workers.

How dare our state broadcaster strip 3.7 million pensioners of their free TV licence?    “It’s the fairest thing to do,” says the Corporation’s Director General, Lord Tony Hall, who’ll have no problems paying HIS license fee as he earns between £450,000 and £499,000 a year (he refuses to say exactly how much, presumably because he’s embarrassed). And how dare he justify abolishing these free licences by perpetuating the myth that Britain’s pensioners are better off than ever before. What planet are Hall and his fat cat cronies living on? Pensioner poverty - according to a report by the Joseph Rowntree foundation - has rocketed by a third in the last decade.

JUN14	Tory leadership contest reinvigorates the party - EXPRESS COMMENT	CONSERVATIVE MPs appear to have rallied to Boris Johnson's banner in the first-round vote of the leadership contest.    There is little doubt that the wide support for the former London Mayor who heroically fronted the Vote Leave campaign is also reflected among party members and, indeed, Daily Express readers as our survey recently revealed. We need to remember, though, that the contest is not yet over and his rivals Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove are both still in the race, albeit far behind as things stand. What has been true about this leadership election is that it has reinvigorated the Tories.
JUN14	Brexit Britain is still a magnet for foreign investment - here’s why - Ross Clark	WE HAD two stories about investment in the UK this week. Guess which one the BBC chose to report prominently on its news bulletins yesterday morning.    A leaked letter from the retiring British High Commissioner in Singapore claimed business leaders had told him they are more likely to invest in France and Germany than the UK. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister announced £945million of investment in Britain by technology companies, including Indian-based Infosys, Japanese company NTT Data and Lilium, a Munich-based flying-taxi start-up that has chosen to base its software development in Britain. Yes, you've guessed it - it was the chitter-chatter at diplomatic sherry parties that the BBC chose to report. Once again, the corporation decided that wild speculation by people opposed to Brexit is more important that real economic news.

JUN15	New leader must act to save vital TV benefit - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE new prime minister will have a pile of important items in his in-tray in Downing Street. However, along with Brexit, we would suggest that it should be considered a priority to sort out the scandal of scrapping the free TV licence for over-75s who are not on pension credit.    It was a harsh decision but the BBC was put in an unenviable position by the Government of making a decision they knew would be hugely unpopular. With the pressure on to save cash and still maintain high quality programme-making, the options open to the corporation were extremely limited. True, the BBC did not help itself by stating in 2015 it would cover the cost of free licences in return for the fee rising with inflation. But we are sure it would not want to pursue the elderly for non-payment of theTV licence.The institution is respected across the nation and must not be put in such an invidious position.

JUN16	UK needs to show its steel in manufacturing	IT IS a sad state of affairs when Britain announces the closure of yet another keystone manufacturing business. Steel is part of our everyday lives but, from now on, we will need to buy most of it in from abroad.  It's such a change from the mid-Sixties when the UK was the fourth biggest steel producer in the world. Now we are 22nd. Sure, China and India have risen up the ranks as they industrialise, but countries like Germany and Japan have managed to hold their production steady due to domestic demand. The UK steel industry has declined because energy costs here are too high. If costs are too high in manufacturing, a business does not generate enough cash to invest in expansion or modernisation and nor does it reward its shareholders. 
JUN16	BBC's big guns make our D-Day vets pay, says NICK FERRARI	THE IRONY is as striking as it is shameful. Less than two weeks ago, the BBC - quite rightly - lavished deserved plaudits in its bountiful coverage on those incredible D-Day veterans who took part in the services both here and across the Channel in Normandy to commemorate the events of 75 years ago.    We saw them jumping out of aircraft, reliving moments of unspeakable terror and remembering acts of untold bravery. This incredible, but shrinking, band who are consistently and uniformly modest about their role, was interviewed exhaustively and justly hailed as heroes. However, as they arrived home to hang up neatly pressed and immaculate uniforms in wardrobes and wrap cherished medals in tissue paper in safe-keeping for future generations, there was a present awaiting them from the BBC. In all but the most impoverished cases, the right to a free TV licence that they have enjoyed for almost two decades had been scrapped and they will have to fork out £154.50p like the rest of us.
JUN16	Boris Johnson has chance to make his own history - EXPRESS COMMENT	BORIS Johnson is often dismissed by his opponents as a clown and buffoon but the truth is that he is a serious man with a deep appreciation of this country's history.    Among the books he has authored is a biography of Britain's greatest Prime Minister  -Winston Churchill - and it is to that titan of the last century that he needs to seek inspiration from now. Barring something unforeseen, Mr Johnson will become our next Prime Minister. But he will have been given that opportunity because Brexiteer MPs believe he has guaranteed that Britain will be leaving the EU on October 31 and there will be no further delay.
JUN16	So long May and Hammond, hello tax cuts for all, says KATE ANDREWS	WHEN Philip Hammond said last year that austerity was finally coming to an end, an extremely important group was overlooked.    The National Health Service got a huge increase to its budget and boosts were given to policing and defence too. But taxpayers - who have been paying down the deficit for nearly a decade - didn't benefit from the Chancellor's generous mood. VAT was increased from 17.5 percent to 20 percent but while spending increases have come back in fashion, cuts to tax have yet to follow. After a Brexit deal, the Chancellor said in his spring statement, taxpayers would get a look-in. Which begs the question: if Brexit negotiations fail to get over the line in October, as occurred in March and April, will we feel our wallets widen any time in the foreseeable future? Thankfully, the Tory leadership race has revealed some tax-cutting champions who see the merits of tackling the tax burden before (and regardless) of Brexit. But not all cuts are equal and households will fare differently if certain policies come into effect.

JUN16	New leader must act to save vital TV benefit - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE new prime minister will have a pile of important items in his in-tray in Downing Street. However, along with Brexit, we would suggest that it should be considered a priority to sort out the scandal of scrapping the free TV licence for over-75s who are not on pension credit.    It was a harsh decision but the BBC was put in an unenviable position by the Government of making a decision they knew would be hugely unpopular. With the pressure on to save cash and still maintain high quality programme-making, the options open to the corporation were extremely limited. True, the BBC did not help itself by stating in 2015 it would cover the cost of free licences in return for the fee rising with inflation. But we are sure it would not want to pursue the elderly for non-payment of theTV licence.The institution is respected across the nation and must not be put in such an invidious position.
JUN16	The contest to be PM cannot be a one-horse race, says STEPHEN POLLARD	THE only surprise about Boris Johnson's victory in the first round of the Conservative leadership contest was its scale.

JUN16	Old age and poverty are not crimes, says CAROLE MALONE	IT’S been a catastrophically damaging week for the BBC - and it’s deserved all the flak and the brickbats thrown at it. How dare our state broadcaster strip 3.7 million pensioners of their free TV licence?    “It’s the fairest thing to do,” says the Corporation’s Director General, Lord Tony Hall, who’ll have no problems paying HIS license fee as he earns between £450,000 and £499,000 a year (he refuses to say exactly how much, presumably because he’s embarrassed). And how dare he justify abolishing these free licences by perpetuating the myth that Britain’s pensioners are better off than ever before. What planet are Hall and his fat cat cronies living on? Pensioner poverty - according to a report by the Joseph Rowntree foundation - has rocketed by a third in the last decade.

JUN17	New eyes on our care homes, EXPRESS COMMENT	THE care home industry is a tough sector.The duty of care to vulnerable people is vital, but margins are tight, and staffing difficult to maintain.    Which is why The Daily Express applauds plans to increase CCTV in care homes. As well as offering protection from less than scrupulous staff, this measure is also set to save the NHS £370million a year from call-outs. It is supported by key people such as the thoughtful Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock and Jayne Connery, from the Care Campaign for the Vulnerable. Yes, there are privacy issues about CCTV and a worthy debate is taking place. Some care homes have ploughed ahead on their own: others have resisted. But we had those debates before in terms of crime, and few now cavil about CCTV in our streets. Plus, it protects staff from vexatious claims as well as patients - and saves money. Let's get on with it.
JUN17	Corbyn's kneejerk appeasement just enables our enemy, says LEO MCKINSTRY	IN THE history of British democracy, there has never been an opposition leader as dangerous as Jeremy Corbyn. With his Marxist ideology, he is a clear menace to our economic prosperity. But just as worryingly, his puerile anti-Western outlook makes him a deadly risk to our national security.    That truth has been graphically illustrated by his enfeebled response to the escalating crisis in the Gulf of Oman. In recent days, tensions have been rising between the United States and Iran after last week's two attacks on a Japanese and a Norwegian tanker near the Straits of Hormuz. Backed up by video footage - taken by a US drone - which appears to show Iranian Revolutionary Guards handling a limpet mine at the side of the damaged Japanese vessel, Washington blamed the twin assaults on Tehran. It was backed up by our own Foreign Office, which claimed that "no other state or non-state actor could plausibly have been responsible". But Corbyn, wallowing in his usual sympathy for our enemies, took a very different line. Having wailed about the lack of "credible evidence" from the USA, he condemned the British Government for rhetoric that "will only increase the threat of war". That stance is typical.

JUN19	Children should be taught to think for themselves, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	I may not approve of much that is spouted by Professor Richard Dawkins, the atheist academic, but a while ago he made a statement which must have resonated with anybody and everybody who has to expound views in public. He said that more effort should be made to teach children how to think in order that they might learn to analyse arguments and apply critical thought.    Mohammed Amin, the chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum, must be wishing the media in this country had been obliged to take such a course. He has been accused of comparing Boris Johnson to Hitler. He did no such thing. Mr Amin was strongly criticising Boris Johnson on the Today programme when the interviewer pointed to Bojo's popularity, whereupon he cited Hitler as proof that popularity does not always guarantee the right result. What he was doing was challenging the notion of popularity as a measure of desirability, not saying that Boris Johnson was like Hitler. I once said in a radio interview that women can take more care of their handbags on a night out than of their own persons.
JUN19	Boris Johnson must now earn the trust of the country – EXPRESS COMMENT	BORIS JOHNSON cemented his reputation as the candidate to beat in last night's Conservative leadership debate. Under the studio lights, he displayed the confidence and charisma that have propelled him forward throughout his extraordinary career.    He is backed by far more MPs than any of his rivals and unless there is a political upset of earthquake proportions he will be one of the two candidates on the ballot when the Tory membership has its vote. Polls suggest there is goodwill and excitement in the party grassroots at the thought of Prime Minister Johnson. The race is his to lose. This is a mighty comeback for the former Mayor of London. His time as Foreign Secretary featured regular moments of controversy and there was talk of a determined campaign among MPs to stop him succeeding Theresa May. The key change in recent weeks is that the rise of the Brexit Party has shot fear through Conservative ranks.
JUN19	Attacks in the Gulf of Oman show that Iran is desperate, says TIM NEWARK	BY attacking tankers delivering oil and threatening to increase weapons-grade uranium production, Iran is ramping up tensions in the Gulf and bullying the rest of the world. The United States is right to respond proportionately by sending a thousand more troops to the area and we should stand by them.    Never ones to shy away from naked blackmail, the Iranian leadership is trying to intimidate EU countries to break ranks with our top ally by saying next week they will violate their agreed limit on producing uranium stockpiles that could be used to arm nuclear missiles. Let's hope Germany, France and the rest don't lose their nerve and cave into Iran's demands to circumvent the sanctions imposed by President Trump. But I wouldn't hold my breath. The fact that Iran is getting desperate by attacking shipping in international waters is a sure sign that Trump's sanctions are biting deep into its economy. Its oil exports are down by 80 per cent and inflation rampant. Riots in the streets could bring down the dictatorship and they know it.

JUN20	We need some Old Etonians to teach us how to get on in life, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	TO the playing fields of Eton, to prepare for the next battle of Waterloo! Only kidding: that applies only to the people who actually studied there, but I was there for the 4th of June, which was actually held on the 15th of June. It's called that to commemorate King George III's birthday, though the school was actually founded by Henry VI.    Confused? You soon will be. Toto, we're not in Kansas, any more. The 4th of June is what any other school would call an open day, but since this is Eton, nothing is done as practised elsewhere. I am fortunate enough to have a godson at the school which is why I was there and I spent about as much time worrying about my outfit as I would have done under normal circumstances for a white tie do. You can tell when you're getting close to Eton as the roads suddenly fill up with Bentleys. Fortnum & Mason's hampers peer out of classic cars. One of the events at the school involves beagles. If you are looking for a glass of fizz, you are in the right place.
JUN20	BBC’s dire debate was a new low in dismal contest, says LEO McKINSTRY	SO far the Tory leadership contest has not been distinguished by either the calibre of the candidates or the quality of ideas. But a new low point was reached with the BBC's shambolic debate on Tuesday night, which was a dismal advertisement for the state of British politics.    Amid all the noise and virtue signalling, no contender looked truly prime ministerial. In an event that generated more heat than light, none of the five exuded statesmanship or put forward credible policies. A central part of the problem was the dismal format of the show. Everything was wrong about it, from the set design to the style of questioning. The five besuited candidates were perched awkwardly on white plastic stools, looking like members of a boy band during an acrimonious split on their final tour. Rory Stewart, the most maverick candidate, was so uncomfortable that he tried to relieve his physical tension by removing his tie and indulging in a bizarre series of stretches.

Polls suggest there is goodwill and excitement in the party grassroots at the thought of Prime Minister Johnson. The race is his to lose. This is a mighty comeback for the former Mayor of London. His time as Foreign Secretary featured regular moments of controversy and there was talk of a determined campaign among MPs to stop him succeeding Theresa May. The key change in recent weeks is that the rise of the Brexit Party has shot fear through Conservative ranks.
JUN20	Attacks in the Gulf of Oman show that Iran is desperate, says TIM NEWARK	BY attacking tankers delivering oil and threatening to increase weapons-grade uranium production, Iran is ramping up tensions in the Gulf and bullying the rest of the world. The United States is right to respond proportionately by sending a thousand more troops to the area and we should stand by them.    Never ones to shy away from naked blackmail, the Iranian leadership is trying to intimidate EU countries to break ranks with our top ally by saying next week they will violate their agreed limit on producing uranium stockpiles that could be used to arm nuclear missiles. Let's hope Germany, France and the rest don't lose their nerve and cave into Iran's demands to circumvent the sanctions imposed by President Trump. But I wouldn't hold my breath. The fact that Iran is getting desperate by attacking shipping in international waters is a sure sign that Trump's sanctions are biting deep into its economy. Its oil exports are down by 80 per cent and inflation rampant. Riots in the streets could bring down the dictatorship and they know it.
JUN20	TV leadership debates are helping the Tories to focus, says STEPHEN POLLARD	WELL, tonight's the night – if you're into that sort of thing. I'm talking about the BBC debate between the remaining Conservative leadership contenders – those still in the running after today’s ballot among MPs. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUN20	New eyes on our care homes – EXPRESS COMMENT	THE care home industry is a tough sector.The duty of care to vulnerable people is vital, but margins are tight, and staffing difficult to maintain.    Which is why The Daily Express applauds plans to increase CCTV in care homes. As well as offering protection from less than scrupulous staff, this measure is also set to save the NHS £370million a year from call-outs. It is supported by key people such as the thoughtful Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock and Jayne Connery, from the Care Campaign for the Vulnerable. Yes, there are privacy issues about CCTV and a worthy debate is taking place. Some care homes have ploughed ahead on their own: others have resisted. But we had those debates before in terms of crime, and few now cavil about CCTV in our streets. Plus, it protects staff from vexatious claims as well as patients - and saves money. Let's get on with it.
JUN20	Corbyn's kneejerk appeasement just enables our enemy, says LEO MCKINSTRY	IN THE history of British democracy, there has never been an opposition leader as dangerous as Jeremy Corbyn. With his Marxist ideology, he is a clear menace to our economic prosperity. But just as worryingly, his puerile anti-Western outlook makes him a deadly risk to our national security.    That truth has been graphically illustrated by his enfeebled response to the escalating crisis in the Gulf of Oman. In recent days, tensions have been rising between the United States and Iran after last week's two attacks on a Japanese and a Norwegian tanker near the Straits of Hormuz. Backed up by video footage - taken by a US drone - which appears to show Iranian Revolutionary Guards handling a limpet mine at the side of the damaged Japanese vessel, Washington blamed the twin assaults on Tehran. It was backed up by our own Foreign Office, which claimed that "no other state or non-state actor could plausibly have been responsible". But Corbyn, wallowing in his usual sympathy for our enemies, took a very different line. Having wailed about the lack of "credible evidence" from the USA, he condemned the British Government for rhetoric that "will only increase the threat of war". That stance is typical.
JUN21	The dangerous European Army idea marches on in Brussels, blasts FREDERICK FORSYTH	OVER in Germany the Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen is happy to talk about the (apparently) pending European Defence Union. But here the entire matter is shrouded in veils of secrecy.    Basically the EDU is another huge plank in the structure coming shortly out of the European Union which marches steadily onwards to its endgame - the complete unification of the continent in every aspect.
JUN21	The Tories must stop tearing each other into shreds, says ROSS CLARK	SO finally we are down to two candidates for the Conservative leadership, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, whose names will be put to the party's 160,000 members. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUN21	We need some Old Etonians to teach us how to get on in life, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	TO the playing fields of Eton, to prepare for the next battle of Waterloo! Only kidding: that applies only to the people who actually studied there, but I was there for the 4th of June, which was actually held on the 15th of June. It's called that to commemorate King George III's birthday, though the school was actually founded by Henry VI.    Confused? You soon will be. Toto, we're not in Kansas, any more. The 4th of June is what any other school would call an open day, but since this is Eton, nothing is done as practised elsewhere. I am fortunate enough to have a godson at the school which is why I was there and I spent about as much time worrying about my outfit as I would have done under normal circumstances for a white tie do. You can tell when you're getting close to Eton as the roads suddenly fill up with Bentleys. Fortnum & Mason's hampers peer out of classic cars. One of the events at the school involves beagles. If you are looking for a glass of fizz, you are in the right place.
JUN21	BBC’s dire debate was a new low in dismal contest, says LEO McKINSTRY	SO far the Tory leadership contest has not been distinguished by either the calibre of the candidates or the quality of ideas. But a new low point was reached with the BBC's shambolic debate on Tuesday night, which was a dismal advertisement for the state of British politics.    Amid all the noise and virtue signalling, no contender looked truly prime ministerial. In an event that generated more heat than light, none of the five exuded statesmanship or put forward credible policies. A central part of the problem was the dismal format of the show. Everything was wrong about it, from the set design to the style of questioning. The five besuited candidates were perched awkwardly on white plastic stools, looking like members of a boy band during an acrimonious split on their final tour. Rory Stewart, the most maverick candidate, was so uncomfortable that he tried to relieve his physical tension by removing his tie and indulging in a bizarre series of stretches.
JUN21	Children should be taught to think for themselves, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	I may not approve of much that is spouted by Professor Richard Dawkins, the atheist academic, but a while ago he made a statement which must have resonated with anybody and everybody who has to expound views in public. He said that more effort should be made to teach children how to think in order that they might learn to analyse arguments and apply critical thought.    Mohammed Amin, the chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum, must be wishing the media in this country had been obliged to take such a course. He has been accused of comparing Boris Johnson to Hitler. He did no such thing. Mr Amin was strongly criticising Boris Johnson on the Today programme when the interviewer pointed to Bojo's popularity, whereupon he cited Hitler as proof that popularity does not always guarantee the right result. What he was doing was challenging the notion of popularity as a measure of desirability, not saying that Boris Johnson was like Hitler. I once said in a radio interview that women can take more care of their handbags on a night out than of their own persons.

JUN22	Boris must prove he can get his house in order - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE reason so many people either love or hate Boris Johnson is because he is spectacular in everything he does. He is not a normal politician, he is colourful with his language and dazzling as a personality. But his private life seems to be even more dramatic.    The latest story of a row at the flat he shares with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds is another episode in a political career that leaps from the sublime to the ridiculous. We should note the police said no action was necessary. However, this is a man running for the highest office in the land. It is not a rock star going off the rails, this is a politician who could soon be making profound decisions for this country.
JUN22	Inside Politics: Rivalry in court of King Boris	BEFORE the king's coronation, the chieftains of the Tory tribes are already bending the knee to their leader-in-waiting. Boris Johnson begins the final round of his battle for the Tory crown with his first head-to-head hustings debate against rival Jeremy Hunt in Birmingham today.    Yet for most of the party's MPs, the leadership contest is effectively over. The bartering for the spoils of victory has begun. Tory factions including the purist Brexiteers of the European Research Group (ERG), the socially liberal "Cameroon" admirers of David Cameron and Esther McVey's Blue Collar Conservatives seeking to direct the party towards working-class voters are vying for ministerial jobs and policy guarantees in the incoming administration.

JUN25	Phoney row detracts from the real task ahead - EXPRESS COMMENT	AS THE politicianThomas Babington Macaulay said in 1830: "We know no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one of its periodical fits of morality." Particularly one that is politically motivated.    And Boris Johnson's domestic spat with his partner Carrie Symonds has been blown out of all proportion. The past few days have seen a blockade outside Ms Symonds's flat and a disproportionate amount of hot air for an incident that hasn't even attracted more than passing police attention. Now, after a weekend of vilification, voices are being raised on the leadership frontrunner's behalf. Fellow Tory MPs Nadine Dorries, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg are standing up for Boris, as are 90 per cent of Daily Express readers in a phone poll. That's important, as this storm in a teacup is detracting from the matters at hand. Let's now get back to the real issue - choosing the right leader and preparing the country for Brexit.
JUN25	Boris Johnson’s tiff with Carrie Symonds teaches us a home truth, says VANESSA FELTZ	LET'S forget politics and get personal. I don't know quite how judgmental you feel about the Bojo row-gate but I wonder how any of us would fare if our neighbours were standing by, smartphones against the wall, poised to record the slightest hint of a fracas? I first sprang to the exalted heights of infamy on afternoon telly in the prehistoric 1990s.    When people spotted me in the cheese aisle at Sainsbury's they'd look horrified or thrilled and say "Blimey! It's her. I wish I had my camera".They'd then ferret about in their bags for an old bus ticket I could autograph. The mobile phone's changed all that. For Joe Public, the invention is nothing short of miraculous. For those in the public eye, though, misery ensued. Never again could they venture out without full make-up, oversized sunglasses and a remit to behave impeccably. Never again would people be cameraless.
JUN25	There’s nothing inevitable about this race to top of the greasy pole, says STEPHEN POLLARD	THE greatest mistake any political commentator can make is to assume that anything is inevitable. I speak from some chastened experience: before the 2017 election, I would have bet my mortgage on Jeremy Corbyn leading Labour to electoral disaster. He lost, for sure. But with 40 percent of the vote, it was no disaster. Mr Corbyn secured his leadership.    Last week the assumption of pretty much everyone whose surname isn't Hunt was that it was inevitable that Boris Johnson would secure the Conservative leadership. His personal foibles and refusal to debate properly with his opponents had been "priced in" as they say, by Tory members. It was even being said that Mr Johnson's supporters had voted for Jeremy Hunt in the final MPs' ballot last week to ensure that their favoured candidate faced a weak opponent. By Saturday, all that had changed after a recording emerged of Mr Johnson rowing with his girlfriend. Jeremy Hunt's supporters now have a spring in their step and the question increasingly being asked is whether, once you strip away the Boris pantomime act, there is anything left worth having.

JUN25	Tory leader race: Boris must stop giving his foes ammunition - LEO MCKINSTRY	THIS should be a golden summer for Boris Johnson.

JUN25	BBC BIAS: How left-leaning and sinister Beeb was exposed at Tory debate, says NICK FERRARI	AS THE closing credits rolled, your thoughts immediately turned to shambles and cock-up.

JUN25	Brexit shame: How last three years show why Westminster can't be trusted - NIGEL FARAGE	TODAY is the third anniversary of the day Britain voted Leave in the EU referendum. In numbers that’s 17.4 million votes. Three years. No Brexit. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUN25	Boris must prove he can get his house in order - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE reason so many people either love or hate Boris Johnson is because he is spectacular in everything he does. He is not a normal politician, he is colourful with his language and dazzling as a personality. But his private life seems to be even more dramatic.    The latest story of a row at the flat he shares with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds is another episode in a political career that leaps from the sublime to the ridiculous. We should note the police said no action was necessary. However, this is a man running for the highest office in the land. It is not a rock star going off the rails, this is a politician who could soon be making profound decisions for this country.
JUN26	The elderly must not miss out on pension credits - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE scandal of pensioner poverty is an injustice that risks becoming much worse if free TV licences for older citizens are axed.    Today, more than a million people have been missing out on help worth around £7billion by not signing-up for Pension Credits to which they are entitled. Citizens are living in hardship because the equivalent of £10million a day goes unclaimed. It is a disgrace that so many pensioners who have contributed so much to this nation are not getting the support to which they are entitled - but it is an outrage that their plight might get even more difficult. Pensioners aged over 75 will lose their free television licences from June 2020 unless they are claiming the benefit.
JUN26	Boris Johnson: This privacy invasion is too close to home, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	IF Boris Johnson's neighbours, Eve Leigh and Tom Penn, had intercepted and recorded a telephone conversation between him and his girlfriend they would have broken the law, but they can with impunity record something which happens in someone's home and give it to a national newspaper.    The woman sounds like the neighbour from hell anyway with her allegedly making rude signs at people she dislikes and her complete indifference to the impact her actions might have on Carrie Symonds herself, who, if reports are true, has been harassed out of her own home. The bigger issue, however, is that of privacy. All of us, whether public figures or private individuals, should feel safe in our own homes and not fear surveillance from nosy neighbours. Johnson's girlfriend Miss Symonds can never feel like that again in her present flat. That should make Leigh and Penn ashamed if they have any humanity at all. Yet the unpleasant neighbours are not the only villains of the drama. Jeremy Hunt wants his rival to "explain" why the police were called but we already know the answer to that. He is simply exploiting a private situation and has plummeted in my estimation of him as a human being.
JUN26	Anti-Brexit attack on Boris Johnson is the new ‘Project Fear’, says TIM NEWARK	FROM anarchist protesters outside his girlfriend's London flat to sniping from his snooty former newspaper boss, Boris Johnson is facing an onslaught of EU-fanatics who will say and do anything to halt the election of a Brexiteer as our next prime minister. Shameful does not do it full justice – it is quite clearly an attempt to bully Tory party members into choosing another Remainer as their leader. It is yet another version of Project Fear and Boris needs to come out fighting.    The old Communist bloc couldn't have recruited better agents than the neighbours who recorded the private goings-on in Carrie Symonds's apartment, then informed the police and an anti-Brexit newspaper. Class War activists subsequently besieged the home, forcing both Boris and Miss Symonds to flee. Can you imagine the furore if Brexit campaigners had forced any prominent Remainer to leave their home? But somehow it's okay for Left-wingers to harass and intimidate politicians they don't like. Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose own children were accosted by Class War activists outside his home, is right to say: "The aggression of the hard Left is really appalling and not how British politics has normally been carried out." But then the full might of the Remain establishment has piled in too, inflating a simple row over wine spilt on a sofa into a demonstration of Boris being unfit to govern. The leading elitist snob on this front is ex-newspaper editor Sir Max Hastings whose arrogant pronouncements on Brexit are legendary. "For many of us," Hastings pompously declares, "his elevation will signal Britain's abandonment of any claim to be a serious country." That has already happened, mate, thanks to Remainers conspiring to betray the referendum result.
JUN26	Phoney row detracts from the real task ahead - EXPRESS COMMENT	AS THE politicianThomas Babington Macaulay said in 1830: "We know no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one of its periodical fits of morality." Particularly one that is politically motivated.    And Boris Johnson's domestic spat with his partner Carrie Symonds has been blown out of all proportion. The past few days have seen a blockade outside Ms Symonds's flat and a disproportionate amount of hot air for an incident that hasn't even attracted more than passing police attention. Now, after a weekend of vilification, voices are being raised on the leadership frontrunner's behalf. Fellow Tory MPs Nadine Dorries, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg are standing up for Boris, as are 90 per cent of Daily Express readers in a phone poll. That's important, as this storm in a teacup is detracting from the matters at hand. Let's now get back to the real issue - choosing the right leader and preparing the country for Brexit.
JUN26	Boris Johnson’s tiff with Carrie Symonds teaches us a home truth, says VANESSA FELTZ	LET'S forget politics and get personal. I don't know quite how judgmental you feel about the Bojo row-gate but I wonder how any of us would fare if our neighbours were standing by, smartphones against the wall, poised to record the slightest hint of a fracas? I first sprang to the exalted heights of infamy on afternoon telly in the prehistoric 1990s.    When people spotted me in the cheese aisle at Sainsbury's they'd look horrified or thrilled and say "Blimey! It's her. I wish I had my camera".They'd then ferret about in their bags for an old bus ticket I could autograph. The mobile phone's changed all that. For Joe Public, the invention is nothing short of miraculous. For those in the public eye, though, misery ensued. Never again could they venture out without full make-up, oversized sunglasses and a remit to behave impeccably. Never again would people be cameraless.
JUN26	There’s nothing inevitable about this race to top of the greasy pole, says STEPHEN POLLARD	THE greatest mistake any political commentator can make is to assume that anything is inevitable. I speak from some chastened experience: before the 2017 election, I would have bet my mortgage on Jeremy Corbyn leading Labour to electoral disaster. He lost, for sure. But with 40 percent of the vote, it was no disaster. Mr Corbyn secured his leadership.    Last week the assumption of pretty much everyone whose surname isn't Hunt was that it was inevitable that Boris Johnson would secure the Conservative leadership. His personal foibles and refusal to debate properly with his opponents had been "priced in" as they say, by Tory members. It was even being said that Mr Johnson's supporters had voted for Jeremy Hunt in the final MPs' ballot last week to ensure that their favoured candidate faced a weak opponent. By Saturday, all that had changed after a recording emerged of Mr Johnson rowing with his girlfriend. Jeremy Hunt's supporters now have a spring in their step and the question increasingly being asked is whether, once you strip away the Boris pantomime act, there is anything left worth having.
JUN26	Memo to the candidates: Brexit plans needed now – EXPRESS COMMENT	IT SEEMS as if theTory leadership race has been going for ages. Well buckle up: there's still almost a month to run before we find out the winner on July 22. And amid all the cacophony about domestic spats and scores, there remains a disturbing lack of clarity about the single most pressing issue of all: how this "orderly" Brexit we are always promised will actually be delivered.    One of the two remaining candidates, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, will preside over the delivery of Brexit by Halloween this year. Johnson has said he'll contemplate a no-deal Brexit while Hunt would apparently allow an extension.
JUN26	Content-free Boris must find policies and sparkle to win, says LEO McKINSTRY	AT THE Tory leadership hustings on Saturday, the first question Boris Johnson faced was inevitably about the explosive revelations of a row with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds at their south London home. Despite the involvement of the police and the media firestorm engulfing his campaign, he was dismissive of the controversy: "I don't think people want to hear about that. I think they want to hear about my plans for the country and the party," he declared. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

JUN27	Why Glastonbury is just so ghastly, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	THE weather forecast looks ghastly: the sun is set to shine. Normally I welcome the sun along with the best of them, but on the odd occasion a washout is devoutly to be hoped for and this is one of 'em. Yup, it's the Glastonbury Festival again.    Is there any other occasion in the British calendar that can even begin to equal this smugfest? The eco-conscious chattering classes out in full, leaving mountains of waste badly paid workers are forced to clear up afterwards? The growing vegan element – "Vegans are well catered for!" say the organisers – who don't seem to have noticed it's happening on a dairy farm? The celebs in designer wellies, taking time out from carbon footprint protests to fly in by helicopter, camp in five-star yurts and pretend to be one of us? I have never been to Glastonbury or any pop music festival and quite frankly I can't imagine anything worse. All those compost loos and lack of sanitary facilities. I was once told of one festival-goer who didn't attend such jamborees with his girlfriend "because women like to wash" (not all women, judging from the pictures of the crowd).
JUN27	Go deliver Brexit...and reach out to your people – EXPRESS COMMENT	WHEN a new Conservative Party leader is named on July 22 and becomes Prime Minister, Daily Express readers will be expecting somebody who has a grasp of policy and will deliver. So it is good to see Jeremy Hunt strongly in favour of our campaign to ensure all over-75s continue to get a free TV licence.    The Foreign Secretary was right to address readers personally in today's newspaper on important issues for us all – including support for another campaign to ensure victims of cystic fibrosis get the medication they need. Both he and Boris Johnson understand that in the end, this leadership election must be about the nitty gritty of policy. This country needs a prime minister with the humanity and understanding to take the UK forward with a post-Brexit vision.
JUN27	A pact would work between the Tories and the Brexit Party, says LEO McKINSTRY	WHATEVER the outcome of the Tory leadership contest, the political crisis over Brexit will continue. The victor will immediately be confronted by the reality of a Remain-dominated Parliament, devoid of a Conservative majority. If Jeremy Hunt causes a major upset and wins, he is likely to pursue some kind of compromise along the lines of Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement.    But her experience repeatedly proved that there is little support in the Commons for such an arrangement. As one of the key architects of the referendum victory, Boris Johnson brings far more ebullience and conviction to the cause of securing British independence from EU rule. Yet if he tries to push through a no deal Brexit, he will almost certainly be blocked by MPs, including many from his own party. Some argue that the way round the Westminster obstacle is to ignore it. Theoretically, this could be done by suspending – or proroguing – the Commons, then implementing Brexit by an executive order. But such a step would be an outrage in a land that is supposed to be the Mother of Parliaments. It smacks of totalitarianism. The whole point of Brexit is to bring back Parliamentary sovereignty, not destroy it.

JUN28	Yes, I really can tell the future of the EU, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	SINCE the beginning of time Man has permitted himself one abiding vanity - the conviction that there is a way of foretelling the future.    Ancient ancestors cast chicken entrails on a floor, later pieces of bone that they called the runes. So-called soothsayers were summoned to detect in the patterns what was going to happen next. Ninety percent of the time they were completely wrong...and still are. Then we asked oracles to go into trances and enlighten us. More bunkum. In 1919 an American in Leningrad cabled home 'I have seen the future and it works.' He was half-right. He was watching Lenin's Communist revolution. It dominated 70 percent of the people of the planet for 70 years. It murdered 100 million humans, but it never worked. Right now we have ponderous asses in politics and economics preaching ruin for our country if we do not do this or that - usually involving dedicating ourselves to the European Union.
JUN28	No payment holiday for health tourists, says CAROLE MALONE	You’d think doctors would be smart people.I thought so too, until this week when 500 of them voted to stop charging foreign tourists for health service treatment, claiming it was racist and should be free. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUN28	At last... the fresh ideas to start Britain's revival - EXPRESS COMMENT	BREXIT was never an end in itself, it was always a necessary path for a better country and an improvement in the quality of our lives.    So it is excellent to see that Boris Johnson has clearly understood and is now articulating it in his leadership campaign. The former London mayor's pledge to revive our high streets will be welcome and should, if he becomes Prime Minister, breathe new life into our communities. It is part of a more optimistic, positive attitude to what this country can be and how life here can be so much better.
JUN28	Points system will prove immigration is good for Britain, says ROSS CLARK	IF Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister his premiership will inevitably be judged on one thing above all else - whether he succeeds in achieving Brexit without causing disruption to the economy.    But yesterday he laid out what could be the foundations of an equally important legacy - to turn migration into something which the vast majority of us welcome rather than see as a threat. Boris's not entirely original idea is for an Australian-style points system. Rather than designed to keep people out, as Theresa May's now-infamous "hostile environment" policy did, it would actively seek people who are well-qualified and have the skills to contribute to the economy. Points would be granted for migrants who had qualifications which are lacking among the population, who had a firm job offer and who had good English. People who failed to meet the criteria would not be rejected so much as invited to acquire the necessary skills. At the same time, migrants would no longer be able to claim benefits from the moment they arrived - as happens now with European Union citizens.

JUN29	Inside Politics: Could Michael Gove have an epic finale?	AS an aficionado of both Wagnerian opera and Game Of Thrones, Michael Gove has a taste for following dark plots that unfold on an epic scale. His own political saga threatens to take a suitably macabre twist next week as the bloodletting begins in the quest for the Tory crown.    Thursday's first ballot of MPs in the leadership contest is expected to cut down the phalanx of candidates as mercilessly as the sword wielded by Siegfried, the hero in Wagner's Ring Cycle. The climax of the battle is shaping up to be a titanic three-way struggle between the Environment Secretary, his one-time Vote Leave comrade-in-arms Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt for a place in the final run-off among Tory members. Mr Gove's only viable path to the Tory throne is keeping runaway favourite Mr Johnson off that final ballot.
JUN29	Council parking charges are killing high streets	THE revelation that council parking charges and fines have passed the £1billion mark is an indictment on the attitude the authorities have towards motorists and local economies.    This war on drivers is simply another tax and an excuse to hoover in even more money from hardworking people. And no wonder the high streets are dying before our eyes if people are faced with a parking ticket every time they dare head out to go shopping. Much of this is done under the guise of "green measures" but the reality is that councils see motorists as easy targets to rake in extra revenue.
JUN29	Vladimir Putin: Don't be fooled by the tough guy act, he's history	WHEN the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Vladimir Putin was a KGB agent attached to the Russian consulate in Dresden. Angry demonstrators in the city first ransacked the offices of the Stasi, the hated East German secret police, before turning their attention to the building occupied by Major Putin and his comrades.    But Putin had no intention of allowing the KGB's sensitive files to fall into the hands of its enemies. Standing at the top of the stairs leading up to the office, he brandished a pistol at the crowd and said in fluent German: "This is Soviet territory and you're standing on our border," before adding: "I'm serious when I say that I will shoot trespassers." His threat had the desired effect and Putin's colleagues were left in peace to complete their document shredding.
JUN29	Inside Politics: The other top job up for grabs	AMID the high-profile battle between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership another more discreet contest is taking place at Westminster.    Candidates to be the next chancellor will ultimately have to win just one vote - that of the incoming prime minister - to clinch the job. Given the Brexit challenges piling up at the Treasury, the victor faces a gruelling task. In the unlikely event of an upset in the leadership contest putting Mr Hunt into Downing Street, his key supporter Amber Rudd is tipped to become the country's first woman chancellor. 
JUN29	Yes, I really can tell the future of the EU, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	SINCE the beginning of time Man has permitted himself one abiding vanity - the conviction that there is a way of foretelling the future.    Ancient ancestors cast chicken entrails on a floor, later pieces of bone that they called the runes. So-called soothsayers were summoned to detect in the patterns what was going to happen next. Ninety percent of the time they were completely wrong...and still are. Then we asked oracles to go into trances and enlighten us. More bunkum. In 1919 an American in Leningrad cabled home 'I have seen the future and it works.' He was half-right. He was watching Lenin's Communist revolution. It dominated 70 percent of the people of the planet for 70 years. It murdered 100 million humans, but it never worked. Right now we have ponderous asses in politics and economics preaching ruin for our country if we do not do this or that - usually involving dedicating ourselves to the European Union.
JUN29	No payment holiday for health tourists, says CAROLE MALONE	You’d think doctors would be smart people.I thought so too, until this week when 500 of them voted to stop charging foreign tourists for health service treatment, claiming it was racist and should be free. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUN29	At last... the fresh ideas to start Britain's revival - EXPRESS COMMENT	BREXIT was never an end in itself, it was always a necessary path for a better country and an improvement in the quality of our lives.    So it is excellent to see that Boris Johnson has clearly understood and is now articulating it in his leadership campaign. The former London mayor's pledge to revive our high streets will be welcome and should, if he becomes Prime Minister, breathe new life into our communities. It is part of a more optimistic, positive attitude to what this country can be and how life here can be so much better.
JUN29	Points system will prove immigration is good for Britain, says ROSS CLARK	IF Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister his premiership will inevitably be judged on one thing above all else - whether he succeeds in achieving Brexit without causing disruption to the economy.    But yesterday he laid out what could be the foundations of an equally important legacy - to turn migration into something which the vast majority of us welcome rather than see as a threat. Boris's not entirely original idea is for an Australian-style points system. Rather than designed to keep people out, as Theresa May's now-infamous "hostile environment" policy did, it would actively seek people who are well-qualified and have the skills to contribute to the economy. Points would be granted for migrants who had qualifications which are lacking among the population, who had a firm job offer and who had good English. People who failed to meet the criteria would not be rejected so much as invited to acquire the necessary skills. At the same time, migrants would no longer be able to claim benefits from the moment they arrived - as happens now with European Union citizens.
JUN29	Why Glastonbury is just so ghastly, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	THE weather forecast looks ghastly: the sun is set to shine. Normally I welcome the sun along with the best of them, but on the odd occasion a washout is devoutly to be hoped for and this is one of 'em. Yup, it's the Glastonbury Festival again.    Is there any other occasion in the British calendar that can even begin to equal this smugfest? The eco-conscious chattering classes out in full, leaving mountains of waste badly paid workers are forced to clear up afterwards? The growing vegan element – "Vegans are well catered for!" say the organisers – who don't seem to have noticed it's happening on a dairy farm? The celebs in designer wellies, taking time out from carbon footprint protests to fly in by helicopter, camp in five-star yurts and pretend to be one of us? I have never been to Glastonbury or any pop music festival and quite frankly I can't imagine anything worse. All those compost loos and lack of sanitary facilities. I was once told of one festival-goer who didn't attend such jamborees with his girlfriend "because women like to wash" (not all women, judging from the pictures of the crowd).
JUN30	Doctors can really damage our health, says NICK FERRARI	IT WAS just a few months ago that doctors and other medical staff were queuing up to tell us it was highly likely the NHS would not survive the winter.    Cuts in real term funding, record levels of demand, an ageing population, crowded wards and a collapsing social care system meant our much cherished institution might not make it it to the spring. While this should rightly exercise all of us, you’d be excused for thinking that those most affected would be the doctors, clinicians and others who actually work in the service, and who would have the keenest interest in ensuring that every penny that could be found was, and that any saving that could be made was put into place. All of which makes the decision taken last week at the Belfast conference of the British Medical Association all the more baffling. Around 500 delegates voted overwhelmingly in favour of abandoning the practice of charging overseas patients for NHS services. Indeed, some of these medics even agreed that “charging migrants for accessing NHS services is a fundamentally racist endeavour” adding they were “complicit in racism”.
JUN30	Labour crisis over anti-Semitism is all down to Corbyn	THE FIASCO last week surrounding the hard-Left Labour MP Chris Williamson is yet another sad chapter in the appalling story of the party’s ongoing anti-Semitism crisis.    Williamson has repeatedly baited the Jewish community by ridiculing allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and casting doubt on the motives of both victims and those attempting to battle it. In February, just days after the young Jewish MP Luciana Berger was driven to leave the party, Williamson suggested that Labour had been “too apologetic” in its response to anti-Semitism. He was suspended.
JUN30	Queen’s message to politicians hits home	FOR MORE than 67 years the Queen has not been just the head of state, she has also been the pole star for this country. Her dignified reign has quietly but assuredly kept Britain on the right lines through some turbulent times.    This has been done without the need for flamboyant public interventions but through a diligence in her role and a strong sense of duty. So when the Queen makes one of her rare public interventions we should all listen, because it comes after much consideration. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament to mark its 20th anniversary, she reminded the elected members there that parliament is not just about talking, it’s about listening and honouring each other’s views. More than that, it is about putting talk into action. 
JUN30	I will fight tooth and nail to get us out, Brexit Party MEP ANNUNZIATA REES-MOGG says	TOMORROW I will be travelling from Lincolnshire to Strasbourg. A journey of nearly nine hours to an institution which the British delegates should have left months ago. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUN30	Inside Politics: Could Michael Gove have an epic finale?	AS an aficionado of both Wagnerian opera and Game Of Thrones, Michael Gove has a taste for following dark plots that unfold on an epic scale. His own political saga threatens to take a suitably macabre twist next week as the bloodletting begins in the quest for the Tory crown.    Thursday's first ballot of MPs in the leadership contest is expected to cut down the phalanx of candidates as mercilessly as the sword wielded by Siegfried, the hero in Wagner's Ring Cycle. The climax of the battle is shaping up to be a titanic three-way struggle between the Environment Secretary, his one-time Vote Leave comrade-in-arms Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt for a place in the final run-off among Tory members. Mr Gove's only viable path to the Tory throne is keeping runaway favourite Mr Johnson off that final ballot.
JUN30	Council parking charges are killing high streets	THE revelation that council parking charges and fines have passed the £1billion mark is an indictment on the attitude the authorities have towards motorists and local economies.    This war on drivers is simply another tax and an excuse to hoover in even more money from hardworking people. And no wonder the high streets are dying before our eyes if people are faced with a parking ticket every time they dare head out to go shopping. Much of this is done under the guise of "green measures" but the reality is that councils see motorists as easy targets to rake in extra revenue.
JUN30	Vladimir Putin: Don't be fooled by the tough guy act, he's history	WHEN the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Vladimir Putin was a KGB agent attached to the Russian consulate in Dresden. Angry demonstrators in the city first ransacked the offices of the Stasi, the hated East German secret police, before turning their attention to the building occupied by Major Putin and his comrades.    But Putin had no intention of allowing the KGB's sensitive files to fall into the hands of its enemies. Standing at the top of the stairs leading up to the office, he brandished a pistol at the crowd and said in fluent German: "This is Soviet territory and you're standing on our border," before adding: "I'm serious when I say that I will shoot trespassers." His threat had the desired effect and Putin's colleagues were left in peace to complete their document shredding.
JUN30	Inside Politics: The other top job up for grabs	AMID the high-profile battle between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership another more discreet contest is taking place at Westminster.    Candidates to be the next chancellor will ultimately have to win just one vote - that of the incoming prime minister - to clinch the job. Given the Brexit challenges piling up at the Treasury, the victor faces a gruelling task. In the unlikely event of an upset in the leadership contest putting Mr Hunt into Downing Street, his key supporter Amber Rudd is tipped to become the country's first woman chancellor.

JUL1	Motor neurone disease is terminal – let’s stop punishing the sufferers	AS YOU'RE reading this, sit still. Imagine you can't get up. You can't lift your hand to scratch your nose. You can't pick up the cup of tea beside you. You can't roll your sleeves up. And you have no voice to ask for help. This is the reality for people living with motor neurone disease (MND). It may be they haven't reached this stage yet – they may still be able to speak, or walk or move their arms.    But eventually, the disease will rob them of those abilities. And there is no cure, so they will die. Yet, according to the rules, they may still not be entitled to access the fast-track process to claim welfare benefits – because they are not terminally ill enough. To access the Special Rules for Terminal Illness (SRTI) a person with MND or any other terminal illness needs a form signed by their clinician confirming they "have a reasonable expectation of death within six months". If only terminal illnesses were that predictable.
JUL1	Tory Brexit spenders! Everyone is reaching for the magic money tree, says LEO McKINSTRY	SPEAKING to the 1983 Tory Conference about her tough approach to state expenditure, Margaret Thatcher declared: "It is no good thinking that someone else will pay. That someone else is you. There is no such thing as Government money. There is only taxpayers' money." The Iron Lady was absolutely right. National prosperity cannot be built on debt.    Sound money is an essential ingredient of secure, long-term economic growth. That was proved dramatically in the late 1970s, just before Mrs Thatcher arrived in power when the profligate Labour Government dragged Britain near to bankruptcy. Yet her wisdom seems to have been forgotten in the current Tory leadership contest, which has so far been distinguished by wishful thinking on Brexit and dangerous irresponsibility on finance. Indeed, the race is fast degenerating into a frenzied auction of unrealistic promises and expensive pledges. This runs counter to the spirit of the Conservatives, who have traditionally been regarded as the party of good housekeeping. They might be unsentimental, but they have tended to be prudent, ensuring that the country lives within its means.
JUL1	Theresa May backs Daily Express bid to help troubled youngsters – inspired by Diana	ASK the world's most successful people in any given field and chances are they'll be able to tell you about an individual who helped get them where they are today. Someone who inspired them to work harder advised them how to achieve more, and gave them the self-belief and support they needed to reach the top.    Meeting the right mentor at the right moment can make all the difference to a person's chances. But sadly, and through no fault of their own, too many young people in the UK today are growing up without that kind of positive role model in their lives. If we are going to make this a country that works for all of us – a country in which everyone can reach their potential and no child's prospects are limited by the circumstances into which they are born – then that has to change. And that means we can't just rely on some combination of providence and "old-school tie" networks to bring young people into contact with the mentors who could help shape their lives in positive ways. It's why, in 2016, the Government committed £70million to provide mentoring for pupils at 200 schools in disadvantaged areas.

JUL2	Decent role models are vital to tackle knife crime plague, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT'S difficult to know what is more shocking – the level of knife crime on our streets or the level of assaults on the police. This weekend there were four fatal stabbings in London alone, including 26-year-old Kelly Fauvrelle, who was eight months' pregnant. Away from London, a 47-year-old man was killed in Llanelli in Wales and a man in his 70s in Tonbridge, Kent.    So far this year, there have been 68 deaths from knife crime in London. According to the official statistics, there were 285 fatal stabbings in England and Wales in 2018 – the highest number since records began more than 70 years ago. The figures are truly appalling. But so, too, are some other statistics from a documentary shown last night on Channel 4. A staggering 80 percent of police say they have been attacked in the past year – and nearly a third say they have needed medical attention afterwards. Other figures reveal that a police officer is attacked on average every 20 minutes.

JUL3	Sometimes it's better to say nothing and concentrate on Brexit, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	LAST Wednesday I wondered why on earth I had re-entered politics, leaving behind my jolly, fun-filled retirement – and then the very next day I had the answer. Let us begin with the bad day. I gave a profile interview to a magazine I trusted and a journalist I like. By the time she left at four in the afternoon, I was ruing the day I ever decided to subject myself to that sort of thing again and also ruing that it was too early for a stiff gin and tonic.    She was less interested in Brexit than in my views on homosexuality. I told her I had never mentioned "cures" but when I casually remarked how glad I had been of the support of gay friends in the recent furore her eyes popped out of her head. I had gay friends? Yes, lots. Why not? Because surely they must be thinking I wanted to cure them. In my frustration I heard myself misphrase something and, although I corrected myself, knew that mischief could be done. Were that not enough she then pressed me on paedophilia in the Catholic church, my views on women priests (1992), remarks about climate change (2009) and my views on married priests, which she must have found disappointingly liberal. The present and future were of less interest. Then on Thursday I went down to the far end of Cornwall to talk to the fishermen of Newlyn and it was a striking reminder of the cause which had drawn me back into the political fray.
JUL3	Labour tax plans are the economics of the madhouse, says TIM NEWARK	SOCIAL mobility will be further hit under Labour proposals to stop families passing on their hard-earned money to their children with a Lifetime Gifts Tax. Any money passed on from parents to children beyond a total limit £125,000 during their lifetime will be taxed. That means a more severe form of inheritance tax would be introduced by a Labour government, way beyond the current 40 percent payable over a threshold of £475,000.    It is a fundamental desire of parents to help their children, and if they can do that while they are alive by giving them money to help buy a home, why should they be taxed again on money they've already paid tax on? It's a double tax whammy and could make it almost impossible for young people to buy a home of their own. Thanks to a decade of recklessly low-interest rates, property prices have spiralled beyond the reach of many young people. The proportion of young homeowners between 25 and 34 has fallen to 27 per cent from 65 percent just two decades ago. In the meantime renting has rocketed. Yet property ownership is the best engine of social mobility. Both my parents were born into poor working-class families who had only ever rented. But by working hard, scrimping and saving, they bought their own home, proudly paying off their mortgage and becoming middle-class.

JUL3	Theresa May backs Daily Express bid to help troubled youngsters – inspired by Diana	ASK the world's most successful people in any given field and chances are they'll be able to tell you about an individual who helped get them where they are today. Someone who inspired them to work harder advised them how to achieve more, and gave them the self-belief and support they needed to reach the top.    Meeting the right mentor at the right moment can make all the difference to a person's chances. But sadly, and through no fault of their own, too many young people in the UK today are growing up without that kind of positive role model in their lives. If we are going to make this a country that works for all of us – a country in which everyone can reach their potential and no child's prospects are limited by the circumstances into which they are born – then that has to change. And that means we can't just rely on some combination of providence and "old-school tie" networks to bring young people into contact with the mentors who could help shape their lives in positive ways. It's why, in 2016, the Government committed £70million to provide mentoring for pupils at 200 schools in disadvantaged areas.
JUL3	Doctors can really damage our health, says NICK FERRARI	IT WAS just a few months ago that doctors and other medical staff were queuing up to tell us it was highly likely the NHS would not survive the winter.    Cuts in real term funding, record levels of demand, an ageing population, crowded wards and a collapsing social care system meant our much cherished institution might not make it it to the spring. While this should rightly exercise all of us, you’d be excused for thinking that those most affected would be the doctors, clinicians and others who actually work in the service, and who would have the keenest interest in ensuring that every penny that could be found was, and that any saving that could be made was put into place. All of which makes the decision taken last week at the Belfast conference of the British Medical Association all the more baffling. Around 500 delegates voted overwhelmingly in favour of abandoning the practice of charging overseas patients for NHS services. Indeed, some of these medics even agreed that “charging migrants for accessing NHS services is a fundamentally racist endeavour” adding they were “complicit in racism”.
JUL3	Labour crisis over anti-Semitism is all down to Corbyn	THE FIASCO last week surrounding the hard-Left Labour MP Chris Williamson is yet another sad chapter in the appalling story of the party’s ongoing anti-Semitism crisis.    Williamson has repeatedly baited the Jewish community by ridiculing allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and casting doubt on the motives of both victims and those attempting to battle it. In February, just days after the young Jewish MP Luciana Berger was driven to leave the party, Williamson suggested that Labour had been “too apologetic” in its response to anti-Semitism. He was suspended.
JUL3	Queen’s message to politicians hits home	FOR MORE than 67 years the Queen has not been just the head of state, she has also been the pole star for this country. Her dignified reign has quietly but assuredly kept Britain on the right lines through some turbulent times.    This has been done without the need for flamboyant public interventions but through a diligence in her role and a strong sense of duty. So when the Queen makes one of her rare public interventions we should all listen, because it comes after much consideration. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament to mark its 20th anniversary, she reminded the elected members there that parliament is not just about talking, it’s about listening and honouring each other’s views. More than that, it is about putting talk into action. 
JUL3	I will fight tooth and nail to get us out, Brexit Party MEP ANNUNZIATA REES-MOGG says	TOMORROW I will be travelling from Lincolnshire to Strasbourg. A journey of nearly nine hours to an institution which the British delegates should have left months ago. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUL4	Fly me to the moon as long as I get pink champagne, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	TO WARSAW, for a long weekend, to sample the Polish ballet. Flying with BA, I booked myself into business class, because I'm worth it, and on boarding the plane I was asked by the man I was sitting beside if I would swap seats with his wife so that they could be together. Of course. No problem. I'm accommodating like that.    I also believe in karma and I was rewarded for my good deed almost immediately.
JUL4	Yet another stitch-up is taking place behind the EU’s closed doors, says LEO McKINSTRY	AFTER a visit in 1974 to the European Commission in Brussels, the Labour Cabinet Minister Tony Benn wrote in his diary: "I felt as if I was a slave going to Rome. The whole relationship was wrong. Here was I, an elected man who could be removed, and here were these people with more power than I had and no accountability to anyone."    His words have become even more pertinent as the European Union has grown in its quasi-imperial dominance. Today it is a vast bureaucratic monolith, crushing national identities and freedoms in its drive to build the federal superstate. It remains an unelected, unaccountable cabal, chosen through a cynical stitch-up rather than by the ballot box. That reality has been graphically exposed in recent days, as the leaders of the EU's member states gathered to decide who should fill the top jobs in Brussels once the regime of Jean-Claude Juncker, the current Commission President, ends in the autumn. Based on rampant cronyism rather than respect for democracy, the process was an unedifying as Juncker's bibulous leadership.
JUL4	Sometimes it's better to say nothing and concentrate on Brexit, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	LAST Wednesday I wondered why on earth I had re-entered politics, leaving behind my jolly, fun-filled retirement – and then the very next day I had the answer. Let us begin with the bad day. I gave a profile interview to a magazine I trusted and a journalist I like. By the time she left at four in the afternoon, I was ruing the day I ever decided to subject myself to that sort of thing again and also ruing that it was too early for a stiff gin and tonic.    She was less interested in Brexit than in my views on homosexuality. I told her I had never mentioned "cures" but when I casually remarked how glad I had been of the support of gay friends in the recent furore her eyes popped out of her head. I had gay friends? Yes, lots. Why not? Because surely they must be thinking I wanted to cure them. In my frustration I heard myself misphrase something and, although I corrected myself, knew that mischief could be done. Were that not enough she then pressed me on paedophilia in the Catholic church, my views on women priests (1992), remarks about climate change (2009) and my views on married priests, which she must have found disappointingly liberal. The present and future were of less interest. Then on Thursday I went down to the far end of Cornwall to talk to the fishermen of Newlyn and it was a striking reminder of the cause which had drawn me back into the political fray.
JUL4	Labour tax plans are the economics of the madhouse, says TIM NEWARK	SOCIAL mobility will be further hit under Labour proposals to stop families passing on their hard-earned money to their children with a Lifetime Gifts Tax. Any money passed on from parents to children beyond a total limit £125,000 during their lifetime will be taxed. That means a more severe form of inheritance tax would be introduced by a Labour government, way beyond the current 40 percent payable over a threshold of £475,000.    It is a fundamental desire of parents to help their children, and if they can do that while they are alive by giving them money to help buy a home, why should they be taxed again on money they've already paid tax on? It's a double tax whammy and could make it almost impossible for young people to buy a home of their own. Thanks to a decade of recklessly low-interest rates, property prices have spiralled beyond the reach of many young people. The proportion of young homeowners between 25 and 34 has fallen to 27 per cent from 65 percent just two decades ago. In the meantime renting has rocketed. Yet property ownership is the best engine of social mobility. Both my parents were born into poor working-class families who had only ever rented. But by working hard, scrimping and saving, they bought their own home, proudly paying off their mortgage and becoming middle-class.
JUL4	Decent role models are vital to tackle knife crime plague, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT'S difficult to know what is more shocking – the level of knife crime on our streets or the level of assaults on the police. This weekend there were four fatal stabbings in London alone, including 26-year-old Kelly Fauvrelle, who was eight months' pregnant. Away from London, a 47-year-old man was killed in Llanelli in Wales and a man in his 70s in Tonbridge, Kent.    So far this year, there have been 68 deaths from knife crime in London. According to the official statistics, there were 285 fatal stabbings in England and Wales in 2018 – the highest number since records began more than 70 years ago. The figures are truly appalling. But so, too, are some other statistics from a documentary shown last night on Channel 4. A staggering 80 percent of police say they have been attacked in the past year – and nearly a third say they have needed medical attention afterwards. Other figures reveal that a police officer is attacked on average every 20 minutes.
JUL4	Motor neurone disease is terminal – let’s stop punishing the sufferers	AS YOU'RE reading this, sit still. Imagine you can't get up. You can't lift your hand to scratch your nose. You can't pick up the cup of tea beside you. You can't roll your sleeves up. And you have no voice to ask for help. This is the reality for people living with motor neurone disease (MND). It may be they haven't reached this stage yet – they may still be able to speak, or walk or move their arms.    But eventually, the disease will rob them of those abilities. And there is no cure, so they will die. Yet, according to the rules, they may still not be entitled to access the fast-track process to claim welfare benefits – because they are not terminally ill enough. To access the Special Rules for Terminal Illness (SRTI) a person with MND or any other terminal illness needs a form signed by their clinician confirming they "have a reasonable expectation of death within six months". If only terminal illnesses were that predictable.
JUL4	Tory Brexit spenders! Everyone is reaching for the magic money tree, says LEO McKINSTRY	SPEAKING to the 1983 Tory Conference about her tough approach to state expenditure, Margaret Thatcher declared: "It is no good thinking that someone else will pay. That someone else is you. There is no such thing as Government money. There is only taxpayers' money." The Iron Lady was absolutely right. National prosperity cannot be built on debt.    Sound money is an essential ingredient of secure, long-term economic growth. That was proved dramatically in the late 1970s, just before Mrs Thatcher arrived in power when the profligate Labour Government dragged Britain near to bankruptcy. Yet her wisdom seems to have been forgotten in the current Tory leadership contest, which has so far been distinguished by wishful thinking on Brexit and dangerous irresponsibility on finance. Indeed, the race is fast degenerating into a frenzied auction of unrealistic promises and expensive pledges. This runs counter to the spirit of the Conservatives, who have traditionally been regarded as the party of good housekeeping. They might be unsentimental, but they have tended to be prudent, ensuring that the country lives within its means.

JUL5	We're governed by a bunch of bumbling fools – when will it end? asks FREDERICK FORSYTH	IF THE bunglers who now control the once-fearsome Tory party – once formidable as the most efficient election-winning machine in Europe – had been briefed three years ago, "Your task now is to destroy the Conservatives by the end of 2019", they could not possibly have done a better job.    Since David Cameron lost his referendum and scuttled off to a country pub or the Cornish coast, the HQ staff and the 1922 Committee have made every miscalculation laid before them, starting with the non-vote coronation of Theresa May. Their latest is the imposition of the excruciating five-week slagging match between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. The 170,000-membership constituency for the final choice never needed more than 10 days to select a new prime minister. Within seven of those days, the contest had degenerated into a bitter exchange of putdowns and insults that benefit no one but Jeremy Corbyn. The party will be riven in two – apart from the huge phalanx of once-loyal supporters who have switched to Farage. If there is even a functioning party left by July 31, it will be a miracle. There is still time for the 1922 Committee to alter the rules yet again and let us vote in a new leader next week but it appears that constipation rules. When I was 17, if I had chosen the path of university over RAF and had to pick a study, I would have chosen history. The present is often fast-moving and hard to comprehend. But the past is open to research, documentation and analysis of what really happened.
JUL5	Boris Johnson is so right to want to put more bobbies on the beat, says ROSS CLARK	I AM no great fan of politicians who try to bribe us with our own money. But there is one spending commitment about which I am pleased to hear – Boris Johnson's pledge to spend £1billion on an extra 20,000 police officers. Drastic though that increase might sound, it merely replaces those cut over the past ten years.    The number of police officers in England and Wales peaked at 144,274 in 2009, but plummeted to 123,507 by 2017. True, the Government needed to save money in order to stop the country going bust after Gordon Brown's irresponsible spending splurge. But the cuts to the police were disproportionate, and a false economy. Of course, no one can attribute any particular crime to falling numbers of police but the surge in knife crime over the past five years, and the human misery which has resulted from it can't be entirely unrelated to the fact there are fewer officers on the streets. Last weekend Greater London witnessed one of the most horrendous crimes of all – the fatal stabbing, in Croydon, of heavily-pregnant 26-year-old Kelly Mary Fauvrelle. Her son Riley, born in an emergency delivery while she was dying, himself died a few days later.

JUL6	Inside Politics: Labour Messiah mirrors Kremlin	LIKE THE Soviet Union in the declining years of Leonid Brezhnev, the Labour Party is gripped with speculation about the health of its leader.    Jeremy Corbyn this week furiously denied suggestions attributed to senior civil servants that he is "too frail" to be prime minister. The 70-year-old's protestations only intensified doubts among the party's MPs about his physical and mental wellbeing. Labour insiders say the veteran Left-winger's attention frequently appears to wander during lengthy party meetings. 
JUL6	Fun police rain on our BBQ party, say RICHARD AND JUDY	J - WE decided to have a small family lunch in our garden last week to celebrate our grandson's first birthday. While heaving a saggy old leather sofa into the garage at my request (my newfound obsession with interior design is causing much upheaval at home) Richard stumbled on a disposable barbecue left over from last summer.    "Great," we thought. "Kids love barbies." Sadly, the damn thing wouldn't light; it had given up the ghost after a year mouldering in our damp garage, so we grilled our M&S burgers (delicious) in the kitchen along with hot dogs and garlic bread, pretended it was a barbecue, and ate on the patio. We had strawberries and cream to finish, followed by chocolate cake for the birthday boy. Next day I read with bemusement that a simple barbecue for four releases more greenhouse gas than a 90-mile car journey.

JUL8	We must not let up in the fight against pollution - EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS tempting to think that Britain's air pollution problems are a thing of the past. Those of a certain age still remember the pea-souper fogs that used to engulf our great cities and it is certainly true that in many cases our air quality is much better than it was a couple of generations ago. But as we reveal today, there is still much work to be done.    For it is shocking to learn that children born in 2011 could still have seven months shaved off their life expectancy if exposed over their lifetimes to toxic air. There has been some progress since new policies were introduced in 2011 but the fact remains that there is still much to be done. There are still 36,000 early deaths every year in the UK that are attributed to air conditions, affecting in particular the young, the old and those with lung conditions. And this is an area about which we cannot be complacent.
JUL8	Jeremy Corbyn has led the Labour Party to the brink of collapse, says LEO McKINSTRY	TWO years ago Jeremy Corbyn pulled off a sensational result in the general election. Defying all predictions, he presided over the biggest surge for the official Opposition since 1945. But it has been all downhill for the Labour leader since then. The euphoria of 2017 has given way to the encircling gloom of chaos, as his party is engulfed by incendiary rows over extremism, bitter accusations of anti-Semitism and acrimonious divisions over Brexit.    Corbyn once promised a "kinder, gentler politics". But he has achieved the opposite. Labour has become a party injected with the lethal poison of intimidation and bigotry. As a result, support is haemorrhaging. The nadir was reached last week when an opinion poll put Labour on just 18 percent, its lowest ever rating. That survey comes in the wake of disastrous local and European election results in May, as well as a loss of more than 100,000 members in the last year. Tellingly there were no chants of "Oh Jeremy Corbyn" at Glastonbury this summer, in contrast to the scenes of adulation in 2017. Even his most loyal allies in the Shadow Cabinet, such as John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, have become disillusioned with his failing leadership. The sulphurous air at Westminster is now full of talk about a challenge to Corbyn's embattled regime.

JUL8	Inside Politics: Labour Messiah mirrors Kremlin	LIKE THE Soviet Union in the declining years of Leonid Brezhnev, the Labour Party is gripped with speculation about the health of its leader.    Jeremy Corbyn this week furiously denied suggestions attributed to senior civil servants that he is "too frail" to be prime minister. The 70-year-old's protestations only intensified doubts among the party's MPs about his physical and mental wellbeing. Labour insiders say the veteran Left-winger's attention frequently appears to wander during lengthy party meetings. 
JUL8	Fun police rain on our BBQ party, say RICHARD AND JUDY	J - WE decided to have a small family lunch in our garden last week to celebrate our grandson's first birthday. While heaving a saggy old leather sofa into the garage at my request (my newfound obsession with interior design is causing much upheaval at home) Richard stumbled on a disposable barbecue left over from last summer.    "Great," we thought. "Kids love barbies." Sadly, the damn thing wouldn't light; it had given up the ghost after a year mouldering in our damp garage, so we grilled our M&S burgers (delicious) in the kitchen along with hot dogs and garlic bread, pretended it was a barbecue, and ate on the patio. We had strawberries and cream to finish, followed by chocolate cake for the birthday boy. Next day I read with bemusement that a simple barbecue for four releases more greenhouse gas than a 90-mile car journey.

JUL9	We must be ready to take that leap into no-deal Brexit, says STEPHEN POLLARD	WHATEVER you may think about Boris Johnson, you could not now accuse him of any ambiguity over Brexit. Lately, he could not have been clearer that if he becomes prime minister a fortnight today, we will leave the EU on October 31. Throughout the leadership campaign, he has said repeatedly that he would rather leave with a deal but if he can't get the EU to agree to drop the Irish backstop, then we will be off without one.    But the one thing we have surely all learnt in the three years since the referendum is to treat such promises with a sackload of salt. Barely a day went by, for example, in the run-up to March 29 when Mrs May didn't pledge with similar insistence that we would be leaving then. Let's take Mr Johnson at his word. Let's assume he really means it. If that is indeed what happens, then what he is actually saying is that we will be leaving without a deal. Because we need to be realistic. It is, of course, possible that a change in Britain's negotiating team will secure what Mrs May could not achieve, and our new prime minister will manage one of the greatest diplomatic and political triumphs in history as we not only agree a new deal with the EU but a new deal that is equally acceptable to the ERG and Remainers in the Commons.

JUL10	We all need to look after those who once cared for us, says TIM NEWARK	OUR ageing population is a concern for us all. We all may be old sometime and expect a level of care that is both dignified and does not impoverish our children. The money to pay for this should come out of central taxation, not local taxation or pillaged from hard-pressed families. The principle of the NHS is that most of us pay into it through a lifetime of taxes and when we need it, it's there for us and our family.    The same should be true of social care. It should not be means--tested and it should not be a licence to rip through our savings and force us to sell a home to pay for it. At the moment it is a shocking reality that anyone with more than £23,250 in assets has to pay the full cost of social care which can hit £100,000 a year. Over the past two years, families with a loved one suffer- ing from dementia have paid out nearly £15billion in fees compared with the £9.3billion of taxpayers' money spent by government. Shamefully, central government has shifted much of the funding of social care for those who can't afford it on to local government with councils suddenly plunged into financial crises by the rising demands as the population ages. It has had many unintended consequences with councils justifying high business rates and parking fees as they desperately hunt around for more cash. The subsequent squeeze on small businesses is bad news for the survival of the beleaguered high street.

JUL11	A posh nightclub and expensive champagne? I'm there says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	ALL together now: a big Happy Birthday to Tramp! The famous nightclub turns 50 in a couple of weeks' time and in its long and louche lifetime has played host to anyone who is anyone.    It was founded by Johnny Gold and Oscar Lerman, who was married to Jackie Collins. Peter Sellers, Joan Collins, Liza Minelli and Ringo Starr all had wedding receptions there. Various Beatles, Rolling Stones and Frank Sinatra were early visitors. It once played host to three James Bonds, when Roger Moore, Sean Connery and George Lazenby bumped in to one another and had dinner in the club's Zodiac restaurant. Michael Caine, meanwhile, had spotted a beautiful actress called Shakira in a coffee advertisement and vowed to fly to her native Brazil to track her down. Instead he met her in Tramp. They have been married for 46 years.
JUL11	Can the Labour Party sink any lower? asks LEO McKINSTRY	A FUNDAMENTAL paradox lies at the heart of British politics. Despite all the turmoil in the Conservative Government, it is Labour that faces the far bigger leadership crisis. Boris Johnson is likely to be soon elected our new prime minister with a resounding mandate to deliver Brexit.  In contrast, Jeremy Corbyn will now only sink deeper into the mire of unpopularity, dragged down by his own extremism and ineptitude. For the Tories, there is the hope of a fresh start fuelled by the advent of British independence. For Labour, the nightmare of internal strife and public contempt now beckon. This week, the problems for Corbyn's beleaguered party worsened on two crucial fronts: the failure to tackle anti-Semitism and the surrender to the anti-Brexit lobby. The former reveals the toxic atmosphere that Corbyn has created in his party. The latter shows Labour's disdain for democracy.

JUL12	Fault! But Meghan just doesn't get it, says CAROLE MALONE	Related articles    SO Princess Privacy is at it again. It wasn’t enough that she and Harry kept details of Archie’s christening and his godparents’ names secret, but this week she pitched up at Wimbledon on a publicly funded freebie with two of her bessies. she then sat in the VIP area commandeering 40 empty seats (VIPs were reportedly left queuing outside) while her security guards told punter to stop taking pictures as she was there in a “private capacity”. OMG - the arrogance, the selfishness, the control freakery. I’m sorry but you can’t be at Wimbledon with 12,000 other people in a private capacity. It’s a public place, jam-packed with punters who, unlike Meghan, had paid for their tickets. And how dare she have security men tell people to stop photographing her.
JUL12	This shameful abuse of power MUST stop now, EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS no secret that the Palace of Westminster is crumbling and infested by rodents. But a new report reveals it is also plagued by bullying and sexual harassment that should never be tolerated.    Leading barrister Gemma White investigated the culture that has been allowed to fester in the Commons and now wants urgent action. Men and women who work for MPs are especially vulnerable because many fear it will be "career suicide" to blow the whistle on bullying by their boss. Change is long overdue. Such a toxic environment is damaging for our democracy and, crucially, dissuades good people from standing for election or applying to work in Parliament. It is bad enough that so many people in politics suffer online abuse. They should not also have to worry about office harassment.
JUL12	No one could have saved Sir Kim once his email leaked, says ROSS CLARK	LABOUR'S spokespeople are not exactly known for their objectivity, but even so the response of shadow foreign office minister to the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch as British ambassador in Washington on Wednesday takes the biscuit.    According to Emily Thornberry, Boris Johnson's failure to back Sir Kim was "the most craven and despicable act of cowardice I have seen from any candidate for public office". Steady on. Even if you did think that Boris should have thrown his weight behind our man in Washington, his refusal to do so would surely not even rank as the biggest act of political cowardice of the day. That title would surely belong to Jeremy Corbyn for refusing interviews to respond to Panorama's expose of anti-Semitism in Labour and his staff's attempt to rubbish the documentarymakers instead. But there is really very little that Boris - or anyone - could have done to save Darroch. There was nothing wrong with him sending a frank assessment of Donald Trump's character and ability to govern in a private memo to London. Indeed, it is part of an ambassador's job to provide such opinions.
JUL12	Time to sweep out the dross at the top, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	FOR SOME time I have nurtured a private daydream. In it a new man comes to the pinnacle of power in Downing Street. A man (it could have been a woman - no sexism here) of steely will and armed with a still-bristled yard broom.    And he starts to clear out the dross that has slowly entrenched itself in office and power over the past 20 years. I refer to the Commons, the Lords, Civil Service, pandemic quangocracy and the various national institutions whose aggregate thousands and thousands of rules and regulations, mostly imposed without any electoral mandate, make our lives a constant overtaxed struggle. A guide to the actual level of their talent is a study of the past three years. We know that in that time we have had a Conservative government and nothing else. We know that all that time Labour has been becoming an ever more appalling shambles under its doddering fool of a leader. Given the near-collapse of the Lib Dems, the serial maladministration of the Scots Nats and Welsh Nats and the near-invisibility of the Greens and Sinn Fein, the British world should have been for the Tories to re-fashion.
JUL12	Iran warning: HMS Montrose would have ‘destroyed’ Tehran boats says Navy chief	IF IT had come to a shooting match, HMS Montrose would have destroyed the three Iranian boats harassing the UK-flagged British Heritage tanker in the Straits of Hormuz, says CHRIS PARRY.    Its high-powered mini-guns and 4.5in gun are more than capable of destroying small patrol boats. But while they may have backed down this time, I fully expect the Iranians to keep up the harassment. The latest situation is a case of back to the future for me.

Despite all the turmoil in the Conservative Government, it is Labour that faces the far bigger leadership crisis. Boris Johnson is likely to be soon elected our new prime minister with a resounding mandate to deliver Brexit.  In contrast, Jeremy Corbyn will now only sink deeper into the mire of unpopularity, dragged down by his own extremism and ineptitude. For the Tories, there is the hope of a fresh start fuelled by the advent of British independence. For Labour, the nightmare of internal strife and public contempt now beckon. This week, the problems for Corbyn's beleaguered party worsened on two crucial fronts: the failure to tackle anti-Semitism and the surrender to the anti-Brexit lobby. The former reveals the toxic atmosphere that Corbyn has created in his party. The latter shows Labour's disdain for democracy.
JUL12	We all need to look after those who once cared for us, says TIM NEWARK	OUR ageing population is a concern for us all. We all may be old sometime and expect a level of care that is both dignified and does not impoverish our children. The money to pay for this should come out of central taxation, not local taxation or pillaged from hard-pressed families. The principle of the NHS is that most of us pay into it through a lifetime of taxes and when we need it, it's there for us and our family.    The same should be true of social care. It should not be means--tested and it should not be a licence to rip through our savings and force us to sell a home to pay for it. At the moment it is a shocking reality that anyone with more than £23,250 in assets has to pay the full cost of social care which can hit £100,000 a year. Over the past two years, families with a loved one suffer- ing from dementia have paid out nearly £15billion in fees compared with the £9.3billion of taxpayers' money spent by government. Shamefully, central government has shifted much of the funding of social care for those who can't afford it on to local government with councils suddenly plunged into financial crises by the rising demands as the population ages. It has had many unintended consequences with councils justifying high business rates and parking fees as they desperately hunt around for more cash. The subsequent squeeze on small businesses is bad news for the survival of the beleaguered high street.
JUL12	We must be ready to take that leap into no-deal Brexit, says STEPHEN POLLARD	WHATEVER you may think about Boris Johnson, you could not now accuse him of any ambiguity over Brexit. Lately, he could not have been clearer that if he becomes prime minister a fortnight today, we will leave the EU on October 31. Throughout the leadership campaign, he has said repeatedly that he would rather leave with a deal but if he can't get the EU to agree to drop the Irish backstop, then we will be off without one.    But the one thing we have surely all learnt in the three years since the referendum is to treat such promises with a sackload of salt. Barely a day went by, for example, in the run-up to March 29 when Mrs May didn't pledge with similar insistence that we would be leaving then. Let's take Mr Johnson at his word. Let's assume he really means it. If that is indeed what happens, then what he is actually saying is that we will be leaving without a deal. Because we need to be realistic. It is, of course, possible that a change in Britain's negotiating team will secure what Mrs May could not achieve, and our new prime minister will manage one of the greatest diplomatic and political triumphs in history as we not only agree a new deal with the EU but a new deal that is equally acceptable to the ERG and Remainers in the Commons.
JUL12	We must not let up in the fight against pollution - EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS tempting to think that Britain's air pollution problems are a thing of the past. Those of a certain age still remember the pea-souper fogs that used to engulf our great cities and it is certainly true that in many cases our air quality is much better than it was a couple of generations ago. But as we reveal today, there is still much work to be done.    For it is shocking to learn that children born in 2011 could still have seven months shaved off their life expectancy if exposed over their lifetimes to toxic air. There has been some progress since new policies were introduced in 2011 but the fact remains that there is still much to be done. There are still 36,000 early deaths every year in the UK that are attributed to air conditions, affecting in particular the young, the old and those with lung conditions. And this is an area about which we cannot be complacent.
JUL13	Love Island: 'Is this how millenials mate', asks VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	I have never seen Love Island, I know remarkably little about it and from what I can gather it consists of a lot of Barbie and Ken lookalikes hanging out in bathing suits.    Apparently more people applied to go on this show than sought to get into Oxbridge: well, I’m a Cambridge grad and so I’m curious to see what my alternative future could have been. Was this where I made my big ­mistake? Choosing academia over reality TV? Love Island takes place in a villa in Majorca which is decorated in primary colours like some sort of giant kindergarten.
JUL13	Maybe it is time for a Royal rest, say RICHARD & JUDY	AFTER a couple of weeks suffering slings and arrows from multiple columnists for keeping Archie’s christening private and refusing to name his godparents, the Duchess sparked even more outrage visiting Wimbledon with friends, sitting in splendid isolation, all seats around her hurriedly cleared of hoi polloi.    Meanwhile a royal official reprimanded a blameless regular for taking photos. The cheek! The poor woman hadn’t even realised Meghan was there. She was snapping away at Serena Williams on court, as you do. The official told the astonished fan the Duchess was present “in a private capacity”. How pompous and paranoid. How private can you be in a public place thronged with enthusiasts enjoying one of Britain’s most iconic traditions? 
JUL13	What ails Germany is bad news for its friends and allies, says MARK ALMOND	WHEN illness strikes a leader it can paralyse a country's political machine. The crisis usually passes with a new head of government. But what if the leader's symptoms reflect a country's wider ills?    The German chancellor has tried to shrug off recent questions about her health by maintaining her punishing schedule but Angela Merkel's decision to sit for the national anthem at a reception for the visiting Danish prime minister a few days after shaking visibly while standing alongside another Euro-grandee heightened concerns that something ails Europe's power broker. Everyone has known for months that Germany is entering the twilight of the Merkel era. Having been the key EU politician since she came to power in 2005, Merkel said earlier this year she would not seek another term in office when this one runs out in 2021.
JUL13	Sports' Super Sunday makes the nation proud - EXPRESS COMMENT	ENGLAND'S cricket team will tomorrow be contesting the World Cup 50-over final at Lords. The highlight of the Formula 1 season will be taking place at Silverstone with British driver Lewis Hamilton favourite to win.    And south-west London will be hosting the world's most glamorous sporting event with the men's final at Wimbledon. It is a reminder that there is so much in this country to be cheerful and proud about. But it is not just sport. Unemployment is at a record low, the UK is the number one destination in the world for international investment, growth is higher than most of the rest of the G20.
JUL13	Inside Politics: Tory leaders healing discord will be tricky	WHERE there is discord, may we bring harmony. The words attributed to St Francis Assisi that were quoted by Margaret Thatcher on first entering 10 Downing Street as prime minister sound equally appropriate for the next Tory politician preparing to follow in her footsteps.    Boris Johnson, almost certain to be confirmed as Tory leader and prime minister in less than a fortnight's time, is braced to take charge of a party so divided the discord has become a cacophony. Mr Johnson's leadership battle with Jeremy Hunt this week lurched from gentlemanly sparring to bare-knuckle combat. Seeking to knock the favourite off balance, the outsider launched a furious assault on his rival's character in last Tuesday evening's live television debate. 
JUL13	Fault! But Meghan just doesn't get it, says CAROLE MALONE	Related articles    SO Princess Privacy is at it again. It wasn’t enough that she and Harry kept details of Archie’s christening and his godparents’ names secret, but this week she pitched up at Wimbledon on a publicly funded freebie with two of her bessies. she then sat in the VIP area commandeering 40 empty seats (VIPs were reportedly left queuing outside) while her security guards told punter to stop taking pictures as she was there in a “private capacity”. OMG - the arrogance, the selfishness, the control freakery. I’m sorry but you can’t be at Wimbledon with 12,000 other people in a private capacity. It’s a public place, jam-packed with punters who, unlike Meghan, had paid for their tickets. And how dare she have security men tell people to stop photographing her.
JUL13	This shameful abuse of power MUST stop now, EXPRESS COMMENT	IT IS no secret that the Palace of Westminster is crumbling and infested by rodents. But a new report reveals it is also plagued by bullying and sexual harassment that should never be tolerated.    Leading barrister Gemma White investigated the culture that has been allowed to fester in the Commons and now wants urgent action. Men and women who work for MPs are especially vulnerable because many fear it will be "career suicide" to blow the whistle on bullying by their boss. Change is long overdue. Such a toxic environment is damaging for our democracy and, crucially, dissuades good people from standing for election or applying to work in Parliament. It is bad enough that so many people in politics suffer online abuse. They should not also have to worry about office harassment.
JUL13	No one could have saved Sir Kim once his email leaked, says ROSS CLARK	LABOUR'S spokespeople are not exactly known for their objectivity, but even so the response of shadow foreign office minister to the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch as British ambassador in Washington on Wednesday takes the biscuit.    According to Emily Thornberry, Boris Johnson's failure to back Sir Kim was "the most craven and despicable act of cowardice I have seen from any candidate for public office". Steady on. Even if you did think that Boris should have thrown his weight behind our man in Washington, his refusal to do so would surely not even rank as the biggest act of political cowardice of the day. That title would surely belong to Jeremy Corbyn for refusing interviews to respond to Panorama's expose of anti-Semitism in Labour and his staff's attempt to rubbish the documentarymakers instead. But there is really very little that Boris - or anyone - could have done to save Darroch. There was nothing wrong with him sending a frank assessment of Donald Trump's character and ability to govern in a private memo to London. Indeed, it is part of an ambassador's job to provide such opinions.
JUL13	Time to sweep out the dross at the top, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	FOR SOME time I have nurtured a private daydream. In it a new man comes to the pinnacle of power in Downing Street. A man (it could have been a woman - no sexism here) of steely will and armed with a still-bristled yard broom.    And he starts to clear out the dross that has slowly entrenched itself in office and power over the past 20 years. I refer to the Commons, the Lords, Civil Service, pandemic quangocracy and the various national institutions whose aggregate thousands and thousands of rules and regulations, mostly imposed without any electoral mandate, make our lives a constant overtaxed struggle. A guide to the actual level of their talent is a study of the past three years. We know that in that time we have had a Conservative government and nothing else. We know that all that time Labour has been becoming an ever more appalling shambles under its doddering fool of a leader. Given the near-collapse of the Lib Dems, the serial maladministration of the Scots Nats and Welsh Nats and the near-invisibility of the Greens and Sinn Fein, the British world should have been for the Tories to re-fashion.
JUL13	Iran warning: HMS Montrose would have ‘destroyed’ Tehran boats says Navy chief	IF IT had come to a shooting match, HMS Montrose would have destroyed the three Iranian boats harassing the UK-flagged British Heritage tanker in the Straits of Hormuz, says CHRIS PARRY.    Its high-powered mini-guns and 4.5in gun are more than capable of destroying small patrol boats. But while they may have backed down this time, I fully expect the Iranians to keep up the harassment. The latest situation is a case of back to the future for me.
JUL14	Attenborough's positivity could tackle climate change, says ANNE DIAMOND	IT WAS so refreshing to see “the most trusted man in Britain” call out world leaders over their cynical attitude to climate change – in particular naming and shaming the USA and Australia.    And the great thing is, Sir David Attenborough, while not mincing his words at a Westminster committee hearing, does not peddle negativity. He is adamant that tackling climate change is possible, could be tremendous fun and that if countries like ours get ahead of the game, we could create economic growth, and some could even make a fortune. Perhaps we should all become tree surgeons or foresters.
JUL14	Dithering Corbyn is rotten to the core, says NICK FERRARI	IT’S ONLY taken three years, but the smoke has cleared and Labour has its policy concerning Brexit – and it has to be ultimate betrayal of the party’s working-class roots.    For most of the time, Labour has shown as much direction as a supermarket trolley. Following weeks, if not months, of pressure from front-benchers such as Diane Abbott, Tom Watson and John McDonnell, as well as a raft of trade union bosses, Jeremy Corbyn finally said Labour would campaign for Remain “against either No-Deal or a Tory deal”. Labour is ready to say it will oppose a deal that has not even been done so, obviously, it has not even seen.
JUL14	Why does Labour think we Jews are the enemy within, asks ANGELA EPSTEIN	IF YOU saw me walking down the street, it’s likely I’d barely merit a second glance. Why would I? A fading redhead with winter-white skin and a losing battle to stay a size 10, I’m about as exceptional as countless other time-poor working mothers you’ll see racing to their next commitment.    So I suppose I should be quite flattered that there are members of the Labour Party who think I’m so much more powerful than the sum of my parts. In their eyes, perhaps, I’m the worst example of Western imperialism. I’m a nefarious capitalist whose puppet-like control causes wars, manipulates the economy and thus affects the world in which we live. All very exhausting when you’re trying to fit in a trolley dash round Tesco before making the school run. 
JUL14	Leaving EU will also see off Jeremy Corbyn’s mob - EXPRESS COMMENT	OUR POLL today shows that despite the shocking revelations on the BBC’s Panorama programme about anti-Semitism in the party, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn still comes out on top with 28 per cent.    We should all be terrified. What it confirms is that the Brexit crisis has opened the door to Britain electing a hard-Left party with questionable values – to put it mildly – and policies which would divide and bankrupt this country. But what is also clear is that the only way to consign this “mad Marxist mob to the dustbin of history”, as Boris Johnson eloquently puts it, is to deliver Brexit.

JUL15	Boris can ditch the gloom and get our nation behind Brexit, says LEO MCKINSTRY	DURING last week's televised Conservative leadership debate, Jeremy Hunt accused rival Boris Johnson of "peddling optimism". It was a bizarre charge, for optimism is exactly the quality that the new Government needs to deliver Brexit. For the past three years, there has been far too much gloom within the political establishment. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

JUL16	Royal premiere was fit for a king, says VANESSA FELTZ	YOU'D be forgiven for not spotting us amid all the coverage of Beyoncé, JAY-Z, the Vin Diesel clan, Pharrell Williams, Sir Elton and David Furnish et al, but my grandson Zekey, five, and I were at the European Premiere of The Lion King at the Odeon in Leicester Square.    It was an epic affair. Disney made sure of that. Instead of the usual shabby red runner, guests crossed a desert yellow carpet giving a palpable hint of the Serengeti. A special jungle-themed bridge elevated revellers high above the pavements. Excitement bubbled over. Lord, was that Sir Tim Rice? He's written the lyrics to Elton's new music. Gosh, was that exquisite beauty in a diaphanous crinoline Maya Jama, presenter extraordinaire and girlfriend of Glastonbury headliner Stormzy? Was that Rochelle and Marvin Humes to the right, Louise Redknapp of Eternal fame to the left, thingummy-bob off Love Island in the middle - plus Faye Tozer next to boxer Nicola Adams, and Hollywood star Seth Rogen, the voice of Pumbaa? Talk about a mish-mash of the famous, infamous and the barely heard-of in their own kitchens.
JUL16	Leave our prudent pensioners alone, EXPRESS COMMENT	IT'S odd that we are encouraged to save all our lives, only to have our nest-eggs taken away from us in later life.    Take the tragic story of Mary Morley. After she retired at 65, the 86-year-old pensioner managed to save a little money each week from her state pension. Nobly, the former chambermaid didn't want to be a burden on her family. By her very thrift Mrs Morley saved twice the £16,000 cap on those claiming housing benefit. So her local authority took her to court, stopping her housing benefit and council tax support, and asking her to pay back £12,000 in overpaid benefits - followed by a swingeing further claim. True, benefits should be means-tested to weed out fraud. But in cases like Mrs Morley's some discretion, or a tapering mechanism, could have been deployed. Time after time - as with the growing numbers who find themselves paying for their own dementia care - our pensioners are punished for being prudent. Once again we see the triumph of bureaucracy over common sense.
JUL16	Creeping attacks on press freedom fly in the face of democracy, says STEPHEN POLLARD	I TRIED explaining to my young son the other day what democracy means. Part of it was easy - that we all get the chance to decide who is in charge of the country, and if we don't like them we can get rid of them.    But then I ended up on all sorts of tangents, including the concept of freedom - that for democracy to function, the population must be free. So I started to talk about what I do for a living - writing and editing - and how vital it is to democracy we are free to say things that some people in authority don't like to hear. Especially, I said, if it's the Government that doesn't like it. If we aren't free to criticise the Government and politicians, then we aren't free. But instead of using abstract terms, perhaps I should simply have highlighted two incidents from the past few days. Two Sundays ago, a newspaper revealed leaked diplomatic cables from Sir Kim Darroch, our then ambassador in Washington. The cables were secret and should have remained so. But someone broke that secrecy and handed them to a newspaper. The police launched an inquiry to find out who was responsible. Sir Kim has since resigned.

JUL16	Maybe it is time for a Royal rest, say RICHARD & JUDY	AFTER a couple of weeks suffering slings and arrows from multiple columnists for keeping Archie’s christening private and refusing to name his godparents, the Duchess sparked even more outrage visiting Wimbledon with friends, sitting in splendid isolation, all seats around her hurriedly cleared of hoi polloi.    Meanwhile a royal official reprimanded a blameless regular for taking photos. The cheek! The poor woman hadn’t even realised Meghan was there. She was snapping away at Serena Williams on court, as you do. The official told the astonished fan the Duchess was present “in a private capacity”. How pompous and paranoid. How private can you be in a public place thronged with enthusiasts enjoying one of Britain’s most iconic traditions? 
JUL17	Jeers are an insult to our intelligence, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	BOTH Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, who gave different reactions to the leaking of sensitive diplomatic documents, got it right. Boris Johnson is likely to be in No10 within days and has to consider the relationship between Britain and its major ally and how to repair the damage done.    Sir Kim Darroch was not attending important diplomatic events – a situation which could not continue. BoJo was 100 per cent right to hesitate over whether he would back the ambassador. Jeremy Hunt was also right to stand up for Sir Kim. He is the Foreign Secretary to whom ambassadors report and the leaks were absolutely no fault of Sir Kim's.
JUL17	We must end persecution of the vulnerable and elderly in society, says ROSS CLARK	WE HAVE all heard of benefit cheats caught out after claiming money to which they were not entitled. But 86-year-old Mary Morley, who lives near Peterborough, is as far from these brazen cases of benefit fraud as it is possible to imagine. After retirement, she eked out her state pension, consigning the rest to a savings account. What she didn't appreciate is how the state will come down like a ton of bricks on people who accidentally save too much to be eligible for state benefits.    Nine years ago, Mrs Morley unwittingly crossed the £16,000 savings limit for people claiming housing benefit. So technically, during that time she has been claiming benefits to which she is not entitled. Clearly, there has to be a strict eligibility criterion for benefits. It would be wrong if taxpayers were forced to subsidise people who have low incomes but have millions squirrelled away. ut that does not justify the shocking way in which Mrs Morley has been treated. When Huntingdonshire District Council found out about Mrs Morley's savings last year, it immediately stopped her housing benefit and council tax benefit – and sent her a demand for £12,000 in overpaid benefits.
JUL17	Royal premiere was fit for a king, says VANESSA FELTZ	YOU'D be forgiven for not spotting us amid all the coverage of Beyoncé, JAY-Z, the Vin Diesel clan, Pharrell Williams, Sir Elton and David Furnish et al, but my grandson Zekey, five, and I were at the European Premiere of The Lion King at the Odeon in Leicester Square.    It was an epic affair. Disney made sure of that. Instead of the usual shabby red runner, guests crossed a desert yellow carpet giving a palpable hint of the Serengeti. A special jungle-themed bridge elevated revellers high above the pavements. Excitement bubbled over. Lord, was that Sir Tim Rice? He's written the lyrics to Elton's new music. Gosh, was that exquisite beauty in a diaphanous crinoline Maya Jama, presenter extraordinaire and girlfriend of Glastonbury headliner Stormzy? Was that Rochelle and Marvin Humes to the right, Louise Redknapp of Eternal fame to the left, thingummy-bob off Love Island in the middle - plus Faye Tozer next to boxer Nicola Adams, and Hollywood star Seth Rogen, the voice of Pumbaa? Talk about a mish-mash of the famous, infamous and the barely heard-of in their own kitchens.
JUL17	Leave our prudent pensioners alone, EXPRESS COMMENT	IT'S odd that we are encouraged to save all our lives, only to have our nest-eggs taken away from us in later life.    Take the tragic story of Mary Morley. After she retired at 65, the 86-year-old pensioner managed to save a little money each week from her state pension. Nobly, the former chambermaid didn't want to be a burden on her family. By her very thrift Mrs Morley saved twice the £16,000 cap on those claiming housing benefit. So her local authority took her to court, stopping her housing benefit and council tax support, and asking her to pay back £12,000 in overpaid benefits - followed by a swingeing further claim. True, benefits should be means-tested to weed out fraud. But in cases like Mrs Morley's some discretion, or a tapering mechanism, could have been deployed. Time after time - as with the growing numbers who find themselves paying for their own dementia care - our pensioners are punished for being prudent. Once again we see the triumph of bureaucracy over common sense.
JUL17	Creeping attacks on press freedom fly in the face of democracy, says STEPHEN POLLARD	I TRIED explaining to my young son the other day what democracy means. Part of it was easy - that we all get the chance to decide who is in charge of the country, and if we don't like them we can get rid of them.    But then I ended up on all sorts of tangents, including the concept of freedom - that for democracy to function, the population must be free. So I started to talk about what I do for a living - writing and editing - and how vital it is to democracy we are free to say things that some people in authority don't like to hear. Especially, I said, if it's the Government that doesn't like it. If we aren't free to criticise the Government and politicians, then we aren't free. But instead of using abstract terms, perhaps I should simply have highlighted two incidents from the past few days. Two Sundays ago, a newspaper revealed leaked diplomatic cables from Sir Kim Darroch, our then ambassador in Washington. The cables were secret and should have remained so. But someone broke that secrecy and handed them to a newspaper. The police launched an inquiry to find out who was responsible. Sir Kim has since resigned.
JUL17	Boris can ditch the gloom and get our nation behind Brexit, says LEO MCKINSTRY	DURING last week's televised Conservative leadership debate, Jeremy Hunt accused rival Boris Johnson of "peddling optimism". It was a bizarre charge, for optimism is exactly the quality that the new Government needs to deliver Brexit. For the past three years, there has been far too much gloom within the political establishment. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUL17	Attenborough's positivity could tackle climate change, says ANNE DIAMOND	IT WAS so refreshing to see “the most trusted man in Britain” call out world leaders over their cynical attitude to climate change – in particular naming and shaming the USA and Australia.    And the great thing is, Sir David Attenborough, while not mincing his words at a Westminster committee hearing, does not peddle negativity. He is adamant that tackling climate change is possible, could be tremendous fun and that if countries like ours get ahead of the game, we could create economic growth, and some could even make a fortune. Perhaps we should all become tree surgeons or foresters.
JUL17	Dithering Corbyn is rotten to the core, says NICK FERRARI	IT’S ONLY taken three years, but the smoke has cleared and Labour has its policy concerning Brexit – and it has to be ultimate betrayal of the party’s working-class roots.    For most of the time, Labour has shown as much direction as a supermarket trolley. Following weeks, if not months, of pressure from front-benchers such as Diane Abbott, Tom Watson and John McDonnell, as well as a raft of trade union bosses, Jeremy Corbyn finally said Labour would campaign for Remain “against either No-Deal or a Tory deal”. Labour is ready to say it will oppose a deal that has not even been done so, obviously, it has not even seen.
JUL17	Why does Labour think we Jews are the enemy within, asks ANGELA EPSTEIN	IF YOU saw me walking down the street, it’s likely I’d barely merit a second glance. Why would I? A fading redhead with winter-white skin and a losing battle to stay a size 10, I’m about as exceptional as countless other time-poor working mothers you’ll see racing to their next commitment.    So I suppose I should be quite flattered that there are members of the Labour Party who think I’m so much more powerful than the sum of my parts. In their eyes, perhaps, I’m the worst example of Western imperialism. I’m a nefarious capitalist whose puppet-like control causes wars, manipulates the economy and thus affects the world in which we live. All very exhausting when you’re trying to fit in a trolley dash round Tesco before making the school run. 
JUL17	Leaving EU will also see off Jeremy Corbyn’s mob - EXPRESS COMMENT	OUR POLL today shows that despite the shocking revelations on the BBC’s Panorama programme about anti-Semitism in the party, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn still comes out on top with 28 per cent.    We should all be terrified. What it confirms is that the Brexit crisis has opened the door to Britain electing a hard-Left party with questionable values – to put it mildly – and policies which would divide and bankrupt this country. But what is also clear is that the only way to consign this “mad Marxist mob to the dustbin of history”, as Boris Johnson eloquently puts it, is to deliver Brexit. 
JUL19	Don’t dare stitch up OAPs, Boris! says CAROLE MALONE	Just three weeks ago the BMA said it wanted to fling open the doors of the NHS to the world. They reckoned foreigners should not be charged for our healthcare – which the rest of us pay for through National Insurance contributions. It should be free for all comers.    At the same time, to this country’s shame, pensioners are having their homes sold out from underneath them and their savings stolen to pay for dementia care that should be free. One shock poll reveals that one-in-three people with dementia have had to sell up because brutal Government policy says funding will be denied to anyone who owns a home or who has more than £23,250 in savings. So, people who scrimp and save all their lives so they won’t be a burden to the State end up getting screwed by the State. Even worse, those who have to fund their own dementia care pay 15 percent more than those who don’t. 
JUL19	Murky world of Brexit intrigue behind leaks, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	IT is rare that we mortals are allowed to see behind the snooty front put up by the Foreign Office to mask its hidden practices but the Kim Darroch affair has certainly been an eye-opener. But why?    Surely no one really thought that ambassadors, in their confidential briefings to their colleagues back home, are never frank and sometimes brutally so. Of course they are. That's part of their job. It is just the part we do not see - or should not. No one would believe for a minute that the American ambassador, reporting back to Washington these past three years about Brexit, did not use words like "pathetic", "incompetent" and "a complete failure". After all, he was describing the Theresa May premiership. Would he have used phrases like "brilliantly successful"? No one else ever did - except Downing Street. So there are only two mysteries. Who leaked - quite deliberately - to a journalist who, having been presented with a scoop, promptly used it?
JUL19	Boris is the man to lead us into a prosperous future, EXPRESS COMMENT	MORE than three years ago, in one of the most inspirational episodes in our island story, the British people voted for freedom from Brussels rule. The margin of the EU referendum victory was decisive, the mandate to the politicians clear. But since then, Westminster has miserably failed to act on that decision.    What should have been a moment of national liberation has been turned by the political class into a dismal saga of prevarication, pusillanimity and paralysis. In the process of this humiliating stalemate, democracy has been repeatedly betrayed. But now there is a chance to break the shackles and make a fresh start on Brexit. The Conservative leadership contest offers a golden opportunity to replace the gloom of fractious inertia with a new spirit of uplifting resolution. At present, according to all the evidence from polls and the campaign trail, it looks as if Boris Johnson will enjoy a resounding victory next week over his rival Jeremy Hunt, perhaps winning more than 70 percent of the votes from Tory members. Hunt has mounted a formidable bid for the crown and has emerged from the contest as a politician of real substance. But he not only lacks Johnson's magnetism, but, more importantly, he fails to match Johnson's potent determination to drive through Britain's withdrawal from the EU by the end of October.
JUL19	A night out has become the theatre of the absurd, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	SO it's out for another night on the front line. Bodycam? Check. Torch? Check. Black combat fatigues for camouflage in the dark? Check. Can't be too careful. It's a jungle out there. Except the jungle in question is a theatre: it has just been revealed by the Society of London Theatre (SOLT) that in the wake of at least two punch-ups, ushers have taken to wearing bodycams to get the violence on film.    Eh? Since when did a civilised night out sniggering at the double entendres in Alan Ayckbourn become a theatre of war? Until very recently the greatest danger in theatre-going involved someone standing on your toe as a latecomer made his way up the aisle or, if you were attending The Mousetrap, someone giving away the plot. These days you risk getting your lights punched out in the audience, never mind what's happening on stage.
JUL19	It is time to take a much tougher stance over rising crime, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE relentless cycle of violence continues to exact a savage toll on Britain. Our once well-ordered society is now plagued by stabbings and shootings. An insight into the human cost of this lethal mayhem is provided today in the Daily Express with John and Linda Burke-Monerville, who, incredibly, have lost three of their sons in separate killings. "Why can't we have peace? As a grieving family, we would like to know: when will the violence stop?" they asked.    Tragically, there is no end in sight. In 2018, the number of homicides rose 14 percent to reach the highest level for 10 years, with London bearing the brunt. This year in the capital there have already been more than 60 murders, none of them more shocking than that last month of heavily pregnant Kelly Mary Fauvrelle, whose child was delivered by paramedics at the blood-soaked crime scene but subsequently died in hospital.
JUL19	Jeers are an insult to our intelligence, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	BOTH Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, who gave different reactions to the leaking of sensitive diplomatic documents, got it right.

JUL20	Inside Politics: Hurricane Boris heads to Number 10	WHITEHALL is on hurricane alert in anticipation of Boris Johnson's expected landfall in Downing Street next week.    With the former foreign secretary overwhelmingly assumed to be confirmed as victor in the Tory leadership race on Tuesday, officials are preparing for a whirlwind of change to begin thundering through the heart of government the following day. Some civil servants have already been seeking shelter while other prepare rapid evacuation plans. Mr Johnson's arrival is almost certain to bring the level of sweeping change in style and personnel usually seen when power switches from one party to another after a general election. The divide between his supporters and those of outgoing prime minister Theresa May runs so deep many senior aides and officials are expected to follow departing ministers out of the door. " I'm far too associated with Theresa's Brexit deal to stay under the new regime," one senior figure in Downing Street told me this week. Many other Number 10 insiders are understood to feel they are in the same position.
JUL20	It's time for the police to take up arms, say RICHARD AND JUDY	SHOULD our police be routinely armed? Once upon a time, I would have argued passionately that they should not. Once upon a time, the thought of officers on the beat carrying pistols strapped to their hips would have made me deeply uneasy.    Once upon a time, comparisons with trigger-happy cops in the United States would have sprung to mind. Once upon a time. Times change. This week, watching the chilling chest-camera footage of unbelievably brave, unarmed police officers confronting the ruthless trio of knifemen rampaging through Borough Market, I changed my mind.The police were completely defenceless against the three armed terrorists. Their deadly rampage was only brought to an end with the arrival of armed officers, who shot them dead at more or less point-blank range. Until that moment, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, had free rein to kill and mutilate. Yes, late-night bakery workers who courageously joined police in pursuit of the killers had armed themselves - with two plastic bread-baskets and a broom.

JUL20	Remainer MPs are betraying Britain's democratic choice, says TIM NEWARK	WHAT on earth are senior Cabinet members doing? By trying to block any chance of a no-deal Brexit, they are denying the UK and our next prime minister the one weapon that would make the EU take us seriously in our next round of negotiations.    No one wants to see Parliament prorogued, but if Remainer MPs continue to betray the referendum result, it leaves the Government with little choice. Chancellor Philip Hammond abstained in this week's vote against suspending Parliament, thus giving his support to Remainers. He justified his defiance of the Tory party whip by saying that he fears a no-deal Brexit will result in economic chaos. But if the Government doesn't deliver Brexit on October 31, with or without a deal, the Tory party will collapse as thousands of despairing voters desert them. This could then allow a Marxist Labour government to gain power and cause far greater damage. Hammond is apparently the first chancellor to defy a threeline whip without being sacked. Not content with that, he is even threatening to bring down the next prime minister with a vote of no confidence if no-deal is not postponed. The strange reasoning of these Tory rebels puts our country in much more danger than Brexit ever could.

JUL21	Stand firm, Boris, and help us be free, says NICK FERRARI	DO YOU really care whether it takes "proroguing", prowrestling or even a Pro Am golf tournament to free this nation from the vice-like grip of life within the EU?    No, me neither. Yet to listen to some of the more ardent Remain supporters, No Deal means all trade will stop, the shelves will be empty, the sick will be dying in front of our eyes due to a chronic shortage of medicine, jobs will be lost by the minute and the pound will make the Zimbabwean dollar look like the gold deposits at Fort Knox. Now, when might we have heard that before? That's right. Just before the Brexit referendum, when Project Fear was at its most jangling, discordant worst. One of the claims, put forward by then Chancellor George Osborne, was that 820,000 jobs would have been lost within two years of the vote. Hopelessly out of touch, the reality is employment has actually reached an all-time high and growth in the economy is out-stripping almost all of the other countries in the European Union, including the one time powerhouse, but now dramatically ailing, Germany.

He justified his defiance of the Tory party whip by saying that he fears a no-deal Brexit will result in economic chaos. But if the Government doesn't deliver Brexit on October 31, with or without a deal, the Tory party will collapse as thousands of despairing voters desert them. This could then allow a Marxist Labour government to gain power and cause far greater damage. Hammond is apparently the first chancellor to defy a threeline whip without being sacked. Not content with that, he is even threatening to bring down the next prime minister with a vote of no confidence if no-deal is not postponed. The strange reasoning of these Tory rebels puts our country in much more danger than Brexit ever could.
JUL21	Don’t dare stitch up OAPs, Boris! says CAROLE MALONE	Just three weeks ago the BMA said it wanted to fling open the doors of the NHS to the world. They reckoned foreigners should not be charged for our healthcare – which the rest of us pay for through National Insurance contributions. It should be free for all comers.    At the same time, to this country’s shame, pensioners are having their homes sold out from underneath them and their savings stolen to pay for dementia care that should be free. One shock poll reveals that one-in-three people with dementia have had to sell up because brutal Government policy says funding will be denied to anyone who owns a home or who has more than £23,250 in savings. So, people who scrimp and save all their lives so they won’t be a burden to the State end up getting screwed by the State. Even worse, those who have to fund their own dementia care pay 15 percent more than those who don’t. 
JUL21	Murky world of Brexit intrigue behind leaks, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	IT is rare that we mortals are allowed to see behind the snooty front put up by the Foreign Office to mask its hidden practices but the Kim Darroch affair has certainly been an eye-opener. But why?    Surely no one really thought that ambassadors, in their confidential briefings to their colleagues back home, are never frank and sometimes brutally so. Of course they are. That's part of their job. It is just the part we do not see - or should not. No one would believe for a minute that the American ambassador, reporting back to Washington these past three years about Brexit, did not use words like "pathetic", "incompetent" and "a complete failure". After all, he was describing the Theresa May premiership. Would he have used phrases like "brilliantly successful"? No one else ever did - except Downing Street. So there are only two mysteries. Who leaked - quite deliberately - to a journalist who, having been presented with a scoop, promptly used it?
JUL22	Iran crisis shows up our disastrous defence strategy, says LEO McKINSTRY	REALITY is about to bite. There will be little time for celebrations. Whoever is elected Prime Minister tomorrow will immediately face a daunting challenge in the Middle East, where Britain's crisis with Iran could escalate into open conflict. No 10's new incumbent will need to show the kind of foresight, coherence and resolution so far absent from the faltering British response to the hostility of the Tehran regime. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
JUL22	Stand firm, Boris, and help us be free, says NICK FERRARI	DO YOU really care whether it takes "proroguing", prowrestling or even a Pro Am golf tournament to free this nation from the vice-like grip of life within the EU?    No, me neither. Yet to listen to some of the more ardent Remain supporters, No Deal means all trade will stop, the shelves will be empty, the sick will be dying in front of our eyes due to a chronic shortage of medicine, jobs will be lost by the minute and the pound will make the Zimbabwean dollar look like the gold deposits at Fort Knox. Now, when might we have heard that before? That's right. Just before the Brexit referendum, when Project Fear was at its most jangling, discordant worst. One of the claims, put forward by then Chancellor George Osborne, was that 820,000 jobs would have been lost within two years of the vote. Hopelessly out of touch, the reality is employment has actually reached an all-time high and growth in the economy is out-stripping almost all of the other countries in the European Union, including the one time powerhouse, but now dramatically ailing, Germany.

JUL22	Inside Politics: Hurricane Boris heads to Number 10	WHITEHALL is on hurricane alert in anticipation of Boris Johnson's expected landfall in Downing Street next week.    With the former foreign secretary overwhelmingly assumed to be confirmed as victor in the Tory leadership race on Tuesday, officials are preparing for a whirlwind of change to begin thundering through the heart of government the following day. Some civil servants have already been seeking shelter while other prepare rapid evacuation plans. Mr Johnson's arrival is almost certain to bring the level of sweeping change in style and personnel usually seen when power switches from one party to another after a general election. The divide between his supporters and those of outgoing prime minister Theresa May runs so deep many senior aides and officials are expected to follow departing ministers out of the door. " I'm far too associated with Theresa's Brexit deal to stay under the new regime," one senior figure in Downing Street told me this week. Many other Number 10 insiders are understood to feel they are in the same position.
JUL22	It's time for the police to take up arms, say RICHARD AND JUDY	SHOULD our police be routinely armed? Once upon a time, I would have argued passionately that they should not. Once upon a time, the thought of officers on the beat carrying pistols strapped to their hips would have made me deeply uneasy.    Once upon a time, comparisons with trigger-happy cops in the United States would have sprung to mind. Once upon a time. Times change. This week, watching the chilling chest-camera footage of unbelievably brave, unarmed police officers confronting the ruthless trio of knifemen rampaging through Borough Market, I changed my mind.The police were completely defenceless against the three armed terrorists. Their deadly rampage was only brought to an end with the arrival of armed officers, who shot them dead at more or less point-blank range. Until that moment, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, had free rein to kill and mutilate. Yes, late-night bakery workers who courageously joined police in pursuit of the killers had armed themselves - with two plastic bread-baskets and a broom.

JUL22	Remainer MPs are betraying Britain's democratic choice, says TIM NEWARK	WHAT on earth are senior Cabinet members doing? By trying to block any chance of a no-deal Brexit, they are denying the UK and our next prime minister the one weapon that would make the EU take us seriously in our next round of negotiations.    No one wants to see Parliament prorogued, but if Remainer MPs continue to betray the referendum result, it leaves the Government with little choice. Chancellor Philip Hammond abstained in this week's vote against suspending Parliament, thus giving his support to Remainers.

JUL23	Love Island’s Amber gambler Michael sees red, says VANESSA FELTZ	The silly season is upon us and features editors scrambling for content are busy cobbling together features on "Lessons we can learn from Love Island". I've watched every second. I could pretend my job demands it (after all how could I possibly broadcast without being au fait with the antics?) but I'd be fibbing.    I enjoy the escapism, the shenanigans, the good humour, sorority, fraternity and youthful optimism. I'm also entranced by their miscommunication and ill-fated decisions – and the fact that almost 20 years after Big Brother exploded onto our screens and schooled us in the genre of reality TV, being filmed 24 hours a day with cameras recording your every shrug and simper doesn't stop folk behaving as idiotically as they would at home.
JUL23	Boris Johnson could play a political masterstroke as he enters No 10, says STEPHEN POLLARD	SINCE Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon 50 years ago, more people have walked on it than have entered 10 Downing Street as a new prime minister. So when Boris Johnson walks through the door tomorrow – assuming every prediction is correct – it will be a huge and rare moment.    He hasn't yet taken office but he is already being relentlessly attacked as a British version of Donald Trump: a Right-wing populist who will say and do anything to secure power. I'm no particular fan of Mr Johnson. But while there are sensible reasons to worry about his suitability to be PM, the idea that he is some kind of British Trump is simply ridiculous and reveals far more about those making the accusation than it does about Mr Johnson. Both in his record as Mayor of London and throughout the leadership campaign he has behaved as a mainstream liberal Conservative – far more of a "wet" (to use the old Thatcherite terminology) than the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the Right of the Tory party.

JUL24	Boris Johnson’s victory means Government will at last believe in Brexit says LEO McKINSTRY	AFTER all the gloom over Brexit in recent years, those yearning for British independence have something to celebrate. Boris Johnson's landslide victory means Downing Street will be inhabited by a figure who not only believes in freedom from EU rule but was a key architect of the 2016 referendum victory.    There is now a chance our withdrawal could be as early as the end of October. But the celebrations for Johnson's triumph will be muted. He has a daunting challenge that will require all his optimism, resolution and humour. Not since Jim Callaghan took over from Harold Wilson in 1976 during the dark days of soaring inflation and trade union domination, has a new prime minister inherited a tougher legacy. Lacking any Commons majority, Johnson presides over a badly split Parliamentary party, with the anti-Brexiteers in open revolt over no-deal.
JUL24	At last, in Boris Johnson we have a PM who will bring energy and Brexit, says TIM NEWARK	MINISTERS resigning before he even steps into No 10 means Boris Johnson will get no honeymoon period as Prime Minister but he should be allowed to plot a new course for the UK.

JUL25	Now Jeremy Corbyn is the party leader who should be ditched, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE advent of Boris Johnson's premiership has been greeted with a predictable spasm of manufactured outrage by Labour. Brimming with synthetic indignation, Jeremy Corbyn's party mouths its usual slogans of class envy and bleats about the need "for a prime minister on the side of the many, not the few".    In the narrow mindset of the Left, Johnson is the perfect target for this kind of divisive propaganda because of his privileged upbringing and colourful record. Apart from the attacks on Johnson's background and politics, Labour also wail that he was elected only by the Tory membership, not by the public. According to the logic of this accusation, he therefore has no legitimate mandate, so what the country urgently needs is a general election.

Oozing optimism and ambition for Britain's future, he promised that "the years of unfounded self-doubt" would be banished, that the "doomsayers and gloomsters are going to get it wrong". It was a well-crafted address, packed with more detail and less humour than critics might have expected. Given that Johnson is a master of the English language, there were a few punchy lines, like "never mind the backstop, the buck stops with me".

JUL26	Bask in Boris's glow, says CAROLE MALONE	IS IT just me or can you feel it - the shifting of tectonic plates in Westminster, which in just three days has totally transformed the political landscape?    It’s not one many in our virulently Remainer Parliament are chuffed about. But for the British people, who’ve had three yeas of hopelessness and handwringing, of doom and despondency, of being bombarded with End of Days scenarios abut leaving the EU - we’re rejoicing that someone who believes in this country is finally running it. Boris is the force of nature Britain needs. In just three days he’s wiped out three YEARS of Theresa May’s cowering, miserable, defeatist reign wth a tsunami of energy, optimism and his much trumpeted Do or Die spirit.
JUL26	Believe in Britain, we have nothing to fear, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	FOR many Moons we have all been told that we have become two nations - or, at best, one split down the middle actually this has been the case for a long time but always hidden from the majority of us.    Now it is out in the open. But the gulf is not between rich and poor, or North and South, or black and white. It is between the Establishment and those I refer to as the BMP - the Broad Masses of the People. The Establishment is numerically inferior but is the true, unelected government in terms of power, influence and self-reward.
JUL26	Why does the heat send our railways into meltdown, asks ROSS CLARK	THE sun had hardly risen yesterday when Network Rail was announcing that train services would have to be cancelled in anticipation of high temperatures later in the day - in case the heat caused the rails to buckle.    LNER, the state-run train operator that runs services between King's Cross, Leeds, York and Edinburgh, went so far as to advise passengers not to attempt to travel at all. I know it was hot, but that was a pretty extreme message to tell commuters who had to get to work - to staff hospitals, run banks and yes, even to help the new Government prepare for Brexit. As usual, at the slightest sign of adverse weather the country was grinding to a halt, unable to cope with conditions that would be considered normal in many countries.

Not since Jim Callaghan took over from Harold Wilson in 1976 during the dark days of soaring inflation and trade union domination, has a new prime minister inherited a tougher legacy. Lacking any Commons majority, Johnson presides over a badly split Parliamentary party, with the anti-Brexiteers in open revolt over no-deal.
JUL26	At last, in Boris Johnson we have a PM who will bring energy and Brexit, says TIM NEWARK	MINISTERS resigning before he even steps into No 10 means Boris Johnson will get no honeymoon period as Prime Minister but he should be allowed to plot a new course for the UK. He has a clear and decisive mandate from both his own MPs and the Conservative Party membership, and will no doubt be keen to test his support in the country – but not too soon, please.

JUL26	Love Island’s Amber gambler Michael sees red, says VANESSA FELTZ	The silly season is upon us and features editors scrambling for content are busy cobbling together features on "Lessons we can learn from Love Island". I've watched every second. I could pretend my job demands it (after all how could I possibly broadcast without being au fait with the antics?) but I'd be fibbing.    I enjoy the escapism, the shenanigans, the good humour, sorority, fraternity and youthful optimism. I'm also entranced by their miscommunication and ill-fated decisions – and the fact that almost 20 years after Big Brother exploded onto our screens and schooled us in the genre of reality TV, being filmed 24 hours a day with cameras recording your every shrug and simper doesn't stop folk behaving as idiotically as they would at home.
JUL26	Boris Johnson could play a political masterstroke as he enters No 10, says STEPHEN POLLARD	SINCE Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon 50 years ago, more people have walked on it than have entered 10 Downing Street as a new prime minister. So when Boris Johnson walks through the door tomorrow – assuming every prediction is correct – it will be a huge and rare moment.    He hasn't yet taken office but he is already being relentlessly attacked as a British version of Donald Trump: a Right-wing populist who will say and do anything to secure power. I'm no particular fan of Mr Johnson. But while there are sensible reasons to worry about his suitability to be PM, the idea that he is some kind of British Trump is simply ridiculous and reveals far more about those making the accusation than it does about Mr Johnson. Both in his record as Mayor of London and throughout the leadership campaign he has behaved as a mainstream liberal Conservative – far more of a "wet" (to use the old Thatcherite terminology) than the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the Right of the Tory party.
JUL27	Decorating a nightclub with Boris's 'brainbox' gave me a hint of the Brexit to come	PAINTING a nightclub with Dominic Cummings... it sounds like the lame title for a bizarre TV series even Alan Partridge might think twice about pitching. In actual fact it’s what I once did for a summer job when I was in my teens.    You see back then Dominic wasn’t a Brexit brainbox acting as a shadowy consigliere to the Prime Minster on ways to outfox Brussels and make our bananas bendy again. Oh no, at that time, in the very early 1990s, he was earning a crust in his summer break from Oxford University as a manager and some time bouncer at his uncle’s then-notorious Durham nightspot Klute. I say notorious because Klute, situated near Elvet Bridge in delightful Durham City and now enjoying a much better reputation, once proudly advertised the fact that it had been voted Europe’s Worst Nightclub.

JUL27	Bask in Boris's glow, says CAROLE MALONE	IS IT just me or can you feel it - the shifting of tectonic plates in Westminster, which in just three days has totally transformed the political landscape?    It’s not one many in our virulently Remainer Parliament are chuffed about. But for the British people, who’ve had three yeas of hopelessness and handwringing, of doom and despondency, of being bombarded with End of Days scenarios abut leaving the EU - we’re rejoicing that someone who believes in this country is finally running it. Boris is the force of nature Britain needs. In just three days he’s wiped out three YEARS of Theresa May’s cowering, miserable, defeatist reign wth a tsunami of energy, optimism and his much trumpeted Do or Die spirit.
JUL27	Believe in Britain, we have nothing to fear, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	FOR many Moons we have all been told that we have become two nations - or, at best, one split down the middle actually this has been the case for a long time but always hidden from the majority of us.    Now it is out in the open. But the gulf is not between rich and poor, or North and South, or black and white. It is between the Establishment and those I refer to as the BMP - the Broad Masses of the People. The Establishment is numerically inferior but is the true, unelected government in terms of power, influence and self-reward.
JUL27	Why does the heat send our railways into meltdown, asks ROSS CLARK	THE sun had hardly risen yesterday when Network Rail was announcing that train services would have to be cancelled in anticipation of high temperatures later in the day - in case the heat caused the rails to buckle.    LNER, the state-run train operator that runs services between King's Cross, Leeds, York and Edinburgh, went so far as to advise passengers not to attempt to travel at all. I know it was hot, but that was a pretty extreme message to tell commuters who had to get to work - to staff hospitals, run banks and yes, even to help the new Government prepare for Brexit. As usual, at the slightest sign of adverse weather the country was grinding to a halt, unable to cope with conditions that would be considered normal in many countries.

It must be awful for them." As a summary of snobby attitudes towards the North of England, it was deadly accurate and since then no government has been able to shift the dial.    In fact, few have bothered trying. Under New Labour and the Tories alike, while northern cities were starved of major investment, vast sums were ploughed into London-orientated infrastructure such as the HS1 rail line, the Jubilee Line Extension and Crossrail. All were promoted by a mindset that viewed London as the golden city that could generate the prosperity needed to fund public services across the land.

JUL31	Raise interest rates and put an end to Project Fear, says TIM NEWARK	Sterling plunging to a two-year low is just another example of Project Fear as City traders get nervous over a no-deal Brexit. But the best way to rally the pound is to raise interest rates and make thousands of hard-pressed savers happy after a decade of ridiculously low-interest rates that have only benefitted the super-rich.    Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to appoint a new Bank of England governor sooner rather than later to make this happen and also strengthen our Brexit preparations. It was the present governor, gloom-master-in-chief Mark Carney, who mistakenly cut interest rates immediately after the referendum result in 2016, anticipating an economy brought to its knees by the leave vote.

I have no doubt that most of them sign up because they want to fight crime and make life better for law-abiding citizens. Yet this week’s headlines cause me to despair. For years police chiefs have been complaining, rightly, that their numbers have been reduced to a point where they cannot do their job, having fallen by some 20,000. So, at last, we have a PM who listens and promises to make up the shortfall. Do they rejoice? Do they cry “criminals, beware!” Nope. Unbelievably, the College of Policing whinges that the police won’t have enough lockers to accommodate the rise. You couldn’t make it up.

AUG1	Scourge of stamp duty kills hopes of so many - EXPRESS COMMENT	STAMP duty distorts the housing market, chokes aspiration and has terrible implications for people of all ages.    Many older citizens would love to downsize, and millions of families long to move into somewhere bigger, but stamp duty can add eye-watering costs to a property transaction. This means that pensioners are stuck with the challenge of heating homes with many more bedrooms than they need. Meanwhile, parents in crowded accommodation find that the dream of a house in which each of their children has somewhere to do homework in peace and quiet remains out of reach.
AUG1	We are probably the best drunks in the world, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	KERRING! News crashes in of a minor fracas involving some fellow Britons. Except that it's not that minor and it's more than just a fracas. Something approaching a riot broke out on a P&O; cruise ship after an incident involving a man dressed as a clown upset fellow revellers in a "patriotic" event on the ship in the early hours of the morning. Arrests were made.    There was blood in the buffet. One mustn't make light of it at all. And yet... For a start, whenever I see a clown my thoughts turn to violence, so you can't totally blame them. (P&O, incidentally, totally denies a clown was involved. More mysterious still.) Secondly, there is the minor matter of the fact that "drink was involved". I bet it was. To be more specific, some of the passengers had paid for a package that allowed them up to 15 drinks per day and although staff were meant to ensure that there was a pause of 15 minutes between drinks, this was not a rule that was enforced very closely. I bet it wasn't.
AUG1	Police must face a robust new probe into Carl Beech affair, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE fallout from the Westminster abuse scandal continues to heap shame on the police. When the controversy first became public in 2014, senior officers said that the testimony of Carl Beech, the main accuser, was "credible and true", despite the implausible nature of his lurid allegations against a host of senior establishment figures.    Yet the police's early belief in him could not have been more ill-judged, for he turned out to be a monstrous fantasist and paedophile. Last week, having been convicted of a lengthy catalogue of serious offences, he was given 18 years in jail. Now comes a further humiliation for the police. This week the former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques launched a savage attack on their spectacularly botched investigation. Complaining that "the course of justice was perverted", Sir Richard wrote that officers may have broken the law when they obtained warrants to search for evidence, given their knowledge that Beech's account was deeply flawed and riddled with inconsistencies.

I have no doubt that most of them sign up because they want to fight crime and make life better for law-abiding citizens. Yet this week’s headlines cause me to despair. For years police chiefs have been complaining, rightly, that their numbers have been reduced to a point where they cannot do their job, having fallen by some 20,000. So, at last, we have a PM who listens and promises to make up the shortfall. Do they rejoice? Do they cry “criminals, beware!” Nope. Unbelievably, the College of Policing whinges that the police won’t have enough lockers to accommodate the rise. You couldn’t make it up. 
AUG1	Time to scrap HS2 and find new ways to boost the North, says PATRICK O’FLYNN	THERE was a famous comedy sketch written by the late Victoria Wood that featured a TV announcer with a cut-glass accent saying: "We'd like to apologise to our viewers in the North. It must be awful for them." As a summary of snobby attitudes towards the North of England, it was deadly accurate and since then no government has been able to shift the dial.    In fact, few have bothered trying. Under New Labour and the Tories alike, while northern cities were starved of major investment, vast sums were ploughed into London-orientated infrastructure such as the HS1 rail line, the Jubilee Line Extension and Crossrail. All were promoted by a mindset that viewed London as the golden city that could generate the prosperity needed to fund public services across the land.
AUG1	I’d put money on Simon Cowell winning an Oscar, says VANESSA FELTZ	He’s shed 20 pounds, embraced an “almost vegan” diet and at the age of 59 Simon Cowell inspires braying hoots of derision from a rotten rabble who think he should keep his ambition under control. Instead of resting comfortably on his lavish laurels, Simon plans for further world domination.    With his instinct for lucrative opportunities, he has witnessed the success of recent biopics featuring Freddie Mercury and Sir Elton John. Mr Cowell thinks he could do a bang-up job of turning other musical giants into silver-screen extravaganzas and very much fancies winning an Oscar along the way. He is still hit-hungry. His desire for conquest is as hot approaching 60 as it was in his 20s. He’s not ready to sip into ritzy retirement. There’s studios to woo, scripts to commission, actors to audition and a new avenue of experience to stroll.  Doubt at your peril. 
AUG1	Like Churchill before him, dynamic Boris Johnson has lifted the gloom, says LEO MCKINSTRY	THE day that Winston Churchill became prime minister in May 1940, the impact was immediate. A new mood of intensity and determination swept through the government machine, focused on the single goal of national survival. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG1	Boris Johnson WILL deliver Brexit and this is how I know, says NICK FERRARI	WAS IT when he stopped me from jumping on to the platform of a slow-moving London bus, and laughed as I was left temporarily stranded? This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG2	Inside Politics: Labour stares into the abyss	FEW MPs can be more grateful for the onset of the political holiday season than Jeremy Corbyn.    Labour MPs departed Westminster for Parliament’s summer break more downcast than ever about the dire state of their party under his leadership. Yesterday’s dismal fourth place for Labour in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, with the party almost losing its deposit, can only deepen their gloom. Mr Corbyn must be relieved at not having to face Boris Johnson in the Commons for a full six weeks.
AUG2	Putting me in Meghan once again, say RICHARD AND JUDY	J - JUST when I decide I’m really not going to write about Meghan Markle again, she does something so public, so me-me-me, that, like every other columnist, I can’t help but react.    It’s not that the Duchess’s appearance in the September edition of Vogue magazine is unusual in royal circles. Kate Middleton was on the front cover of the magazine’s centenary edition in 2016 looking jolly and bucolic in a sporty country hat. Princess Diana appeared many times and even our most un-princessy of royals, Anne, made the cover in the 1970s (and incredibly sexy she looked too, all wide eyes and pouting lips. Nice to remember our no-nonsense Anne was quite a hottie in her time). 
AUG2	Google junket shows Harry’s rather green, says CAROLE MALONE	IT TOOK Prince Harry years to shake off his bad boy image - the one that had us all thinking he was a bit thick and destined, as the spare not the heir, for a life of idleness, partying and wild women. Then he joined the Army - and everything changed. Harry the man emerged from the shell of Harry the party boy.    And we adored him, not just for being Action Man, but for his sensitivity and caring towards those wounded in action. The Invictus Games for disabled servicemen and women - his brainchild - was a rip roaring, inspirational success. Finally, this warm, wonderful young man, who had a reputation for diving into crowds and hugging whoever came his way, had found a purpose. And the British public were 100 percent team Harry.
AUG2	Time to deliver on free TV licences for elderly - EXPRESS COMMENT	BORIS Johnson must not ignore the plea of nearly 635,000 people for him to save free TV licences for pensioners.    This is an early test for the Prime Minister who will be fully aware of the power pensioners possess at the ballot box. We are confident he will deliver. On the campaign trail he left nobody in any doubt that the BBC should be "coughing up" the cash rather than making over-75s pay to watch television. Pensioners turned up on his Downing St doorstep yesterday with a petition urging him to "do the right thing". He will face anger and dismay if millions of older citizens have to pay £154.50 or risk prosecution.
AUG2	There is a secret letter to end this Irish backstop nonsense, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	MANY of us thought we had seen the backside of the Irish Backstop – but it is back in full anti-British malign force. Basically, this ludicrous capitulation by Theresa May has no benefit for the EU at all but would cause huge damage to Britain. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG2	How on earth can the elite lecture us over climate change? asks ROSS CLARK	IF you set out to satirise the hypocrisy of the global elite when it comes to tackling climate change you probably wouldn’t come up with the idea of the Google Climate Camp. It is just too ridiculous. Who on earth would believe that a conference supposedly about tackling climate change would attract celebrities travelling in 114 private jets? This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG2	Scourge of stamp duty kills hopes of so many - EXPRESS COMMENT	STAMP duty distorts the housing market, chokes aspiration and has terrible implications for people of all ages.    Many older citizens would love to downsize, and millions of families long to move into somewhere bigger, but stamp duty can add eye-watering costs to a property transaction. This means that pensioners are stuck with the challenge of heating homes with many more bedrooms than they need. Meanwhile, parents in crowded accommodation find that the dream of a house in which each of their children has somewhere to do homework in peace and quiet remains out of reach.
AUG2	We are probably the best drunks in the world, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	KERRING! News crashes in of a minor fracas involving some fellow Britons. Except that it's not that minor and it's more than just a fracas. Something approaching a riot broke out on a P&O; cruise ship after an incident involving a man dressed as a clown upset fellow revellers in a "patriotic" event on the ship in the early hours of the morning. Arrests were made.    There was blood in the buffet. One mustn't make light of it at all. And yet... For a start, whenever I see a clown my thoughts turn to violence, so you can't totally blame them. (P&O, incidentally, totally denies a clown was involved. More mysterious still.) Secondly, there is the minor matter of the fact that "drink was involved". I bet it was. To be more specific, some of the passengers had paid for a package that allowed them up to 15 drinks per day and although staff were meant to ensure that there was a pause of 15 minutes between drinks, this was not a rule that was enforced very closely. I bet it wasn't.
AUG2	Police must face a robust new probe into Carl Beech affair, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE fallout from the Westminster abuse scandal continues to heap shame on the police. When the controversy first became public in 2014, senior officers said that the testimony of Carl Beech, the main accuser, was "credible and true", despite the implausible nature of his lurid allegations against a host of senior establishment figures.    Yet the police's early belief in him could not have been more ill-judged, for he turned out to be a monstrous fantasist and paedophile. Last week, having been convicted of a lengthy catalogue of serious offences, he was given 18 years in jail. Now comes a further humiliation for the police. This week the former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques launched a savage attack on their spectacularly botched investigation. Complaining that "the course of justice was perverted", Sir Richard wrote that officers may have broken the law when they obtained warrants to search for evidence, given their knowledge that Beech's account was deeply flawed and riddled with inconsistencies.

AUG3	Celebrities make mockery of Goggle climate change camp, says JENNIFER SELWAY	GOOGLE hosted a three-day “summer camp” in Sicily last week for the great, the good and the A-listed. The theme was – you guessed it – climate change.    And of course the snarky squad was quick to point out that the arrival of 114 gas-guzzling private jets and sundry super-yachts rather went against the spirit of the thing. Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Katy Perry, George Clooney and Harry Styles were on the guest list – which is, incidentally, in theory confidential. Isn’t it a relief to know that Harry Styles is a force for change vis-a-vis global warming? I can sleep easy now. 
AUG4	Happy Mondays, says Carole Ann Rice	THE gloom of winter is well known as a trigger for Seasonal Affective Disorder, bringing zero-energy and a time where we cocoon into part human/part duvet larvae.    However it is entirely possible that blue skies and scorching heat can have us in a mood meltdown as temperatures soar and our spirits plummet. Throwing back the curtains to another day of searing heat can take the wind out of anyone’s pointlessly inadequate bedroom fan. Those who live in the city know the horror of sweltering public transport, the aromas that would rival a French fromagerie in a power cut and the sort of feet on display in sandals that usually would be the biological preserve of creatures with tusks, horns and “danger – do not touch” notices. 
AUG4	Brexit: Polls squabbles are a gift to Remainers - EXPRESS COMMENT	BREXIT donor Arron Banks claims that at least 10 Conservative MPs have urged him to persuade Nigel Farage not to field candidates against them in a general election.    There is every chance the country may go to the polls in the near future. Brexiteers who have devoted years to getting the UK out of the EU will be dismayed if this leads to a Remain alliance taking power. One MP suggested that if Jeremy Corbyn wins the keys to Downing Street with the help of the SNP the future of the UK itself will be in doubt.

We used to pass by, laugh at the lunacy of the doomsayers, shrug and carry on happily with our own lives. Today, though, the people predicting the end of the world aren’t standing on street corners shouting into the wind, they’re on our TV screens, leading political parties and are even members of the Royal Family. The doomsday cultists have gone mainstream and now anyone who’s anyone is busy predicting the impending green apocalypse.

AUG6	It’s time to get tough with criminals which means building more jails, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	Priti Patel says criminals should feel terror at the thought of breaking the law and fear the police. She is quite right and the announcement of another 20,000 police is welcome but if she wants to deliver real change it will mean extra resources throughout the entire justice system.    Someone who puts a knife in a pocket or handbag does so because there are no consequences to fear. The first step, therefore, is that such people must fear stop and search and that is where the extra police will be useful, but there must also be a concentrated effort to increase stop and search to the point where the knife-carrier thinks it more likely to happen than not. That means deploying officers in droves.  The next step is that there must be a consequence of having a knife, beyond mere confiscation. Carriers must be arrested on the spot which means having sufficient cells and processing facilities. 
AUG6	Boris Johnson, the People's PM, must show he is serious about social care, says TIM NEWARK	Two blonds met in a boozer, Boris Johnson and Babs Windsor at the Queen Vic pub when he was London mayor. And now he is Prime Minister he should certainly back Dame Barbara’s demand for fairer treatment for dementia sufferers and their carers.    It is his great opportunity to show he is truly a People’s PM, listening to our national concerns. In a heartfelt plea in an open letter to the PM, the 82-year-old film and TV icon laid out the terrible cost to families as their loved ones succumb to the ageing disease. Diagnosed herself with Alzheimer’s, she knows the pressure it puts on relationships. About 850,000 thousand people in the UK are affected by dementia and yet, if that was not bad enough, their relatives then frequently have to face the agonising decision of selling the family home to pay for the costs of much needed social care. The threshold at which sufferers don’t have to pay for care has been set scandalously low at just £23,250 in assets and yet they may face up to £100,000 a year in care costs.
AUG6	Pack it in Harry, this virtue signalling is starting to get weird, says VANESSA FELTZ	HOW charming for Prince Harry to wish his 38-year-old wife a happy birthday. How utterly weird for him to do so on social media. Call me old fashioned but why is it de rigueur to express felicitations to loved ones in the public arena when we can see them over breakfast?    If Harry wants to say to Meghan: “Thank you for joining me on this adventure”, why doesn’t he lean over the muesli and say so, using actual words? This isn’t virtue signalling. It’s “love signalling” and he’s saying: “I love my wife and I want you to know it.” Just as when your pal posts: “Well done to my son on his GCSEs” on social media, the question remains – why make a private issue so public? 
AUG6	We can’t put the social media genie back in the bottle, says STEPHEN POLLARD	There is nothing remotely surprising about a new survey from the charity Action for Children which shows the high level of anxiety among youngsters caused by social media. And it’s not just youngsters – it’s also one of the most worrying aspects of modern parenting.    But the poll of 5,000 11- to 18-year-olds is no less shocking for being entirely unsurprising. It shows just what a blight cyberbullying is on modern childhood. More than a third of all children say they’re worried about online threats. And even though 57 percent say they don’t tell their parents about their social media worries, almost half of all adults are nonetheless seriously worried about children’s safety online. Bullying has always existed. But in the pre-digital world, victims at least had sanctuary at home.

AUG8	Is there nothing these puritans will not interfere with? asks VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	And so the march of puritanism goes on. The miserable shall inherit the earth, at the rate we're going. The latest to succumb to those who specialise in taking offence at the completely offence-less are, of all people, those behind the Great British Beer Festival. They have forbidden real ale enthusiasts from giving their beers sexist names such as dizzy Blonde, Slack Alice, Top Totty and The Village Bike.    There are some fruitier examples, too, that perhaps shouldn't be repeated here. But how depressing. How unnecessary. And how very un-British. The reason for this idiocy is that some survey of spoilsport women said they wouldn't buy beer if it was advertised in a sexist way (do grow up), leading the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) to act. naughty names are banned. Well here's a thing: quite a lot of women, including me, wouldn't buy beer however it was advertised, because we can't stand the stuff. Give me a glass of champers any day. 
AUG8	John McDonnell has cynically exploded a bomb under Labour party, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE failure of Westminster to deliver Brexit has thrown British politics into a state of flux. Amid continuing parliamentary gridlock and public exasperation, the old two-party system is breaking down.
In this atmosphere of chaotic uncertainty, where Labour and the Tories both sank below 15 percent of the vote in the recent European elections, there is now constant talk of new coalitions to counter the loss of traditional support.    Many Conservatives, terrified of the surge behind the Brexit Party, want an electoral pact with Nigel Farage. The Liberal Democrats plot a Remainer alliance, building on their success last week at the Brecon by-election, which was helped by the Greens and Plaid Cymru standing aside. But for cynical opportunism, it would be impossible to beat the collusion that has emerged this week between the Scottish Nationalists and the Labour leadership.

About 850,000 thousand people in the UK are affected by dementia and yet, if that was not bad enough, their relatives then frequently have to face the agonising decision of selling the family home to pay for the costs of much needed social care. The threshold at which sufferers don’t have to pay for care has been set scandalously low at just £23,250 in assets and yet they may face up to £100,000 a year in care costs.
AUG8	Pack it in Harry, this virtue signalling is starting to get weird, says VANESSA FELTZ	HOW charming for Prince Harry to wish his 38-year-old wife a happy birthday. How utterly weird for him to do so on social media. Call me old fashioned but why is it de rigueur to express felicitations to loved ones in the public arena when we can see them over breakfast?    If Harry wants to say to Meghan: “Thank you for joining me on this adventure”, why doesn’t he lean over the muesli and say so, using actual words? This isn’t virtue signalling. It’s “love signalling” and he’s saying: “I love my wife and I want you to know it.” Just as when your pal posts: “Well done to my son on his GCSEs” on social media, the question remains – why make a private issue so public? 
AUG8	We can’t put the social media genie back in the bottle, says STEPHEN POLLARD	There is nothing remotely surprising about a new survey from the charity Action for Children which shows the high level of anxiety among youngsters caused by social media. And it’s not just youngsters – it’s also one of the most worrying aspects of modern parenting.    But the poll of 5,000 11- to 18-year-olds is no less shocking for being entirely unsurprising. It shows just what a blight cyberbullying is on modern childhood. More than a third of all children say they’re worried about online threats. And even though 57 percent say they don’t tell their parents about their social media worries, almost half of all adults are nonetheless seriously worried about children’s safety online. Bullying has always existed. But in the pre-digital world, victims at least had sanctuary at home.
AUG8	That 'Boris bounce' may not be a winner yet at a General Election, says LEO MCKINSTRY	THE drumbeat for a swift general election is growing louder by the day. Bolstered by a surge in support for the new Prime Minister, Tory High Command is now said to be on a "war footing". This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG8	Happy Mondays, says Carole Ann Rice	THE gloom of winter is well known as a trigger for Seasonal Affective Disorder, bringing zero-energy and a time where we cocoon into part human/part duvet larvae.    However it is entirely possible that blue skies and scorching heat can have us in a mood meltdown as temperatures soar and our spirits plummet. Throwing back the curtains to another day of searing heat can take the wind out of anyone’s pointlessly inadequate bedroom fan. Those who live in the city know the horror of sweltering public transport, the aromas that would rival a French fromagerie in a power cut and the sort of feet on display in sandals that usually would be the biological preserve of creatures with tusks, horns and “danger – do not touch” notices. 
AUG8	Brexit: Polls squabbles are a gift to Remainers - EXPRESS COMMENT	BREXIT donor Arron Banks claims that at least 10 Conservative MPs have urged him to persuade Nigel Farage not to field candidates against them in a general election.    There is every chance the country may go to the polls in the near future. Brexiteers who have devoted years to getting the UK out of the EU will be dismayed if this leads to a Remain alliance taking power. One MP suggested that if Jeremy Corbyn wins the keys to Downing Street with the help of the SNP the future of the UK itself will be in doubt.
AUG8	'Don't panic about climate change, the end isn't nigh', says talkRADIO Presenter	REMEMBER those men who used to wander the streets with placards proclaiming “The End Is Nigh” in big black letters, shouting about how the world is about to be destroyed and how we’ll all go to Hell?    We used to pass by, laugh at the lunacy of the doomsayers, shrug and carry on happily with our own lives. Today, though, the people predicting the end of the world aren’t standing on street corners shouting into the wind, they’re on our TV screens, leading political parties and are even members of the Royal Family. The doomsday cultists have gone mainstream and now anyone who’s anyone is busy predicting the impending green apocalypse. 
AUG9	Jeremy Corbyn and Labour are too thick to run the country, says CAROLE MALONE	John McDonnell’s plan to send Jeremy Corbyn in a cab to the Palace and demand that the Queen puts the country in his hands is quite simply beyond farce. First, she’s not there. She’s in Balmoral for the summer. You’d think even someone as rabidly anti-royal as McDonnell and Corbyn would know that.    Second, two-bob politicians like Corbyn or McDonnell don’t get to demand an audience with Her Maj. Third, if Corbyn tried to force his way into seeing her (hard to imagine him forcing his way out of a paper bag), there’d be a posse of armed guards to show him that little plan isn’t a goer. Four, what Mcdonnell is talking about is in effect a coup and unless he’s planning to arm Momentum with some secret cache of AK-47s (yes, yes I know they’d like that) to take back control, it ain’t going to happen. 
AUG9	Remainers are not only undemocratic they are a threat to democracy, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	Many years ago I stood for a while beside a military cemetery in a small town in Pennsylvania. I did so because I was standing on the exact spot where, on November 19, 1863, a great president had stood and delivered one of the greatest speeches of all time – the Gettysburg Declaration. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG9	Why are airlines allowed to make a misery of flying? asks ROSS CLARK	HOW painful it is if you are contemplating a holiday flight over the next few weeks, to watch PanAm's promotional film for the first commercial transatlantic jet flight in 1958. Even the economy passengers sit with such unimaginable levels of legroom that they don't even have to get up when someone wants to get in and out of the window seat.    They are served fresh food on proper plates, can wander up to a lounge and visit a "powder room". What's more, the journey takes six-and-a-half hours – quicker than many planes take to fly from New York to London today. Yes, of course, jet travel is safer now and the cost has fallen to a level that makes foreign holidays affordable for many more of us. Neither do we have to put up with fellow passengers smoking.
AUG9	Is there nothing these puritans will not interfere with? asks VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	And so the march of puritanism goes on. The miserable shall inherit the earth, at the rate we're going. The latest to succumb to those who specialise in taking offence at the completely offence-less are, of all people, those behind the Great British Beer Festival. They have forbidden real ale enthusiasts from giving their beers sexist names such as dizzy Blonde, Slack Alice, Top Totty and The Village Bike.    There are some fruitier examples, too, that perhaps shouldn't be repeated here. But how depressing. How unnecessary. And how very un-British. The reason for this idiocy is that some survey of spoilsport women said they wouldn't buy beer if it was advertised in a sexist way (do grow up), leading the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) to act. naughty names are banned. Well here's a thing: quite a lot of women, including me, wouldn't buy beer however it was advertised, because we can't stand the stuff. Give me a glass of champers any day. 
AUG9	John McDonnell has cynically exploded a bomb under Labour party, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE failure of Westminster to deliver Brexit has thrown British politics into a state of flux. Amid continuing parliamentary gridlock and public exasperation, the old two-party system is breaking down.
In this atmosphere of chaotic uncertainty, where Labour and the Tories both sank below 15 percent of the vote in the recent European elections, there is now constant talk of new coalitions to counter the loss of traditional support.    Many Conservatives, terrified of the surge behind the Brexit Party, want an electoral pact with Nigel Farage. The Liberal Democrats plot a Remainer alliance, building on their success last week at the Brecon by-election, which was helped by the Greens and Plaid Cymru standing aside. But for cynical opportunism, it would be impossible to beat the collusion that has emerged this week between the Scottish Nationalists and the Labour leadership. 
AUG9	It’s time to get tough with criminals which means building more jails, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	Priti Patel says criminals should feel terror at the thought of breaking the law and fear the police. She is quite right and the announcement of another 20,000 police is welcome but if she wants to deliver real change it will mean extra resources throughout the entire justice system.    Someone who puts a knife in a pocket or handbag does so because there are no consequences to fear. The first step, therefore, is that such people must fear stop and search and that is where the extra police will be useful, but there must also be a concentrated effort to increase stop and search to the point where the knife-carrier thinks it more likely to happen than not. That means deploying officers in droves.  The next step is that there must be a consequence of having a knife, beyond mere confiscation. Carriers must be arrested on the spot which means having sufficient cells and processing facilities. 
AUG9	Boris Johnson, the People's PM, must show he is serious about social care, says TIM NEWARK	Two blonds met in a boozer, Boris Johnson and Babs Windsor at the Queen Vic pub when he was London mayor. And now he is Prime Minister he should certainly back Dame Barbara’s demand for fairer treatment for dementia sufferers and their carers.    It is his great opportunity to show he is truly a People’s PM, listening to our national concerns. In a heartfelt plea in an open letter to the PM, the 82-year-old film and TV icon laid out the terrible cost to families as their loved ones succumb to the ageing disease. Diagnosed herself with Alzheimer’s, she knows the pressure it puts on relationships. About 850,000 thousand people in the UK are affected by dementia and yet, if that was not bad enough, their relatives then frequently have to face the agonising decision of selling the family home to pay for the costs of much needed social care.

AUG10	Dementia's no bar to rock, says BARBARA STEPHENS	BOB DYLAN famously turned his back on Woodstock to travel 3,000 miles to perform at the Isle of Wight Festival 50 years ago this month. On Saturday, August 31, the Million Dollar bash festival in Cowes will honour the anniversary and pay tribute.    It’s an opportunity for music fans of all ages to pay homage to the brilliant music of the day. But the Bash will be something else.. it’s set to be the world’s first dementia- friendly rock festival. Because the “beautiful people” who were young and part of the hippie generation in the Sixties are in the prime of demographic today for being at risk of dementia. One in 14 people over 65 has a type of dementia and this proportion increases one in six people over the age of 80. Million Dollar Bash will welcome people living with dementia and their partners, friends and carers, not because this is an event specifically for people with dementia - it isn’t - but because, just like anyone else who was a music enthusiast in the Sixties and Seventies, with enduring memories of the iconic island festival featuring Dylan plus great acts such as The Who, Joe Cocker, and Free, people living with dementia will enjoy the nostalgia of this 50th anniversary event.
AUG10	Blame the SNP if Corbyn gets a taxi to Buckingham Palace, says NICK FERRARI	IT IS a prospect that chills the blood. Some time next month, Marxist Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell steps into the Autumn sunshine in Westminster and hails a cab.    Having loaded long-time pal and confessed anti-Monarchist Jeremy Corbyn into the back, he instructs the driver to head to Buckingham Palace. Once there, Mr. Corbyn - who has said he sees little point in continuing with the monarchy - seeks an audience with the Queen and informs her that as Boris Johnson has lost a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons, he will be boring a government, albeit with this nightmarish scenario only being made possible with the fulsome support of the SNP. To get to this point, according to Comrade McDonnell, Labour could have agreed to referendums in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. They would also have had to promise the Lib Dems a second referendum on leaving the EU.
AUG10	For Dorothy's sake, we really have to get tough on crime, says LEO MCKINSTRY	Even in our increasingly lawless society, there are still crimes that have the capacity to shock. Two such incidents occurred last week.    In the first, 89-year-old Dorothy Woolmer was raped and murdered by a thug who broke into her north London home. This was an act that shows how badly order has broken down. In any morally cohesive society, a widower like Mrs Woolmer, whose late husband served this country in the royal navy, would be cherished in her old age, not targeted in this appalling way.

AUG10	Why we've changed our minds on no-deal Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	FOR many months this newspaper backed the efforts by Theresa May and others to get a deal with the European Union.

Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG10	Extra police will be in vain unless we fix justice system, says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT'S a sign of how out of touch so much of the political class is that their reaction to Home Secretary Priti Patel's vow to make criminals "literally feel terror" has been to sneer.    The core purpose of government is to guarantee our security. One part of that is economic security. But another part is our security on the streets and in our own home. Ms Patel understands that - and so too does her boss, Boris Johnson. Yesterday he hailed the "amazing" hero policeman who was horrendously slashed in a machete attack as he protected a female colleague.

AUG11	It's Boris's chance to stop this bloodbath, EXPRESS COMMENT	BACK in the 1990s Tony Blair famously vowed to protect the vulnerable by being “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime”.    For all his foreign policy failings Mr Blair was an intuitive politician who understood that soft justice is not only unpopular, it also leads to more crime.

AUG12	Today's politicians are awful – even the Queen says so... apparently, says STEPHEN POLLARD	Not once in her 67 years on the throne has Queen Elizabeth said publicly what she really thinks about any political issue, however uncontroversial her views may be. On very rare occasions, she has dropped a hint. But even then it has always been veiled and we rely on interpreting her words rather than any direct statement of her views.    This, most observers believe, is the secret to her success as monarch – that she is genuinely above politics. No matter who the prime minister may be and what party they come from, none of us actually know what she thinks. Which is why any story that appears to reveal those beliefs makes waves. At the weekend, a newspaper reported that the Queen has privately lamented the calibre of our current political class and its “inability to govern”. She was apparently speaking shortly after David Cameron’s resignation in 2016 in the wake of the Brexit referendum. 
AUG13	Trump's backing of no deal Brexit should strike fear into the heart of EU, says TIM NEWARK	When the going gets tough, it’s good to know who your friends are and John Bolton, US National Security Adviser, has made it clear that the world’s biggest economy is keen to fix a trade deal with the UK sector by sector to avoid delays.    “We see the importance and urgency of doing as much as we can agree on as rapidly as ­possible,” he says, “because of the impending October 31 exit date.” It’s a clever response to the doomsayers who moan that trade deals take years to ­negotiate. We clearly share ­similar values over many aspects of trade, so why not shelve the difficult bits and speedily gain easier access to each other’s markets? It’ll give a lift to our economy post-Brexit and could set the tone for other rapid trade deals with major economies. 
AUG14	Who’s betraying whom in Britain’s Brexit battle? - EXPRESS COMMENT	THERE was fighting talk from Boris Johnson when he took to Facebook to answer questions from members of the public. The Prime Minister accused MPs who thought they could block Brexit of taking part in a “terrible collaboration” with the EU.    His words will dismay critics who fear the divisions in our country will only deepen if one side in the debate is portrayed as betraying Britain. But Mr Johnson was not just letting off steam. He knows he needs to convince Brussels that Britain is ready to quit the EU without a deal, and that Remainers in Parliament will not be able to stop this. As he put it: “The more they think there’s a chance that Brexit can be blocked in Parliament, the more adamant they are in sticking to their position.”

AUG15	Target crime bosses, not just their foot soldiers - EXPRESS COMMENT	EVERY society faces the challenge of protecting innocent people from criminals who mercilessly prey on the vulnerable.    The duty of the police, courts and Government is nothing less than to fight the forces of evil. Thieves and rapists who terrify victims forfeit their right to freedom and should be kept behind bars. It is deeply worrying that the number of criminals before courts in England and Wales is at an all-time low.
AUG15	My greatest regret is not getting pregnant by a rich rock god, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	I HAVE one major regret. When I was a cute twentysomething I totally failed to get myself knocked up by a septuagenarian rock god, thus setting myself up for life.    Mick Jagger's latest baby mama has a $5million Manhattan townhouse; it would be worth putting up with the ageing rocker on a part-time basis for that. Nor is she alone in her good fortune, although she never actually married the old goat, for a new report has just said that tying the knot multiple times is better for women than for men. I bet it is.

Nevertheless, there is something about the latest clutch of economic figures which suggest we may well be heading for a recession, and it isn't just that stock markets are tumbling.    GDP figures published by the Office for National Statistics last week showed that between April and June, the UK economy experienced its first quarter of negative growth since 2012. That was followed sharply by similar news from Germany. Italy has already had a recession, in the second half of last year, and appears to be heading for another, while in China, economic growth has slowed to its lowest level in years. Meanwhile, investors spotted an arcane phenomenon known as an "inverted yield curve". This is when the yield – or interest – on a 10-year US Treasury bond falls below that of a two-year bond.
AUG16	Target crime bosses, not just their foot soldiers - EXPRESS COMMENT	EVERY society faces the challenge of protecting innocent people from criminals who mercilessly prey on the vulnerable.    The duty of the police, courts and Government is nothing less than to fight the forces of evil. Thieves and rapists who terrify victims forfeit their right to freedom and should be kept behind bars. It is deeply worrying that the number of criminals before courts in England and Wales is at an all-time low.
AUG16	It’s time to bring home brave Robert Nairac, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	ON MAY 14, 1977, a fearsomely brave captain in the Grenadier Guards called Robert Nairac was trying to infiltrate the Provisional IRA in a bar in South Armagh, then known as Bandit Country. He was unmasked, captured and driven south of the border into Ravensdale Woods. There, he was hideously tortured for two days then murdered.    His body was never revealed, never discovered... until maybe now. There were enquiries, searches. After the Good Friday peace it was hoped the IRA might divulge where he lies but they remain vicious to the end. While our Ulster veterans are still being hounded in one of the most shameful episodes of our long history, one of the men suspected of torturing and killing Nairac as others watched is still alive and going unpunished in the USA. 
AUG16	My greatest regret is not getting pregnant by a rich rock god, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	I HAVE one major regret. When I was a cute twentysomething I totally failed to get myself knocked up by a septuagenarian rock god, thus setting myself up for life.    Mick Jagger's latest baby mama has a $5million Manhattan townhouse; it would be worth putting up with the ageing rocker on a part-time basis for that. Nor is she alone in her good fortune, although she never actually married the old goat, for a new report has just said that tying the knot multiple times is better for women than for men. I bet it is.

AUG17	High time for new Great Reform Act to control our MPs, says PATRICK  O’FLYNN	TWO hundred years ago there took place at St Peter's Field, in Manchester one of the most brutal acts of repression ever carried out by the British state on home soil. A vast assembly had gathered to protest about their lack of a political voice, principally due to draconian restrictions on suffrage that left the common people unable to vote.    On seeing the size of the demonstration, magistrates panicked and sent in first the local yeomanry and then the cavalry who charged with sabres drawn, killing 18 people and injuring many hundreds more. The events of August 16, 1819, were soon being referred to as The Peterloo Massacre in caustic reference to the British triumph at Waterloo just four years earlier. Yesterday all kinds of Leftish organisations, from the Green Party to the TUC, marked the bicentenary by putting out worthy words of solidarity on social media. But a bitter irony could be noted. In many cases these organisations were the very ones that form the core of the establishment campaign to thwart implementation of the biggest vote for anything in the history of our nation, the vote to leave the European Union.

AUG18	Euro leaders need to do a deal with Britain - EXPRESS COMMENT	BORIS JOHNSON is right to go to France and Germany with his message that the UK is leaving the European Union come what may on October 31.    EU leaders who are pinning their hopes on our Parliament derailing his plans will see how serious he is when they look in his eyes. Mr Johnson knows that the Conservative Party faces electoral catastrophe if Britain does not leave the EU before the next election - a political event which could be imminent. If he fails to deliver Brexit he will be ousted from Downing Street. His place in the history books hinges on him finally cutting the cord with Brussels.

I know we were showered with assurances that all was tickety-boo chez Jones.    Yet we struggled to believe that they would live happily ever after. As a Strictly veteran, I’ve tried my best to describe the extraordinary hothouse atmosphere of the show. For the first time in their lives, celebrities are confined for up to 10 hours a day with a gorgeous, lithe and athletic dancer whose job it is to make them feel heard, supported and appreciated while gyrating gracefully against sensitive bits of their anatomy. 
AUG19	Boris has won – and Remainers are becoming ever more desperate, says LEO MCKINSTRY	AS the hour of Brexit approaches, the diehard Remainers are becoming ever more desperate. For more than three years, they have plotted to thwart the 2016 referendum result by court actions, scare-mongering propaganda and Parliamentary manoeuvres. But all their cynical schemes have come to nothing. Britain is now firmly on course to leave the European Union at the end of October.    Given its profoundly undemocratic basis, the Remain cause was always going to struggle. But it has been hit recently by two additional factors. First, the widely predicted backlash against Brexit has never materialised. Contrary to the Remainers' hopes, there has been little growth in support for a second referendum or the abandonment of our departure. The real public disillusion has been targeted at the politicians who, through endless prevarication and posturing, have miserably failed to carry out the clear 2016 mandate.

Those words can certainly be applied to public health campaigners, who seek to create permanent hysteria and guilt over our lifestyles.

But it didn’t take long to work out that this review is most unlikely to result in Boris Johnson and his Transport Secretary Grant Shapps pulling the plug on the whole shebang. For a start, it is going to be chaired by Douglas Oakervee, a highly-respected civil engineer who just happens to be the ­former chairman of HS2 Ltd.

For the first time in their lives, celebrities are confined for up to 10 hours a day with a gorgeous, lithe and athletic dancer whose job it is to make them feel heard, supported and appreciated while gyrating gracefully against sensitive bits of their anatomy. 
AUG23	It’s time we heard from Prince Andrew, say RICHARD AND JUDY	R - THE walls are beginning to close in on Prince Andrew over his long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.    In a nutshell, Andrew finds himself increasingly tarnished with so-called guilt by association. He needs to explain his relationship with the dead paedophile before others do the explaining for him. While he insists he is totally innocent of any wrong-doing and is ‘appalled’ by the allegations against his former friend, every day seems to bring fresh twists in the tale. 
AUG23	Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are nothing but divas, as William shows, says CAROLE MALONE	IF the rumours are true and Wills and Harry aren’t on good terms, then his and Kate’s £73 Flybe flights from Norwich to Aberdeen won’t have helped heal the rift.    Because the sight of them and their three kids happily strolling across the tarmac with all the other members of the public made Harry and Meghan look even more precious and spoiled than they already do. It also makes a nonsense of the preposterous claim by actress, Jameela Jamil, who says Harry and Meghan absolutely have to travel by private plane because of possible assassination and kidnap attempts. And it’s this kind of ludicrous comment by Meghan’s interfering celebrity friends that is damaging them even more than they are damaging themselves. Because if our future King and his entire family can fly commercial, then the 6th in line to the throne can too, which might well be the message Wills was sending his brother?
AUG23	Sickening treatment of war heroes has to stop - EXPRESS COMMENT	FORCING almost a million Armed Forces veterans to pay to watch TV because of the BBC's decision to scrap the free licence for over-75s is truly sickening.    If there is one group of people who have served their country, put their lives on the line for our freedoms and are owed a debt of gratitude by this country, it is the people who served in the Armed Forces. It is believed that more than 100,000 of these distinguished citizens are in their 90s. The idea that these people should now be taxed to fund the millionaire lifestyles of BBC presenters such as Gary Lineker is a national disgrace.
AUG23	Brexit bashers are cowards determined to see UK crumble at EU hands,says FREDERICK FORSYTH	THERE is something very weird going on in this country and it all revolves around two short words – No Deal. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG23	HS2 can cause boom for the North but Boris must adopt bold new plan, says PATRICK O'FLYNN	AS A longstanding opponent of the HS2 scheme to whizz business executives down to London from the north of England fractionally quicker than is possible at present, I was cheered by the announcement this week of an independent review into the £100billion project.    But it didn’t take long to work out that this review is most unlikely to result in Boris Johnson and his Transport Secretary Grant Shapps pulling the plug on the whole shebang. For a start, it is going to be chaired by Douglas Oakervee, a highly-respected civil engineer who just happens to be the ­former chairman of HS2 Ltd. For Mr Oakervee to conclude that HS2 is not worth pursuing would be tantamount to asking someone to accept that the cause he spent years of his life promoting passionately was a load of old baloney.
AUG23	Carrie Symonds will come a cropper sooner rather than later, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	So a big hello, then, to Carrie Symonds, the official First Girlfriend and she who has brought Boris to heel. She’s been around for ages, of course, and has appeared in this space before now, but matters have taken a delightful new turn with the news that her past foreign travel had banned her from getting a Stateside visa.

AUG23	EU hothead Macron should take leaf out of Merkel’s book on Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	GERMANY’S Chancellor Angela Merkel put it succinctly - there are 30 days for the EU to make a deal with Britain.    As the EU’s chief negotiator was so fond of saying, the clock is ticking. But the countdown is now entirely for the EU and the intransigent federalist idealogues in Brussels. Now we have a Prime Minister determined to fulfil the wishes of the British people and ensure we leave this undemocratic bloc on 31 October it has put the onus on the EU.
AUG23	Stop the finger wagging - our children have never been healthier, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE great Irish author CS Lewis once wrote that “of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.    It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies”. Those words can certainly be applied to public health campaigners, who seek to create permanent hysteria and guilt over our lifestyles. With puritan relish, they issue endless, finger-wagging demands for new taxes, crackdowns, restrictions and awareness programmes. Typical is the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies, who once described herself as the nation’s “chief nanny”.
AUG23	The EU is Brexit Britain's past and not its future - EXPRESS COMMENT	PULLING out of almost all the European Union meetings scheduled for next month is a very welcome development from the Government. This is more than a symbolic move by Boris Johnson. It's a visible sign that the EU and membership of the bloc represents Britain's past and not its future. This is a modal window.

AUG23	Broken Britain: We must return sense of respects to our society, writes TIM NEWARK	SOMETHING is wrong in our society when daily assaults on unarmed policemen are on the rise across Britain. More than 10,000 officers were injured in attacks last year.    That's an average of 27 a day, and that appalling statistic is up by a third over the past four years. Tragically, a PC like Andrew Harper will be killed in the line of duty simply for investigating a burglary. Only recently PC Stuart Outten was stabbed in the head with a machete as he stopped a van in East London. Fortunately he defended himself with a Taser stun gun and heroically managed to protect a female colleague. It's no wonder that yesterday it was reported in the Daily Express that Chief Constable Nick Adderley wants to see all his officers armed with Tasers.
AUG24	Can Royal Family recover from this perfect storm? asks CHRISTOPHER WILSON	WHAT’S going wrong with the monarchy? The rock-solid institution at the centre of British life is suddenly looking unsteady and feeble, not a day passing without a headline or embarrassing leak weakening their hold on our affections.    Top of the list is the scandal surrounding Prince Andrew and his association with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Following close behind is the social media war stoked up by friends and foes of jetsetting Harry and Meghan over their holier-than-thou stance on global warming. William and Kate haven’t escaped – their budget-jet flight to Balmoral last week was looking pretty good until it was discovered that Flybe, apparently wanting its logo to be photographed, had replaced the usual plane with another diverted 123 miles from the North East. It also meant the original plane left empty. 
AUG24	Justice has gone way off the rails, says NICK FERRARI	SENTENCING of juveniles in this country is a joke. If you’ve ever been in doubt whether the law is an ass, look at these two cases and you’ll see it’s the biggest and dumbest donkey in the paddock.    From the fatal stabbing of a teenager to the mindless vandalism and destruction of a model railway exhibition that represented the lifetime’s work of many collectors, when the guilty parties actually faced justice, the sentences were little more than a slap on the wrist. They faced the law – and the law ran. Schoolboy Yousef Makki, 17, had won a scholarship to the £12,000-a-year Manchester Grammar School and his parents have said he wanted to become a surgeon. However, it seems fair to suggest he might have strayed somewhat as, at the trial of the teenager accused of his murder, the court heard how Makki, his attacker and another teenager carrying a knife acted out “idiotic fantasies” pretending they were middle-class gangsters. 
AUG24	Brexit Britain will become global leader in trade liberalisation, says LIZ TRUSS	THIS week has been a fantastic week for Britain and for British businesses.

AUG24	Inside Politics: Caretaker? Jeremy Corbyn could barely take care of an allotment	LIKE a gathering of super-villains from the pages of a Batman comic, a summit of the arch-enemies of Brexit will be convened by Jeremy Corbyn in Westminster next week.    Newly-elected Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, former Tory rebel Anna Soubry, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Ian Blackford, leader of the Scottish National Party in the Commons, have all confirmed their attendance. The hard-Left Labour leader only needs the Joker, the Penguin and Catwoman to turn up to complete the full Gotham City horror set. Corbyn's fledgling Remain alliance musters next Tuesday to plot how to wreck Brexit by toppling Boris Johnson through a Commons motion of no-confidence as soon as Parliament returns from its summer break at the beginning of next month. Yet already, the saboteurs' summit is shaping up to be a feeble affair. Several senior pro-Brussels MPs including the former Tory ministers Dame Caroline Spelman and Nick Boles, who now sits as an Independent Conservative, have sent their regrets.

AUG24	Schools can learn from strict head's return to basics, says STEPHEN POLLARD	THE word hero is bandied about far too easily. But someone of whom you've probably never heard who is a true hero is Katharine Birbalsingh.    Ms Birbalsingh is the founding head teacher of Michaela community school which was set up, after many battles and amid much opposition, in a converted office block close to London's Wembley stadium in September 2014. Michaela and its founder are controversial because its ethos is based on traditional education methods: strict discipline, pedagogical teaching where a teacher imparts knowledge to children and learning by rote. To the education establishment these are all something close to evil. From the moment Ms Birbalsingh first emerged as a public figure, she has been attacked for her views, often viciously. When she began the process of setting up Michaela, the education establishment did all it could to stop her.

AUG25	Special relationship is about more than just trade, EXPRESS COMMENT	THE special relationship between the UK and USA has been the most important alliance in history for the benefit of humanity.    This in no way overstates the case. Let us look at our achievements together. The transatlantic partnership pioneered and promoted modern democracy and the rule of law, it defeated the great tyrannies of Nazism and Communism, it opened trade borders and has been a guarantor of peace and prosperity, and it put the rights of the individual at the heart of public policy and politics. So the prospect of an initial trade agreement being signed next month followed by a full-scale deal is not just about economics and business, it is something that can reshape international relations.

AUG26	Ben Stokes’s success in Ashes gives us a lesson about life, says STEPHEN POLLARD	What a difference a year makes. Last August, Ben Stokes had just been found not guilty of assault. It was the end of a 12-month ordeal for the England cricketer, which at one point looked like ending his international career. Today, he is a national hero.    Winning the World Cup with a stellar innings would be enough for most cricketers. Not Stokes.For, on Sunday he gave one of the greatest sporting performances of all time in nearly single-handedly winning the Third Test at Headingley and keeping England’s Ashes hopes alive. But this is not a column about sport. Stokes’s claim to sporting immortality is, of course, based on his astonishing talent and success.
AUG26	The family that plays together, stays together, says VANESSA FELTZ	TALK about a storm in a teacup or turning an empty nest into a hornets’ nest – never has a huge survey involving 55,000 Germans caused such a rumpus.

Cue every voluble female the media could muster in August – when most have fled to villas in Tuscany – dashing into print and day – time telly to argue the toss. Naturally, we heard from the “I haven’t had children and I’m perfectly happy at all times” brigade. These were emphatic. Children are a drag, worry and expense and no one who has made the glaring mistake of giving birth will manage to enjoy tranquillity ever again. Equally trenchant were those agreeing with the survey.

Not the “Ladies” and the “Gents” of British loo-going tradition but achingly right-on, single sex, non-binary lavs.    And here's what happened. As I walked in, a load of women who were busy doing their make-up turned round simultaneously and fixed me with the kind of disgusted, accusatory glare I assume they would normally reserve for a known sex-offender. I found myself apologising and limping off to a cubicle (not a urinal obviously) the seat of which – like ALL toilet seats in male lavatories ladies – was covered in somebody else's urine.

AUG26	Scrapping Thames boats is health and safety lunacy, says TIM NEWARK	THEY were tough enough to survive Dunkirk, but Thames pleasure boats – some nearly 100 years old – now face the scrap heap because of over-zealous health and safety rules.    Thousands of summer Bank Holiday tourists have enjoyed the 150-year-old route from Westminster to Hampton Court and beyond, plying through the waves from the heart of London to the Upper Thames countryside. People have flocked to the river for fun ever since the first bank holidays were introduced in 1871. But now many of those venerable “little ships” may be scrapped thanks to new rules. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency proposes improvements that will cost up to £500,000 to implement on each vessel, forcing at least 20 of the oldest vessels to stop operating. The owners simply cannot afford changes that mean virtually rebuilding their craft. Historic saloon bars will have to be ripped out, picture windows closed and extra safety walls known as bulkheads inserted into antique cabins. Bulkheads create watertight compartments in case the hull is breached, but these passenger ships have survived very well without them for almost a century.

AUG28	Meghan Markle and Prince Harry want privacy? Let them have it, writes ANNE WIDDECOMBE	WHEN I said that I thought Meghan Markle could spell trouble for the Royals, I suffered bucketloads of abuse but I was only too right. Once a spoiled Hollywood celebrity, always a spoiled Hollywood celebrity. However, there is no need for all the angst. If the Sussexes want privacy then that is fair enough, with Harry so far down the line of succession. So let us give them all the privacy in the world and simply ignore them.
AUG28	Children must be taught respect for the police - EXPRESS COMMENT	IT is truly shocking to see that assaults on police officers last year totalled more than 1,000 for just one force alone.    The increase in these attacks by 16 percent in Sussex which include officers being punched, spat at, kicked, scratched and much more is wholly unacceptable and underlines that the problem is escalating. Deputy Chief Constable Jo Shiner, of Sussex Police, is right to say that this sort of unpredictable problem should not be part of a police officer's daily job. Former CID chief Kevin Moore is also absolutely correct to say that sentencing needs to be tougher for such crimes to act as a deterrent.

I referred to the transition period when, as Nigel Farage has pointed out, we would have no voice and no veto but still be subject to EU law, and also to defence and fishing regulations and to extended transition periods in some provisions.    I observed that all Boris Johnson was talking about was the backstop. So now I challenge the PM to make his intentions clear and unequivocal: will he accept the rest of the May deal and put it to Parliament if he gets the concession he is seeking on the backstop? 
AUG28	We need root and branch reform of the House of Lords, says TIM NEWARK	New Labour and the Lib-Dems have flooded the House of Lords with left-leaning peers and now it no longer accurately reflects British public opinion. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is right to reward prominent Brexit backers with peerages and re-balance the institution that has done everything to block Leave.    If the House of Commons is skewed against Brexit then the House of Lords is even more so. But it will take a lot of new peers to shake up this cosy club where most of the almost 800 sitting there are fully signed up members of the liberal elite determined to frustrate the result of the 2016 election. Abolishing most of the hereditary peers that made up the House of Lords for centuries was meant to make it more relevant but it simply swapped one privileged gang for another.
AUG28	Royal row: Is there a growing rivalry between Harry and William, writes VANESSA FELTZ	FULL marks have been awarded to Kate and Wills for boarding a budget flight to Scotland with their little ones. There's no question the Cambridges have done the right thing. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG28	Ben Stokes’s success in Ashes gives us a lesson about life, says STEPHEN POLLARD	What a difference a year makes. Last August, Ben Stokes had just been found not guilty of assault. It was the end of a 12-month ordeal for the England cricketer, which at one point looked like ending his international career. Today, he is a national hero.    Winning the World Cup with a stellar innings would be enough for most cricketers. Not Stokes.For, on Sunday he gave one of the greatest sporting performances of all time in nearly single-handedly winning the Third Test at Headingley and keeping England’s Ashes hopes alive. But this is not a column about sport. Stokes’s claim to sporting immortality is, of course, based on his astonishing talent and success.
AUG28	The family that plays together, stays together, says VANESSA FELTZ	TALK about a storm in a teacup or turning an empty nest into a hornets’ nest – never has a huge survey involving 55,000 Germans caused such a rumpus. Exhaustive research conducted by academics recently “proved” having children makes you happy – but only when they finally fly the coop.    Cue every voluble female the media could muster in August – when most have fled to villas in Tuscany – dashing into print and day – time telly to argue the toss. Naturally, we heard from the “I haven’t had children and I’m perfectly happy at all times” brigade. These were emphatic. Children are a drag, worry and expense and no one who has made the glaring mistake of giving birth will manage to enjoy tranquillity ever again. Equally trenchant were those agreeing with the survey.
AUG28	Having Ladies’ and Gents’ loos isn’t a hate crime – leave our lavs alone says PAUL BALDWIN	Sorry if this is TMI but I went for a wee recently at the ExCel Centre in London. Now this wouldn't normally qualify as news but the thing was they have cutting edge gender-neutral toilets there. Not the “Ladies” and the “Gents” of British loo-going tradition but achingly right-on, single sex, non-binary lavs.    And here's what happened. As I walked in, a load of women who were busy doing their make-up turned round simultaneously and fixed me with the kind of disgusted, accusatory glare I assume they would normally reserve for a known sex-offender. I found myself apologising and limping off to a cubicle (not a urinal obviously) the seat of which – like ALL toilet seats in male lavatories ladies – was covered in somebody else's urine.
AUG28	Boris has cornered the EU with Trump's help - get behind the PM, writes PATRICK O'FLYNN	LEAVE voters are often cautious about accepting at face value claims by the Conservative Party leadership that it is committed to delivering Brexit properly and on time. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG28	Scrapping Thames boats is health and safety lunacy, says TIM NEWARK	THEY were tough enough to survive Dunkirk, but Thames pleasure boats – some nearly 100 years old – now face the scrap heap because of over-zealous health and safety rules.    Thousands of summer Bank Holiday tourists have enjoyed the 150-year-old route from Westminster to Hampton Court and beyond, plying through the waves from the heart of London to the Upper Thames countryside. People have flocked to the river for fun ever since the first bank holidays were introduced in 1871. But now many of those venerable “little ships” may be scrapped thanks to new rules. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency proposes improvements that will cost up to £500,000 to implement on each vessel, forcing at least 20 of the oldest vessels to stop operating. The owners simply cannot afford changes that mean virtually rebuilding their craft. Historic saloon bars will have to be ripped out, picture windows closed and extra safety walls known as bulkheads inserted into antique cabins. Bulkheads create watertight compartments in case the hull is breached, but these passenger ships have survived very well without them for almost a century.
AUG29	Blue Mink must now be feeling the blues, says VIRGINIA BLACKBURN	LADIES and gentlemen, we have finally reached the moment when society has started to eat itself.    We have reached peak insanity, total idiocy, utter gormlessness. And the reason? A flower power anthem entitled Melting Pot and composed to eradicate racism has now been banned from the radio station Gold's playlist. And the reason? It promotes racism. Now it would be understandable if the song by Blue Mink had been banned on the grounds of it being sentimental drivel, although that would also take out just about every song from the flower power era, especially those dirges sung by whiny women in protest at things like the legitimate construction of inner city parking facilities in overcrowded areas.
AUG29	Remainer determination to halt Brexit has now been exposed, says STEPHEN POLLARD	YOU will struggle to find a more ridiculous sight than the massed ranks of Remainers lining up yesterday to denounce the decision of Boris Johnson to hold a Queen’s Speech on October 14. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG29	May the force be with Boris in fight with MPs undermining democracy - EXPRESS COMMENT	LET us be completely unequivocal. The Prime Minister’s decision to prorogue – suspend – Parliament is completely justifiable.    Boris Johnson has right on his side. And any decent Briton who loves this country and respects democracy should applaud his actions. The reason this has happened is because a Remainer Parliament coupled with a Marxist Labour Party has turned its back on democracy. The so-called attempts to stop “no deal”, such as this week’s Church House declaration, are about stopping Brexit and ignoring the greatest democratic event in British history. So it is a bit rich to see MPs such as Dominic Grieve whine that this is “a democratic outrage”.
AUG29	Remainers' tears over proroguing Parliament are all fake, says IAIN DUNCAN SMITH	THE howling of the Remainers in response to Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament, so he can have a Queen's Speech is all fake. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG29	Children must be taught respect for the police - EXPRESS COMMENT	IT is truly shocking to see that assaults on police officers last year totalled more than 1,000 for just one force alone.    The increase in these attacks by 16 percent in Sussex which include officers being punched, spat at, kicked, scratched and much more is wholly unacceptable and underlines that the problem is escalating. Deputy Chief Constable Jo Shiner, of Sussex Police, is right to say that this sort of unpredictable problem should not be part of a police officer's daily job. Former CID chief Kevin Moore is also absolutely correct to say that sentencing needs to be tougher for such crimes to act as a deterrent.
AUG29	Meghan Markle and Prince Harry want privacy? Let them have it, writes ANNE WIDDECOMBE	WHEN I said that I thought Meghan Markle could spell trouble for the Royals, I suffered bucketloads of abuse but I was only too right. Once a spoiled Hollywood celebrity, always a spoiled Hollywood celebrity. However, there is no need for all the angst. If the Sussexes want privacy then that is fair enough, with Harry so far down the line of succession. So let us give them all the privacy in the world and simply ignore them.
AUG29	Boris Johnson's fudge won’t sweeten Theresa May's deal, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	I make no apology for returning to the theme of this page last week when I pointed out that there was far more wrong with the Theresa May deal than just the backstop, however important that issue may be.

AUG30	Our country works very well with no written constitution, says LEO McKINSTRY	AFTER years of undemocratic resistance to Brexit, the Remainers are suddenly gripped by panic at the reality of a Government which is determined to enact the 2016 Referendum result.    That is why they descended into such frothing hysteria at Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament next month, thereby restricting their capacity for yet more plots and procrastination. Amid their frenzied desperation the anti-Brexit campaigners pretend that Britain now faces an unprecedented constitutional crisis. The air is thick with wild accusations that the Government has perpetrated a “coup”. Such claims are nonsense. The Prime Minister has done nothing illegal or unconstitutional.
AUG30	Off-piste Boris is ready to rock, say RICHARD AND JUDY	R - EVER sat on a train that’s been shunted into a siding? There you sit, immobile, glum, increasingly impotent and impatient.    From time to time a passenger announcement speaks confidently of imminent departure. But you don’t move. You start to go crazy with boredom and frustration. Britain’s been like that over the last three years, hasn’t it? Stuck on a Brexit train to nowhere. Driver May kept coming over the public address, robotically promising we’d be back on track in a jiffy, until she was finally prised out of the cab and replaced by Driver Johnson. 
AUG30	Butt out Mr Major you’ve had your day and it wasn’t entirely glorious, says PAUL BALDWIN	PADDY ASHDOWN once called him “a decent and honourable man” and, had he just kept his trap shut, Sir John Major could have seen out his political days as exactly that.    We would have nodded to the quiet yet huge part he played in the Good Friday Agreement helping bring the Troubles in Northern Ireland to a peaceful conclusion, we might have gently mocked his endearingly middle-class M&S grey suits, love of cricket and mild-mannered approach to politics, while perhaps wishing there was a little more of that around Westminster. History might have quietly put to bed the way his seven years at the helm of the Tory Party left the Conservatives in ruins, with two of their number in prison or heading there, others embroiled in corruption probes and sex scandals and the door to No 10 left wide open for Tony Blair.
AUG30	Coup are you trying to kid, you numpties, says CAROLE MALONE	IF you’d listened to some of our hysterical politicians this week you could be forgiven for thinking they were fighting for survival from a bunker somewhere in downtown Caracas.    Sounding like recruits from Citizen Smith’s guerrilla army, they could be heard squealing : “It’s a coup. It’s a dictatorship. It’s a revolution.” John McDonnell ludicrously likened Boris to Hitler. Nicola Sturgeon –who still refuses to accept the result of the Scots Independence Referendum – called him a “tinpot dictator.” The ridiculous Hugh Grant raged: “**** you, you over promoted rubber bath toy.” Writer Sir Phillip Pullman hinted the PM should be hanged and MP Kate Osamor suggested abolishing the monarchy. 
AUG30	Disturbing HRT findings must be taken seriously - EXPRESS COMMENT	WHILE it is not yet proven, we should still take the study that suggests 3,000 breast cancer cases a year are caused by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for women as a serious alarm call.    It is clear that more investigations are needed in this treatment to ensure thousands of women's lives are not put at risk. HRT has been an important treatment in helping women deal with menopause and improving their quality of life, so it would be unwise to stop providing it on the back of one study. However, we have to take seriously this evidence that the increased breast cancer risk it causes to women is twice as high as previously thought.
AUG30	Nothing beats glory of a British summer, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	IF there is any experience that may be termed a modern misery it is surely going through an airport.    From kerbside to check-in desk it is mere struggle – suitcases, wheelies, wobbly trolley, sweaty queue. Then present your passport and e-issued boarding pass. Take both back from beaming check-in staffer and proceed into the gaping jaws of the god security.
AUG30	It is flying in the face of democracy to thwart Brexit, says ROSS CLARK	WHAT is the greatest threat to our democracy: that the Government prorogues Parliament for a slightly longer period than is normal at this time of year, at a time when MPs were due to go off for their party conferences anyway? This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

AUG31	Election could see off the Remainer fanatics - EXPRESS COMMENT	WHEN the history books are finally written on the past three years of British politics, the question will be asked about why a group of fanatics in Parliament were allowed to do so much to damage democracy in this country.    This comment does not refer to Boris Johnson’s government, because the Prime Minister’s attempts to fulfil the result of the 2016 EU referendum and leave the EU are both brave and admirable. His decision to prorogue Parliament to allow the Government to bring forward a legislative programme is not an assault on democracy – it is part of the democratic process. However, what we have seen in Parliament – and in other areas of public life – is a Remainer elite pouring contempt on the British people and doing all it can to stop Brexit. 
AUG31	Heroic act will stop the Remainers’ plot, says NICK FERRARI	AS THE absurd level of fear and panic engendered by Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s bravery in taking a decisive stance to deliver something this country voted for what feels like a lifetime ago is ramped up to unprecedented proportions, it seems time to share an adage I’ve followed for many years and which seems to have always served me pretty well. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
AUG31	Stop this gull public health menace, says TIM NEWARK	CITIES and towns across the UK are being trashed by hordes of invading seagulls.    From Bath and Cheltenham to Manchester and Hull, historic urban centres miles from any coast are disfigured by a storm of bird mess, their streets littered with ripped garbage bags as gulls scavenge for food and residents kept awake by the incessant screaming of these flying vermin. Urban gull colonies have doubled in recent years from 239 to 473. They say a journalist should never become the story but I’ve had no choice as my family have to keep their bedroom windows closed on the hottest nights of the year and daren’t venture out into our garden because of swooping gulls and their faeces splattered everywhere.
AUG31	Inside Politics: Is this High Noon for Mr Speaker?	JOHN BERCOW is facing his last stand as the battle lines are drawn for the climax of the parliamentary struggle over Brexit next week. The Commons Speaker famously postponed his promised retirement last year claiming his experience was needed through the "momentous" debates about the UK's departure from the EU.    Should his bid to wreck Boris Johnson's Brexit plans be defeated, his Speakership will have little purpose left. When MPs return to Westminster on Tuesday, a series of procedural attempts will be made to overturn the Prime Minister's decision to lengthen the annual parliamentary recess for the party conference season by six days. From his sunbed on holiday in Turkey, Mr Bercow has already signalled his intention to do everything in his power to help the "Remain Alliance" of MPs' bid to thwart Downing Street.
AUG31	Top of the class investment for long overdue schools boost - EXPRESS COMMENT	AT LAST some big thinking on the subject of education. The Prime Minister's announcement that schools will receive an extra £14billion over the next three years could not be more welcome.    This money is long overdue and until now our children's education has been something of a lottery, depending on where the parents live and what resources are available. Not so long ago, the British education system was the envy of the world and it is high time we made it so once again. And with Brexit looming and the growing importance of Far Eastern economies, it is imperative that we give our children an outstanding education.
AUG31	Our country works very well with no written constitution, says LEO McKINSTRY	AFTER years of undemocratic resistance to Brexit, the Remainers are suddenly gripped by panic at the reality of a Government which is determined to enact the 2016 Referendum result.

SEP1	Pensioners' loneliness could teach youth how to survive tragedy, says CONSTANCE KNOX	LONELINESS among the elderly in the UK is at an all-time high. Shockingly, 49 per cent of older people say that television or their pets are their main form of company, according to Age UK figures.    But this should not really come as much of a surprise, as many are put into care homes, often left unvisited, or a majority live alone with little help. This seems even more shameful when you look at how other societies are treating their “old”. In China, an Elderly Rights Law was introduced to tell adult children they must never neglect elderly people and that they must make arrangements to visit them often.

SEP2	When will Meghan Markle’s father Thomas button his lip says VANESSA FELTZ	When will Thomas Markle learn to button his lip? Good Lord, the first lesson for all parents of adult children is to put up and shut up.    Shoot your mouth off or offer honest feedback: each way you run the risk of a fate worse than death – being exiled from the company of the people you love most in the world. Meghan’s dad, above, can’t resist making an already excruciating situation worse. He fuels his family discord by embarrassing his daughter and son-in-law in public. 
SEP2	EU chief’s stance makes no-deal exit more likely - EXPRESS COMMENT	AT the start of what will be a defining week for our country, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, has set the tone – and it’s depressingly negative.    The EU won’t budge. It’s Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement or nothing at all. And yet both German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron have told Prime Minister Boris Johnson they are open to further negotiations and will listen to suggestions for avoiding the dreaded Irish backstop. With intractable men like Barnier in charge it makes us ever more keen to free ourselves from the EU’s shackles.

SEP2	Stop this gull public health menace, says TIM NEWARK	CITIES and towns across the UK are being trashed by hordes of invading seagulls.    From Bath and Cheltenham to Manchester and Hull, historic urban centres miles from any coast are disfigured by a storm of bird mess, their streets littered with ripped garbage bags as gulls scavenge for food and residents kept awake by the incessant screaming of these flying vermin. Urban gull colonies have doubled in recent years from 239 to 473. They say a journalist should never become the story but I’ve had no choice as my family have to keep their bedroom windows closed on the hottest nights of the year and daren’t venture out into our garden because of swooping gulls and their faeces splattered everywhere.
SEP2	Inside Politics: Is this High Noon for Mr Speaker?	JOHN BERCOW is facing his last stand as the battle lines are drawn for the climax of the parliamentary struggle over Brexit next week. The Commons Speaker famously postponed his promised retirement last year claiming his experience was needed through the "momentous" debates about the UK's departure from the EU.    Should his bid to wreck Boris Johnson's Brexit plans be defeated, his Speakership will have little purpose left. When MPs return to Westminster on Tuesday, a series of procedural attempts will be made to overturn the Prime Minister's decision to lengthen the annual parliamentary recess for the party conference season by six days. From his sunbed on holiday in Turkey, Mr Bercow has already signalled his intention to do everything in his power to help the "Remain Alliance" of MPs' bid to thwart Downing Street.
SEP2	Top of the class investment for long overdue schools boost - EXPRESS COMMENT	AT LAST some big thinking on the subject of education. The Prime Minister's announcement that schools will receive an extra £14billion over the next three years could not be more welcome.    This money is long overdue and until now our children's education has been something of a lottery, depending on where the parents live and what resources are available. Not so long ago, the British education system was the envy of the world and it is high time we made it so once again. And with Brexit looming and the growing importance of Far Eastern economies, it is imperative that we give our children an outstanding education.
SEP2	Our country works very well with no written constitution, says LEO McKINSTRY	AFTER years of undemocratic resistance to Brexit, the Remainers are suddenly gripped by panic at the reality of a Government which is determined to enact the 2016 Referendum result.    That is why they descended into such frothing hysteria at Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament next month, thereby restricting their capacity for yet more plots and procrastination. Amid their frenzied desperation the anti-Brexit campaigners pretend that Britain now faces an unprecedented constitutional crisis. The air is thick with wild accusations that the Government has perpetrated a “coup”. Such claims are nonsense. The Prime Minister has done nothing illegal or unconstitutional.
SEP3	I used to admire John Major and Ken Clarke, now I watch with dismay, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	What with people taking to the streets and Parliament prepared to strip a government of its powers, the Brexit debate is beginning to resemble an unarmed civil war and civil war pits neighbour against neighbour, friend against friend and even divides families.

SEP3	The communist Jeremy Corbyn would destroy the UK, says TIM NEWARK	The biggest theft of private property since the Russian Revolution is being planned by the Labour Party if they ever get into power. The great Labour government heist would compel private companies to redistribute £300 billion of shares to workers while landlords would be forced to offload their properties to tenants below the market value.    That means our nest-eggs would be open to being pillaged by Marxists as soon as Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell walk into Downing Street.  Ruinously low interest rates over the last decade have meant that many of us have had to shift their life-time savings into buying rental property. But now under a “right to buy” scheme proposed by shadow chancellor McDonnell, he wants to change the law to force landlords to sell their property at a “reasonable price” that could be below its actual value, causing modest property owners to be cheated out of thousands of pounds from their investments.

And yet both German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron have told Prime Minister Boris Johnson they are open to further negotiations and will listen to suggestions for avoiding the dreaded Irish backstop. With intractable men like Barnier in charge it makes us ever more keen to free ourselves from the EU’s shackles.

SEP11	BA’s £150k-a-year pilots are ruining lives of Britain’s hard workers, says TIM NEWARK	It’s a funny old world when workers receiving a pay packet of over £150,000 go on strike for more money. On top of that, having been offered an inflation-busting pay rise of 11½ percent over three years, British Airways (BA) pilots say that is still not enough money.    In the meantime, most people earning much less than that are having their holidays ruined or cancelled because of rich people wanting even more money. Highly trained people deserve a decent sum of money to reflect their expertise and when I hit turbulence at 35,000 feet I want the reassuring voice of an experienced captain to calm me down—along with a large glass of wine—but the basic salary of long-haul captains is already £167,000 and isn’t much of it done on auto-pilot these days? Most accidents are caused by pilot error, not plane error.
SEP11	Here’s why Gibraltar is a shining example for Brexit Britain, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	I am in Gibraltar, which is part of my constituency, for National Day and following a series of briefings on Brexit preparations, am more than impressed with the can-do attitude here. Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU but has spent the last three years making darn sure that it is nevertheless ready to leave and without a deal if necessary.    It does not moan and whimper but simply finds solutions. Obviously relations with Spain can be bad enough at any time, depending on the political weather, but arrangements for Brexit have been bedevilled by the uncertain relationship between the two countries. Gibraltar sends its waste to be disposed of in Spain to a facility shared by several regions, but among which only Gibraltar pays for the service.

SEP11	An election can cure Britain’s political ills - EXPRESS COMMENT	BORIS JOHNSON is a well known classicist versed in the history, legend and literature of the Ancient Greeks and Romans.    So he may well have a phrase coined by the Ancient Greek doctor Hippocrates in mind as he approaches the endgame in the Brexit process – “desperate times require desperate measures” or, more accurately, “for extreme diseases, extreme methods of cure are most suitable.” There is no doubt that the body politic in Britain is suffering from a potentially fatal ailment. It is infected by an anti-democratic virus leaving a Remainer Parliament unable to accept the will of the British people to leave the EU. 
SEP11	Don’t write off PM Boris yet…he’s the greatest showman, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE PRIME Minister has just endured a week from hell.    Amid scenes of high drama at Westminster, he managed to lose his Parliamentary majority, his control of the Commons agenda – and his brother Jo from his Government. As MPs backed yet another delay on Brexit, the hopes of imminent British independence from EU rule now look increasingly bleak, despite Boris Johnson’s “do or die” pledge to take us out by the end of October. Many critics put the blame for the deepening crisis on his heavy-handed approach to party management. Conceived by his maverick adviser Dominic Cummings, Downing Street’s tactics have included the controversial prorogation of Parliament and the expulsion of 21 anti-No Deal Tory MPs – including distinguished figures such as Kenneth Clarke and Philip Hammond.

SEP18	Why do some on the left attack our tolerant way of life so much? Asks Paul Baldwin	FASCIST is not a word you throw around lightly in Germany, even now. And yet when EU president elect Ursula von der Leyen had the temerity to appoint a 'Vice-President for protecting our European way of life' that is exactly what she was labelled.    Even by the increasingly jack-booted, idiotic measures of the modern left it was some insult. But, insulting as it was, it was even more baffling. If the left truly finds modern Europe fascist then we can only conclude they really need to get out more. Here's what we know about western Europe – classical Europe, the Europe of Rome, Paris, Madrid, Berlin and of course London.
SEP18	How Cameron, living in Notting Hill, is utterly detached from reality, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	David Cameron tells us that he regrets holding a referendum on EU membership because it did not yield the result he wanted. So much for democracy. With the publication of his memoirs, both his character and his premiership are attracting close scrutiny but there has been little recognition of his major fault: he is probably the most precipitate mortal I’ve ever met.

SEP18	Jeremy Corbyn would turn Britain into a basket case like Zimbabwe, says TIM NEWARK	SHOCKINGLY, Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell has made it clear he will send accountants to jail simply for advising their clients on how they can legally avoid paying so much tax. They’re not breaking the law but he doesn’t like what they’re doing so that’s that.    On top of that he wants trade unions to settle 100 percent of workers’ wages –taking us way beyond the bad old days of 1970s collective bargaining. It’s the kind of totalitarian Marxism we’re only used to seeing in failed countries like Venezuela or Zimbabwe. We can’t say we haven’t been warned as McDonnell gleefully compares tax avoidance to burglary. “If you were advising someone how to burgle a house,” he says, “you wouldn’t be able to use professional privilege would you.” He wants the state to poke its nose into private conversations between clients and their financial advisers.
SEP18	Thank David Cameron - after all HE was the man who freed us from EU, says STEPHEN POLLARD	SEEING the reaction to David Cameron’s memoirs has been fascinating. Whatever else our former PM achieved in office – and the list is considerable – his legacy will always be dominated by the referendum.    For the chattering classes, this is a damning indictment of the man. And it explains why his book has been met with such relentless hostility. They can never forgive him for destroying British membership of the EU and allowing what they see as uncouth xenophobes to shatter our politics.
SEP18	Forget father figures – happy wife equals a happy life, says VANESSA FELTZ	Happy wife, happy life – might sound like a phrase embroidered on a T-shirt, but research based on the Millennium Cohort Study found over 14 years that if the mother of the household is happy in her relationship all earthly bliss enfolds the family.    A jolly mum means children without mental health problems, closeness with adolescents and a stable relationship with the father. Fascinatingly a dad’s happiness – or the lack thereof – has no bearing whatsoever on his offspring’s mental health.  Sir Paul Coleridge, the founder of the Marriage Foundation proclaims perkily: “Whether we like it or not, there is an ingredient for keeping the whole family happy which is only available from the mother or mother figure.” 
SEP18	David Cameron’s Project Fear was the real lie in the Brexit vote, says LEO McKINSTRY	In his long-anticipated memoirs, serialised over the weekend, David Cameron reveals that the Brexit vote in 2016 came as a hammer blow to his inner circle.Indeed, so great was the shock that his wife Samantha had to pour herself This is a modal window.

SEP18	MPs in dock for not delivering on EU poll - EXPRESS COMMENT	NEXT time Boris Johnson opens a debate on holding an early election, he should simply pick up Oliver Cromwell’s speech on April 20, 1653, when he closed the discredited Rump Parliament.    The ComRes poll we publish today ends any doubt that the vast majority of the nation would join him in echoing the Lord Protector’s stricture to Parliamentarians: “In the name of God, go! Ye are grown intolerably odious to the whole nation. You were deputed here by the people to get grievances redressed, are yourselves become the greatest grievance.” What a damning indictment of MPs that seven in 10 people think they do not reflect the views of the nation and more than that believe Parliament is an institution which puts political point-scoring above the interests of the nation.

SEP18	Remain’s farce is with you every single day, says NICK FERRARI	USUALLY, they ended with some hapless oaf – often Brian Rix – caught with his trousers around his ankles and exposed as a bumbling buffoon. Everyone would roar with laughter and the curtain came down.    That was a Whitehall farce of old, for theatrical audiences. Tragically we are all now living through our very own modern day Whitehall farce, and this one’s enough to make anyone weep. If those clueless, self-serving, self-obsessed schemers and chancers in Westminster had plotted to make themselves appear more removed from us, we who elect them and put them in their well paid and mostly unaccountable posts, they couldn’t have done a better job. 
SEP18	David Cameron can’t be solely blamed for the current mess, says KATE ANDREWS	It was the shot heard round the world. Not in 1775 or 1914, but rather in 2016, when then-prime minister David Cameron launched the second referendum campaign on the UK’s membership of the European Union. It set off a series of unpredictable events that continue to unfold on a daily basis.    Demands for explanations and cries of incompetence have been thrown Cameron’s way from Leavers and Remainers alike, expressing their disappointment that more preparation was not put into plans for an orderly exit, or deep frustration and agony for calling the referendum in the first place. He will this week give his account as his heavily-delayed memoir, For The Record, arrives. While Cameron will want to portray his legacy as encompassing his key domestic and foreign moments (including referendums won and lost), his critics have a narrower view. 
SEP27	Surrender row MPs must deliver a people's Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	MILLIONS of people feel revulsion and dismay when they look at MPs in the Commons screaming at one another.    The Prime Minister is right to say "tempers need to come down". There is no excuse for abuse or intimidation inside the chamber, on the street or on social media. Insults that would never be tolerated in a modern workplace have no place in Westminster. MPs should show that it is possible to disagree on a topic of great importance without treating your opponent like an enemy or a fool.
SEP27	Worst toxic offender in Commons is Labour’s inflammatory John McDonnell, says ROSS CLARK	The Supreme Court judgment on Tuesday was supposed to be a triumph for democracy, getting MPs back to work to debate Brexit and other burning issues of the day.

SEP27	Iran’s rabid Revolutionary Guards are the true Middle East danger, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	WHAT on earth is going on in the Middle East? You might respond, “Who cares?” But alas we all depend on that seething cauldron of hatred and instability. Almost every drop of oil and therm of gas we import comes from there.    Actually, we have a hundred years of free energy beneath our feet in shale oil but we cannot drill for it because this offends the luvvies. The USA, also endowed with shale gas, has turned herself from a massive importer to a net exporter of energy which is why she is prospering and we are not. We are told it was the Houthis of Yemen who destroyed half the Saudi oil reserves with pinpoint drone and missile attacks and sent our petrol prices towards outer space. So who the hell are the Houthis?
SEP27	How Labour Party has been overrun by dead-eyed communist fanatics, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	ONE of the few enigmas that exist in our society is the widespread belief that the Marxist-Leninism that now governs the former Labour Party is only a tad further Left than Clement Attlee or Hugh Gaitskell.    Just for the record, in its decades of power communism killed far more people than the rightly loathed Nazism. Hitler’s creed murdered 14 million innocents – six million Jews, five million Russian POWs, two million non-Jewish Poles and a million mixed others.

SEP27	Boris’ foes are cheering - but are quiet about what to do next, says MACER HALL	WEARING a diamond brooch shaped like a spider, the President of the Supreme Court has ensnared Boris Johnson in a tangled legal and political web that appears to render him helpless as his gloating anti-Brexit enemies advance.    Lady Hale, delivering the unanimous ruling of 11 senior justices, wrecked any hope of respite for the Prime Minister from the parliamentary warfare that has raged against his do-or-die bid to finally get the UK out of the EU. From the precincts of the Westminster court to the Labour conference in Brighton yesterday his foes were crowing about his misfortune. They were notably less clear about exactly what they will do with the extra parliamentary hours the legal case has won them.
SEP27	Labour really do want to take us back to the 70s, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	IN the latest manifestation of a return to the 1970s and the politics of envy, Labour talks about abolishing public schools. Don’t the idiots realise that the rich will send their offspring to be educated abroad, while those who scrimp and save to afford such education will employ tutors?    If he really wants equality, Jeremy Corbyn should bring back grammar schools which offer rich and poor alike the sort of education that people currently queue up to buy. 
SEP27	Triumphant Remainers – be ashamed politics has reached this low ebb, says PATRICK O’FLYNN	OF ALL the difficult days that have passed in our politics since that historic vote by the British people more than three years ago to leave the European Union, yesterday was perhaps the most traumatic for supporters of that great cause. When the United Kingdom failed to exit the EU on March 29 this year – despite departure being promised literally hundreds of times by the then prime minister – many of us Leave voters had seen it coming and were braced for the let-down.    Likewise, we have become accustomed to the spectacle of MPs elected overwhelmingly on promises to honour the referendum verdict breaking their word with alacrity.  We have even become inured to the repeated manipulation of parliamentary procedure by Remain-supporting Commons Speaker John Bercow in order to assist the Brexit-blocking antics of those so-called “honourable members”. But what we saw yesterday was a Prime Minister who is genuinely straining to deliver the referendum mandate – being ruthlessly boxed-in by political opponents who we now realise will do almost anything to deny the democratic outcome being implemented and have many weapons at their disposal.

OCT4	Inheritance tax cut by Tories would bury Labour says RICHARD AND JUDY	R - HMM. Sajid Javid’s speech to the Tory conference was a missed opportunity. Where was the vote-winning catnip? I couldn’t sniff any at all. Maybe he’s saving it for the party’s coming election manifesto.    Remember what happened back in 2007, when George Osborne told a delirious conference he would raise the inheritance tax threshold to a million pounds? The number of people saying they’d vote Tory at the next election went through the roof overnight. Gordon Brown was so spooked he shelved plans to call an early poll: a blanket of blue would have rolled out across the country’s constituencies. Ultimately Osborne bottled the decision. A pity. To be totally fair, Javid did nod to it at a fringe event. 
OCT4	Boris’ new Brexit deal means we truly take back control says SUELLA BRAVERMAN	THE United Kingdom remains imprisoned by the European Union, despite 17.4 million people voting to leave in 2016.    But now, under the leadership of Boris Johnson, we have a new proposal that means we take back control of our laws and our borders. It’s a proposal that means we can leave on October 31 without disruption. And it respects the result of the Referendum. I have long wanted to see the United Kingdom freed from the shackles of the EU, but the last deal simply did not deliver on that. It left us surrendered to the EU. Under the control of European law and the European court forever. It may have been Brexit in essence, but it lacked real substance.
OCT5	It's time Dublin got real on this deal, says Nick Ferrari	It was a typically boisterous, confident and humorous display – but make no mistake, when Boris Johnson repeatedly says he wants a deal but is ready to take this country out of the European Union in just 25 days without one if he has to, he is utterly prepared to do so.    Johnson has been the darling of Con-servative conferences down the years, with his tousled blond mop-top delighting the blue-rinse brigade of the Tory finest. Somehow the usually prim and proper matrons from the shires, and their sports jacket-wearing husbands, who would normally tut-tut and seek to admonish the sort of extra-curricular bedroom activities of which our Prime Minister stands accused, are happy to pull a veil (or should that be duvet?) over such alleged racy goings on. This was Johnson’s first conference as leader and down all the years I’ve been there and seen him attend when he’s been both in and out of favour and when he was the most powerful Tory in the land, in his role as London mayor.

OCT5	Boris’ new Brexit deal means we truly take back control says SUELLA BRAVERMAN	THE United Kingdom remains imprisoned by the European Union, despite 17.4 million people voting to leave in 2016.    But now, under the leadership of Boris Johnson, we have a new proposal that means we take back control of our laws and our borders. It’s a proposal that means we can leave on October 31 without disruption. And it respects the result of the Referendum. I have long wanted to see the United Kingdom freed from the shackles of the EU, but the last deal simply did not deliver on that. It left us surrendered to the EU. Under the control of European law and the European court forever. It may have been Brexit in essence, but it lacked real substance.
OCT6	EU must compromise or will count the cost - EXPRESS COMMENT	IN HIS excellent comment piece for this newspaper today, Boris Johnson says that his government has jumped on to the island in the middle of the river and invites the EU to make a similar leap of faith to join him there from its side.    The Prime Minister's characteristically colourful phraseology sums up the situation we find ourselves in. If a deal is to be done then difficult compromises have to be made. The Government under Mr Johnson laid out a wide-ranging and generous compromise to sort out the Northern Ireland backstop. To their credit, the Northern Ireland Democratic Unionists also compromised in accepting that they would have to agree to some all-Ireland regulations.
OCT6	Enough claptrap! It's time for Britain to find its nerve, says MARK WALLACE	IT’S the conventional thinking that Boris Johnson has made life far more difficult – perhaps even impossible – for himself in recent weeks by taking a hard-nosed approach to Brexit. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
OCT6	It's time Dublin got real on this deal, says Nick Ferrari	It was a typically boisterous, confident and humorous display – but make no mistake, when Boris Johnson repeatedly says he wants a deal but is ready to take this country out of the European Union in just 25 days without one if he has to, he is utterly prepared to do so.    Johnson has been the darling of Con-servative conferences down the years, with his tousled blond mop-top delighting the blue-rinse brigade of the Tory finest. Somehow the usually prim and proper matrons from the shires, and their sports jacket-wearing husbands, who would normally tut-tut and seek to admonish the sort of extra-curricular bedroom activities of which our Prime Minister stands accused, are happy to pull a veil (or should that be duvet?) over such alleged racy goings on. This was Johnson’s first conference as leader and down all the years I’ve been there and seen him attend when he’s been both in and out of favour and when he was the most powerful Tory in the land, in his role as London mayor.
OCT6	Harry’s strop over Meghan in the media won’t win him many fans, says CAROLE MALONE	IT’S hard to believe they could have got it so catastrophically wrong.

OCT6	Inheritance tax cut by Tories would bury Labour says RICHARD AND JUDY	R - HMM. Sajid Javid’s speech to the Tory conference was a missed opportunity. Where was the vote-winning catnip? I couldn’t sniff any at all. Maybe he’s saving it for the party’s coming election manifesto.    Remember what happened back in 2007, when George Osborne told a delirious conference he would raise the inheritance tax threshold to a million pounds? The number of people saying they’d vote Tory at the next election went through the roof overnight. Gordon Brown was so spooked he shelved plans to call an early poll: a blanket of blue would have rolled out across the country’s constituencies.

OCT7	EU is playing dangerous game of chicken, says SAM LISTER	BRUSSELS is playing a very dangerous game of chicken in the final days of the latest Brexit countdown. Previous deadlines came and went because EU leaders, rightly, banked on Theresa May opting for delay rather than no-deal. They are assuming this time round that Boris Johnson will be forced, albeit against his will, into doing the same by the "Surrender Act" that demands he asks for an extension.    That would open up the possibility of a general election that the EU believes could return a government that would hold another referendum or even just cancel Brexit altogether. While they have a slither of hope that Britain's departure will be abandoned, the Eurocrats and EU leaders that so fiercely object to a member leaving their club will refuse to make concessions. That is why the Prime Minister laid out in no uncertain terms in talks with French President Emmanuel Macron yesterday that he will take Britain out of the EU on October 31 come what may.
OCT7	The Irish blockade won’t stop Boris Johnson’s Brexit campaign, says LEO McKINSTRY	The Brexit wreckers are starting to gloat. They think that they have cornered Boris Johnson, fatally damaged his premiership and thwarted Britain’s imminent departure from the EU. Due to their ruthless control of Parliament, the Prime Minister may have little choice but to ask Brussels for yet another delay in Brexit if no withdrawal agreement is reached in the next few days – even though such a request would contradict his solemn pledge that Britain would be out by the end of October, “come what may”.

OCT9	Why state pension ruling against women was RIGHT, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	HOORAY for sanity in the High Court, where last week women lost their fight over the rises in state pension age.

OCT9	Slash inheritance tax to give workers a hand up, says TIM NEWARK	It cannot be right that working people, having diligently paid their taxes over a lifetime, then have that income taxed again when they die. It is one of the most natural impulses in the world to pass something on to your children to give them a little help. It is not up to the state to pick our pockets again on that hard-earned money.    The Conservatives know this is a strongly held sense of injustice and it was good to hear Chancellor Sajid Javid hint that a Boris Johnson-led government may well slash inheritance tax. "I shouldn’t say too much now,” he told an audience at their party conference, “but I understand the arguments against that tax. I do think that when people have paid taxes already, through work or through investments and capital gains and other taxes, there is a real issue with then asking them, on that income, to pay taxes all over again.” Shortly afterwards, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick backed this up by saying “It is a tax which is particularly unpopular because people can see the fundamental unfairness of paying tax twice.” Especially when they want to leave property to their children or grandchildren.

OCT9	Meghan Markle’s dad must start acting like a father, says VANESSA FELTZ	If we were in any lingering doubt, we now most definitely have the measure of Meghan’s dad. He has outed himself, fair and square. Following the avalanche of reaction to the news that the Sussexes are suing a brace of newspapers, Thomas Markle has taken a leap into the abyss with two flat feet.    It turns out that when Meghan’s chums revealed in US magazine People that the Duchess had written an anguished letter to him his indignation was boundless. “I was forced to defend myself,” said Mr Markle. All together now: “for pity’s sake, why?” Self-defence? Never was there a more pathetic excuse for ratting out your newly royal daughter. Good Lord, any loving parent knows you sacrifice your ego, your good name, your cash and your best Chinese rug for the sake of your children.

OCT11	BBC must clip its wings and stop wasting money so free TV licences stay, says TIM NEWARK	Over-75s must continue to receive their free TV licences said a select committee of MPs this week. Both the BBC and government must step in to secure free to view for older generations who depend increasingly on their TV for company. The new rule in which only those claiming pension credit will get free licences is “an absurd situation” said the House of Commons group.    A government spokesman backed them up saying “Taxpayers want to see the BBC using its substantial licence fee income in an appropriate way to ensure it delivers for UK audiences.” The BBC likes to see itself as a public service and yet when it comes to serving 3.7 million older citizens it steps to one side, wanting taxpayers to cough up yet more money. The BBC currently receives more than £3 billion a year from licence fee payers forking out £154.50 a year for a service many of them are not watching nearly as much as they used to. Much of that money goes on paying the bloated wages and pensions of senior TV executives and overpaid talent like football pundit Gary Lineker whose most recent contract was £1.75 million to banter with his soccer mates. He says he has volunteered to take a pay cut in his next contract and, to be honest, he’d probably do the job for nothing as his continued high profile ensures he can earn substantial sums elsewhere.
OCT11	I cry when hearing Harry Dunn’s parents, but is jail the answer? says CAROLE MALONE	It’s impossible to listen to Harry Dunn’s parents, Charlotte and Tim, talk about the loss of their son without being consumed by their pain. Without wanting to cry with them knowing that their lives are broken, possibly forever. Their beloved boy Harry was knocked off his motorbike and killed in a head-on crash outside an RAF base.    The car suspected of hitting him was on the wrong side of the road and allegedly being driven by American diplomat’s wife Anne Sacoolas. Mrs Sacoolas, who has diplomatic immunity, was interviewed by Northants police at the time but soon after fled the country and is now in America with her husband and three children. Obviously Tim and Charlotte want her back in Britain because they desperately need answers about how their son died.  They’ve pleaded with Mrs Sacoolas to return – not with vengeance or hate in their hearts – simply because they cannot properly grieve until their questions are answered.
OCT11	Beginning of the end on Brexit? Let's hope so - EXPRESS COMMENT	WHEN Britain and her allies turned the tide of the Second World War at El Alamein in North Africa, Churchill declared that it was not the end, not even the beginning of the end but possibly the end of the beginning.    Roll forward 77 years to very different circumstances but another intense European struggle and Churchill's words may have an echo following yesterday's talks between Boris Johnson and the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The extremely positive words emerging from those talks suggest that we are finally on the verge of cracking a Brexit deal and resolving the inscrutable issue of the Northern Ireland backstop. The question of what to do with the Irish/ Northern Irish border while respecting the Good Friday Agreement and the EU referendum result had until yesterday appeared to be more like one of those images by Escher where poor souls forever push a giant rock up steps.
OCT11	Brexit nightmare stemmed from Tories so it’s time to get serious, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	Well, the Tories can now return from Manchester and get on with what they are supposed to be doing – running the country. The patient faithful would be most grateful if they could try not to make so many mistakes. For it is a matter of history that the nightmare of the past three and a half years is not all down to the shambles of what used to be our Labour Party or the loopy-loo Lib-Dems.    The torrent of errors that have laid us low stemmed from the Tories. It began with David Cameron calling the referendum. Nothing wrong with that but what was foolish was for him to become the passionate leader of the Remain campaign. When he lost, he’d destroyed his own incumbency as prime minister. Then he quit so fast he left both party and country leaderless. The 1922 Committee, charged with finding a successor, dithered when urgency was of the essence. Half a dozen candidates appeared and then behaved like complete prats. Michael Gove knifed Boris Johnson and both withdrew. Andrea Leadsom blew herself away with a daft remark and without a vote we got the utter disaster of Theresa Ma
OCT11	Leo lectures UK on what we think – but he’s forgetting history, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	THE CLAIM by Irish premier Leo Varadkar that a majority of the British now wish to stay in the EU was particularly crass when one recalls the death of Irish democracy. In 2007 the Giscard d’Estaing-devised EU constitution was resoundingly rejected at referendum by the French and the Dutch. Brussels re-arranged its clauses and re-presented it as the Treaty of Lisbon.    All EU members were instructed to pass and ratify it into law without a referendum. But Ireland had a problem. Its constitution was clear – any transfer of sovereignty had to go to referendum. So Dublin held one and the Irish voted “No”. They were told to go back to the poll and try again – and this time get it right – meaning say “Yes”. So they did. Master Varadkar happily went along with it. So much for democracy in the land of St Patrick. Now he lectures us on what we think. 
OCT11	Don’t treat hungry commuters worse than criminals, says ROSS CLARK	Dame Sally Davies, the outgoing Chief Medical Officer, once complained bitterly about being called Britain    Yesterday, she called for a ban on eating on buses and commuter trains in order, she said, to fight obesity. Children need to grow up in environments in which snacking between meals is unacceptable, she argued. How bizarre. This is the same Sally Davies who in 2013 called on the Coalition to decriminalise some illegal drugs and told MPs that drug addiction should be treated as a medical issue rather than a criminal matter.

OCT12	You are being lied to – Varadkar and Barnier are giving us NOTHING, says Paul Baldwin	“Caw” said the crow. “Balls” said the Milligan.    Schoolboys (and perhaps girls) of a certain vintage will instantly recognise the line from Spike Milligan's absurdist novel Puckoon – a book riddled with madness, black comedy and more F-words than 10 minutes of Love Island, which it was mandatory to pass around at the back of the class in the late 1970s. The premise of Puckoon was, of course, the issue of the Irish border – a border at once random, vague and pointless yet so imbued with symbolism people were prepared to kill and die (perhaps in a ditch) for it. Sound familiar?
OCT12	Extinction Rebellion is risking public safety, says NICK FERRARI	HOW’S your week been? If you’re fortunate you will have been one of the more than fifty-six million people in this country who don’t live in London, so have hopefully enjoyed a normal and largely uneventful time.    However, to have lived in London is to have spent a week where you’ve witnessed the ultimate proof of how the police have descended from force to farce. It was another week when the Tristrams and the Tabithas deserted the shires and spent some of their trust fund cash to join the great unwashed, unloved and underemployed to indulge in the ludicrously selfish hissy fit that was the latest Extinction rebellion protest. What do they want? Action on climate change. How will they get it? 
OCT12	Ordinary voters back Boris and Brexit - EXPRESS COMMENT	THE poll in today's newspaper is a further endorsement of Boris Johnson and the strategy he is pursuing to resolve Brexit.    It shows the sound and fury of Tory rebel Remainers, Labour, SNP and the other ragtag friends of Brussels in Parliament is not influencing the British public. Ordinary voters have ignored their ludicrous claims against our Prime Minister, their barbs about his private life, calling him a racist, and, the biggest falsehood of all, that he is not serious about getting a deal. The ComRes poll puts the Conservatives five points ahead of Labour and would be enough for an election victory.
OCT12	Extinction Rebellion are hypocrite rebels without a cause, say RICHARD AND JUDY	RICHARD - It was the picture of the week. That snap of Extinction Rebellion protesters taking a break from saving the planet to queue docilely for their McDonald's. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
OCT12	BBC must clip its wings and stop wasting money so free TV licences stay, says TIM NEWARK	Over-75s must continue to receive their free TV licences said a select committee of MPs this week. Both the BBC and government must step in to secure free to view for older generations who depend increasingly on their TV for company. The new rule in which only those claiming pension credit will get free licences is “an absurd situation” said the House of Commons group.    A government spokesman backed them up saying “Taxpayers want to see the BBC using its substantial licence fee income in an appropriate way to ensure it delivers for UK audiences.” The BBC likes to see itself as a public service and yet when it comes to serving 3.7 million older citizens it steps to one side, wanting taxpayers to cough up yet more money. The BBC currently receives more than £3 billion a year from licence fee payers forking out £154.50 a year for a service many of them are not watching nearly as much as they used to. Much of that money goes on paying the bloated wages and pensions of senior TV executives and overpaid talent like football pundit Gary Lineker whose most recent contract was £1.75 million to banter with his soccer mates. He says he has volunteered to take a pay cut in his next contract and, to be honest, he’d probably do the job for nothing as his continued high profile ensures he can earn substantial sums elsewhere.
OCT12	I cry when hearing Harry Dunn’s parents, but is jail the answer? says CAROLE MALONE	It’s impossible to listen to Harry Dunn’s parents, Charlotte and Tim, talk about the loss of their son without being consumed by their pain. Without wanting to cry with them knowing that their lives are broken, possibly forever. Their beloved boy Harry was knocked off his motorbike and killed in a head-on crash outside an RAF base.    The car suspected of hitting him was on the wrong side of the road and allegedly being driven by American diplomat’s wife Anne Sacoolas. Mrs Sacoolas, who has diplomatic immunity, was interviewed by Northants police at the time but soon after fled the country and is now in America with her husband and three children. Obviously Tim and Charlotte want her back in Britain because they desperately need answers about how their son died.  They’ve pleaded with Mrs Sacoolas to return – not with vengeance or hate in their hearts – simply because they cannot properly grieve until their questions are answered.
OCT12	Beginning of the end on Brexit? Let's hope so - EXPRESS COMMENT	WHEN Britain and her allies turned the tide of the Second World War at El Alamein in North Africa, Churchill declared that it was not the end, not even the beginning of the end but possibly the end of the beginning.    Roll forward 77 years to very different circumstances but another intense European struggle and Churchill's words may have an echo following yesterday's talks between Boris Johnson and the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The extremely positive words emerging from those talks suggest that we are finally on the verge of cracking a Brexit deal and resolving the inscrutable issue of the Northern Ireland backstop. The question of what to do with the Irish/ Northern Irish border while respecting the Good Friday Agreement and the EU referendum result had until yesterday appeared to be more like one of those images by Escher where poor souls forever push a giant rock up steps.
OCT12	Brexit nightmare stemmed from Tories so it’s time to get serious, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	Well, the Tories can now return from Manchester and get on with what they are supposed to be doing – running the country. The patient faithful would be most grateful if they could try not to make so many mistakes. For it is a matter of history that the nightmare of the past three and a half years is not all down to the shambles of what used to be our Labour Party or the loopy-loo Lib-Dems.    The torrent of errors that have laid us low stemmed from the Tories. It began with David Cameron calling the referendum. Nothing wrong with that but what was foolish was for him to become the passionate leader of the Remain campaign. When he lost, he’d destroyed his own incumbency as prime minister. Then he quit so fast he left both party and country leaderless. The 1922 Committee, charged with finding a successor, dithered when urgency was of the essence. Half a dozen candidates appeared and then behaved like complete prats. Michael Gove knifed Boris Johnson and both withdrew. Andrea Leadsom blew herself away with a daft remark and without a vote we got the utter disaster of Theresa Ma
OCT12	Leo lectures UK on what we think – but he’s forgetting history, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	THE CLAIM by Irish premier Leo Varadkar that a majority of the British now wish to stay in the EU was particularly crass when one recalls the death of Irish democracy. In 2007 the Giscard d’Estaing-devised EU constitution was resoundingly rejected at referendum by the French and the Dutch. Brussels re-arranged its clauses and re-presented it as the Treaty of Lisbon.    All EU members were instructed to pass and ratify it into law without a referendum. But Ireland had a problem. Its constitution was clear – any transfer of sovereignty had to go to referendum. So Dublin held one and the Irish voted “No”. They were told to go back to the poll and try again – and this time get it right – meaning say “Yes”. So they did. Master Varadkar happily went along with it. So much for democracy in the land of St Patrick. Now he lectures us on what we think. 
OCT12	Don’t treat hungry commuters worse than criminals, says ROSS CLARK	Dame Sally Davies, the outgoing Chief Medical Officer, once complained bitterly about being called Britain    Yesterday, she called for a ban on eating on buses and commuter trains in order, she said, to fight obesity. Children need to grow up in environments in which snacking between meals is unacceptable, she argued. How bizarre. This is the same Sally Davies who in 2013 called on the Coalition to decriminalise some illegal drugs and told MPs that drug addiction should be treated as a medical issue rather than a criminal matter. 
OCT13	MPs must put country before party and secure Brexit for Britain, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE HOUR of reckoning approaches. Boris Johnson is about to enter one of the most momentous weeks in the history of British politics.    At stake is the fate not just of his premiership but the very destiny of our country. If he is able to secure a withdrawal deal in the coming days, he will be able to honour the referendum result and put Britain on the road to independence. But if the intransigence of either the house of Commons or the EU prevails, then a miserable stalemate will drag down his Government and sink Brexit, perhaps forever. Today, the Queen’s Speech at the state opening of Parliament will set out the Tories’ vision for Britain, including more police on the streets, tighter immigration controls and greater funding for the NHS.
OCT13	A year after ISIS was vanquished the terror group is returning, says MARCO GIANNANGELI	THE consequences of Recep Erdogan's military offensive in northern Syria are already all too clear to see. Today, hitherto inert IS sleeper cells have woken and are at work reasserting their identity in a region where, less than a year ago, they were declared vanquished.    Kurdish forces with the SDF and YPG have been betrayed. They were instrumental in the Syrian part of the victory and vital to the subsequent guarding of camps holding more than 70,000 IS prisoners. At least 100,000 civilians, who until recently could count on the presence of US forces to safeguard them, risk creating a fresh humanitarian crisis as they flee Turkish bombardment in search of safety.
OCT13	The canonisation of a new British saint is a historic moment, says JACOB REES-MOGG	THE canonisation today in Rome of Cardinal John Henry Newman will be the first time for 618 years that an English saint, other than a martyr, has been pro­ claimed. The last one was John of Bridlington, in 1401.    This is important because a martyr is declared a saint due to the form of death, while other saints led sanctified lives. The term canonisation is much misun­derstood. It is not an award of an honour such as being made a Knight of the Garter, nor is it a posthumous medal for holiness. It is a declaration that someone showed heroic virtue in life and whose sanctity has been proved by miracles.
OCT13	Johnson can land the ultimate prize for the UK - EXPRESS COMMENT	IN THE Queen's Speech Boris Johnson will offer us a glimpse of the brave new world that awaits Britain when it finally escapes the clutches of the EU.    At last, the generational problems which have beset this nation on health, social care, policing, immigration and much more can begin to be tackled in a meaningful way. No longer will we be held back by the Brussels bureaucracy and forced to pour billions of taxpayers' pounds a year into the black hole of EU finance. The prize could not be greater for Britain - and this would be just the beginning as new free trade deals and opening up to the rest of the world will see this country flourish and prosper.
OCT13	You are being lied to – Varadkar and Barnier are giving us nothing, says PAUL BALDWIN	“Caw” said the crow. “Balls” said the Milligan.    Schoolboys (and perhaps girls) of a certain vintage will instantly recognise the line from Spike Milligan's absurdist novel Puckoon – a book riddled with madness, black comedy and more F-words than 10 minutes of Love Island, which it was mandatory to pass around at the back of the class in the late 1970s. The premise of Puckoon was, of course, the issue of the Irish border – a border at once random, vague and pointless yet so imbued with symbolism people were prepared to kill and die (perhaps in a ditch) for it. Sound familiar?

OCT14	Strictly’s Dev’s departure will hurt him like hell – and I should know, says VANESSA FELTZ	SO farewell Dev Griffin. You were definitely a Strictly one to watch this series, yet watch you we cannot. The feelgood sequin and glitterball show never fails to shock us with seemingly inexplicable exits and rampant injustices. Why you should bite the dust, while Emma Weymouth survives for another episode or two, is bewildering.    You had it all: a flexible frame, versatility and an infectious affinity for the music. You must feel lost, deflated and all at sea. Rory Bremner, who fell at the first hurdle, described the feeling as watching your best mates cracking open the fizz and driving off in a golden coach without you. I’ve been there. It hurt like fury. And my cha-cha-chas couldn’t hold a candle to your sinuous and silky performances. 
OCT14	At last we can see signs of life after Brexit, says STEPHEN POLLARD	For a nation that does pageantry better than any other, it was no surprise to see yesterday’s Queen’s Speech pulling out all the stops. For all the bizarre political context in which it was made, it’s always thrilling to see British pomp in its full glory. But make no mistake – it was indeed one of the most bizarre of all Queen’s Speeches.    For one thing, the government whose agenda Her Majesty outlined yesterday is itself desperate to call a halt to what many have rightly called a “zombie Parliament”. Boris Johnson has spent his entire time as Prime Minister demanding that the Opposition vote for an election. That would mean the Queen repeating the whole thing in a few weeks, whoever wins. And don’t forget that Boris Johnson has so far lost every vote in the House of Commons.

OCT16	Please don’t let us go to a cashless society, we still need notes, says PATRICK O’FLYNN	BACK in the days when comedians were permitted to be funny and just a little politically incorrect, Harry Enfield developed two characters who were devoted to cash.    The first, Loadsamoney, was a plasterer who would regularly display his wad of banknotes, leaving the distinct suspicion that he might not have paid tax on some of his earnings. The second, Big Bob Joylove, was a spiv who cheerfully misinterpreted any response to anything he said as a demand that a bribe be paid and would reply “Oh, I get you” before peeling off an array of tenners. In that era, who could doubt that cash was king? Most of us used the folding stuff for the vast majority of transactions, from the supermarket shop to purchasing a round of drinks in the pub. Not any more. 
OCT16	There is no excuse for refusing to vaccinate children, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	WHAT is going on with the measles vaccine? If statistics are to be believed, much of the boycott is to be found among the normally health-conscious middle classes, who take their little darlings to ballet or judo lessons but not to the nice vaccination lady. Why?    There may be some lingering fear about autism, despite the near unanimity of medical experts against any link and there will be a small number who object to the use of foetal cell lines, despite the Church having sanctioned the vaccine. But the large majority simply seem inclined not to bother, and I suspect what we have here is a reaction both against an overstated case and a growing resistance to immunity in general. Scare tactics never work if they contradict common experience. However much experts tell us that six units of alcohol constitute a binge, nobody is going to believe that three doubles or two large glasses of wine come anywhere near that description.

OCT17	Remainers now owe Boris Johnson a huge apology, writes ROSS CLARK	The ink was hardly dry on the EU withdrawal agreement announced yesterday before opposition parties trotted out their predictable negative reactions.    Jeremy Corbyn described it as “even worse” than Mrs May’s deal. Nicola Sturgeon said the SNP would vote against it and Jo Swinson confirmed there was no deal the Lib Dems would ever vote for other than one ignoring the result of the 2016 referendum. Diehard Remainers were wrongfooted by the break-through. For weeks they insisted the Prime Minister had no hope of securing a deal by the deadline of October 31. Many insisted he wasn’t even trying – with some claiming he was involved in some dark conspiracy with short-sellers planning to make a fortune on a plunging pound.

OCT17	Strictly’s Dev’s departure will hurt him like hell – and I should know, says VANESSA FELTZ	SO farewell Dev Griffin. You were definitely a Strictly one to watch this series, yet watch you we cannot. The feelgood sequin and glitterball show never fails to shock us with seemingly inexplicable exits and rampant injustices. Why you should bite the dust, while Emma Weymouth survives for another episode or two, is bewildering.    You had it all: a flexible frame, versatility and an infectious affinity for the music. You must feel lost, deflated and all at sea. Rory Bremner, who fell at the first hurdle, described the feeling as watching your best mates cracking open the fizz and driving off in a golden coach without you. I’ve been there. It hurt like fury. And my cha-cha-chas couldn’t hold a candle to your sinuous and silky performances. 
OCT17	At last we can see signs of life after Brexit, says STEPHEN POLLARD	For a nation that does pageantry better than any other, it was no surprise to see yesterday’s Queen’s Speech pulling out all the stops. For all the bizarre political context in which it was made, it’s always thrilling to see British pomp in its full glory. But make no mistake – it was indeed one of the most bizarre of all Queen’s Speeches. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.
OCT17	MPs must put country before party and secure Brexit for Britain, says LEO McKINSTRY	THE HOUR of reckoning approaches. Boris Johnson is about to enter one of the most momentous weeks in the history of British politics.    At stake is the fate not just of his premiership but the very destiny of our country. If he is able to secure a withdrawal deal in the coming days, he will be able to honour the referendum result and put Britain on the road to independence. But if the intransigence of either the house of Commons or the EU prevails, then a miserable stalemate will drag down his Government and sink Brexit, perhaps forever. Today, the Queen’s Speech at the state opening of Parliament will set out the Tories’ vision for Britain, including more police on the streets, tighter immigration controls and greater funding for the NHS.
OCT19	Brexit mockery - now it's time we got rid of this zombie Parliament, says MARTIN DAUBNEY	AT just before 3pm yesterday, did anybody else feel a minor earthquake, as 17.4 million Britons head-butted their desks or kicked their tellies?    Once again, it was Brexit Groundhog Day as another vote – this time the Letwin amendment – meant just 16 MPs votes rendered the British public’s vote meaningless. Our zombie Parliament proved it is utterly unfit for purpose. In Parliament Square, the People’s Vote crowd cheered. Onstage, Remainers Anna Soubry, Jess Phillips and Caroline Lucas celebrated like England had won the Women’s World Cup. This should not be happening. It makes an absolute mockery of British politics. We are now a global laughing stock. 
OCT19	For how long can gutless political pygmies prostitute British democracy? asks PAUL BALDWIN	SO here we are again – Brexit Groundhog Day. Another chance to enact the will of the people ripped away by our gutless political pygmies hell bent on prostituting British democracy.    The eyes of the world are upon us said Theresa May this morning with uncommon prescience – they must be blinking in disbelief at how we have the front to call ourselves a democracy. Boris Johnson’s deal is imperfect, as any deal will be imperfect. We are removing a huge nation from a much huger supranation. There’s a lot to go wrong. But it is workable, just.
OCT19	Letwin plot is ‘disgraceful bid to thwart the will of the people’, says PATRICK O’FLYNN	ALMOST nine years after the Daily Express began campaigning to get the United Kingdom out of the European Union, we can finally see the prize of Brexit coming tantalisingly within reach. In November 2010, this newspaper energised a cause which, until we took it up, had been deliberately confined to the fringes of debate by the British establishment – despite it having widespread latent support among voters.

OCT19	Britain is unhappy? Tosh! Brits are cheerful now, says RICHARD MADELEY	ANOTHER week, another national survey to leave you scratching your head.    The latest study purports to show how unhappy we are compared to the past, and it made bizarre reading. It seems Britain was at its most content around 140 years ago, in the 1880s. No matter that poverty, disease, child labour and domestic slavery were rife: we’re told that Britons have never felt they had it so good, before or since. Researchers at two universities and the Alan Turing Institute in London pored over books and newspapers published during the last 200 years.
OCT19	Labour MPs - defy Corbyn and honour your leave-voting constituents, says TIM NEWARK	LABOUR MPs in Leave constituencies must honour their voters and back Boris Johnson’s deal today. They must defy Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership that just wants to play party politics with our nation’s great future.    Crucially, Labour has said they will not withdraw the whip from their MPs who back the deal in a sneaky admission that getting Brexit behind them could well get Corbyn out of a tight corner with his pro-EU supporters. Instead Corbyn just wants to posture in front of his divided ranks with empty rhetoric. In fact it now appears that Corbyn might have made his flat-out refusal to back Boris’ deal before he even saw the text of the agreement. His quote about a “sell-out deal” and his usual wittering about maintaining “environmental, social and employment standards at the highest level” was hitting news desks minutes before even No 10 had sent out the agreed Brexit wording.
OCT19	How patriots could take 'Surrender Act' to the Supreme Court, writes FREDERICK FORSYTH	A Barrister friend who studies these things with a magnifying glass has been examining the Benn Act, dubbed by Downing Street the surrender Act. According to him this act requires us to surrender to the requirements of the EU in concluding a “settlement” on their terms.    But these require us to break up our kingdom into Northern Ireland with one set of trading rules (the EU’s) and mainland Britain with another. 
OCT19	Back Boris - those voting against deal are destroying our future, says CAROLE MALONE	HE’S only gone and done it. He’s only gone and delivered the miracle that, even four days ago, our Brexit-deranged Remainer Parliament, lawyers, think tankers and campaigners all said was impossible. This is a modal window.

OCT19	British independence is alive again thanks to Boris Johnson's triumph, says LEO MCKINSTRY	The dream of British independence is alive again. A new era of national freedom beckons, thanks to Boris Johnson’s remarkable triumph in Brussels. In achieving this historic breakthrough on a deal, the Prime Minister has played his part superbly in attempting to honour the 2016 referendum result.    After three years of shameful procrastination, it is now up to MPs to follow his magnificent lead and finally deliver Brexit. If they back him, Britain will set out confidently on the road to becoming a self-governing nation once more. But if they indulge in more of their squalid, irresponsible manoeuvres against this hard-won agreement, they will sink Brexit and shatter the last vestiges of faith in our democratic system. In such bleak circumstances, public contempt and derision will be their deserved fate.
OCT19	Brexiteers didn’t crack and have now finally won the battle, writes FREDERICK FORSYTH	There will come a time when the utter chaos to which we have all been subjected for the past three-and-a-half years will be examined with hindsight, made sense of and explained.

OCT20	Finally the game may be up for jubilant Remainers, says LEO McKINSTRY	After the Government’s latest setback on Brexit, the pro-EU brigade is in a triumphalist mood. By placing yet another obstruction in the path of Britain’s orderly departure, they think that they have put Boris Johnson on the rack.    But the jubilation of the remainers may be premature. their latest tactical manoeuvre could backfire, by galvanising the pro-Leave forces in the Commons and uniting the public behind the Prime Minister in defence of democracy. Last Saturday, after more than three years of procrastination, MPs had the opportunity to resolve the Brexit crisis by backing the new deal negotiated by Boris Johnson. 
OCT20	Extinction Rebellion’s extreme tactics do no one any good, says TIM NEWARK	BUMPING into an Extinction Rebellion (ER) supporter last week on a train station, she let the cat out of the bag. “Like Trump, we’re taking an extreme position,” she told me, “in order to shift the whole debate towards us.

OCT20	House of Cowards - now we are in a new era of crisis - SUNDAY EXPRESS COMMENT	YESTERDAY will live as a moment of infamy in the long annals of Parliament. MPs had a golden opportunity to end the Brexit crisis and honour the verdict of the 2016 referendum by supporting the Prime Minister's hard-fought EU withdrawal deal.    Instead, with the self-indulgent obstinacy that has become their hallmark, they decided to plunge Westminster into more turmoil by refusing to approve the agreement. Yet again, the House of Cowards showed that it prefers irresponsible procrastination to decisive action. The euphoria that Boris Johnson generated on Thursday with his heroic diplomatic triumph at the Brussels summit has now evaporated, replaced by a mood of uncertainty and despair. By their failure to back him, our foolish politicians have demonstrated their contempt for democracy and the national interest.

Yet, I can’t help wondering why she has reached so many iffy conclusions? She says her British friends warned her not to marry Prince Harry because “the tabloids will destroy your life”. I have a soupçon of experience in matters of tabloid scrutiny.    When my husband upped and offed in 1999 the “story” was splashed all over the front pages. I first found out about and saw a picture of the woman he’d been having an affair with on the pages of a newspaper.  Paparazzi jumped out at my children, then 10 and 13, from behind our bushes and employees were approached for interviews. My girls heard the “story” discussed at length on radio phone-ins played loudly over speakers on the school coach.

There were Labour MPs prepared to put the country first and vote for the deal, just as the hardline European Research Group was falling in behind it. even without the DUP, it seemed set to pass.    And then Sir Oliver Letwin threw a spanner in the works with his latest wrecking manoeuvre, an amendment forcing the Government to abandon plans for a clear vote, followed by John Bercow’s intervention yesterday. The MPs who backed the Letwin amendment will have to answer to their constituents at the next election. But while it’s impossible to be certain where we will actually stand over Brexit within the next 48 hours, let alone by October 31, one thing is now crystal clear: Boris Johnson has not only transformed the political scene, he has transformed the electoral chances of the Tories.

In an apparently resounding boost for the Government, MPs backed the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at its second reading by the decisive margin of 30 votes, the first time that the House of Commons had actually backed any Government deal with the EU. Through his dynamism and determination, Boris Johnson achieved something Theresa May never did in three fraught attempts. But then the House's addiction to chaos and confusion kicked in.

OCT22	Harry is a fine young man, but a stiff upper lip wouldn’t go amiss, says TIM NEWARK	It is shocking indeed to hear that Prince Harry, a young man of such character and promise, is teetering on the edge of mental distress. Tearful and exhausted, still carrying the grief of losing his mother and admitting estrangement from his brother, he is clearly feeling the pressure of being a royal and protecting his new wife from the media onslaught.    There is much he can be proud of. His military service in Afghanistan put him on the frontline and earned him the respect of his comrades. To take that experience and translate it into promoting the Invictus Games, a high profile event aimed at helping injured soldiers demonstrate their physical prowess was a stroke of genius and rightfully earned him great plaudits. Who can forget him and his brother proudly wearing their military frock coats as they walked together to his wedding in Windsor Castle?

OCT24	Remainers’ self-indulgent move is a recipe for further Brexit deadlock says LEO MCKINSTRY	FOR an uplifting moment last night at Westminster, it seemed that there might be light at the end of the tunnel. Finally, the exhausting stalemate over Brexit could be broken after more than three years of procrastination and paralysis.    In an apparently resounding boost for the Government, MPs backed the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at its second reading by the decisive margin of 30 votes, the first time that the House of Commons had actually backed any Government deal with the EU. Through his dynamism and determination, Boris Johnson achieved something Theresa May never did in three fraught attempts. But then the House's addiction to chaos and confusion kicked in.

OCT24	Thuggish Remainers pick on a young child – that’s about their level, says ANN WIDDECOMBE	PARLIAMENT is a circus. The Government has lost control.

OCT24	Harry is a fine young man, but a stiff upper lip wouldn’t go amiss, says TIM NEWARK	It is shocking indeed to hear that Prince Harry, a young man of such character and promise, is teetering on the edge of mental distress. Tearful and exhausted, still carrying the grief of losing his mother and admitting estrangement from his brother, he is clearly feeling the pressure of being a royal and protecting his new wife from the media onslaught.

OCT24	Bercow has been an egocentric, whistle-happy partisan for too long, says LEO MCKINSTRY	THE Speaker John Bercow was in his element yesterday as he indulged in two of his favourite pastimes - pontificating in a theatrical manner while frustrating the Tory Government. This is a politician who is regularly inebriated with the exuberance of his florid, attention-seeking rhetoric. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

OCT24	Meghan – don’t give up lip service, says VANESSA FELTZ	I’m a Meghan fan. I admire her feistiness, her drive, her rise to become a successful actress, her poise and beauty. Yet, I can’t help wondering why she has reached so many iffy conclusions? She says her British friends warned her not to marry Prince Harry because “the tabloids will destroy your life”. I have a soupçon of experience in matters of tabloid scrutiny.    When my husband upped and offed in 1999 the “story” was splashed all over the front pages. I first found out about and saw a picture of the woman he’d been having an affair with on the pages of a newspaper.  Paparazzi jumped out at my children, then 10 and 13, from behind our bushes and employees were approached for interviews. My girls heard the “story” discussed at length on radio phone-ins played loudly over speakers on the school coach. We were followed to the supermarket. Folk I’d never met aired their ill-informed views while sympathisers cooed: “You poor thing! It must be awful having your dirty laundry aired in the media.” 
OCT24	Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit vision is the real winner of this saga, says STEPHEN POLLARD	Only a fool would predict the eventual fate of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal. at the end of last week it seemed odds-on that the Prime Minister had secured enough votes – just – to have MPs pass his new Brexit deal. There were Labour MPs prepared to put the country first and vote for the deal, just as the hardline European Research Group was falling in behind it. even without the DUP, it seemed set to pass.    And then Sir Oliver Letwin threw a spanner in the works with his latest wrecking manoeuvre, an amendment forcing the Government to abandon plans for a clear vote, followed by John Bercow’s intervention yesterday. The MPs who backed the Letwin amendment will have to answer to their constituents at the next election. But while it’s impossible to be certain where we will actually stand over Brexit within the next 48 hours, let alone by October 31, one thing is now crystal clear: Boris Johnson has not only transformed the political scene, he has transformed the electoral chances of the Tories.

OCT25	Essex lorry: Why is it so hard to track down international criminal gangs, asks ROSS CLARK	AS YET we know little about the 39 people found dead in the back of a lorry at Grays, Essex, on Wednesday other than that they appear to have been Chinese nationals. We do not know what motivated them to make their ill-fated journey to Britain, where they planned to go, nor what they hoped to do when they arrived here.    One thing is for sure: no one deserves to die locked in a refrigerated container. We can only guess at the agonies they suffered as, one by one, they succumbed to extreme cold or oxygen starvation. Did they cry out or bang on the walls when they realised the hopelessness of their situation? If so, no one heard them. Caught in the largely automated world of international cargo handling, they had no chance.
OCT25	Boris has made EU crack – remainers will pay for their betrayal says FREDERICK FORSYTH	Amid all the doom and gloom after last Saturday’s naked betrayal of the British people and their vote of three-and-a-quarter years ago, there is a beam of light and it is this. In his eight weeks of office Boris Johnson had achieved what had seemed impossible.    He had caused Brussels to crack and reverse its hitherto intransigence. He had achieved what had seemed to have no chance – a departure deal that we could live with. As to how it happened, it is really quite simple. For three years the Brussels- based EU team thought they had got Britain over a barrel thanks to the blithering incompetence and weakness of Theresa May and her team of secret Remainers. They presumed we would stay that way, a vassal state paying billions a year for the privilege of being bossed around. 
OCT25	Gullible Scots have fallen for Sturgeon’s independence pipe dream, says FREDERICK FORSYTH	Scottish SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon brandishes before the Scots her dream of a second secession referendum but it is a pipe dream. Unfortunately, a proportion, the gullible ones, have fallen for it. Sheer facts are often inconvenient but cannot be ignored. So here they are.    Without constant economic and financial support from south of the border, Scotland is functionally bankrupt. So the sovereign, independent Republic of Scotland would be neither sovereign nor independent. here are the reasons. one: Miss Sturgeon claims the EU would welcome Scotland back into the fold. Not a chance. the last thing the EU needs is yet another basket case. if it ever happened, it would be as a servant state. 
OCT25	Boris’ stock rises every time House of Cowards frustrates our wishes, says LEO McKINSTRY	AT the House of Cowards, it is business as usual this week. Confusion, paralysis and obstinacy still reign at the Commons, where MPs have indulged in yet more delaying tactics over Brexit.

OCT26	Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are royal insult to our modern Queen, says CAROLE MALONE	SO MEGHAN and Harry reckon they’ve “single- handedly modernised the monarchy’? As the couple seem hell-bent on making their every thought public, I’m hoping they’ll elaborate on what it is they think they’ve done.    Because from where I’m sitting all they’ve done is insult and embarrass the royal family, particularly the Queen who is the most modernising monarch we’re ever likely to see. They’re insulting Charles who’s done more than his bit and Wills and Kate who played a blinder in Pakistan and were told by the honorary consul: “You have radiated joy wherever you have been,” to which Wills replied: “We’re happy people.” 
OCT26	Brexit violence poll is most disturbing finding you can imagine says STEPHEN POLLARD	IT HAS become something of a cliché in recent weeks to argue that the language and tone of our politics have taken a turn for the worse – and that we need to dial down the rhetoric.    Healthy, vigorous political debate is the lifeblood of democracy. It’s easy to dismiss such warnings over language as coming from “snowflakes” – and to argue that if you can’t stand the heat, you shouldn’t be in the kitchen. But the concerns are very real and it’s been obvious for some time that we have lost – or are on the point of losing – that typically British civility underpinning political debate which has stood us in such good stead for so long.

OCT26	Fear of the electorate is only thing that unites Corbyn and Jo Swinson says MACER HALL	LIKE the hero of Gulliver’s Travels pegged to the ground by a host of minuscule Lilliputians, Boris Johnson finds himself ensnared this weekend. The Prime Minister had hoped to be at the helm steering the country out of the EU next week. Instead, the Remainer alliance has him trussed up in Downing Street barely able to move.    Mr Johnson this week charted a course out of the Brexit storm by calling a general election on December 12. On Monday, MPs are set to vote on a Government motion seeking to trigger that snap poll. Yet the expectation is that, for a third time in as many months, the vote will fall short of the two-thirds "super majority" required for the motion to pass.
OCT26	Bullish Tories have forgotten Farage remains a major threat to Boris says NICK TYRONE	WITH a sizeable lead in the polls and having defied his critics by securing a new Brexit deal, Boris Johnson is relishing the chance to cripple Corbyn and Farage at the ballot box. But the Tories shouldn’t consider the threat the Brexit Party poses to be dead, says Nick Tyrone. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

OCT26	Heading footballs must be banned immediately after brain injury find says RICHARD MADELEY	SOMEONE’S got to say it, loud and clear, so I will. Heading the ball must be banned from football matches, completely, irrevocably, and immediately. The link between soccer and terrible brain injuries, specifically because of “headers”, has finally been established beyond the slightest doubt.    I realise that the thought of matches minus the thrilling sight of skilled and powerful headed goals seems almost surreal. But then so once did the concept of smoke-free offices, pubs and restaurants. When banning cigarettes, cigars and pipes from public areas – and public transport – was first mooted, it sparked righteous outrage. It took years of patient campaigning for common sense to prevail.
