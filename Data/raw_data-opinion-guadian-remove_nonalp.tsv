JAN1	Politicians could ease refugee suffering, but instead they stoke fear	The major incident is well and truly under way Sajid Javid has signalled just how seriously he is taking the recent spike in refugee crossings across the Channel by interrupting his holiday to deal with the crisis  All manner of plans are now being devised to shore up our borders Around people have crossed the Channel since Christmas Day but while the government ramps up concern about this sudden new development actually something that has been occurring since context is lacking 
JAN1	If we must look to the past, let’s make it 1989 – a year of transformation	Whatever happened to the future Brexiteers cling on to a fantastical mixture of empire war and an England whose genius was supposedly embodied by Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher In the United States Donald Trump harks back to an America of economic might musclebound men toiling in car factories and coalmines and splendid isolation A recent issue of the Economist surveyed politics in Europe and the US and observed an orgy of reminiscence partly traceable to the fact that millions of westerners cannot shake off a deep and understandable sense of decline  There s an obvious irony in having to look back to find something better but marks the th anniversary of a run of events that embodied pretty much the polar opposite optimism faith in the future and a sense of shared humanity that could not be more different from the polarised rancorous mood of today As this year unfolds the events of a year as replete with significance as or will be celebrated and picked apart in Berlin there will be an impressive run of commemorative events Leafing through histories of the time and thinking back to what happened what most sticks out is a set of emotions and impulses that we would do well to revive defiance joy an urge to run headlong into whatever happened next 
JAN1	Brexit is not an end to Britain’s liaison with Europe. It’s just a new beginning	They are sick of the whole thing They just want it to be over No more uncertainty Brexiteers want resolution They will be disappointed Willing something does not make it so Aethelred wanted Viking raids to stop The kingdoms of Wales Scotland and Ireland wished the Norman and Plantagenet monarchs of England would cease their predatory lunges into their territory Neville Chamberlain hoped that Hitler would be content with Czechoslovakia Oliver Letwin wished there was an island we could send all migrants to The hopes of politicians and rulers are whispers in a gale  There is no end state in our relations with Europe There is only millennia of collaboration conquest disputes exchange competition and alliance 
JAN1	Louis CK’s rant shows abusers are still casting themselves as victims	One of the more idiotic if not wholly surprising byproducts of the MeToo era is how men who have been exposed as misogynists and abusers have recast themselves as victims Lost livelihoods and broken reputations are they tell us an excessive price to pay for their transgressions Lately though going hand in hand with this victim status is a new hardened persona one that comes bathed in fury and self righteousness You thought that was bad they seem to say You ain t seen the half of it  Take Louis CK the comedian who in November admitted to repeatedly exposing himself to and masturbating in front of unconsenting women and on being found out declared I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want I will now step back and take a long time to listen For CK a long time meant nine months after which he was back on stage at the Comedy Cellar in New York doing what comics tend to do talking and saying what he wanted Now new audio has emerged from a fortnight ago featuring a lengthy Louis CK rant I would call it a comedy set but that would give it a credence it doesn t deserve recorded at a Long Island club It finds him jokingly bemoaning the money he has lost in the past year mocking the survivors of the shooting in Parkland Florida in which students and staff members were killed and lamenting the new political correctness that champions gender neutral pronouns and frowns on the use of words like retarded Presumably sensing disapproval from his audience he says What are you going to take away my birthday My life is over I don t give a shit You can be offended it s OK You can get mad at me Anyway So why do black guys have big dicks Let s talk about that for a minute 
JAN1	I used to defend smacking children. Now I see it as an abuse of power	Brats do not endear themselves Even when insulated from children we nevertheless encounter our fair share of adults whom we suspect got their own way too much of the time as kids The recent behaviour of some Conservative MPs could be a case in point The foot stamping of fanatical Brexiteers unable to reconcile what they wish for with reality is not unlike that of a child screaming their insistence that they won t wear a coat even though it s C outside  It s not hard to imagine that they were rarely told no when they were young Or that the finality of the word was seldom made concrete to them They have become grandiose and overindulged and we re collectively suffering the consequences of their tantrum 
JAN1	Don’t expect Brexit to give us a British Alexander Hamilton	I spent most of hearing the same story of revolution ambition and factional rivalry played on a loop And when I wasn t listening to the Hamilton soundtrack I wrote about Brexit  I m late to the Hamilton party I know Lin Manuel Miranda s musical about the first US Treasury secretary opened on Broadway in I only got tickets to see it in London a few weeks ago but by then I was word perfect on the score For the uninitiated Hamilton tells the story of an orphan immigrant s climb up the social and political ladders of newly independent America culminating in a death that well let s just say it puts the modern Twitter spat into perspective Plus singing dancing rapping 
JAN1	Human dignity is in danger. In 2019 we must stand as one to survive	What does it mean to be human That question sits at the core of human rights To be human has specific implications human self awareness and the actions taken to uphold human dignity these are what gives the concept of humanity a special meaning  Human self awareness and human actions determine the interplay between individual thought and language and the wider society It is our actions as humans that deliver economic security the right to education the right to free association and free expression and which create the conditions for protecting expression and encouraging bold thinking When we abandon efforts to uphold human dignity we forfeit the essential meaning of being human and when we waver in our commitment to the idea of human rights we abandon our moral principles What follows is duplicity and folly corruption and tyranny and the endless stream of humanitarian crises that we see in the world today 
JAN1	There is a path to a second referendum – and only Labour can win it	If it was the season of peace and goodwill towards all then politics failed to get the memo Not only did hostilities continue through the Christmas period some of the main protagonists announced in advance that they were incapable of taking a break If anything the holidays provided more opportunities for irate booze fuelled Twitter rants One particular object of ire was Jeremy Corbyn s pre Christmas interview in the Guardian where he appeared to dash the hopes of many on the left that Labour would immediately become the party of remain  As the political class sobers up in January and returns to Westminster it will become apparent that little has changed The size of the majority against the prime minister s deal will have diminished but as No briefed in the run up to the internal confidence vote in her leadership it only takes a majority of one Bizarrely Downing Street has chosen to amplify the threat of no deal by announcing more money and even the deployment of troops But this strategy seems set to backfire it will only give comfort to the European Research Group hardliners that there can be a soft landing to jumping off the cliff edge 
JAN1	Was 2018 a turning point for women? Yes, it exposed what we’re up against	A pale slouching Harvey Weinstein has so far escaped criminal charges for the allegations of sexual assault against him A millionaire is given a three year jail sentence for killing a woman who died from the horrific injuries he inflicted on her including having bleach poured over her face because this was said to be consensual rough sex The incredibly brave Kurdish women who have faced down Islamic State have now been totally abandoned by Trump s policy on Syria This is how we end the year and though there are those reluctant still to give up the narrative of sunlit progress it s not been a great one for women  But there are so many great and good women out there who shine light into the darkness I raise a glass to you for 
JAN1	Brexiteers want Britain to ‘look east’. But their idea of Asia is a fantasy	In a few weeks Singapore observes the th anniversary of Sir Stamford Raffles arrival The spot where he landed is marked with a statue arms folded looking out to sea while the storey headquarters of a local bank towers behind him It s a popular selfie spot  Singapore s government plans a series of exhibitions and historic walking trails that will turn the spotlight on the island s long and successful history both before and after the imperial adventurer strode ashore and planted the union flag in January 
JAN2	May has run down the Brexit clock. It must be stopped	Theresa May thought her Brexit deal was an offer MPs could not refuse Not because it would bring our constituents anything useful Quite the opposite it will make us poorer our economy less certain and our outlook less hopeful Take the prime minister s Brexit deal or crash out of Europe with no deal at all she declared  But far from being the Don Corleone of British politics Theresa May is more the emperor with no clothes Explicitly keeping the option of a no deal on the table is an act of supreme economic sabotage It is also delusional The prime minister has long preferred the support of hard right Brexiteers over more reasonable voices within her party Now she is seeking the votes she needs by threatening these same Brexiteers with something they actually want a no deal Brexit Her attempt at blackmail is both stupid and venal 
JAN2	Sajid Javid’s bluster on Channel crossings has an ugly Australian precedent	Britain is in the grip of a crisis Apparently Last week the home secretary Sajid Javid declared the number of people attempting to cross the Channel a major incident though the numbers don t support such a claim But that didn t deter the newspapers   Home secretary brings back two Border Force cutters to tackle migrant crisis says the Metro Sajid Javid recalls two Border Force boats to patrol English Channel amid migrant crisis the Evening Standard reports Migrant crisis the Sun shouts in capitals Two Border Force boats redeployed from the Med to patrol the Channel for migrants The Daily Express joined in Migrant crisis migrants detained at Kent beach ahead of Sajid Javid talks And the Times Migrant crisis Sajid Javid sends extra boats to Channel 
JAN2	Here, in the bloodlands of Belarus, I found hope for the future of Europe	In December I travelled to Minsk for a seminar with a group of European historians A few miles outside the capital of Belarus we visited places where both the Nazis and Stalin s secret police had committed some of the worst crimes of the th century During those few days I also spoke with some young locals who offered glimmers of hope as to what a truly united Europe could one day look like  It was the most instructive trip I ve made in years a deep dive into conflicting European memories highlighting the difficulty of overcoming stereotypes and ideological narratives as well as the legacy of the cold war in people s minds 
JAN2	Theresa May has broken her promise to the over-75s	Imagine for a second the BBC taking a frail housebound elderly pensioner to court for not possessing a TV licence that for years she has had for free Then imagine fining her the standard penalty with legal costs on top and if she doesn t pay or can t pay sending her to prison  Unthinkable In fact one in every court cases is over non payment of TV licences And from next year millions of people aged over could lose their right to a free TV licence and if they don t pay up end up being taken to court despite a Conservative election promise they would not have to pay 
JAN2	I thought online fakes would cause an infopocalypse	Remember when Barack Obama called President Trump a total and complete dipshit No me neither But if you search for it there s a video on YouTube where he appears to be saying just that I used to think that deepfakes would change the world These clips created using off the shelf AI systems take advantage of new capabilities to near perfectly edit video swapping faces altering expressions and synthesising speech without any artistic expertise  The technology burst into the public consciousness around Christmas when a small batch of perverts cottoned on to the possibilities of using it to insert their favourite celebrities into pornography But others were quick to see the wider ramifications of the tech a well timed deepfake of say a world leader declaring war or an FTSE chief executive openly discussing their company s impending bankruptcy could send shockwaves through the world s media

JAN3	Donald Trump has a point – the world should start solving its own problems	For a Briton to spend time in the US just now is a blessed relief Whole days pass and no talk of Brexit It is as if a pall has lifted from the art of conversation But the US has its own deep divide slashing through the populist body politic It is Donald Trump and America first  Trump has become a phenomenon Like Samson in the temple he seems able to topple the entire edifice of policy Down crashes America s government machine for the sake of a wall world trade is devastated stock markets plummet alliances lie in ruins It is astonishing what one man can do to the world virtually alone 
JAN3	Elizabeth Warren’s ‘likability’? The US media has learned nothing from 2016	The countdown to the US election has only just begun but it s already starting to look like a hellish repeat of  On Monday senator Elizabeth Warren became the first major Democrat to announce her intention to run for president As you may be aware Warren is a woman which means that it is basically illegal not to compare her with Hillary Clinton despite the two being very different politicians It is also mandatory to analyse her likability which we all know is the most important issue when it comes to female candidates Indeed less than hours after Warren had announced her bid Politico published a story headlined Warren battles the ghosts of Hillary They publicised the story with a widely derided tweet asking How does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground 
JAN3	Charging forced marriage victims rescue fees is a Foreign Office racket	In recent days the abhorrent practice of the Foreign Office whereby it forces British nationals who are victims of forced marriage abroad to pay for their protection and rescue has again hit the headlines It is left to the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt to say he wants to get to the bottom of the issue  But this is not a new issue that has only just come to light Southall Black Sisters the charity I run has sounded the alert about this for some time but without success The Guardian reported that this was happening over years ago This is why Hunt s appeal to British embassies for more humanity and compassion appears disingenuous 
JAN3	Fiona Onasanya is lucky. She’d be out of a job were it not for Brexit	It seems a strange thing to say about the disgraced Labour MP for Peterborough but Fiona Onasanya is a lucky woman Onasanya was found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice last month She faces a prison sentence She is contemplating the ruin of a career that included her public aspiration to become Britain s first black female prime minister I m not sticking my neck out very far to say that this last is not now going to happen  Onasanya s offence she repeatedly denied to police that she was behind the wheel when her car was caught speeding in Cambridgeshire in She refused to say who was driving In fact it was Onasanya who is a qualified solicitor as well as an MP After a first trial failed to agree a verdict Onasanya was found guilty at the retrial She will be sentenced soon 
JAN3	It’s not just Windrush. Britain’s immigration scandal will grow in 2019	Tasfin came to the UK in from Bangladesh or what was then called East Pakistan He was years old Orphaned during the brutal partition of India by the departing British he had been working since the age of for an American company in the port city of Chittagong He made tea unloaded containers repaired cars and swept floors And he eventually concluded that the only way to ensure a better life for himself was to scrape together the fare for a one way ride to the Tilbury Docks As a citizen of the Commonwealth he enjoyed this right to move to the United Kingdom as did all those now fondly referred to as the Windrush generation  Now Tasfin lives in Tooting south London with the eldest of his three sons surrounded by grandchildren the youngest of whom will be sitting her GCSEs in a few months time After working for over years on the London Underground he retired a few months after his wife passed away and struggles with chronic arthritis 
JAN3	Indian women just did a remarkable thing – they formed a wall of protest	On January in one of the biggest movements for women s rights in India million women lined up across the length of the southern state of Kerala to uphold Renaissance values What they were demanding was an end to violent agitations against women trying to enter Kerala s Sabarimala temple a popular Hindu pilgrimage site This followed a ruling by the Indian supreme court in September which forced the temple s doors open to women of all ages in a sensational blow to religious tradition   Where a man can enter a woman can also go What applies to a man applies to a woman the bench said in its judgment Since the temple has accepted only men and older women in their millions every year to preserve the mythological celibacy of the ruling deity Ayyappa In theory the court order only reinforced Indian women s constitutional right to enter places of worship as freely as men but in practice it wreaked mayhem Between November and December more than a dozen women of menstrual age including reporters tried to enter the temple but were stopped shoved and stoned by mobs of male devotees None of the women could make it in despite police protection and prohibitory orders Both sides are far from giving in Protests have since continued though most women who were sent back by the mobs have vowed to return 
JAN3	The space race is back on – and is China in the lead?	China s achievement in landing a spacecraft on the far side of the moon announced by Beijing s state media this morning has ramifications that go far beyond the simple statement of this being a first for mankind It puts China on the map of international space exploration on a par with the existing space powers of the United States and Russia the European Union to a lesser extent but also adds a new dimension It is the first time a landing has been attempted on the far side of the moon with the particular communications challenges this entails and it has been a success  The first response from the US space agency Nasa was generous as scientists to scientists what China had managed was a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment The response in political and military quarters in Washington as in Moscow however is likely to reflect trepidation There is now a serious newcomer to be considered 
JAN3	Labour members want another vote. Jeremy Corbyn shouldn’t fear that	At the outset of the Labour left faces both an unprecedented set of opportunities and potentially an unprecedented crisis As Theresa May hurtles towards what should be certain defeat on her Brexit deal and the divisions within the Conservative party deepen the prospects for a transformative leftwing government this year look good Even under the Fixed term Parliaments Act it is entirely plausible that the Tories will lose control and be unable to prevent an election  The problem that the left has is the gap between the apparent position of Labour s leadership and that of its rank and file In the most authoritative poll yet done research published this week by Queen Mary University shows that a whopping of Labour members back a fresh Brexit referendum substantially more than Jeremy Corbyn received in either leadership election 
JAN3	The Channel migrant ‘crisis’ is really a tale of British hypocrisy	A lot of us have spent the past few weeks telling our children some fairly problematic stuff That there s an old man with a beard who breaks into our homes with a reindeer and watches them while they sleep That it s acceptable to talk about the ins and outs of a virgin s womb That there was a genocidal king who murdered newborn boys I can t think of any context in which we would tell these stories other than Christmas but I suppose we feel they are balanced out by their happy endings Santa is a creepy idea but he does leave presents The traumatic experience of being homeless in another town with a birth imminent ends with a baby swaddled happily in a manger We don t tend to dwell on the next part in which the holy family went on to become refugees in Egypt although the Pope is among the religious figures who has suggested we should think about that more  You don t even need to go that far to see what is wrong with this year s Christmas message though which courtesy of Sajid Javid is that there is officially No Room at the Inn The home secretary cut short his a night luxury safari holiday in South Africa to appear to us as a Tory Ghost of Christmas Present with the message that Britain is now facing a full on crisis 
JAN3	The first lesson from my life as a carer? There is such a thing as society	It s leaflets at the moment If my son sees any in a cafe for instance he wants them all Later he will want to go through them and then destroy each one tearing them into tiny pieces We ve got him down to a maximum of three This is progress When he lived at home it was books each one to be looked through swiftly then reshelved on the other side of the room If we went outside every item on display in the two village shops had to be named three times I stopped going outside I stopped trying to speak to anyone on the phone because my son knew that if he stood next to me and shrieked like an agonised seagull no one could hear a thing  I have spent a large part of my life as a carer for my son whom I shall call Huw he is now a vulnerable adult who has severe autism and obsessive compulsive disorder OCD I was helped for part of that time by my daughter Rhiannon There are around million carers in the UK that s one in people and that doesn t include parents whose children aren t sick or disabled So many carers stories go untold Why Probably because it s exhausting especially if lack of sleep is part of the picture typical in cases of autism It may be because unaffected people feel uncomfortable thinking about it but it s possible that they just don t think about it full stop because our stories aren t out there And yet it s possible we will all be carers at some point 
JAN4	No-deal Brexit is like Dragons’ Den. No ferries, Chris? Sorry, I’m out	There s a certain type of movie character that finds time to suggest a shag even in the midst of a crisis If anything the fact the bomb clock is ticking or planetary destruction is pending gets them in the mood The Tories are like that but with backstabbing There are days until Brexit Theresa May s deal is about to get voted down heavily and bump the UK a few weeks closer to a calamitous no deal exit and the first thought of certain Tory leadership hopefuls is Ooh how can I do over the Saj  If you missed this latest flurry of displacement activity a report claimed the home secretary refers to himself in the third person during meetings According to what a source told the Sun and which Javid hotly denied He uses phrases like Just you watch what the Sajid is going to do about this or the Saj will sort that out Oof These drive bys made a charming companion piece to the articles suggesting that Javid was failing to get a grip on Britain s nonexistent migrant crisis and the very detailed articles about Javid s very luxurious South African holiday 
JAN4	Democrats are battling Trump. But on Brexit, Labour is tongue-tied	I m suffering from a bad case of opposition envy Perhaps you missed this only recently discovered malady among all the new year detox supplements and guides to a new you In which case let me fill you in  Spool back to the early summer of when twin horrors loomed on the horizon Brexit and Trump I imagined back then the devil offering progressive types one wish they could either have Britain stay in the European Union or see Donald Trump lose the US presidential election But they could not have both I wrote then that forced to make that diabolical choice I d opt for a remain victory in the referendum Though four years of Trump would be a nightmare Brexit would haunt us for generations 
JAN4	Think Riyadh’s Netflix ban was bad? Imagine if Hasan Minhaj was a Saudi citizen	The government of Saudi Arabia makes it very clear that resistance to its regime is futile It will not tolerate dissent it is untouchable  The kingdom has never claimed to be a democracy or that it believed in free speech the right to protest or the right to collectively bargain for rights There is no independent press 
JAN4	Beware the clever lie of a 'clean break Brexit'	Some days it can be hard to believe but Brexit hasn t actually happened yet Until pm on March when we leave the EU without a deal enter into the transition period envisaged by Theresa May s withdrawal agreement or don t leave at all because the article period has been extended the fight over our future remains a battle of ideas  Such battles are won largely with words in the absence of facts on the ground we are swayed by assertions characterisations and attempts to define sorry Theresa often rather nebulous concepts 
JAN4	All aboard Chris Grayling’s Brexit pizza ferry – what could possibly go wrong?	We re about to give back control to a government that can t tell the difference between P O and Papa John s pizza I know you think that sounds good but one day you ll want insulin or a functioning health service rather than a pepperoni stuffed crust  In case you ve missed everything here s a quick recap In government members insisted that Brexit was easy and no deal was better than a bad deal After realising that was shite they discovered they had to do quite a lot of planning for no deal This left them in the awkward position of going back to a public they d just told that Brexit would improve their lives and assuring them there d be food 
JAN4	Fat Cat Friday should shatter the myth that Britain’s bosses deserve their pay	Please raise a glass if you re not doing Dry January of course to our nation s exceptionally talented CEOs and their superhuman work ethic and skills For the average executive to have earned the equivalent of a worker s average annual salary by January is surely testament to an unimaginable amount of hard work and graft They must truly deserve the hike in their salaries since last year unlike millions of good for nothing slackers like nurses and teachers who have endured years of stagnating pay  It is worth taking a moment to absorb how great the gap now is between the worker and the boss Top executives now earn times more than the average worker in the ratio was The salary of the average FTSE chief executive is the same as that of Britons on minimum wage combined This in a country where workers have suffered the worst squeeze in wages for generations where most Britons languishing in poverty are actually in work where child poverty has increased at its fastest rate for three decades and where one in every people are classed as homeless or in inadequate homes It is not a trend restricted to Britain of course US top bosses earn times the average worker s wage 
JAN4	An invisible Irish border is crucial. That’s why we support the backstop	Life has become pretty normal for most people in Northern Ireland over the past years or so Like anyone else in the UK people go to jobs near to them or in the next town They go to doctors chemists and hospitals near to them They buy local fresh food They use trains buses and roads to get around  But if we in Britain get Brexit wrong our friends in Northern Ireland will find all of these things harder to do Why Because of the border with Ireland which is crossed million times a year as people on either side go about their daily lives 
JAN4	Cheap rail fares would mainly benefit the rich? That’s muddled thinking	One of the most depressing things about politics in the UK is realising how easy it is for total nonsense to become common sense and received wisdom  Take this tweet from YouGov following the recently announced rise in fares There will be calls for train fares to be frozen the main beneficiaries will be those in wealthier households of those who made more than train journeys last year are in households earning k Just are in households on less than k Most of the poor YouGov sagely intones take the car or bus or walk Therefore we should not lower the price because that means only rich people will benefit 
JAN4	Run, swim, cook: the new prescription for happiness	When Ella Risbridger was at her lowest ebb sitting with a psychiatrist trying to explain why she had wanted to throw herself under a bus help came from a wholly unexpected source Her mind was looking for a puzzle to occupy itself as she put it something to take her outside the horrible thoughts she was having And it settled most unexpectedly on baking  She came home from hospital and made a pie and from then on cooking became a sort of comfort and salvation For her the rhythmic and predictable act of making meals became a self soothing ritual a way not so much of curing her chronic anxiety as living through it Even the recipe that provided the title of her wholly unconventional cookbook Midnight Chicken came from an afternoon spent lying on the floor wondering if she would ever be able to get up 
JAN4	Women of colour fleeing violence need help – not penalties for who they are	Rotherham is a town now made infamous by grooming gangs and government agencies that assumed children as young as could consent to sex with men old enough to be their fathers Five minutes from a city centre that has perhaps seen better days sits the black and minority ethnic BME violence against women and girls VAWG charity Apna Haq Nestled behind a large mechanic s garage its location provides an apt visual metaphor Not unlike wild flowers that bloom by busy roadsides the charity exists and flourishes in spite of it all  Apna Haq which in Urdu means our right was set up in by manager Zlakha Ahmed Back then in her work as an English language tutor and then later as a youth worker Ahmed had come across countless beautiful intelligent women whose experiences of abuse and social isolation would stay with her In the end her frustration a word she uses frequently over men controlling women s behaviour kickstarted the charity Rooted in the community it exemplifies the importance of specialist organisations in the women s sector that cater for women from black and ethnic minority communities Yet just five years into Tory austerity Ahmed s year legacy was under threat after their contract to deliver domestic violence services was instead awarded to a generic provider 
JAN5	Brexiters ache to dish out a severe spanking, whether we like it or not	Wide eyed foreigners long ago concluded that masochism was le vice anglais Impressed by the volume of Victorian spanking pornography the Italian critic Mario Praz wrote in the s It seems to be an assured fact that sexual flagellation has been practised in England with greater frequency than elsewhere Or as a successful lawyer once declared on the theme Most people probably think S M spanking bondage whipping role play like doctors and nurses sheikhs and harems guards and prisoners is harmless and private and even funny  The late Christopher Hitchens who claimed with pride that Margaret Thatcher once smote me on the rear with a rolled up parliamentary order paper explained it thus There is almost no English surname however ancient and dignified that cannot be instantly improved by the prefix Spanker 
JAN5	Churchill and the film-maker: sadly, their dream of England persists	My older brother took me to see the original version of The Four Feathers when I was nine or He had seen it several times already had once sat through it twice when thanks to the principle of continuous performance it was possible to stay put in your seat and watch the programme all over again at no extra cost  Films about war weren t new to me The Four Feathers stood out on two counts Surprisingly given its date and in contrast to the usual British monochrome it was in Technicolor and the war it featured was older and more obscure than the familiar one which had ended in In it an army led by General Kitchener fought the Muslim revivalist leader the Mahdi and his followers in Sudan in the late s 
JAN5	Ruth Wilson’s gleeful villainy makes must-see TV of Luther	Is there a helpline for people disturbed out of doing everyday activities by Luther induced nightmares I only ask because I found myself alone on the top deck of the bus last week and instead of being grateful for that rare moment of feeling like a public transport VIP I wondered how likely it might be that a serial killer was waiting underneath the back seat ready to slither down the aisle and do me in  I ve had more are you watching it conversations about Luther s return than I have since Bodyguard was on It continues to amaze me that a show can be so duff in so many ways fundamentally nonsensical a plot entirely reliant on Luther having convenient sudden feelings about things and that grotesque dare you to flinch violence and yet it doesn t matter one bit because it s so entertaining that you barely have time to catch a breath 
JAN5	No-deal Brexit is like Dragons’ Den. No ferries, Chris? Sorry, I’m out	There s a certain type of movie character that finds time to suggest a shag even in the midst of a crisis If anything the fact the bomb clock is ticking or planetary destruction is pending gets them in the mood The Tories are like that but with backstabbing There are days until Brexit Theresa May s deal is about to get voted down heavily and bump the UK a few weeks closer to a calamitous no deal exit and the first thought of certain Tory leadership hopefuls is Ooh how can I do over the Saj  If you missed this latest flurry of displacement activity a report claimed the home secretary refers to himself in the third person during meetings According to what a source told the Sun and which Javid hotly denied He uses phrases like Just you watch what the Sajid is going to do about this or the Saj will sort that out Oof These drive bys made a charming companion piece to the articles suggesting that Javid was failing to get a grip on Britain s nonexistent migrant crisis and the very detailed articles about Javid s very luxurious South African holiday 
JAN5	Democrats are battling Trump. But on Brexit, Labour is tongue-tied	I m suffering from a bad case of opposition envy Perhaps you missed this only recently discovered malady among all the new year detox supplements and guides to a new you In which case let me fill you in  Spool back to the early summer of when twin horrors loomed on the horizon Brexit and Trump I imagined back then the devil offering progressive types one wish they could either have Britain stay in the European Union or see Donald Trump lose the US presidential election But they could not have both I wrote then that forced to make that diabolical choice I d opt for a remain victory in the referendum Though four years of Trump would be a nightmare Brexit would haunt us for generations 
JAN5	Yes to culture. But the whole nation needs a boost, not just our cities	Another year over a new one just begun sang one of Liverpool s great songsmiths And with each one that passes a new anniversary is formed Last year was significant for me as it was not just the th anniversary of Grange Hill but also the th anniversary of what will probably soon be known as the UK s one and only European capital of culture  This year will mark a decade since having seen the impact on Liverpool I suggested and began shepherding the UK city of culture project Last week the Labour MP Yvette Cooper suggested there should be a town of culture award to sit alongside it 
JAN5	Think Riyadh’s Netflix ban was bad? Imagine if Hasan Minhaj was a Saudi citizen	The government of Saudi Arabia makes it very clear that resistance to its regime is futile It will not tolerate dissent it is untouchable  The kingdom has never claimed to be a democracy or that it believed in free speech the right to protest or the right to collectively bargain for rights There is no independent press 
JAN5	Beware the clever lie of a 'clean break Brexit'	Some days it can be hard to believe but Brexit hasn t actually happened yet Until pm on March when we leave the EU without a deal enter into the transition period envisaged by Theresa May s withdrawal agreement or don t leave at all because the article period has been extended the fight over our future remains a battle of ideas  Such battles are won largely with words in the absence of facts on the ground we are swayed by assertions characterisations and attempts to define sorry Theresa often rather nebulous concepts 
JAN5	All aboard Chris Grayling’s Brexit pizza ferry – what could possibly go wrong?	We re about to give back control to a government that can t tell the difference between P O and Papa John s pizza I know you think that sounds good but one day you ll want insulin or a functioning health service rather than a pepperoni stuffed crust  In case you ve missed everything here s a quick recap In government members insisted that Brexit was easy and no deal was better than a bad deal After realising that was shite they discovered they had to do quite a lot of planning for no deal This left them in the awkward position of going back to a public they d just told that Brexit would improve their lives and assuring them there d be food 
JAN5	Fat Cat Friday should shatter the myth that Britain’s bosses deserve their pay	Please raise a glass if you re not doing Dry January of course to our nation s exceptionally talented CEOs and their superhuman work ethic and skills For the average executive to have earned the equivalent of a worker s average annual salary by January is surely testament to an unimaginable amount of hard work and graft They must truly deserve the hike in their salaries since last year unlike millions of good for nothing slackers like nurses and teachers who have endured years of stagnating pay  It is worth taking a moment to absorb how great the gap now is between the worker and the boss Top executives now earn times more than the average worker in the ratio was The salary of the average FTSE chief executive is the same as that of Britons on minimum wage combined This in a country where workers have suffered the worst squeeze in wages for generations where most Britons languishing in poverty are actually in work where child poverty has increased at its fastest rate for three decades and where one in every people are classed as homeless or in inadequate homes It is not a trend restricted to Britain of course US top bosses earn times the average worker s wage 
JAN6	Our uncivil war over Brexit was fuelled by deceit, not one oddball	Right on cue as the witching hour of Brexit closes in we are offered an opportunity to reflect on the forces that brought us to this state of national disarray and division One of the most eye catching things about James Graham s drama Brexit The Uncivil War screened on Channel tomorrow evening is that David Cameron proved too dull to make the final draft The author of this whole catastrophe the man who in the interests of party management put the referendum commitment into the manifesto and as prime minister made it happen is thus reduced to the status of Gavrilo Princip the assassin who unwittingly triggered the first world war  James Graham s genius is for poking about in the stomach of the beast
JAN6	Will it be a black woman who turfs Trump out of the White House?	Life as Donald Trump has known it for the last two years has just changed forever Quagmired in a government shutdown of his own making Trump s ability to manipulate his world is already severely constrained in this very new year The more he struggles against his new surroundings the more he sinks  Last week the president could only watch his beloved cable news channels as a bystander to the biggest tectonic shifts as the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first candidate to officially emerge to run against him next year And it won t be long before the House launches several investigations into corruption and incompetence while the Mueller investigation continues to tighten several nooses around all things Trumpian 
JAN6	‘Managed no deal’? That’s just more Brexit snake oil	Here we go again As we return haggard and hungover from the Christmas break the Brexit deal is heading back to parliament And presumably the debate will also continue where it left off Prepare for a succession of Brexiteers touting the idea of a managed no deal as an appealing alternative to either the deal on offer or the prospect of a no deal outcome They re wrong  It s worth tracing the logic deployed by proponents of this approach because it has gone through three distinct stages 
JAN6	Our out-of-step press demonises desperate refugees	Where is our humanity More to the point where is the compassion that should inform the editorial agendas of our major news outlets  For the past couple of weeks in a period we like to call the season of goodwill Britain s newspapers and broadcasters have been reporting the arrival of desperate men and women on our shores as if they are criminals unworthy of charity or understanding 
JAN6	I dislike the link to empire, but it felt wrong to turn down an OBE	Very occasionally I wish I was French The fantasy usually materialises just after a holiday when I dream of living by the warmth of the Mediterranean or after a trip to Paris during which I indulge fantasies of being a Left Bank cafe bohemian  Such daydreams evaporate when I remember that my French is sub GCSE standard that as a strict vegetarian I am routinely the target of tutting derision by French waiters and that even the faintest waft of Gauloise smoke leaves me fumbling for my asthma inhaler But at the end of last year I stumbled upon a new reason to indulge this fantasy 
JAN6	To stop Brexit, Labour supporters will have to revolt against their leader	Since nearly all of his career has been spent in rebellion against his own party I guess we should not be too surprised that Jeremy Corbyn seems so determined to defy it over Brexit Labour members hate Brexit and they want it reversed With parliament deadlocked and growing public support for taking the question back to the people a large majority of Labour voters and an even larger majority of Labour members wants the party to throw its weight behind another referendum Compare and contrast with a Labour leader who doesn t hate Brexit doesn t want it to be reversed and will not help facilitate another referendum if he can possibly avoid it  That divide between leader and members has been pretty obvious for a long time to anyone who contemplated Mr Corbyn with clear eyes rather than wearing soft focus lenses The split has become more evident as the Labour frontbench has run through various tactical ruses to try to mask the tension between its members and its leader He is what he is and that is a lifetime opponent of the EU He has not once expressed a flicker of remorse about the result of the referendum and treats the momentum behind a second referendum not as an opportunity to be seized but as a threat to be smothered 
JAN6	Power politics always drives space conquest. China’s coup is no different	Nasa rejected it as too difficult and costly an undertaking Last week China declared mission accomplished after landing a spacecraft Chang e on the far side of the moon  It was a remarkable endeavour As the far side of the moon never faces the Earth mission control cannot communicate directly with the spacecraft but only via an orbiting satellite The terrain is more broken and cratered than the near side so landing a craft is that much more difficult Even Nasa was impressed a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment the administrator tweeted 
JAN6	This is the Nancy Pelosi moment and Donald Trump should be very afraid	The Trump White House has frequently been called chaotic wild undisciplined disorderly But a better word might be unruly because if there s one thing Donald Trump can t abide it s rules Not only has the Trump administration signally failed to follow the rules it s not clear it ever bothered to learn them But as the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives last week that abruptly changed Trump is about to get schooled in the rules of the game  For two years thanks to a Republican Congress that chose not to honor its constitutional duty to maintain oversight of the executive branch the American political drama has centred on special counsel s Robert Mueller s investigation But that focus is about to widen as Nancy Pelosi the once and future Speaker of the House reclaimed the gavel promising to show Americans its power the picture of her smiling as she wielded it went viral for good reason 
JAN6	Brexiters ache to dish out a severe spanking, whether we like it or not	Wide eyed foreigners long ago concluded that masochism was le vice anglais Impressed by the volume of Victorian spanking pornography the Italian critic Mario Praz wrote in the s It seems to be an assured fact that sexual flagellation has been practised in England with greater frequency than elsewhere Or as a successful lawyer once declared on the theme Most people probably think S M spanking bondage whipping role play like doctors and nurses sheikhs and harems guards and prisoners is harmless and private and even funny  The late Christopher Hitchens who claimed with pride that Margaret Thatcher once smote me on the rear with a rolled up parliamentary order paper explained it thus There is almost no English surname however ancient and dignified that cannot be instantly improved by the prefix Spanker 
JAN6	Keeping up with the Kardashians means paying other women to have your babies	Behold the handmaid of the Kardashians Or at least that of Kim the celebrity and Kanye artist and Trump loyalist The couple have just announced the commissioning of their fourth child using the womb of a gestational carrier who will since this is the US be paid for the rental  In details shared after their previous carrier delivered last year Kim Kardashian explained to her millions of fans that she was the first person to have skin on skin contact with her baby and that the experience from carrier vetting to the carrier s organic diet to delivery had gone so brilliantly she would recommend surrogacy to anybody presumably as the purchaser rather than the provider One of the few problems was remembering she was having a baby I m totally gonna forget and then a month before I m gonna be like holy shit we need to get a nursery For the surrogacy industry then this ongoing Kimye promotion may be the most valuable publicity since Elton John and his partner acquired two delightful sons via a similar route far more so in fact since Kardashian though it could be risky for her to give birth again at least had the not entirely tragic alternative to gestational assistance of remaining a mother of two healthy children Conventionally the attribution of desperation to infertile or gay would be parents has been critical in eclipsing the other sorts of desperation that might make impoverished Indian Greek or Ukrainian women consider becoming incubators for rich couples they are unlikely post baby handover to see again 
JAN7	Ten years after the first war on Gaza, Israel still plans endless brute force	This month marks the th anniversary of the first major military assault on the million Palestinians of the Gaza Strip After its unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in Israel turned the area into the biggest open door prison on Earth The two hallmarks of Israel s treatment of Gaza since then have been mendacity and the utmost brutality towards civilians  On December Israel launched Operation Cast Lead pounding the densely populated strip from the air sea and land for days It was not a war or even asymmetric warfare but a one sided massacre Israel had dead the Gazans had dead including children and more than wounded According to one estimate of the casualties were civilians Israel claimed to be acting in self defence protecting its civilians against Hamas rocket attacks The evidence however points to a deliberate and punitive war of aggression Israel had a diplomatic alternative but it chose to ignore it and to resort to brute military force 
JAN7	At the heart of this NHS cash boost lies a dishonesty: tax	Something about a big government launch in January invites suspicion It feels like one of those doomed new year resolutions that is all optimistic intent and no staying power It smacks of a prime minister desperate to turn over a new leaf yet fated to relapse into bad old habits  Theresa May wants the new political season to kick off with a conversation about the NHS She visited a children s hospital in Liverpool bearing a long term plan and a suitcase full of Treasury cash 
JAN7	A no-deal Brexit would be disastrous. My amendment will help prevent it	Just because most people don t want something to happen doesn t mean it won t So it is with a no deal Brexit I believe the majority of MPs ministers and most people across the UK are opposed to the self inflicted damage to our economy and security that would result from crashing out of the EU But there are just days left and there is a growing danger that a combination of brinkmanship political paralysis siren voices and drift will push us over the cliff edge  This is too serious for parliament to stand by That is why I have tabled an amendment to the finance bill with a group of other cross party committee chairs to put safeguards in place against no deal 
JAN7	Britain is crippled by record personal debt while the Tories boast of a boom	With a government torn apart by Brexit and a country falling to pieces because of that government Conservative MPs have a fallback they sometimes like to use as proof of their success the UK has record employment levels It s a proud badge of honour they wear fetishising work it doesn t matter what that work looks like or how much it pays because it s supposedly a sign that the economy is doing well The thing is people might be in work but they re also in debt  Britain s household debt has reached a new high According to the TUC UK households now owe an average of to credit card firms banks and other lenders There might be some quibbling over what s included in these figures Unlike the Bank of England in its calculations the TUC includes increasingly exorbitant student loans which have eye wateringly high interest rates But even if we were to take those out of the equation leaving debt at half that estimated by the TUC the level of debt the nature of that borrowing and why it s being accrued spells trouble In academic Johnna Montgomerie called it one of the biggest problems facing the United Kingdom s economy and society 
JAN7	No more tribal politics: MPs must be allowed a free vote on Brexit	Has anything changed over the holiday Yes March is two weeks nearer Like the imminence of death it concentrates the mind  Parliament now moves into that darkly hallowed chamber known as the short term its walls moving ever inwards A few things are clearer One is that Theresa May has the best deal on offer Another is that only a sizeable handful of Tory last ditchers and industrial anarchists believes a no deal Brexit is in the nation s interest Yes it may have been overlaid with hysteria understandably in the case of farmers But it does not add up 
JAN7	Caroline Lucas is wrong – a meat tax would only hurt the poor	Caroline Lucas called for a meat tax last week something the environment secretary Michael Gove has suggested is the worst example of a nanny state He is wrong The idea isn t authoritarian it s regressive Like other proposals to impose taxes on dangerous products to save people from themselves it is well intentioned But the inevitable consequence is that poor people will suffer  This is by no means an argument that meat is good for people or even necessarily cheaper Red meat is associated with a host of health issues such as heart disease cancer and diabetes and chefs such as Jack Monroe have shown how people can eat healthy vegan meals on a tight budget But to incentivise behaviour by making things more expensive is to say that the rich can do whatever they please while the poor should go without The weight of environmentally conscious decisions falls on those who can t afford to pay rather than on society as a whole It s reverting to th century rules the poor can eat beans while the rich eat meat Choice becomes something only the rich deserve 
JAN7	There is no leftwing justification for Brexit. We must fight it to the last	Perhaps the only success of David Cameron s reckless EU referendum gamble was that it took the Tories toxic split on Europe and shared it with the rest of the country At least they are no longer the laughing stock now we all are  Yet among the cluster of possible solutions around Norway this or Canada that or a customs union of sorts the danger remains that the bigger picture is being missed the political effect of Brexit on the UK and our foreign relations Brexit is one part of a project to reshape the politics of the west and set it in concrete And too many on the left are happy to sleepwalk into that oblivion 
JAN7	A message to the mob: behave on social media as you would in real life	I love social media I really do I relish any opportunity to interact with people I may never meet in person strangers with similar interests Sadly I am usually boring sharing articles posting about social issues art occasionally music and increasingly ornithology I have relatively few followers and do not actively seek more by being self consciously witty I follow only those I know or find interesting If I consider someone to be a septic pustule Donald Trump for example why would I follow them when I would walk away if they joined my mates in a pub I ve made friends have even met some in person social media has provided an overwhelmingly positive experience  Recently however that changed An article I had written went live at pm By pm I realised a storm was brewing Notified by Twitter which mercifully and to my surprise did a great job I applied all suggested filters locking my account just in time to shield myself from the worst of the personal and spiteful abuse Even so still I felt isolated as if I was buried beneath a pile of manure It was intimidating when men yes it was mostly men with few friends but a keen interest in wrestling requested to follow me 
JAN7	Together we can thwart the big-tech data grab. Here’s how	Our family got a Google Home Hub for Christmas As comparative lifestyle Neanderthals we have so far only used it as a glorified digital picture frame and music player though this is clearly not what it was built for Say Hey Google tell it what you want and a whole universe of entertainment advice and help can be supplied up to and including instant control of internet connected doorbells thermostats and more  Contrary to their branding as assistants the primary purpose of these devices is not to devotedly help the people who use them At the risk of stating the blindingly obvious once we have paid for the hardware we get the services they can deliver largely for free in return for limitless access to the small details of our lives Big tech is therefore able to carry on making advertising more and more precisely targeted and vastly increase the mountains of data that power its development of artificial intelligence Smartphones tablets and computers have been helpful but evidently not helpful enough Build data gathering machines into the domestic sphere and you break open whole streams of personal information 
JAN7	Detained at US immigration, I felt frightened. And very lucky	I flew back to the US from London last week and after waiting for two hours at immigration I stood by as the officer frowned at my documents My children s US passports had been scanned without a problem But looking at my green card the officer asked Was this lost or stolen in the last year As it happens it was Then I m sorry he said glancing down at my three year olds After a seven hour flight and all that waiting in line they were doing breaststroke across the JFK floor You ll have to step this way  I have heard about the Congratulations You Have Problems With Your Paperwork room at JFK but until that moment had never actually seen it It is a small windowless room dominated by a raised bank of desks behind which six or so officers sit with several more patrolling the room No cellphones snapped a woman as I knelt on the floor restraining a child with one hand while trying to text the cab driver waiting for us outside with the other 
JAN8	The Guardian view on Brexit: the government has failed – it’s time to go back to the people	Next week the House of Commons will take what is probably the most consequential vote of our era Unless the government again gets cold feet key aspects of this country s economic model social cohesion and international future will be shaped in the so called meaningful vote over Theresa May s Brexit deal It will define what Britain is more than any other political event in modern times It poses questions and choices that cannot be shirked  This newspaper supported Britain s entry into the European Community in the s We opposed Britain s departure from the European Union in We took these positions on the basis of the same long term principles Britain is a European nation by virtue of its geography and history It shares enduring economic and cultural ties and values with the rest of Europe Above all Britain has a direct interest born from the suffering of our peoples in decades of war in the peace and harmony of Europe from which all can prosper In the era of Donald Trump and Xi Jinping Britain s engagement in Europe is freshly urgent 
JAN8	The murder of my wife, Jo Cox, is being used to cow MPs. That’s not her legacy	I ve spent the past few weeks desperately sorting hundreds of pictures of Jo to archive print off and put in albums My objective was to have finished the project by the new year so that the kids have access to as many pictures of their mum as they want playing with them dashing around on the campaign trail on holiday together  Having spent way too long looking at pictures of her in the past few weeks the thing that comes out in almost every photo is her spirit of generosity and kindness Her smile is unmissable and unforgettable even in the face of awful weather precipitous rock climbs or on tough days We miss her energy and positivity in our lives as much as anything 
JAN8	To accept an OBE is to condone the brutality of empire	Acentury ago the eminent Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore returned his knighthood to the viceroy of India The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in their incongruous context of humiliation Tagore wrote in outrage as scores of peaceful protesters were massacred in Jallianwala Bagh He would now stand shorn of all special distinctions by the side of my countrymen  In accepting the knighthood Tagore had been unfairly accused of being a colonial flunkey partly because he had expressed justifiable reservations about aspects of Indian nationalism The atrocities in Amritsar jolted the Nobel laureate into accepting that that his Knight Commander of the British Empire the KBE still in use today could not be treated as unconnected to the bloodied realities of that empire s operations 
JAN8	Vote Leave relied on racism. Brexit: The Uncivil War disguised that ugly truth	At the beginning of Channel s drama Brexit The Uncivil War the ex Tory Ukip MP Douglas Carswell tells Matthew Elliott and Dominic Cummings newly appointed to run Vote Leave that they will offer a respectable alternative to the rightwing thugs Nigel Farage and Arron Banks Cummings the strategist and anti hero of this semi biopic soon returns to the theme the Conservative led and soon to be officially recognised campaign needs to be respectable appealing beyond Ukip s base if it is to win plus one and the referendum Elliott drums the point home We need to get them Farage and Banks Leave EU to do the heavy lifting on the migration stuff then we keep our hands clean  However Cummings has a problem The EU s supranational institutions demonised by Brexiters are too complicated too remote to be the focus of the campaign It needs a simple message repeated over and over and over if it is to appeal to the three million extra voters that the other side have no idea exist who Cummings new friend Zack Massingham of the shadowy AggregateIQ promises can tip Vote Leave over the line 
JAN8	Are the men in the news adults – or attention-seeking five-year-olds?	This could just be me showing my age but watching the news at the moment is like tuning in to a particularly fraught episode of The Secret Life of Year Olds One little boy is feeling ignored by a girl he likes so he s pulling her hair and telling her that he wouldn t be her friend anyway because he s found out that she s going to be six in a minute Another can t get the attention of the teacher by being a good boy so instead he is loudly spitting out his dinner under his desk One of the older boys has noticed that the younger kids get more attention so he s regressing to baby talk and throwing all the toys out of a pram Meanwhile over by the Wendy house a group of bullies is chasing after a little bossy girl and shouting in her ear that she is a big bum face Oh for sensible Dr Laverne Antrobus to appear in a secret viewing room and explain that this is a crucial but brief period of radical attention seeking and it will all be OK again once the children have had a good night s sleep and a cuddle  In the grownup world however attention seeking behaviour is increasingly hard to ignore This week a year old French author hardly anybody had heard of decided to rattle a few cages by announcing that he just can t fancy a woman his own age French feminists threw up their hands in horror one of them publishing a photo of a year old derriere on Instagram which only seemed likely to reward his silliness Fortunately the British media and anyone who has ever using a dating website in the st century just rolled their eyes and turned to the next story elderly bear shits in woods see photos pages 
JAN8	This radical plan could be the way to get social housing back on track	Home should be a sanctuary Warm and safe it is a place where a door can be firmly closed on the trials threats and stresses of the outside world A place you can rest and enjoy your leisure time  For as long as there have been people they have needed homes In Abraham Maslow s hierarchy of needs warmth and rest sit alongside food and water at the base of the pyramid In his theory only when those basic needs are met can we concern ourselves with higher goals 
JAN8	It’s time for May to pull the emergency brake and extend article 50	In a jam like this when parliamentary discipline has broken down No has two last ditch tactics up its sleeve The first is to try to pull off the psychological trick of persuading MPs that the mood is changing and that they had better fall in line before they miss the bus The second is to blackmail them by painting a picture of how awful the alternative to the prime minister s deal is underlining that the responsibility for the ensuing chaos will lie with MPs who vote against her  Unfortunately for Theresa May neither of these ruses is likely to work this time No has been briefing since before Christmas that it is making progress with the European Union on the backstop and will soon be able to unveil changes that will make the plan acceptable to the rebels Downing St also says it is in talks with the Democratic Unionist party and if the DUP changes position on her deal so will most pro Brexit Tory rebels This is either whistling in the wind or more likely deliberately misleading 
JAN8	The sexism in surgery is shocking – from 'banter' to discrimination	In of people applying to medicine and dentistry courses were women However according to the Royal College of Surgeons of England only about of consultant surgeons in were women Why A small survey in the BMJ medical journal points to the level of discrimination As a general surgical trainee I have been shocked by the experiences reported by some female colleagues The discrepancy in the number of women applying to medicine and those going on to become consultant surgeons can partly be explained by the higher dropout rate Could inherent gender discrimination within surgery itself play a part in that  Female colleagues with children have struggled to be accepted and are seen as less than full time surgeons despite working similar hours in hospital to those surgeons with part time hospital and research commitments A female surgeon returning from maternity leave didn t dare tell colleagues that she had a month old baby at home fearing that she would be viewed as lacking commitment to speciality Female surgeons are continually asked about their family plans I was even asked at an international conference if colorectal surgery would be the correct career path if I plan to have children These aren t challenges that are unique to surgery or to women with more men taking longer paternity leave yet the stigma seems more entrenched in surgery than other specialities 
JAN8	Theresa May is taking us to the no-deal cliff but won’t march us over	They re back but nothing has changed so happy Groundhog Day Ahead lies more perpetual Brexit hell so get used to it Don t imagine the next fortnight of high parliamentary drama will lead to an ending where we can all return to politics as usual This won t end with the January vote on the prime minister s deal nor with reprised attempts to revive it soon after It won t end by the supposed January deadline either nor will it all be over on March exit day Barring extraordinary and dangerous shocks yes dreadful things are possible Brexitry will go on and on for the foreseeable future Awful prospect Yes but all alternatives are frighteningly worse than extending the process as we back off the precipice  For now this push me pull you directionless government is leading us to the very edge They want us to take a good look at the no deal Tarpeian rock below which we will be dashed to pieces by the likes of Boris Johnson who on Monday ditched his old Canada deal to back a naked no deal as soon as he saw the Tory membership swing that way 
JAN8	Carcinogens in your cosmetics? Welcome to Brexit Britain	How would you feel about putting a lovely dollop of formaldehyde on your nails No Well perhaps I could interest you in a sprinkling of asbestos for your skin Hmm tricky customer eh OK surely you couldn t object to some coal tar on your eyelids to really make them pop Oh come on who wouldn t risk a little light cancer for a really banging shade of eyeshadow You wouldn t Too bad In our brave new Brexit world where EU legislation is no longer in force and we are forced to accept trade deals on Trump s terms expect all these known carcinogens and more to be appearing on a beauty shelf near you  Since UK consumers have been protected by the EU s precautionary principle Essentially the EU doesn t think that chemicals that have been linked to cancer and birth defects belong in cosmetics and so they are banned from use in consumer products And who could argue with that 
JAN9	This was the great political power struggle of our times – and ministers lost	John Bercow can sometimes seem to be auditioning to play Shakespeare s Malvolio The House of Commons Speaker has at times a comic degree of self esteem that is the equal of the arrogant steward in Twelfth Night Like Malvolio Bercow can also drive colleagues to distraction as he did today Today though Bercow took a brave stand to empower Britain s parliament against Britain s government on Brexit And that qualifies him to be considered the most radical holder of his office in generations Like Malvolio a version of greatness has been thrust upon him  The vast majority of people are understandably not well versed in Commons procedure So it may seem strange to claim that a decision to allow an amendment to be moved on a Commons timetable motion and with no debate is in any way immense Nevertheless Bercow s decision to allow the all party effort led by the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve to tie the government s hands it must come back with a plan B within three days if the Brexit deal is defeated next week deserves such accolades 
JAN9	Trump’s border wall address was so lame, was it in fact a distraction?	Donald Trump is a master at manufacturing faux crises He is not a master at faking humanitarian concern  He thought that speaking from the Oval Office and sitting behind the Resolute desk would help him invoke a grave national crisis It s the setting that JFK used to tell the country about life threatening Cuban missiles It s where George W Bush tried to calm the country after 
JAN9	Never mind her politics, Kate Bush’s music speaks for itself	What does a Tory look like Do they automatically come attired in Charles Tyrwhitt shirts and Barbour jackets and have naturally booming voices Does membership of the Conservative party automatically make you a subscriber to Horse Hound magazine Clearly such assumptions are ludicrous but there is a sense among some music fans that Tory loving pop stars should identify themselves a badge perhaps or a special hat in order that we may judge their acceptability  This certainly would have prevented a world of grief for Kate Bush who has just ended two years on the naughty step when she released a statement clarifying her political views In an interview with the Canadian magazine Maclean s in Bush was reported as having expressed support for the new British prime minister Theresa May prompting a fit of the vapours among her admirers Taken in context the meaning of Bush s quotes was obvious During a discussion about Hillary Clinton and the fear of women s power she voiced enthusiasm for having a woman in charge But nuance rarely being a characteristic of st century discourse this was lost in translation and our Kate was branded a Tory More heartache ensued in the flurry of press around the release of her remastered back catalogue and a book of lyrics late in prompting finally clarification on her website 
JAN9	When free societies copy Russian media tactics, there’s only one winner	How do you respond when a principle that forms part of the bedrock of your society is used to undermine it  This is the question facing liberal democracies across the world as Russia and others exploit free speech and its institutions especially traditional and social media through misinformation and electoral interference 
JAN9	Want to stop prisoners reoffending? Start by allowing phones and photos	These are dark days in a country torn by Brexit and years of austerity which have widened the gap between rich and poor  And few places are as gloomy as the prison system where shocking levels of violence and drug abuse mean there is little in the way of positivity for those tasked with inspecting the penal estate 
JAN9	Surviving R Kelly is a watershed moment for women of colour	It s been several days since the Surviving R Kelly docuseries began on January reaching a channel record of million viewers and the hashtag is still trending Conversations and debates about Lifetime s intense six part series are still evolving as people digest the stories shared by Kelly s survivors And on Tuesday news broke that investigators are looking into allegations in both Chicago and Atlanta as a result of the series  One could assume that the reason for the series success is a combination of good promotion curiosity outrage and excitement But for many women particularly black and brown women who have experienced sexual violence I believe the premiere was both a long awaited public moment of vindication for those Kelly has allegedly hurt and for those fighting to hold him accountable and a sign of the ever growing resistance against him and others who inflict this kind of harm of women and girls in our communities 
JAN9	The botched Alex Salmond harassment inquiry could stop women speaking out	You would assume that civil servants faced with allegations of sexual assault by a former first minister of Scotland would proceed with the utmost caution that they would fireproof themselves against a future appeal by making sure the procedure used to investigate those allegations was robust and that it was followed to the letter With the MeToo campaign in the headlines and a report suggesting that despite its conceit of itself as family friendly Holyrood has the same level of sexual harassment as Westminster the stakes surrounding the inquiry into Alex Salmond s alleged behaviour towards two female members of staff in could scarcely have been higher  Knowing the former SNP leader would pore over every detail as he had every right to do they owed it to the women involved to ensure their handling of the complaints was beyond reproach Instead it emerged at Salmond s judicial review one aspect of the process was so flawed as to invalidate the entire investigation 
JAN9	Brexit proved our economy is broken, but our leaders still have no clue how to fix it	Just after midnight on May a senior staffer in the remain campaign sent colleagues an urgent message Voters are very sceptical about our warnings on the economy began his email They don t trust the numbers They don t trust the Treasury As head of strategy for Britain Stronger in Europe Ryan Coetzee had bombarded Britons with evidence of the economic damage they would do to themselves if they didn t stay in the EU He and his team enlisted the Bank of England the IMF the OECD and pretty much every acronym that mattered They d wagged fingers flung numbers around and pointed out the danger signs  From David Cameron down leading remainers considered the economy their trump card In the biggest single choice Britain had had to make for four decades they were sure economics would be the deciding factor But with less than a month to go before the vote seasoned operative Coetzee could see the strategy was failing Why just a few days earlier George Osborne had produced Treasury analysis that Brexit would send house prices plunging by as much as and BBC journalists reported being deluged with calls from would be buyers asking where they could sign up 
JAN9	I was harassed outside parliament. These thugs must not stifle Brexit debate	The Brexit result split those who support it The darker politics that was mixed in with the mainstream leave vote no longer feels the need to hide On Monday Anna Soubry Owen Jones and I were confronted by it But those who verbally attacked and physically harassed us do not speak for ordinary leave voters or the disadvantaged They have nothing to do with the pro Brexit protesters with whom I respectfully disagree  I ve encountered them before talking to people around the country is what I do I ve engaged with them at People s Vote marches in Sunderland and outside parliament I even attended a rally led by the English Defence League s so called Tommy Robinson A figure close to Robinson admitted to me believing I was pro Brexit that they knew Brexit would make the country poorer Knowingly going ahead with a policy that leaves desperately squeezed people even worse off is a betrayal of those they claim to represent 
JAN9	Britain must rid itself of the delusion that it is big, bold and in charge	 Being powerful Margaret Thatcher once said is like being a lady If you have to tell people you are you aren t It s a lesson that could usefully be learned by Gavin Williamson the elfin defence secretary who longs to inherit her job  Like a one man military band Williamson spent the Christmas period blowing the trumpet twirling the baton and banging the drum for Brexit Britain Leaving the EU he told the Daily Telegraph would restore Britain as a truly global player determined once again to play the role on the world stage that the world expects us to play Post Brexit Australia Canada New Zealand Caribbean countries and nations right across Africa would look to us to provide the moral leadership the military leadership and the global leadership of which they had been too long deprived 
JAN10	Trump and the Brexiters must own the mess they lied us into	Three years ago shortly after I arrived back in Britain after years in the US my gas meter was stolen When the new one arrived it bore a note insisting that it should not be stolen It reminded me of the poster in the window of the Boys and Girls club at the top of my street in Chicago that read Stop killing people Some things should not need to be said  So it was on Wednesday as MPs passed an amendment demanding the government come back with a plan B within three days if the Brexit deal is defeated next Tuesday The real scandal was not that the Speaker John Bercow had to creatively interpret parliamentary rules so that the vote could take place but that the vote was necessary at all Plan A isn t up to much It was withdrawn last month at the th hour because it was clearly going to be voted down Nothing has changed It will almost certainly be rejected next week Time is running out We have no hat and the EU wouldn t lend us a rabbit to pull out of it even if we did Under these circumstances the government shouldn t be forced to come back with a plan B in a timely fashion When it comes to backups they should be well down the alphabet by now 
JAN10	Cutting tuition fees will turn universities into vassals of the state	Meanwhile back at the ranch or in this case the campus the mice are running riot Ignored by Brexit Britain s universities are facing financial meltdown I predict that within a decade they will become institutions wholly owned by the state their academic autonomy unrecognisable  A few weeks ago three universities were reported to be on the brink of bankruptcy University debt has soared by bn in the past decade Cardiff has borrowed m over years with experts suggesting it would take years to repay if its current surplus does not improve The backing for these loans is supposedly the ballooning scale of student fees which David Cameron almost tripled to in in England and the removal of the cap on student numbers Fees rather than grants now comprise the vast bulk of all university income for teaching undergraduates 
JAN10	London’s gangs have changed, and it’s driving a surge in pitiless violence	The murder of year old Jayden Moodie on Tuesday night highlights how youth violence continues to devastate the lives of young people families and communities in London Jayden s death marks a new low point as he is the youngest victim to die on London s streets so far this year  We don t know whether Jayden was himself involved in gangs or if his death was gang related All we know is that he was struck by a vehicle while riding a moped then chased by a group of three men and stabbed to death in what police believe was a targeted attack However Jayden was killed in Leyton part of the east London borough of Waltham Forest where the threat of gangs and gang violence looms large 
JAN10	‘Do I look pretty?’ is my daughters’ favourite question and it’s worrying me	As I do most years I watched the Golden Globes red carpet show last week I like red carpet shows Among other things I like the parade of pretty frocks and the awkwardness of one group of adults milling around shouting the names of another group of adults nearby This year however the entertainment was impaired by the sense that as the parenting manuals like to say I was showcasing bad behaviour for my daughters Along with can I have a treat and when is it going to be my birthday the question do I look pretty now comes up regularly in my house and the attraction of the rote answer yes has started to pall  I can t put all the blame on the Disney princesses although God knows they don t help The present generation of animated heroines have been given feisty attitudes and desires beyond marriage but with the exception of Moana they still have tiny waists tinier noses and in the case of Elsa from Frozen an amazing Dolly Parton chest that busts out at the climax of Let It Go to the ongoing amazement of her four year old fans 
JAN10	An election would be a headache for Labour – and all-out war for the Tories	Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election in a speech in Wakefield on Thursday morning That s what oppositions do so what s new The government s essential all consuming defining policy of our era is about to be voted down in parliament The shadow of the loss of Jaguar Land Rover jobs sharpens the immediacy of the nightmare with Brexit said to be partly to blame As Corbyn declared A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all  That used to mean a government fell and a prime minister resigned with an election inevitable No longer Instead here is a government with no majority surviving only on bungs to a handful of unionist extremists who don t represent remain voting Northern Ireland Even then it still loses vote after humiliating vote with no intention of resigning in the honourable old fashioned way If John Bercow this morning called speaker of the devil by the Sun is stretching the rules he is only responding to this extraordinary constitutional crisis The spirit of his role is to stand up for parliament as this majority less government makes serial attempts to deny MPs any say 
JAN10	Ocasio-Cortez has shown ‘shameless’ women are a powerful force	Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has feet And she washes sometimes In order to do this she takes off her clothes the brazen hussy I presume this to be the case although the picture of feet in the bath that the Daily Caller published seems to have been falsely ascribed to her Experts have been brought in to analyse the length of the toes in the image because this is clearly the biggest issue in America right now  This quite insane attempt to shame her is so bizarre after the video of her dancing on a rooftop at college backfired and she responded by dancing into her congressional office She is more popular than ever She excites the left because of her youth her passion and her politics She excites the right because she has a body and God knows she may even enjoy that fact This must be highlighted as sinful over and over again 
JAN10	By mollycoddling our children, we're fuelling mental illness in teenagers	We talk incessantly about how to make children more resilient but whatever we re doing it s not working Rates of anxiety disorders and depression are rising rapidly among teenagers and in the US universities can t hire therapists fast enough to keep up with the demand What are we doing wrong  Nassim Taleb invented the word antifragile and used it in his book by the same name to describe a small but very important class of systems that gain from shocks challenges and disorder Bones and the banking system are two examples both get weaker and more prone to catastrophic failure if they go for a long time without any stressors and then face a major challenge The immune system is an even better example it requires exposure to certain kinds of germs and potential allergens in childhood in order to develop to its full capacity Parents who treat their children as if they are fragile for example by keeping them away from dirt and potential allergens such as peanuts are depriving their children s immature immune systems of the learning experiences those systems need to develop their maximum protective capacity 
JAN10	Why your chicken wings mean we’ve entered a new epoch	Have you ever thought much about the bones that remain littered in front of you after finishing a plate of chicken wings New research suggests that Gallus gallus domesticus the modern factory farmed chicken might not be just a Sunday lunch staple but instead a marker of a new age in Earth s history  The or so years following the last major ice age are collectively called the Holocene a geological chapter in earth s biography that includes the development of all human civilization Some experts argue that humans have fundamentally altered the earth s biosphere to the point where we now live in a new age called the Anthropocene an amalgamation of the Greek words for new and human Copernicus was wrong the earth doesn t revolve around the sun anymore It revolves around us 
JAN10	Social care is ageist – and the new NHS plan doesn’t even try to fix it	 We are taking a big step to secure the future of the NHS for our children and their children Theresa May told an audience in Liverpool on Monday as she launched the NHS year plan May s emphasis on generations of NHS users may be cliched political rhetoric the children as they say are our future but by pitching public services as a deal between the generations she quite unintentionally landed on something important  This country s health and care system is currently riddled with a damaging generational divide one that manifests itself in anything from a deficit in joined up services to outright bad feeling 
JAN10	It’s not perfect, but Norway plus may be Labour’s least worst option	There are no good options for Labour on Brexit Accepting this fact is both depressing and liberating Being on the left is supposed to be about unbounded optimism a belief that what is deemed politically impossible by the sensible grownups of politics can be realised with sufficient imagination and determination But recognising that there is no magic button that will end the Brexit debate is to be freed of the stress of searching for the impossible  Supporters of every position on Brexit should be honest about the downsides of their chosen strategies Labour s priority is rightly a general election When Theresa May declared from a Downing Street podium that she was seeking to dissolve parliament in April she wanted to make the election entirely about Brexit Labour did not allow her to do so shifting the conversation on to domestic issues where it was strong from hiking taxes on the rich to investing in public services to public ownership issues that unite remainers and leavers Even though voters have priorities other than Brexit such as stagnating wages housing and the NHS repeating the strategy this time would be far more challenging to put it mildly Labour s electoral coalition which encompasses both pro remain Kensington and pro leave Ashfield will be placed under severe strain The fact that Brexit dominates political debate is bad for Labour because it suppresses its anti establishment politics its leading figures are left looking like triangulating politicians the same as the all the rest 
JAN11	Brexit disaster looms. Can MPs unite quickly enough to save us?	The iceberg is approaching and now the scramble for the lifeboats begins The iceberg in question is the catastrophe of a no deal crashout from the European Union its contours and texture becoming ever sharper as March gets closer For now most MPs are vehement in their insistence that they dislike the iceberg very much and that they are passionately opposed to sailing right into it But the law is clear Britain leaves the EU on that date unless another law is passed to change course In other words standing on the deck shouting at the berg will not help MPs have to agree a plan to get out of the way and they have to do it very soon  Here s how fast things are moving On Tuesday night Theresa May will watch as her deal sinks in the Commons It might not take the battering predicted by BBC News which projects a defeat by more than votes Indeed it might end up being much narrower That s thanks to an amendment tabled by Labour s Hilary Benn which will give MPs the chance simultaneously to reject both May s deal and a no deal Jacob Rees Mogg s crowd won t want to do that they think a collision with the iceberg will be bracing shake things up a bit so May might suffer a milder humiliation than was otherwise looming 
JAN11	Even Mordor was less toxic than Brexit Britain, this nation beyond parody	Well there you are then Another epic political week has passed in off brand Westeros a septic isle from which there is no real escape only a bloodstained booth where Chris Grayling is offering to sell you a ferry ticket  Every few days I change my mind about what I d pop in the time capsule to explain to future generations just how inspirational this era was This week though the choice could only be Wednesday s parliamentary exchange between House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and Tory MP Adam Holloway which I have lightly edited for space reasons 
JAN11	Theresa May is about to find out that Brexit is bigger than her	Whatever else happens with Brexit no one in British politics will ever again underestimate the power of a timetable The pressure of the article clock ticking down forced Theresa May into the compromises that make her deal unpalatable to MPs She has tried to pass the pain on to MPs hoping that the grim consequences of missing the deadline would force them to settle for her plan Earlier this week in an act of parliamentary jujitsu the former attorney general Dominic Grieve turned the timetable weapon back on May securing an amendment that sets a limit of three days for the prime minister to say what comes next if her deal collapses  Running down the clock should eliminate options and force decisions So far that hasn t worked Instead the same volume of Brexit bluster has been compressed into an ever tighter space which in accordance with the laws of political thermodynamics raises the temperature and increases the danger of something blowing up 
JAN11	Andy Murray taught us Scots to dream big and show emotion	Small wet overweight countries should not and usually do not produce tennis superstars And although it was a time his many followers in Scotland and beyond had been expecting for a while the pain and frustration etched on Andy Murray s face as he announced his retirement from tennis at a tearful press conference in Australia still came as a shock The fairytale Federer style comeback we all wished for was not to be  The visceral authenticity of the emotion made it difficult to watch But it said everything you need to know about Murray still utterly committed to the game he loves struggling to free himself from the only life he has ever known even though it is now causing him excruciating pain 
JAN11	We don’t think John Finnis should teach at Oxford University. Here’s why	This week along with other students we started a petition to stop Professor John Finnis teaching at Oxford University As anticipated the petition has been criticised on the grounds that its proposals would undermine academic and though Finnis himself says his views are strictly philosophical religious freedom We were called snowflake students who were simply incapable of arguing against opposing views We believe these criticisms miss the point  Here are some of the reasons for the petition in a paper Finnis sets out that the judgment that homosexual conduct is evil can be defended He draws an analogy between the copulation of humans with animals and homosexuality In a article he laments restrictions on the discussion of the reversibility of sexual orientation or the relation if any between sexual orientation and child abuse 
JAN11	Don’t be fooled by Amber Rudd’s phoney attempt at compassion	Imagine launching a leadership bid by promising not to rob quite as many children as you were originally planning to do The work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd is far from alone in circling the carcass of Theresa May s premiership although quite how a remainer is to triumph in a vote of the Ukip ised Tory grassroots is difficult to answer and her speech today appropriately in a jobcentre certainly represents positioning  As well as suggesting the benefits freeze may possibly end next year her heavily trailed announcement is that the retrospective implementation of the two child limit on universal credit won t happen The newly born third child of a supermarket worker nurse or admin assistant from the just about managing families May claimed to champion will still have their support taken away 
JAN11	Labour must back a people’s vote before the clock runs out	Over the next few weeks Britain faces a stark binary choice It is not the blackmail choice that Theresa May misleadingly poses my deal or no deal Nor is it the choice Jeremy Corbyn still implausibly claims her bad Brexit or his much better Brexit The real choice we must make before B day currently March is this blindfold Brexit or democratic timeout  As parliament takes back control we urgently need the Labour front bench to join MPs from all parties in getting us to the timeout By timeout I mean a period of democratic deliberation leading up to a second referendum in which we decide on the basis of everything we now know how we should address the real problems that contributed to the vote for Brexit in what kind of country we really want to be and whether we can do that better outside or inside the EU For this our EU partners will extend article and give us the necessary time 
JAN11	The aliens are coming. And they’ve caught us with our pants down	Earlier this week astronomers announced that they had observed repeated bursts of radio waves coming from deep space with some experts suggesting this could be evidence of alien life Is this it Could extraterrestrials finally be trying to contact us I hope not  Let me provide an analogy and I think you ll see what I mean 
JAN11	Tech firms have a duty to face down antisemitism	Beyond a quick read of a Wikipedia page what can the internet really tell us about antisemitism in the United Kingdom The answer is a great deal It has been shown that people are remarkably honest when they search for information online Their Google searches and queries reveal interests prejudices and hatreds that they might otherwise keep hidden from friends family members neighbours surveys and even themselves These searches have been shown to share their health secrets sexual preferences and hostility towards other groups  As part of my work with the Antisemitism Policy Trust and the Community Security Trust I put this to the test to see what Google searches made by people in the UK could tell us about attitudes towards Jewish people Unsurprisingly perhaps we found that every year people in the UK express antisemitic thoughts through their internet searches 
JAN12	Don’t give in to the age of fatalism. Fight back and secure your future	Anyone reading the outpouring of writing the global crisis has provoked must be prepared for anticlimax There are hundreds of denunciations of Trump s America Brexit Britain and the Putinesque dictatorial democracies appearing everywhere from Hungary to Venezuela Turkey to the Philippines  You turn to the final chapter expecting to hear how to fight back and answer comes there none The endnotes flash by the index rolls and that s that You should not be surprised The global order that developed in the s has failed and to date the only replacement on offer has been authoritarian nationalism that will impoverish and diminish its supporters as much as its opponents 
JAN12	Marie Kondo calls it clutter; to me they are mementoes	I wouldn t say that I m a hoarder exactly but I will admit that there is no shelf in my flat left unadorned with photographs or trinkets or slightly pathetic miniature plants that could do with a good drink  As someone who moves house more often than I buy a new winter coat this is not a practical trait but still I can find ledges where you would not believe That flat part on top of the mirror Perfect for postcards Weird bit along the stairs that doesn t seem to have any structural purpose Exactly the right place for an exhibition of the exhibitions I ve seen over the last couple of years perked up with some holiday snaps and another plant While it s not quite at Channel documentary intervention levels yet I unashamedly love stuff

JAN12	I’m a remainer. So why do I feel more and more sympathy for leave voters?	The outcome of the referendum horrified me Despite my doubts about the European Union as an institution its remoteness lack of democracy and inflexibility in dealing with crises such as the eurozone debt I was and remain convinced that it s better for nations to work together to deal with problems than apart  Since then the chaotic fallout of the vote has made Brexit seem even more scary we have witnessed an unstable government inept negotiations early signs of the economic damage to come and a looming no deal outcome 
JAN12	Theresa May is about to find out that Brexit is bigger than her	Whatever else happens with Brexit no one in British politics will ever again underestimate the power of a timetable The pressure of the article clock ticking down forced Theresa May into the compromises that make her deal unpalatable to MPs She has tried to pass the pain on to MPs hoping that the grim consequences of missing the deadline would force them to settle for her plan Earlier this week in an act of parliamentary jujitsu the former attorney general Dominic Grieve turned the timetable weapon back on May securing an amendment that sets a limit of three days for the prime minister to say what comes next if her deal collapses  Running down the clock should eliminate options and force decisions So far that hasn t worked Instead the same volume of Brexit bluster has been compressed into an ever tighter space which in accordance with the laws of political thermodynamics raises the temperature and increases the danger of something blowing up 
JAN12	The Met’s Gangs Matrix is racist policing in its purest form	In a review into the Metropolitan police service s secretive Gangs Matrix the London mayor s office has been forced to publicly acknowledge that the database disproportionately targets black males The representation of young black males on the matrix is disproportionate to their likelihood of criminality and victimisation the report sneaked out just before Christmas admitted  Of the almost names on the matrix at any given time are black and are other ethnic minorities Yet the review made no attempts to explain why this shocking disproportionality exists nor did it seek to understand or explain the impact of this racist policing process on the individuals targeted their families or the communities that they come from 
JAN12	Bread is on the rise again – but it’s time we Brits demanded a better loaf	Bread is back In a major review hailed by critics of the low carb trend the World Health Organization has decreed that wholegrain breads can help combat a range of diseases such as diabetes cardiovascular problems and cancer  But did bread ever really go away The headline news has looked dire in the last few years white sliced sales down in the five years to according to retail analysts Mintel M S launching those weird high protein sandwiches half the bread but all the filling storied baking powerhouse Warburtons launching gluten free wraps But this low carb trend always felt like a fad awaiting a correction long before the latest news

JAN13	Brexit has revealed MPs’ flaws – and our own	How do you find out someone s character flaws We all go to great lengths to conceal our own producing improbable lines in job interviews about our greatest weakness being our tendency to work too hard Politicians employ advisers who plot news grids to show how busy and effective their leaders are even as those leaders regularly fail to take important decisions  Shakespeare liked to use two devices to get his characters to reveal their true selves he either put them in disguise or got them drunk In politics today the device for unmasking people s weaknesses is rather less fun than a masked ball or session with a tankard it s Brexit 
JAN13	David Cameron and the art of blaming other people	David Cameron really loved organising votes for things didn t he That was his answer to everything I was reminded of this when I read that the elected police and crime commissioners which his government introduced to oversee the constabularies of England and Wales aren t doing a very good job According to the head of the National Crime Agency they re all about stopping speeding and burglary and not so hot on organised crime online child abuse and modern slavery  It s not surprising Making some local elected officials the overseers of the police is effectively putting the Neighbourhood Watch in charge of law enforcement strategy They re going to address the issues most noticeable to the very small percentage of people who might turn out to vote for them If they were in charge of healthcare all the money would go to treating RSI caused by overenergetic net curtain twitching Their best chance of arresting a mafia boss is if he plays the music too loudly at his Christmas party 
JAN13	US TV networks put ratings over principle by airing Trump speech	Donald Trump s speech on the Mexican border crisis delivered live from the Oval Office last week marked a milestone in his brief but historically chaotic presidency it revealed serious errors of judgment that weren t simply down to him Unfortunately for commercial media outlets it was their shortcomings that attracted almost as much attention and criticism as the scaremongering speech itself  It is the hallmark of many non Democratic countries that tinpot dictators appear at the drop of a hat on national broadcast outlets Even in functioning democracies you can measure the importance of a national moment by whether the head of state or government pops up in prime time For this reason appearances by US presidents on all TV networks were traditionally a relatively rare occurrence When they do happen the decision to run them is made on an ad hoc basis by the heads of those networks 
JAN13	Out of the Brexit nightmare must emerge a more robust democracy	There s a terrific scene in The Favourite the film about the last of the Stuart monarchs when Queen Anne is about to propose a European policy to her parliament Just before she opens her mouth the bewigged MPs make plain that they won t have it The queen faints with shock and hits the floor with a thump  I don t expect Queen Theresa to collapse when she loses in parliament this week not least because the rejection of her Brexit deal is not going to be a surprise to anyone herself included If we still lived by the traditional rules of British politics defeat ought to be the final curtain for Mrs May Brexit is the defining task of her premiership and she is about to fail it We d ordinarily expect the abdication of the PM to follow such a humiliating rejection Yet no one neither friend nor foe expects her to respond to defeat by submitting her resignation Brexit has so scrambled our politics that it has normalised dramas that we would once have regarded as extraordinary and made the unthinkable routine We no longer know which of the rules still apply 
JAN13	Fraudulent reporters harm us all. Vigilance is essential	The name Claas Relotius recently joined those of Janet Cooke and Jayson Blair in the list of reporters whose deceptions massively harmed esteemed publications and journalism more generally Similarities in the cases offer lessons  Last December the prestigious German magazine Der Spiegel revealed the extent of the fraud of Relotius one of its star writers Disclosures continue but it is already clear that large parts of his award winning reporting were simply made up 
JAN13	The vandals destroying libraries should have the book thrown at them	It is a further triumph for The Favourite with Bafta nominations to have propelled Ophelia Field s biography of Sarah Churchill the favourite in question to the heights of Amazon s gay and lesbian biography list  Anne Somerset s biography of Queen Anne is also likely to benefit as people attempt to discover more about the extraordinary incidents depicted in Yorgos Lanthimos s film How did th century politicians train their racing ducks Did Queen Anne ever get treatment for her raging bulimia What became of Anne s little rabbits And did Sarah really dress up as a highwayman because it s certainly not in Wikipedia 
JAN13	Leonardo was a man of the Renaissance, not narrow nationhood	He drew portraits for Italian dukes sketched for the papacy and died at the court of a French king If there is any artist who defies nationhood it is surely Leonardo da Vinci Yet last week Leonardo s cosmopolitan legacy was caught up in an extraordinary intergovernmental spat when Rome renewed its threat to block Italian galleries from lending to the forthcoming Louvre exhibition commemorating the th anniversary of Leonardo s death  Leonardo was Italian after all Why don t they loan us the Mona Lisa 
JAN13	A divided Britain is not new. So why do today’s schisms seem intractable?	A few years ago we stayed in a cottage in the Yorkshire Dales One night we went for a drink in the local It was plastered inside and out with union jacks The moment I saw the flags the hairs on my neck stood up Anyone black or Asian who had grown up in s and s Britain would probably have felt the same The union jack in those days was a sign meaning Beware fascists around  Littondale in the s is of course a very different place from east London in the s and the meaning of the union jack very different too The pub was welcoming and friendly and we returned there more than once And yet I know that the next time I see a pub plastered with union jacks the hairs of my neck once more will stand up 
JAN13	Don’t give in to the age of fatalism.

JAN13	Angst, grief, pain: Europe is in turmoil as extremists form new alliances	It could simply be a coincidence Or perhaps the decision to exhibit Edvard Munch s most famous work The Scream at the British Museum in April closely following Britain s scheduled March exit from the EU is an artful piece of deliberate subversion Either way the Norwegian painter s celebrated depiction of extreme pain occasioned by high anxiety mental instability grief loneliness and separation seems especially well suited to the times  Yet while Britain heads for a potentially spectacular nervous breakdown an agitated Europe is not in much better shape Nervousness abounds about the EU s prospects and cohesion with the focus on European parliament elections on May This normally dull uninspiring contest is turning into a battlefield on which a definitive struggle over Europe s direction may be fought and decided The last elections in saw the lowest ever turnout could be very different 
JAN14	This is only the end of the beginning of our Brexit civil war	Let no one think it will soon be over This is only the end of the beginning in a Brexit civil war that will last a generation There is no end in sight no healing in prospect no solution to hand whatever the outcome of myriad votes Just get on with it MPs find constituents complaining They are sick of the sight and sound of Brexit warned the Mail on Sunday leader without moving an inch on its own support for Theresa May s deal Few do budge So listen to no one who claims their particular answer will bring some miraculous national closure None will Better then to ignore snake oil political remedies  Start with no deal the most lethal ending described as national suicide by Dominic Grieve No need to rehearse the irrefutable reasons why crashing out would be a crippling economic blow and turn us into a pariah state But note how devil may care David Davis would wantonly renege on certified EU debts with a blithe We will keep the bn and spend it as we see fit Writing in the Sunday Times he added Now is the time for the UK to call the shots No dealer Dominic Raab tells May in the Telegraph to send a clear message to Brussels that the UK will not be bullied His breezy talk of trading on WTO rules never reveals the killer terms they would entail 
JAN14	On Brexit our MPs have been in hiding. They must show themselves	The Palace of Westminster lends itself well to hide and seek The Gothic labyrinth of interconnecting passageways and stairwells defies navigation It contains a million places of concealment But there are times when the division bell rings and MPs must show themselves The game ends and everyone sees who stands where The vote on Theresa May s Brexit deal should be such a moment of revelation  It is two years since parliament voted to propel the UK out of the European Union giving May authorisation to pull the article trigger Then the great game of hide and seek began A small minority of MPs dared to declare Brexit a bad business from the start They saw how reckless it was to set off on the journey without a map or a notion of the destination But most hid not in niches behind stone pillars but in bogus arguments and behind plastic loyalties 
JAN14	If Labour supports a public vote, we’ll take no lectures from Tories about democracy	In this week in the British electorate went to the polls They did so because Herbert Asquith s Liberal government had been unable to get Lloyd George s famous People s Budget through the House of Lords Liberal posters defined the election as a choice between the peers and the people They finally got their way after a second election that December  The fixed term parliament act was never intended to prop up a zombie government
JAN14	MPs are lying to voters – there is no alternative to May’s Brexit deal	Parliament is about to lie to those who elected it two years ago It is about to pretend that there is a better way of leaving the EU than is outlined in Theresa May s deal It knows there is not If it votes down May s deal it will lie  The deal is not a settlement but a transition It is a way of moving forward of leaving the EU pending negotiation of a long term trading relationship It is not a compromise but in reality a defeat for the having our cake and eating it school of Brexit fantasists But it is the only deal on offer All else is a Westminster miasma of personal ambition party advantage and endemic hysteria MPs are charged with governing the country well Never in my experience have they shown less interest in that cause 
JAN14	In a world of joyless self-denial, what do we really want? Drunken Blind Daters, getting it on	Joanne and Morgan a barista and a children s social worker have quite literally added to the gaiety of the nation with their brilliant blind date As they told the Guardian s Weekend magazine they got drunk fell over crashed a party fancied each other rotten Knickers were lost Mouths were full They didn t care about table manners or the food Or indeed what any of us thought What most of us thought anyway was Excellent behaviour Here were two young people having a wild time For a brief moment all was well with the world  Who cares whether they live happily ever after I have never understood what a date actually is except some sort of weird creepy transaction where whoever pays gets to demand stuff from the other person Often I sit next to people on such dates and eavesdrop and as far as I can ascertain they are worse than job interviews They might as well be asking each other What qualities make you suitable for this role Would you describe yourself as a self starter You state on your application that you are ft would you mind standing up 
JAN14	Forget project fear. Remainers now need a ‘project patriotism’	If as seems likely the prime minister s Brexit deal is rejected in parliament on Tuesday it is arguably only the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who stands in the way of a second referendum If he moves a no confidence vote and it fails Labour has already at its conference mandated that the party seek a second referendum And given that there is no majority in parliament for any currently envisaged version of Brexit including no deal it is entirely plausible that the current Brexit stasis could indeed be eventually settled by another referendum  So what would those who wish Britain to stay in the EU need to do differently to win it Recent tracker polls have shown an increasing swing to remain with the highest scores for Britain was wrong to leave the EU being recorded in the last two months But the long term trends show that few voters are switching remain s ranks are being swelled by new younger voters joining the electorate and their elders leaving it If anything positions may have hardened and polarised further 
JAN14	It’s not too late for Trump and Turkey to reach a compromise over Syria	Since last month s announcement that the US will imminently withdraw its troops from Syria President Trump has backtracked The White House has declared that the withdrawal may yet take a number of months amid a series of other contradictory remarks from senior American officials over whether the US plans to withdraw its troops entirely or to maintain some presence in eastern Syria On Sunday Trump generated further confusion by declaring plans for a safe zone in Syria across the border with Turkey without explaining who would enforce this zone and where it would be located even declaring that the US would devastate Turkey economically if it attacked Syria s Kurds  A precipitous withdrawal would be indeed be bad news it could pave the way for an Islamic State resurgence the jihadist organisation is thought to still have fighters at large in Syria and Iraq as well as expanded Iranian influence 
JAN14	Do you think the Irish citizens' assembly on abortion was a good idea?	In Ireland voted in a referendum to legalise abortion Irish politics had been debating this divisive and emotive issue for decades however the Irish citizens assembly which deliberated on the matter prior to the referendum was cited as a successful process in helping people understand the complex issues  The citizens assembly was established in by parliament and its purpose was to deliberate on a number of issues including the eighth amendment that outlawed abortion The citizen members of the assembly were selected to be electorally representative and included those in favour of the change those against and those undecideds Over the course of five weekends between the end of and early the assembly listened to people on all sides of the abortion debate including experts and those sharing their personal experiences 
JAN14	Why are we so obsessed with young, successful people like Sally Rooney?	When year old novelist Sally Rooney became the youngest ever winner of the Costa Book Prize last week it was to deafening cheers of critical acclaim that have characterised her brief career Rooney has already been heralded as the first great millennial novelist and a Salinger for the Snapchat generation And these Snapchatting millennials have since been overwhelming booksellers in the rush to read their author prompting shops to advertise that they still have copies of her novel Normal People in stock Yet for all her obvious talent the fanfare around Rooney s award made this millennial s heart sink slightly  The slightly frenzied reaction to Rooney seems to be symptomatic of the way we now greet achievements by young people Last year another year old author Daisy Johnson became the youngest person to be shortlisted for the Man Booker prize for her debut novel Everything Under Likewise some of year old Autumn de Forest s expressionist paintings have been valued at m m poet Ocean Vuong was only when he won the TS Eliot prize for his debut collection in and Christopher Paolini published the first of his bestselling Inheritance series when he was in his teens It seems we increasingly celebrate youthfulness as a marker of success in and of itself Teen Vogue s Under list began in This year s cohort includes year old designer Kheris Rogers and seven year old activist Havana Chapman Edwards 
JAN14	A nation ‘bored of Brexit’ risks sleepwalking into disaster	Just before Christmas I spent a day in Cowley a working class suburb of Oxford where a factory now owned by BMW manufactures that great British icon the Mini The plant closes its doors for an annual maintenance period usually timed to coincide with local schools summer holidays But this year amid the company s concerns about Britain s future relationship with Europe the shutdown will not only be longer than usual but is scheduled to begin the day after we formally leave the European Union a decision taken says the company to minimise the risk of any possible short term parts supply disruption in the event of a no deal Brexit  You might imagine the surrounding streets would be full of anxiety and urgency But once BMW had declined my request to visit the factory and I had resigned myself to long hours spent vox popping I was not entirely surprised to find the complete opposite questions about Brexit being met with an exasperated indifference as if it were something in which people were barely interested 
JAN15	After this staggering defeat for May, our country is left lost and adrift	This was a defeat on a scale without precedent in the era of universal suffrage a rebuff more humiliating than any endured even by Ramsay MacDonald in Some Conservatives voted against the signature policy of their own party tonight thereby triggering a motion of no confidence that in any normal era would see the government toppled within hours  But such are these extraordinary times that is not even the most significant story from tonight What matters more than the fate of this government or this prime minister is the fate of the country and its decision to leave the European Union which is now suspended in a state of limbo if not purgatory The law says Britain will leave the EU in odd days Yet tonight it has rejected the only firm exit path that exists It means that unless something changes and MPs can reach an agreement with each other Britain will crash out of the EU on March without a deal an outcome all but the most wild eyed Brexiteers regard as an economic and social catastrophe for these islands 
JAN15	The Guardian view on May’s Brexit deal: it’s over, but what’s next?	The overwhelming and decisive rejection by MPs of Theresa May s withdrawal agreement to leave the European Union is a shattering blow to the authority of the prime minister She has spent two years negotiating a deal which in substance was the opposite of what she said she wanted in public only to see it repudiated by parliament Her minority government has now been defeated on no fewer than occasions Britain is leaving the EU in weeks and Mrs May leads a cabinet that is hopelessly split a party that is riven with disagreements and a country that is deeply divided So emphatic is the Commons historic rebuff that Mrs May s deal is finished Mrs May lost by votes the greatest defeat of a government ever The scale of the opposition means it is not credible Mrs May could bring the motion back to the Commons modified with a few tweaks from Brussels and hope for success a second time round  https web archive org web https www theguardian com politics may eu referendum morning briefing sign up
JAN15	The fear that lies behind toxic masculinity	What strikes me most is the fragility Gillette makes an advertisement calling on men to challenge abusive behaviour and thousands furiously proclaim they will never use its products again The American Psychological Association APA issues new clinical guidelines advising that a masculinity characterised by dominance aggression and emotional repression can be harmful to men s mental health and the world s conservative media falls into a collective faint So much for the strong and silent types  If real men according to the men s rights movement are tough and commanding why are the exponents of this doctrine so easily discomposed Why does the slightest challenge to the norms they proclaim by a razor ad or an academic body they had probably never encountered before trigger this frenzied testeria 
JAN15	Rod Liddle is wrong about the causes of black teenage deaths	They say don t speak ill of the dead and especially not of dead children But it seems there is an exception to that rule when the subject is black and poor and meets a violent death In fact certain rightwing commentators claim they are are doing us a special favour by suggesting that victims of violent crime such as year old Jaden Moodie are somewhat gangsta Led by figures such as Rod Liddle who among other things questioned why Jaden was out at night pm actually and criticised his fatuous gangsta moves these talking heads believe they are courageously owning the identification of a cultural problem one about which the progressive voices in our society stay silent for fear of being called racist or politically incorrect  Of course most violent crime is conducted by white people and the majority of stabbing victims in Britain are white But as long as any black children are tragically dying on the streets it is hugely important to debate the causes The Liddles of this world posit two diagnoses for the problem of black youth violence absent fathers and the related claim that the black family is uniquely dysfunctional and more nebulously black culture which is perceived as flawed and nefarious Yet in direct contrast to the rightwing commentators who exploit this problem to pursue their poisonous agendas there are people who have been researching and writing about the ecology of violence in our cities for decades making sense of what we are often told is senseless They have found young people living in an alternative cognitive landscape in which you stab first and ask questions later where distrust of the authorities and hostile strangers results in people and especially young men arming themselves and acting in aggressive and threatening ways in order to pre empt attacks 
JAN15	Moaning is a crucial part of parenting. So give Duncan Jones a break	Among the great lies of our time are the Brexit agreement will be one of the easiest in human history Mexico is going to pay for the wall We tried to deliver your parcel but you weren t in and Nobody ever tells you how hard it is to be a parent  The latest person to tell us how hard it is to be a parent is Duncan Jones a filmmaker father of two and the son of David Bowie He sparked debate AKA a social media pile on this week with a series of tweets about life with children aged two and a half and nine months I ll tell you something I never see anyone admit he wrote They are exhausting frustrating and life destabilizing They are rarely fun Sure smiles are great hugs are lovely but it s HARD not obviously a good choice in life 
JAN15	Donald Trump's fast food banquet – feeding the people Whoppers, as ever	It s another day and that means another slice of absurdity served up in Trump s America guys Or in this particular case slices of pizza And some hamburgers and other assortments of fast food  This is the spread the president put on for the visiting Clemson University football team who had won the College Football Playoff National Championship Trump made sure to point out numerous times that he paid for the food out of his own pocket Many federal employees are not being paid at all given the ongoing government shutdown now the longest ever which is why the president had to order food in the first place because catering staff are on furlough which again he blamed on the Democrats 
JAN15	I’ve withdrawn my amendment so parliament can reject May’s failed deal	At pm this evening we as MPs will be asked to take the single most important decision that any of us have faced during our time in parliament The outcome will affect the future of our country our economy and the lives of the people we represent  The Brexit referendum showed us to be divided and those of us who campaigned for remain have to accept that we lost But that does not mean that we have to agree to the deal the prime minister has brought back a deal that satisfies no one 
JAN15	Gillette’s ad is not PC guff, Piers Morgan – look beyond the macho stereotype	What would the advertising industry do without Piers Morgan  Whenever they need a grumpy middle aged man to be triggered there he is reliable as clockwork He did it with Greggs vegan sausage roll helping catapult their January marketing wheeze onto the front pages by complaining that it was a monstrosity And he s done it again with the new Gillette ad targeting toxic masculinity which twists its familiar the best a man can get tagline to suggest that men can do a lot better than Harvey Weinstein and fighting in the street It ends on a heroic note with images of men in general and fathers in particular showing their sons a better way But that didn t stop Morgan dismissing it as absurd virtue signalling PC guff that might drive him to get his razors elsewhere Let boys be damn boys Let men be damn men he harrumphed on Twitter 
JAN15	A London DJ's punishment sheds light on Singapore's caning shame	Any day now year old Ye Ming Yuen could be escorted out of his cell at Singapore s Changi prison and whipped times with a rattan cane This comes on top of the year sentence he s already serving after being convicted of seven drug offences in a country that takes pride in its uncompromising approach when it comes to law breaking  The story of Yuen a former British public schoolboy and London DJ has captured the attention of the British press but he s far from the only one awaiting caning Judicial corporal punishment has been a long time fixture in the south east Asian city state It was first introduced by British colonialists in the th century but has been retained and even expanded by the post independence government Today it s applicable to more than offences from violent crimes like rape and robbery to nonviolent breaches of the law such as vandalism or overstaying one s visa for over days Between January and October the courts handed down caning sentences to people sentences were carried out in that time 
JAN15	Hate the Sopranos finale? You're not a real fan of the series	Let s get one thing straight Tony Soprano didn t die at the end of The Sopranos He sat down with his family put Journey on a jukebox and chomped on some onion rings Then the screen went black What happened after that whether Tony was assassinated by the bloke who walked into the toilet moments before the blackout or if he lived and had to listen to Meadow discuss her terrible parallel parking is an unknown and will always remain so As it should do  At the end of last week a book released to coincide with the show s th anniversary made headlines for an interview with the series creator David Chase by the TV critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz During the interview Chase referred to the final scene as the death scene and the fatal scene That was enough for those who have trawled for an answer to what happened when the screen went black in June to start the ending engine up again The Times dedicated a story to whether or not the issue of Tony Soprano s fate had finally been put to bed Of course it hasn t and isn t In the Vox writer Martha P Nochimson claimed Chase had told her that Tony wasn t dead Finally there was an answer Until Chase released a statement saying the story was untrue and that the final scene of The Sopranos raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer 
JAN16	It’s now or never for May. Time to compromise on Brexit	It is said that the past is a foreign country But after the Brexit referendum it is the present not the past where we do things differently No government in British history has taken such a Commons beating as Theresa May suffered on Tuesday Yet hours later the selfsame MPs who had thrown out her UK EU Brexit deal by votes to now handed her premiership a fresh lifeline The Conservative MPs who voted her policy down on Tuesday backed her on Wednesday as though it were the most natural thing in the world to do  By voting by to that they still had confidence in May s government the House of Commons turned the ordinary meaning of words on their head But this wasn t a vote of confidence in any normal sense It was a suboptimal tribal choice between a government led by May and one led by Jeremy Corbyn It was a knockabout partisan diversion from the main national issue which now resumes The loss leaves Corbyn with fewer defences against Labour s second vote campaigners But the victory also finds May still wedded to her defeated Brexit policy and settled in for another year in Downing Street 
JAN16	Only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo	The pound rose and all was calm on the stock market As far as the financial markets were concerned the message was clear the voting down by MPs of Theresa May s withdrawal agreement means a delayed Brexit a softer Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all Those with serious wealth in Britain have always been worried that Brexit will lead to radical change They now think that there will be a perpetuation of the status quo or something not far removed from it Hence the pound getting stronger  There s no question that opting for the quiet life has its attractions There would be a boost to the economy as companies decided to push ahead with investment plans that had been delayed while the outcome of Brexit was uncertain And of course any economic costs of no deal would be avoided 
JAN16	Labour must pursue a better Brexit deal, not a second referendum	It is perversely a sign of the government s weakness not its strength that it has inevitably seen off a vote of no confidence All that unites a bitterly fractious Conservative party is panic at the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn led Labour government coming to power in a general election a likelihood many are admirably honest about If Theresa May was confident about the Tories prospects she would risk throwing the dice But Labour started the last election campaign percentage points behind the Tories in the polls and ended two points behind six weeks later Today the polling average has Labour slightly ahead Conservatives fear that a Corbyn led administration would not be like a normal Labour government and would upend an economic consensus established by Margaret Thatcher And they would be right  The media will now attempt to shift the narrative claiming that it is Labour under pressure This is absurd The government has just suffered the biggest parliamentary defeat in the history of British democracy A disastrous near decade of Tory rule has left Britain in its worst combined political and social crisis in modern times the consequence of ideologically driven austerity and catastrophic political decisions by both David Cameron and May Labour will be pilloried for not having a magical solution when there is none to a crisis engineered by its opponents 
JAN16	The Guardian view on Brexit and parliament: now dissolve the red lines	A Commons vote affirming confidence in Her Majesty s government does not indicate that parliament trusts Theresa May Her reprieve on Wednesday night by a margin of largely expresses Tory and DUP reluctance to risk a general election Power is still flowing away from the prime minister  In voters deprived the Tories of a majority Last December the government was found in contempt of parliament One third of Tory MPs have said they have no confidence in Mrs May as their party s leader On Tuesday the prime minister s Brexit deal was crushed in a Commons defeat greater than any recorded in the modern era Mrs May s authority has been stripped away her credibility is gone Every precedent guides her towards resignation But not much about Brexit follows precedent 
JAN16	MPs alone won’t solve the Brexit deadlock. We need a citizens’ assembly	The Brexit process has become almost unspeakably awful Like a foul smell that nobody really wants to deal with without action it will only get worse As party unity collapses in parliament how we find consensus on the greatest issue of our time will determine what the outcome is whether that turns out to be a second referendum or the next stage of negotiation We believe the best path to such a consensus involves setting up a citizens assembly  Just like the Labour party we represent contrasting communities that nevertheless have much in common Wigan voted to leave the EU Walthamstow to remain One is a northern town fighting to regain the good jobs and dignity that were once commonplace The other is an inner city area fighting an epidemic of knife crime and the rise of gentrification Separated by miles in both places people are angry deeply affected by poverty and disempowered by a system that does not respond to their needs 
JAN16	Welcome to the Westminster apocalypse. Have you thought about theocracy instead?	The world s most densely betwatted space at the best of times Westminster became even more wantonly apocalyptic in the days and hours leading up to the historic defeat of Theresa May s Brexit deal Behold a bell tolling haute remainer yellow vested journalist infested shitbird MP crawling flashmobbed performance art piece entitled HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THEOCRACY INSTEAD  If not don t rule it out An awful lot of things are apparently back on the table after May s flame out including but not limited to default no deal extending article a Norway style arrangement second referendum and return to absolute monarchy by either the Queen or David Attenborough 
JAN16	Arrogant remainers want a second vote. That would be a bad day for democracy	Remainers often argue as if they had a monopoly on what counts as reasonable and rational decision making Supporting the EU comes from the head whereas wishing to leave the EU comes from the heart as the MP Rachel Reeves once put it And yet the attitude of some towards a second referendum is breathtakingly reckless and cavalier Almost anything as long as it brings us one step closer to the UK staying in the EU is countenanced and justified  I remember one Cambridge lunch on a day when cabinet ministers were resigning over Theresa May s deal in which a colleague told me he would cheer every time a new resignation was announced The more chaotic the better he said because chaos makes shelving Brexit that much more likely 
JAN16	I took part in a citizens' assembly – it could help break the Brexit deadlock	In August there was a knock on my front door A man from a polling company introduced himself he was selecting people to take part in a national forum to discuss social issues in Ireland One of the topics to be debated was our country s strict abortion laws  I said yes not entirely sure what I was signing up for A week later there was a phone call to verify that I was on the register to vote and then my place as one of the members of the Citizens Assembly was confirmed An explainer booklet came in the post along with an invitation to Dublin Castle for the inaugural meeting in October 
JAN16	Theresa May needs to realise she can’t keep every Tory happy	The House of Commons has spoken but what has it actually said A clear and resounding no to a complex deal the UK and the EU have spent nearly two years negotiating And behind the emphatic no lies an unlikely coalition of hard Brexiteers ardent remainers and those in between collaborating to kick the deal and the prime minister  Unfortunately the kick was directionless 
JAN16	Cutting police homicide teams is the sure sign of a failing society	In August year old Yiannoulla Yianni was raped and murdered in her home while preparing food for her family Thirty four years later in my former team at the Metropolitan police led an investigation that convicted her killer After the trial Yiannoulla s brother Rick commented that the family never gave up hoping and were truly grateful to the police for finally bringing him to justice  Every murder cries out for justice That s why the Met never closes an unsolved homicide 
JAN17	Theresa May’s survival is just a Tory confidence trick	Back in when strong and stable was still a campaign slogan and not a laugh line I sat in on a focus group of undecided voters in Harrow home to two marginal seats in north west London Even then they didn t like Theresa May much Assuming she would be an effective negotiator they appreciated her steeliness the word strong came up twice as did Thatcher and clever But overall they found her unreliable and unrelatable They described her among other things as a liar headmistress busybody uncaring and untrustworthy  Comparing her to Jeremy Corbyn one said He d buy a round Theresa wouldn t When asked if they would trust her to look after their home while they were on holiday the consensus was The house yes But not the pets This is Britain If she can t be trusted to get a round in or look after pets I doubt May would have passed one of her own Home Office British values tests 
JAN17	On Saturday the UK turns remain. Parliament must force a second referendum	You could call it swing Saturday or crossover day for this Saturday January marks an important moment This is the day in theory when the country turns remain Even if not a single person has changed their mind since the referendum the demographic shift alone will have done the heavy lifting Enough old leavers will have died and enough young remainers will have come on to the electoral register to turn the dial on what the country thinks about Brexit  The psephologist and founding YouGov president Peter Kellner calculates that the leave vote has been declining by about a day taking into account the differential turnout the young turn out to vote much less often than the old By using exactly the same proportion of every age group turning out to vote exactly as they did in demographics alone will have transformed the UK into a remainer nation 
JAN17	Why did Tulip Siddiq have to vote in person? Cold Conservative calculation	Obscure parliamentary procedures are currently all the rage from John Bercow s controversial deviation from precedence in selecting amendments to business motions and the arcane voting procedure requiring MPs to physically go through division lobbies or be nodded through for which they still have to be on parliament grounds for their vote to be counted  The decision by the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq to delay the caesarean birth of her second child to vote in the crucial Brexit debate on Tuesday night and the confidence vote on Wednesday night has reignited the debate over proxy voting and reminded the country that the Conservatives have a fundamental problem with women Despite parliament agreeing in principle last February to implement proxy voting party whips have yet to facilitate a system for those MPs who most need it mainly pregnant people and parents 
JAN17	Don’t rely on Germany to solve Brexit, it doesn’t need to help Britain	Remember when Boris Johnson was telling you that Germany would force the EU to accept almost any conditions for Brexit basically Britain having its cake and eating it too because they need us more than we need them Didn t happen But in desperate Brexit times the hope for a deus ex machina to solve the whole damn thing persists Recently there have been more suggestions that Angela Merkel will somehow rescue Theresa May by offering Britain a new and better deal That isn t going to happen either Here s why  First back to Johnson He argued that Germany wanted to export cars to Britain so it would make sure that Britain and Europe had free access to each other s markets no matter what True Britons bought German cars in almost every fifth car Germany exported But car exports to Britain were down by whereas exports to China and Japan were up by and respectively May talks about global Britain but Germany thinks globally too and in the scheme of things Asia and the US are more important And by the way while British politicians were bickering about whether the country should belong to a customs union which supposedly stops Britain from striking free trade deals with global partners the EU signed a free trade agreement with Japan which should bring Germany export gains of bn a year 
JAN17	Only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo	The pound rose and all was calm on the stock market As far as the financial markets were concerned the message was clear the voting down by MPs of Theresa May s withdrawal agreement means a delayed Brexit a softer Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all Those with serious wealth in Britain have always been worried that Brexit will lead to radical change They now think that there will be a perpetuation of the status quo or something not far removed from it Hence the pound getting stronger  There s no question that opting for the quiet life has its attractions There would be a boost to the economy as companies decided to push ahead with investment plans that had been delayed while the outcome of Brexit was uncertain And of course any economic costs of no deal would be avoided 
JAN17	It’s not just the Fyre festival – this is the golden age of the social media con	The psychology of the con artist is such say those who study them that the very best fraudsters are able to sail through lie detector tests because they don t believe themselves to be lying This fact came to light in Fyre Fraud one of two documentaries released this week about the Fyre music festival a fiasco that traumatised hundreds of social media influencers and for which organiser Billy McFarland is serving a six year prison sentence What s fascinating about the story as told in both the Netflix and Hulu shows is how deeply McFarland tapped into the self deception of his targets and how the companies that enabled him continue to thrive  The art of the con feels like the great expression of our age and McFarland a grifter who as well as having the brainwave to put on a music festival in the Bahamas ran a credit card company and sold fraudulent tickets to exclusive events is the sort of vapid buffoon whose naked untrustworthiness is so undisguised as to make him seem almost transparent 
JAN17	A semi-Brexit, with just England and Wales leaving the EU, is the solution	When all solutions are bad it s time to reinvent the problem Is it still possible to honour the initial Brexit referendum without crossing the EU s red lines Yes through semi Brexit  The UK is divided into four nations two of which voted remain and two of which voted leave The British government could honour those decisions and allow Scotland and Northern Ireland to remain in the EU as the successor state to the UK while permitting England and Wales if it still wants to to exit 
JAN17	Labour must pursue a better Brexit deal, not a second referendum	It is perversely a sign of the government s weakness not its strength that it has inevitably seen off a vote of no confidence All that unites a bitterly fractious Conservative party is panic at the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn led Labour government coming to power in a general election a likelihood many are admirably honest about If Theresa May was confident about the Tories prospects she would risk throwing the dice But Labour started the last election campaign percentage points behind the Tories in the polls and ended two points behind six weeks later Today the polling average has Labour slightly ahead Conservatives fear that a Corbyn led administration would not be like a normal Labour government and would upend an economic consensus established by Margaret Thatcher And they would be right  The media will now attempt to shift the narrative claiming that it is Labour under pressure This is absurd The government has just suffered the biggest parliamentary defeat in the history of British democracy A disastrous near decade of Tory rule has left Britain in its worst combined political and social crisis in modern times the consequence of ideologically driven austerity and catastrophic political decisions by both David Cameron and May Labour will be pilloried for not having a magical solution when there is none to a crisis engineered by its opponents 
JAN17	Amber Rudd’s denial of the benefits crisis takes political spin to a new level	Watching the government jostle to survive this week I couldn t help but think how spin that frantic Thick of It type politics most associated with the Blair years seems almost mild in today s climate In an era in which politicians can now offer facts that openly contradict reality a spin barely seems to cover it  This was surely on Amber Rudd s mind when taking over at the Department for Work and Pensions DWP in November There are few more toxic domestic briefs in government not least because of universal credit Her predecessor Esther McVey tried the direct route simultaneously misleading parliament while accusing critics of peddling fake news 
JAN18	What we don’t talk about when we only talk about Brexit	One of Brexit s more pernicious aspects even before you get to its actual flaws is its tendency to suck all available oxygen unto itself to drain resources that might otherwise have gone elsewhere Before the referendum civil servants warned that such a task untangling years of legal agreements ripping out a delicate web of connections that had become embedded would consume all their energies Naturally their warnings were dismissed as Project Fear But even the head of Vote Leave Dominic Cummings before he took on the form of Benedict Cumberbatch conceded via Twitter that leaving the European Union would present the British state with the hardest job since beating Nazis  Just think of what else we could have done with all that time and money including the bn we re spending to guard against the entirely avoidable and self inflicted calamity of a no deal crash out from the EU The effort we could have made for jobs or housing or to repair the damage inflicted by austerity the work that could have been done to improve life for those left behind by three decades of change globalisation and automation But Whitehall didn t have the bandwidth Governments might be able to walk and chew gum at the same time but walking while shooting yourself in both feet that it turns out is impossible 
JAN18	How a Cotswolds river became a name that defined history	Sometime in a friendly chain of events not untypical of India took me to a shipping office in Kolkata there to meet the nephew of an Anglo Indian woman I had met quite casually a month or two earlier in Bihar It was dusk The office was in a large gloomy building by the river Unshaded bulbs shed a yellow light on walls decorated with calendars from companies that made ceiling fans and water pumps but there was also a picture of a ship with a black and white funnel and a bow wave creasing a blue sea SS Nuddea said the caption  Nuddea It had been a big name in my childhood My father had sailed on an earlier Nuddea owned by the same shipping line the British India Steam Navigation Company and the family album had pictures of him aboard in his white tropical uniform Not a very smart ship one of the workaday N class Nerbudda Nowshera that tramped slowly to Australia and back my father had wanted a berth on one of the bigger M class Madura Modasa that took passengers as well as cargo Nevertheless I had thought proudly of the Nuddea as Daddy s ship and never imagined that the name could represent anything beyond a cargo steamer built in Glasgow in 
JAN18	Second referendum campaigners’ biggest problem? The ‘elitist’ tag	Short of being photographed skiing at Davos with Bono nothing says global elite like trotting up the steps to your very own private plane  So no wonder Channel pounced delightedly on the revelation that Nigel Farage recently chartered a private jet to reach Strasbourg in an interview with the man himself that swiftly went viral Who s the man of the people now eh 
JAN18	Theresa May will do anything for love, but she won’t do that, or that, or that …	For better or for worse one of post imperial Britain s favoured methods of understanding itself has been through the prism of the royal family We come together at royal weddings and jubilees some like to say while others do so in front of box sets of The Crown Brexit on the other hand has long been a straight up car metaphor Cars are far and away the most popular way of understanding what might be happening to us Remainers warn of a car being driven off a cliff or of Theresa May running out of road Brexiteers talk of taking the wheel and the open road  Sensationally these two streams have crossed DON T CROSS THE STREAMS in the matter of Prince Philip s road accident The crash widely believed to have been orchestrated by Mohamed Al Fayed and MI though you won t read that in the mainstream media comes at a moment of high Brexit drama And looking at HRH s upturned vehicle I wonder what its import can be other than that certain things might be regarded as recklessly beyond the capabilities of our decrepit political system 
JAN18	Why are people cheering for no deal? Because they’re thinking about it the wrong way	There are moments in life when your heart sinks I had one last night right at the start of my terrifying debut on Question Time Isabel Oakeshott had just said we should leave the EU with no deal And the audience cheered Not a subdued start of the evening not quite warmed up cheer But a roar A loud one Shit I thought Do I dare point out the problems with this Because there are problems aplenty  Metaphors matter And Brexit has become a metaphorical cornucopia if you see what I mean Perhaps nowhere is this more true and more damagingly and misleadingly so than when it comes to the question of no deal 
JAN18	It was never about Europe. Brexit is Britain’s reckoning with itself	At least the Sun thrives on chaos The savage parliamentary mauling of Britain s withdrawal agreement with the European Union allowed Rupert Murdoch s pet tabloid to unveil on Wednesday morning a front page of grandly gleeful malevolence Under the headline Brextinct it conjured a creepy chimera of Theresa May s head pasted on to the body of a dodo But the thing about such surreal pictures is that it is not easy to control their interpretation From the outside this one seemed to suggest much more than the immediately intended message that both May and her deal are politically dead When it prompted one to ask did Brextinction really happen Was this strange creature ever really alive or was it not always a grotesquely Photoshopped image of something else a crisis of belonging that has attached itself to the wrong union Do the events of this week point us not towards the EU but to the travails of a radically disunited kingdom  The dodo after all may be proverbially dead but it has a vivid afterlife in that great trawl of the English unconscious Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland It is the Dodo when various characters have fallen into a pool of tears who suggests how they might dry themselves the Caucus race There was no One two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over However when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the Dodo suddenly called out The race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking But who has won 
JAN18	These Steiner ‘failures’ are really a failure of the free school agenda	Ofsted inspectors have found three of the UK s four Steiner state schools inadequate in reports that will be published this week Their core concerns are believed to be safeguarding bullying and a lack of support for children with special educational needs A number of private Steiner schools have also been deemed inadequate  In a brilliant primer written in when free schools were still a jewel in the crown of the coalition government the BBC journalist Chris Cook described the core controversies that might be thrown up by Steiner schools At that point and to this day these are mainly private schools In a way the handful that opened on the state s dollar were the apotheosis of Michael Gove s promise to parents if you want to replicate a private education even at its very wackiest and you have the energy you have our blessing 
JAN18	‘Back in 2019, Britain was much larger’: what the history books will say	It s always odd when politicians make an appeal to the history books it s like an actor making an appeal to reviewers midway through the film But it took on a new surreal meaning on Monday when Theresa May asked us to consider what the history books would say about the vote on her deal  It takes truly great commitment to your own mediocrity to sort through a catalogue of your own mistakes find the largest and most avoidable and then tell the gods of history that yep this national humiliation is the way you want future generations to remember you It s like calling up the Oxford English Dictionary and requesting that to cock something up irrevocably to the point that people feel a pang of despair when they hear your name be for ever known as doing a Theresa 
JAN18	Cate Blanchett’s S&M; play is just the shock that tepid theatre needs	If you love theatre and want to read a measured review of a play that you can go and see stop right here The play that I am talking about Martin Crimp s When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other which I feel could be the title of much of what I have sat through in the theatre is one you are unlikely to see either It is at the National Theatre and is completely sold out Tickets could only be obtained by public ballot It stars Cate Blanchett who is of course bloody wonderful and is full of sex and violence  I am not a theatre buff though I have been a film critic but most of what I have seen in the theatre in the last years has been mediocre beyond belief I love Beckett and recently loved the Pinter revival But what is so brilliant about Pinter is how much fear and menace he conjures just off stage Every line a threat every character is implicit in the horror Its not in your face it just gets in your head 
JAN18	The great thing about my coming out later in life? Nobody judged me	I first came out in my early s following a destructive affair with a colleague Coming out was not nearly as stressful as recovering from the affair or the period surrounding it during which I questioned and eventually began to understand my sexuality I had been married for years to the father of my children and the changes these realisations brought about were complicated and challenging to navigate  I had wondered about my sexuality after my second child was born in my mid s but due to the trauma of my brother s suicide at around that time all my emotional energy was taken up with surviving alongside parenting small children and depression By the time I fell for the woman at work I had lost any remaining affection for my husband and the chaos of an affair was a distraction from my emotional emptiness I remember thinking Fuck it I ve got nothing left to lose and throwing myself headlong into the affair ending my relationship with my husband within about a fortnight 
JAN19	Its compass smashed, the ghost ship Brexit sails into ever darker waters	The curse on the crew of the Flying Dutchman damned them to sail the seas for eternity with no hope of ever reaching port It came to mind during the dark tempests in which parliament first dismasted the government by rejecting its Brexit deal and then voted to leave that same government afloat In the hope of gathering some intelligence about how the captain of the Brexit ghost ship intends to navigate her way out of this hell I turned to a senior and clever Tory who is a close shipmate of the prime minister How will it end Came his sagacious reply I haven t got a fucking clue  This much we do know At pm on March one of three things must happen Britain will crash out of the EU without a withdrawal agreement or a transition period This will mean the overnight termination of decades of legal and trading agreements with both our continent and the rest of the world an outcome that will deal severe reputational damage to this country and unleash disruption for which it is not at all prepared Or Britain s politicians will have to collectively confess that they cannot find a solution and seek to prolong or revoke the withdrawal process damning us to sail on without landfall in sight unless this is accompanied by the promise of another referendum to resolve the deadlock Or parliament will very hard against the deadline finally give its approval to something This may not be a safe harbour but the approval of a withdrawal agreement would be a port of sorts until the beginning of the next stage of the negotiations covering future relations 
JAN19	Cut tuition fees and you shut the door to poor students	Last week universities in England were preparing reports on how they have diversified their student populations These reports will be submitted to the director of fair access at the Office for Students My university King s College London will report happily that our undergraduate intake is now state school more than ethnic minority and has the fastest growing population of low income students in the Russell Group  And what has made all this progress and vital work possible The very thing that many believe to be the enemy of educational opportunity tuition fees 
JAN19	Council houses were once a glory of the public realm. Let’s return to those days	Build more council homes Not so long ago this idea was although not new radical So thoroughly had Margaret Thatcher schooled the nation in the virtues of private property that decades after her departure it still seemed outlandish to mainstream politicians to go back to what had been the main way of addressing housing need Now as it has finally sunk in that the private sector cannot will not and should not be expected to fill all the gaps in the supply of homes even Conservative politicians are calling for local authorities to be given the powers to do so instead  However whenever the case is made it raises the obvious question which is where to find the money Everyone knows that housing is expensive Everyone knows or did before it was found that national wealth can be frittered and forsworn in the great Brexit adventure that the government has been in the grip of austerity for all of this decade It s a reasonable point 
JAN19	The Tories now treat the nation as they have long treated the poor	Brexit did not come from nowhere The jerry built utopianism the indifference to and ignorance of how the British live and what they need to keep them safe the know nothing pride in ignorant generalisations and the cocksure love of sweeping solutions have their roots in the right that emerged a decade ago  Before the Brexiters wrecked the country they wrecked the lives of the poor Universal credit was the Conservatives fantasy when they took power Iain Duncan Smith offered a dream so seductive that even his natural critics could not find it in their hearts to condemn him unequivocally His grand project would remove disincentives to work It would simplify the complicated and create a benefits system that was a doorway to real aspiration and achievement 
JAN19	Here’s me and the Mona Lisa. Who says that art and selfies can’t mix?	So there you are having worked your way through a crowd denser than a Brexit negotiation standing in front of your prize The Mona Lisa in the Louvre What do you do Look more closely at that enigmatic smile Wonder at the subtle gradations of light and shadow in Leonardo s rendering of the face Admire the illusion of depth  No of course not You turn your back on the painting whip out your phone and take a selfie And then you move on to your next prize 
JAN19	Why it sticks in the craw to see billionaire Trump ‘slumming it’	It comes to something when the perfect way to demonstrate wealth and status is by slumming it with junk food  First up President Donald Trump Finding himself without catering staff oh you know the shutdown unpleasantness for a visit from the Clemson University football team Trump piled tables with his beloved takeaway burgers various brands Or as he initially tweeted hamberders stinking and steaming away in polystyrene cartons presumably after so many hours giving off the kind of whiff you d associate with an unregulated abattoir in a heatwave 
JAN19	Jasmin Paris’s amazing feat gives new meaning to endurance	Last week Jasmin Paris won the Montane Spine Race for which the word gruelling seems horribly inadequate Like Diana Nyad swimming from Cuba to Florida at the age of or Serena Williams winning her rd grand slam there are some feats of human endurance that scramble the mind and running miles along the Pennine Way is one of them  But these triumphs go beyond personal victories They should lift our collective spirit because sometimes people are incredible and how wonderful it is to be reminded of that 
JAN19	What we don’t talk about when we only talk about Brexit	One of Brexit s more pernicious aspects even before you get to its actual flaws is its tendency to suck all available oxygen unto itself to drain resources that might otherwise have gone elsewhere Before the referendum civil servants warned that such a task untangling years of legal agreements ripping out a delicate web of connections that had become embedded would consume all their energies Naturally their warnings were dismissed as Project Fear But even the head of Vote Leave Dominic Cummings before he took on the form of Benedict Cumberbatch conceded via Twitter that leaving the European Union would present the British state with the hardest job since beating Nazis  Just think of what else we could have done with all that time and money including the bn we re spending to guard against the entirely avoidable and self inflicted calamity of a no deal crash out from the EU The effort we could have made for jobs or housing or to repair the damage inflicted by austerity the work that could have been done to improve life for those left behind by three decades of change globalisation and automation But Whitehall didn t have the bandwidth Governments might be able to walk and chew gum at the same time but walking while shooting yourself in both feet that it turns out is impossible 
JAN19	May I have a word about… Marcelo Bielsa	What a truly extraordinary week in the febrile world of the B word I refer not to the pustulant Bercow or the vexatious Brexit but the Leeds United head coach Marcelo Bielsa  If you missed this story and I really can t credit that your mind has been elsewhere a brief recap An official from the club was collared for spying on their opponents Derby County prompting a veritable deluge of outrage and opprobrium quite in keeping with an event that shook the noble game to its very foundations feel free to add your own cataclysmic cliche 
JAN19	How a Cotswolds river became a name that defined history	Sometime in a friendly chain of events not untypical of India took me to a shipping office in Kolkata there to meet the nephew of an Anglo Indian woman I had met quite casually a month or two earlier in Bihar It was dusk The office was in a large gloomy building by the river Unshaded bulbs shed a yellow light on walls decorated with calendars from companies that made ceiling fans and water pumps but there was also a picture of a ship with a black and white funnel and a bow wave creasing a blue sea SS Nuddea said the caption  Nuddea It had been a big name in my childhood My father had sailed on an earlier Nuddea owned by the same shipping line the British India Steam Navigation Company and the family album had pictures of him aboard in his white tropical uniform Not a very smart ship one of the workaday N class Nerbudda Nowshera that tramped slowly to Australia and back my father had wanted a berth on one of the bigger M class Madura Modasa that took passengers as well as cargo Nevertheless I had thought proudly of the Nuddea as Daddy s ship and never imagined that the name could represent anything beyond a cargo steamer built in Glasgow in 
JAN20	England’s rebel spirit is rising – and it wants a no-deal Brexit	In my innocence I didn t expect many people to be in a central Portsmouth Wetherspoons at am on a Friday morning But there they all were in their droves passionate supporters of Brexit there to hear the pub chain s founder and chairman Tim Martin make the case for Britain leaving the EU with no deal Martin has been on the road since November with the aim of visiting at least of his boozers The day we crossed paths he was traversing the south coast moving on to Southampton and Weymouth given that it has whetted the appetite of what remains of the country s local press drawn large crowds and shifted huge amounts of food and drink the whole thing looks to have been an unlikely success  Martin s case was unconvincing to the point of tedium a half argument that ignored what a no deal Brexit would mean for British exports and too blithely dismissed all those concerns about supply chains and chaos at UK ports let alone what a no deal scenario would mean for the island of Ireland But on the level of political sociology the spectacle presented was compelling the hardest of the Brexit hardcore many of them on the pints and riled to snapping point before the speech even got going and then taken into incandescence by the posse of local Liberal Democrats interrupting Martin s speech at every turn 
JAN20	We can’t leave a no-deal decision in the hands of wiped-out Theresa May	It is nothing less than despicable that when our opposition and our government can clearly see they need to work together to get us out of this Brexit chaos they are refusing to do so And that means Theresa May could quite conceivably allow Britain to exit the EU without a deal without any serious plans in place and without reference to parliament To prevent a no deal outcome requires MPs to proactively replace this legal default position with something else  If the court case I brought against the government over article was about anything at all it was about parliamentary sovereignty That meant the will of the overwhelming majority of our MPs should prevail on the major issues of the day It is their duty to represent their constituency their party and the interests of the country It is a tenet of representative democracy that MPs are not delegates for their constituents This means that their decisions and actions are ultimately governed by putting the best interests of all their constituency before all else 
JAN20	Where are George Clooney and co now that Sudan needs them?	In a US law firm signed a contract with the Sudanese government to assist in efforts to lift the economic sanctions that had been suffocating the country since Within weeks George Clooney and John Prendergast veteran activists for human rights in Sudan wrote a letter in Time magazine objecting to this They asked rhetorically did the law firm s senior ranks filled with ex senators and congressmen not know that president Omar al Bashir s regime had committed mass atrocities That it was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Darfur That it persecuted Christians The question of their firm working in the service of such a brutal and vile regime can only be answered by the simplest of terms they concluded Probably they just don t know  The sanctions were lifted but it made little difference The world had forgotten Sudan and was in no rush to be reminded All that was associated with the country ticked off neatly in the Clooney Prendergast letter was unsavoury So allow me to remind you For the past four weeks Sudan has been seized by a popular uprising on the part of a people that has been suffering under a brutal dictatorship for years and from the effects of the global human rights machine that cut them off from the world for 
JAN20	Opioids don’t work for chronic pain. So why do we still prescribe them?	One of the key principles you learn in medical school is that doctors should do no harm But what should doctors do when our patients insist that we do things that we know are harmful This is the dilemma that thousands of doctors face on a daily basis when tasked with helping patients with chronic pain  Pain is a universal human experience that alerts us to bodily harm Most pain is transient and requires no specific intervention other than the passage of time For more severe acute pain pain that lasts hours days or weeks and cancer pain at the end of life modern medicine has several very effective treatments pills injections and the like But chronic pain which persists for months or years is a very different entity 
JAN20	It’s the defining issue of Brexit, but who understands Northern Ireland?	Have you ever visited Northern Ireland You should go it s a fascinating place In fact if it were less fascinating that is to say less complicated then the UK s departure from the EU would have been easier You have that to thank us or resent us for  Before you visit you should familiarise yourself with some of the basic geography First of all where is Northern Ireland Obviously it s in Ireland but only in one version of Ireland It is on the island of Ireland but not in the political state legally named Ireland So it s in Britain Not quite it is not on the island of Britain but it is in the United Kingdom the state often referred to as Britain It can therefore be described as being in both Britain and Ireland one politically and the other physically But unpack that sentence further it is not on the island of Britain or in the state of Ireland It is neither and both at the same time 
JAN20	The lure of ancient Egypt is a way to revitalise faded industrial towns	Museums teach us to dream Since the Victorian age it s been Egyptian mummies matched only by dinosaurs that have captivated children Being taken to see the mummies is a rite of passage and one accessible across the country not just to those in London who have the British Museum on their doorstep But local authority culture budgets are being slashed so how can regional arts institutions survive What should they do about the pressure to return looted objects And how do they show their relevance to modern audiences  I have been exploring the history of three northern Egyptian museums which have four remarkable Victorian women at the heart of their story For those looking for entries for one of those currently popular anthologies of plucky rebel ladies from history they all fit the bill 
JAN20	A citizens’ assembly is now the only way to break the Brexit deadlock	Parliament must inflict a second defeat on the government by voting next Tuesday to extend article for a year Not as a delaying tactic but for a purpose to enable a process of nationwide consultation and reflection Key to this would be a series of citizens assemblies whose thinking would then lead to constructive reconsideration by parliament of our relations with Europe including the option of a renegotiation followed by a referendum  The direct engagement of the British people is now essential in order to address the triple challenge of a government defying the sovereignty of parliament an ever more divided country and mounting distrust between parliament and people 
JAN20	How admirable that MPs want to amend Brexit. It won’t work	Constitutional folklore is notoriously unreliable Liberal statesman John Bright for instance did not as is so often claimed declare in that the British legislature was the mother of all parliaments That particular distinction he accorded to England Likewise and more importantly it is not true that parliament is sovereign That authority is vested in the Queen in parliament which is to say ministers of the Crown acting in tandem with the Commons and the Lords The question always is where the balance between government and parliament lies  Since the second world war the general trend has been towards the aggregation of power in the executive In former lord high chancellor Lord Hailsham went as far as saying we live in an elective dictatorship Tony Blair s chief of staff Jonathan Powell spoke of the creation of a Napoleonic state Yet last week s historic defeat of Theresa May s Brexit deal in the Commons was a milestone in a quiet counter revolution Ever since Iraq parliament has assumed that it has a right of veto over any significant declaration of military hostilities select committees though still no match for their US counterparts have flexed their muscles 
JAN20	There’s one thing that really puts me off veganism: Peta	I ve been vegetarian for ages and have been considering going vegan One reason I haven t yet is pizza vegan cheese is a crime against tastebuds Another thing putting me off is Peta The animal rights organisation seems to launch itself into the headlines every few months with an obnoxious advertising campaign that makes vegans look like pea brains with whom no right minded person would want to be associated  Peta s latest act of tofu terrorism is a new ad centred around masculinity Traditional masculinity is DEAD it announces The secret to male sexual stamina is veggies It brought this thesis to life with a puerile video featuring men vigorously waving vegetable genitalia Nothing has ever made me want to eat a carrot less Or an aubergine Congrats Peta you ve put me off fruit and veg I m craving a hamberder as I believe the meat treats are called in the White House 
JAN20	It's heartwarming to hear MPs speaking up for press freedom	In too many countries it is open season on journalists Ruling politicians acting like the monarchs of regimes past openly denigrate the men and women who seek to hold them to account and thereby encourage their citizens to follow suit The most obvious example is US president Donald Trump and his declaration that journalists are enemies of the people purveying fake news  Presidents and prime ministers elsewhere have taken his lead from Turkey s Recep Tayyip Erdo an jailer at the last count of journalists to Hungary s Viktor Orb n who deals with critical media outlets by buying them up and closing them down and on to the Czech president Milo Zeman who thought it amusing to hold up a mock assault rifle labelled for journalists 
JAN21	No-deal Brexit is a Dad’s Army parody and I refuse to stockpile	Plan B No just B for Back to Brussels to Beg a Better Backstop not even Botoxing her old plan A Theresa May does not surprise Wild rumours that she might dash for another election or resign mid crisis fooled no one Why expect better If she pretended to listen to flotillas of visitors imploring her to see sense change course stop the madness then she wore earplugs Of course nothing changed However she has every reason for intransigence strapped to her pilot seat clamped in irons Move an inch on the customs union soften a red line and she would haemorrhage Tory MPs winning few from Labour Kate Hoey may cavort at Jacob Rees Mogg s Bollinger bash at his home to celebrate May s vote defeat but entices no fellow Labour MPs  As the captive prime minister in name only runs the clock down closer to a nuclear no deal how terrified should we be Pay attention when her own business minister Richard Harrington MP warns that it would be such an absolute disaster that he would resign warning of car industry collapse if supply chains were cut Some cabinet ministers would walk too rather than take the blame for needless carnage Every day brings more bad news the International Air Transport Association warns that m sold airline tickets could be cancelled no deal means no extra flights above last year s quota 
JAN21	Prince Philip’s crash should mark a turning point in our royal sycophancy	So much is made of the harm that sections of the British media have done to the royals over the years that it often completely overshadows the terrible harm the royals do to the media For something strange and awful seems to come over the industry when tasked with covering the monarchy it becomes servile oddly pious nerdily preoccupied with such things as the dates of building restorations and the royal protocol on tights People are often mean about the BBC s sycophantic royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell but his is a disease that infects anyone who touches his subject  First and perhaps worst is the fixation on detail which serves to make the country look like deranged stalkers convinced their victims are sending them secret love signals through the curtains Take the reaction to the car crash in which the Duke of Edinburgh wasn t injured there were artist s impressions of Philip in its aftermath fact files about the vehicle he was driving stories about the Queen being as usual driven to church in a different car just days after the accident and what it might have meant that Philip wasn t with her 
JAN21	If Russell Brand wants to change the world, he could try changing a few more nappies	I am way too woke to be part of the backlash against Russell Brand which was sparked by an interview this weekend in which he talked about fatherhood I m so woke I was part of the frontlash But you don t really want to cross a man whose revolutionary consciousness involves legal letters so all I can say is well done Swami Russ for reproducing and reaching a higher state of evolution than I imagined possible  After all it is certainly neither right nor sensible to prefer the womanising drug addled Essex thesaurus to his latest incarnation but then I am not here to be right or sensible His voyage towards sobriety may have helped many He rewrote the step programme in his book Recovery married Katy Perry told everyone not to vote in before changing his mind oh and had sex four or five times a day He was beloved by brocialists as he demanded revolution but then he forgot how to be funny He made the political YouTube series The Trews because the bad old MSM mainstream media was not to be trusted

JAN21	Cancer in your 20s is terrifying – too many of us are left to cope alone	When I was diagnosed with leukaemia in aged I was shocked to find out how little survival rates had improved among young people with cancer in recent decades Research had left us forgotten in the middle between children and older adults as one study put it with improvements in outcomes among teens and twentysomethings lagging behind the dramatic advances seen among the general population  So the encouraging trends revealed by last week s Teenage Cancer Trust TCT report the first detailed analysis of to year olds with cancer in the UK are cause for celebration Mortality rates for all cancers in the age group have fallen by almost a third from per million in to per million in Five year survival rates have risen by four percentage points from in females males in to females males in the period 
JAN21	At last, the Elizabeth v Mary catfight trope of history is being reassessed	The argument that history is written by the winners depends on your definition of winning Who wins in the struggle between Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots may seem obvious in the director Josie Rourke s new film with its opening scene of Mary s execution on Elizabeth s orders in February But in naming the film after Mary Rourke and screenwriter Beau Willimon imply that although Elizabeth won the battle over her Scottish cousin it was Mary who triumphed in the longer historical war of sympathy and affection  For the first time in this story s cinematic history the two female leads are directed by a woman who avoids the catfight trope and instead sees Elizabeth and Mary as potentially kindred spirits whose antagonism is manufactured by their fearful and violent male lovers and counsellors

JAN22	Only empathy can break the cycle of violence in Israel-Palestine	Empathy is all about imagining other minds appreciating that different people have different perspectives and responding to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion After a career studying autism and the nature of empathy I see empathy as one of our most valuable natural resources It has particular promise as an approach to conflict resolution one that has advantages over viewing a problem through a chiefly military economic or legal lens  We can see this if we look at the Israel Palestine conflict where both communities have different views of the same historic period both claim the same piece of land and both have valid emotional reactions to the conflict that must be acknowledged I am not an expert in that dispute nor so naive to believe that there is a single simple solution to it But I do believe empathy can help 
JAN22	Katie Price is right. Disabled people shouldn’t be forced off the internet by abuse	What sort of person repeatedly picks on a disabled child in the most vicious and cruel of terms  The answer of course is the sort of people the model Katie Price had in mind when she started campaigning for online abuse to become a specific criminal offence Price s year old son Harvey who is blind autistic and has Prader Willi syndrome has been hideously mocked and taunted His mother quickly gathered more than supportive signatures for a petition demanding online abuse be treated as a hate crime and now the parliamentary petitions committee has accepted her argument that the law isn t fit for purpose or to be precise a part of that argument Price s petition referred not just to disability but to homophobia racism and even body shaming of women the MPs were careful to single out disability alone arguing in their report that they didn t want to cut across the work of others on the rest

JAN22	A year ago I was raped. Here’s what I have learned	On a grey autumn evening in London just over a year ago I went out for drinks with a friend to celebrate a new job Eight hours later I was raped by somebody I d never met before  My assault happened in late when the MeToo movement was still fresh and gaining momentum every day I felt lucky for this Lucky in the way you might feel if you d escaped a house fire thinking you were alone only to find that the people next door had escaped a house fire too In the state of shock that followed which lasted for several months I became obsessed with this new wave of feminism 
JAN22	Brexit is a mess – what would Yes Minister’s Sir Humphrey do?	 What is the function of the civil service To help the government implement its policies But with Brexit the most important constitutional issue for decades every cabinet minister has his or her own policy Without a written constitution and with only norms traditions and precedents to guide us this unprecedented situation has made everyone in government into a headless chicken   I was merely a humble vessel into which ministers the people s representatives poured their thoughts and hopes My job was to help turn this jumble into workable policies no mean task We were loyal to each government and each prime minister in turn supporting their manifestos their hopes and their dreams where practicable whatever our private opinions

JAN22	'Transparency and fairness': Irish readers on why the Citizens' Assembly worked	While the Brexit debacle rumbles ever on several outcomes are on the table including the possibility of a second referendum Some including this newspaper have suggested that if a second referendum were to happen a way forward could be for the UK to follow the model adopted by Ireland to try and break the stalemate over an emotive issue that had dogged its politics for decades abortion  In Ireland s Citizens Assembly was established by parliament to deliberate on a number of issues including gay marriage and the eighth amendment that outlawed abortion The citizen members of the assembly were selected to be electorally representative and included people who were in favour of the change some who were against and some who were undecided The findings were published in a report at the end of and debated in parliament in Though the findings weren t initially popular with the public the result of last year s referendum wanted to repeal the th amendment was very close to the assembly s in favour of having no restrictions on termination in early pregnancy 
JAN22	Justin Welby’s speaking in tongues makes sense to his evangelical tribe	Archbishop Justin Welby s statement to the Christian radio station Premier that he talks in tongues every morning is an appeal using one of the clearest markers to his evangelical tribe Talking in tongues is a streaming babble of nonsense syllables delivered with a curious calm authority as if what the speaker were saying made incontrovertible sense even though it contains no recognisable words It sound like what it probably is the spontaneous operation of the speech producing parts of the brain when they are completely decoupled from the bits that handle language and thought  For believers it is a priceless expression of the presence of the holy spirit It is mentioned in the New Testament and has been the defining feature of the charismatic movement which was the major development of Christianity in the last century 
JAN22	If Russell Brand wants to change the world, he could try changing a few more nappies	I am way too woke to be part of the backlash against Russell Brand which was sparked by an interview this weekend in which he talked about fatherhood I m so woke I was part of the frontlash But you don t really want to cross a man whose revolutionary consciousness involves legal letters so all I can say is well done Swami Russ for reproducing and reaching a higher state of evolution than I imagined possible  After all it is certainly neither right nor sensible to prefer the womanising drug addled Essex thesaurus to his latest incarnation but then I am not here to be right or sensible His voyage towards sobriety may have helped many He rewrote the step programme in his book Recovery married Katy Perry told everyone not to vote in before changing his mind oh and had sex four or five times a day He was beloved by brocialists as he demanded revolution but then he forgot how to be funny He made the political YouTube series The Trews because the bad old MSM mainstream media was not to be trusted 
JAN22	Cancer in your 20s is terrifying – too many of us are left to cope alone	When I was diagnosed with leukaemia in aged I was shocked to find out how little survival rates had improved among young people with cancer in recent decades Research had left us forgotten in the middle between children and older adults as one study put it with improvements in outcomes among teens and twentysomethings lagging behind the dramatic advances seen among the general population  So the encouraging trends revealed by last week s Teenage Cancer Trust TCT report the first detailed analysis of to year olds with cancer in the UK are cause for celebration Mortality rates for all cancers in the age group have fallen by almost a third from per million in to per million in Five year survival rates have risen by four percentage points from in females males in to females males in the period 
JAN23	Could this local experiment be the start of a national transformation?	If there is hope it lies here in the most deprived borough in London Barking and Dagenham has shocking levels of unemployment homelessness teenage pregnancy domestic violence and early death Until it was the main stronghold of the British National party Its population turns over at astonishing speed every year about of residents move out But over the past year it has started to become known for something else as a global leader in taking back control  Since the second world war councils and national governments have sought to change people s lives from the top down Their efforts during the first years of this period at least were highly effective creating public services public housing and a social safety net that radically improved people s lives 
JAN23	The only Brexit compromise I can see coming is a bad one	Brexit is a reminder that two connected things need to happen in order for a political compromise to stick First partisan leaders must decide that it is better than any other achievable outcome Second the public must also converge to give it their backing One movement towards the treaty table without the other doesn t cut it  The Northern Ireland peace process was a classic example of this dual process It took many years before mutually antagonistic political leaders decided that a peace deal was better than an unwinnable war But it took even longer for the two communities in Northern Ireland to begin to make the same move The peace process only worked because the political deal was followed by referendums that endorsed it 
JAN23	Think another general election is unlikely? Think again	Could a general election be looming It might seem unlikely Last time Theresa May dissolved parliament she had a point lead and higher personal ratings than Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair in their pomp Labour had suffered one of its worst postwar defeats just two years earlier And yet the Conservatives lost their majority This time round Labour are ahead in several polls Jeremy Corbyn s team though tired after their journey from the political wilderness to the epicentre of the greatest political upheaval since the war will begin an election with far more experience than last time As senior Conservative officials have pointed out to the Sun Tory seats are held by a margin of less than with Labour in second place in of them How would voters view the fourth national vote in five years the fifth for Scottish voters Brenda from Bristol would be considerably more irate this time Would Tory MPs really let May take their party into an election just weeks after of them voted against her leadership Are they not uniquely fearful of a Corbyn government which they rightly judge to be a totally different prospect to a normal Labour administration  And yet May s Brexit deal has suffered the biggest defeat in the history of British democracy If she halved the margin of defeat in another vote it would still find a place in the five worst parliamentary routs How on earth is she supposed to turn a vote deficit into a victory of at least one in a matter of weeks She won t get a meaningful concession on the backstop from the EU how will she get the DUP all the hard Brexiteers of the Tory ERG and Tory remainers on side Jacob Rees Mogg is showing signs of surrender to May but a hardcore would not follow him If she is expecting mass Labour defections to back her deal disappointment beckons May is in an impossible situation of her own making 
JAN23	Wealthy Brexiteers like James Dyson are jumping ship. Why might that be?	Let s give James Dyson the benefit of the doubt Let s take at face value the assurances issued by his multibillion pound company whose products involve the generation of hot air as to why it is relocating its headquarters from Wiltshire to Singapore  Apparently it has nothing to do with Brexit What s more it s barely a move at all since it will see only two people both top executives actually moving to Singapore Dyson will continue to employ people in the UK many of them in research and development and the relocation is really just about wanting to keep a closer eye on the firm s investments in Asia That it chose to do that in Singapore where companies pay a mere in tax rather than say India or South Korea is surely pure coincidence 
JAN23	Let us condemn the heresy of workspaces in churches	Walking through Camden Town in north London recently a place whose countercultural relevance dwindled sometime between the Libertines first and second albums I came across a building labelled WORK LIFE plus the slogan Because life s too short  It seemed to symbolise everything that the late cultural theorist Mark Fisher meant when he coined the phrase boring dystopia WORK LIFE is one of those hubs for freelancers or digital nomads a handy phrase if that green juice cleanse isn t providing the quite the level of purging that your body desires Don t flush yet though there s more Nestled in one of London s most iconic postcodes there s plenty of creative spirit here as well as a punk rock approach to business 
JAN23	To those leaving Labour: if you want to stop Brexit, stay and fight	If some reports are to be believed large numbers of Labour members are leaving the party because of its position on Brexit The suggested figure of people walking away is difficult to corroborate and has been strenuously rebutted by the party But Labour s resistance to backing a fresh referendum despite the overwhelming view of its members has undeniably prompted some to leave  Labour cannot afford to be blase about the size and morale of its membership The maths is simple to win a general election Labour will have to pull off a ground campaign bigger than it did in Around three quarters of its members want a fresh referendum If there is a chasm between the views of members and the strategy of the leadership on such a defining issue Labour s ground troops will be demoralised and it will lose This process will rot away at the Corbyn project pushing thousands of new members into inactivity or into the arms of Labour s old establishment 
JAN23	We’ll never see a cross-party deal on Brexit: tribalism runs too deep	Imagination agility empathy diplomacy all the qualities of an effective negotiator that Theresa May lacks She was unsuited to the task of getting a good deal in Brussels and now looks incapable of steering a bad deal through parliament But the prime minister is not without skill She has an exceptional ability to drain the drama from a crisis to eke dullness out of an emergency It is practically a superpower Only May could make a live broadcast in a drastic breaking news situation feel as missable as a daytime repeat As one former Downing Street aide tells it May has one political technique that she applies to every situation She just grinds you down  It seemed inconceivable that May would try to rehabilitate her Brexit plan after it was rejected in the biggest Commons defeat for a sitting government in modern times MPs on all sides cheered the deal s annihilation believing that the scale of the shock would jolt the prime minister into a change of course It has not May returned to parliament this week looking like an earthquake survivor unable to take in the magnitude of the devastation pottering numbly around a ruined house rehanging pictures on half collapsed walls perching ornaments on the rubble that was once a mantelpiece 
JAN23	Medical advice on the pill was wrong for 60 years. How convenient to blame the pope	Earlier this month updated guidelines from the Faculty of Sexual Reproductive Healthcare FSRH indicated that the seven day break commonly recommended in most contraceptive pill regimens has no health benefits Under the new guidelines people taking the pill are free to reduce or stop this pause allowing them to skip their monthly bleeds  Understandably these changes were widely reported by the media with most reports suggesting an unusual explanation for the original recommendation of the hormone free break Speaking to the Telegraph Professor John Guillebaud of University College London said The gynaecologist John Rock devised the break because he hoped that the pope would accept the pill and make it acceptable for Catholics to use Rock thought if it did imitate the natural cycle then the pope would accept it 
JAN23	For the EU to prosper, Britain must leave	Until recently I was a committed remainer and wedded to the belief that the best way out of this Brexit mess for the EU was simply to try to ensure it didn t happen But the events of the past month illustrate why there is rightly a growing mood in Brussels for a completely different outcome for the EU to prosper Britain must leave  The rationale is simple Brexit is either now or in the not so distant future inevitable That is because Britain continues to demand impossible conditions for its membership of the community based compromise led multinational organisation the modern EU represents Even in trying to exit Britain is still arguing about red lines of its own making This approach would only amplify if it somehow ended up remaining a member Britain already enjoys a privileged position in the EU much to the chagrin of many other member states Opt outs from the euro the Schengen agreement on passport free travel the charter of fundamental rights and on any European legislation related to freedom justice and security have all been negotiated by successive British prime ministers 
JAN23	Panic is on the agenda at Davos – but it’s too little too late	Pity the poor billionaire for today he feels a new and unsettling emotion fear The world order he once clung to is crumbling faster than the value of the pound In its place he frets will come chaos Remember this as the plutocrats gather this week high above us in the ski resort of Davos they are terrified  Whatever dog eared platitudes they may recycle for the TV cameras what grips them is the havoc far below Just look at the new report from the summit organisers that begins by asking plaintively Is the world sleepwalking into a crisis In the accompanying survey of a thousand bosses money men because finance like wealth is still mainly a male thing and other Davos decision makers nine out of say they fear a trade war or other economic confrontation between major powers Most confess to mounting anxieties about populist and nativist agendas and public anger against elites As the cause of this political earthquake they identify two shifting tectonic plates climate change and increasing polarisation of societies 
JAN24	Is there a ‘right’ way to deal with children who commit crimes?	How does an year old boy end up alone in a London police cell Eleven years old for heaven s sake That means either still in primary school or at best in the nervous beginnings of secondary Eleven still says muddy knees flapping around in a blazer several sizes too big and wanting a bedtime story or at least it does for the parents of the lucky children Life is not like that for every year old however and it is the unlucky ones who are perhaps most likely to end up in the bowels of a police station His solicitor didn t say what he was accused of doing when she posted on Twitter earlier this week that no child should be in a cell Period Her point was that a custody suite is no place for a kid that small no matter what they might have done  But the mind makes leaps anyway Children as young as nine have been found carrying knives Gangs organising so called county lines operations running drugs from the inner city deep out into rural towns have been known to recruit from primary schools 
JAN24	If Brexit Britain wants Europe to listen, it must learn to speak European	An old New Yorker cartoon shows a middle aged man at a drinks party saying to another But that s enough about you let s talk about me This is Brexit Britain talking to the rest of Europe To be sure all nations are obsessed with their own affairs A Polish joke has it that the entry for elephant in the encyclopedia reads the elephant and the Polish question But most European countries have at least some accompanying sensitivity to what is going on around them  I wonder how many people in Westminster this week even knew that the leaders of France and Germany were signing a new treaty of cooperation in Aachen that the French president Emmanuel Macron deeply shaken by the level of support for the gilets jaunes protests had launched a national debate much like the one being called for in Britain that Poland had been shaken by the senseless murder of the liberal pro European mayor of Gda sk Pawe Adamowicz in an atmosphere of partisan conflict so bitter that the nation could not even unite in the face of such tragedy Reflecting all this turmoil the whole continent is gearing up for European elections in May which will be a battle royal between two fundamentally different visions of the European future a conservative nationalist one spearheaded by the Hungarian Viktor Orb n and the Italian Matteo Salvini and a more liberal internationalist one represented by the much weakened Aachen duo of Macron and Angela Merkel Orb n and Salvini don t intend to leave the EU they intend to run it So it s not just the future of the UK that will be decided this year it s also the future of Europe 
JAN24	How the right tricked people into supporting rampant inequality	Why don t people rebel The wonder of decades of rising inequality across the west is how placidly people put up with it UK wages are still below levels and a growing sector of jobs are nasty non unionised achingly hard with workers treated worse the boot on the employer s foot despite low unemployment You might call Brexit a kind of protest but that can be overdone The vote was swung largely by comfortable older Tory voters in the shires led or misled by privileged ideologues  Those on the progressive left have been perplexed that rising social injustice hasn t led to much sign of the oppressed rising up either at the ballot box or through more physical acts of protest New research out on Wednesday suggests some explanations though these will be of precious little comfort Looking at surveys across western countries since the s Dr Jonathan Mijs of the London School of Economics International Inequalities Institute monitors how as countries become less equal attitudes of the majority shift in the wrong direction 
JAN24	What does Boris Johnson have to do to stop people giving him money?	In the comedy website Funny Or Die published a patriarchy lampooning video called hours of walking around New York City as a man The white male subject of said video walks around city streets being complimented high fived and offered everything from jobs to Starbucks gift cards By the end he is being carried around on a makeshift throne by adoring passersby dressed in a crown and sceptre while his new subjects chant King King King  Do you think that s what Boris Johnson s life is like I ask because it emerged yesterday that our former foreign secretary was given a donation by JCB before delivering a speech at the company s headquarters a speech that contained four mentions of the company was given in front of a large JCB vehicle and was plastered across the news 
JAN24	Donald Trump’s ship of fools is heading for the rocks in Venezuela	Donald Trump s implicit threat of direct US military intervention in Venezuela is a high risk gamble that could backfire calamitously By publicly and aggressively backing the opposition s bid to supplant him Trump has presented Nicol s Maduro the country s incumbent president with a very personal existential challenge  If Maduro reacts as he has in the past by using violence to suppress his opponents or if he arrests US diplomats who ignore his order to leave the country Trump may face a daunting choice between rapid escalation including possibly sending in US forces and a humiliating climbdown 
JAN24	Clooney and Prendergast: We're not silent on Sudan – we're going after the regime's loot	 Where are George Clooney and co now that Sudan needs them asked an Opinion article in the Guardian this week The oped assumed that a lack of public statements by us and others with a long association with Darfur Sudan more broadly and South Sudan meant that we were doing nothing in response to the Sudanese regime s brutal crackdown of escalating protests throughout the country  This is indeed a critical moment in Sudan s fraught history The people of Sudan are rightly leading demands for change and we believe our role is to support the cause of human rights for Sudanese people by using strategic and tactical advocacy in Europe the US and Africa focused on key points of leverage As the demonstrations have unfolded this past month our entire team has continuously engaged officials in governments around the world to take measures to hold the Bashir regime accountable Much of this advocacy is not done in public 
JAN24	He may dress up as a firefighter. But Matteo Salvini is no saviour	A few weeks ago Matteo Salvini the interior minister and leader of Italy s far right League party conducted a press conference wearing the full uniform of Italy s fire and rescue helicopter crew More recently he wore a jacket belonging to the country s mountain rescue unit another time a firefighter s uniform Images of him in a police jacket are plastered all over his Instagram account he s frequently sighted wearing this outfit at political rallies Clearly Salvini is not a policeman a firefighter or a member of Italy s mountain rescue crew  Saturating his social media feeds with pictures of him in these costumes is part of an elaborate ploy Nicknamed the captain by his supporters this wardrobe projects the vision of powerful leadership his fans crave When he started out it s worth noting Salvini resisted the more traditional outfits of political life wearing sweaters and hoodies rather than suits to such an extent that his opponents dubbed him Felpetta a twist on the Italian term for sweater felpa or even Felpetta Nera a play on the infamous Italian fascist anthem Faccetta Nera

JAN24	The Brexit nightmare is entirely the Tories' fault. Don't blame Labour	There isn t much that s funny about Brexit At least not funny ha ha But there is one aspect of it that is at least curious that this act of national foot shooting has resulted in quite so many people putting the blame for it on the two main political parties even though only one of them has been in power since  Scroll through the comments or tweets on any story about Brexit and the online rage from remainers splits evenly I ll never vote Labour again if they facilitate Brexit in any form is a fairly representative comment as is the idea that supporting Labour means Brexit catastrophe When I tweeted an observation on this I was told Both parties own this mess that there are those of us who will never vote Tory but also never vote Labour because they have enabled the whole thing and that the main parties were uncaring about voters thoughts on the EU 
JAN24	Nancy Pelosi is an alien species to Trump – and he has no idea what to do	Donald Trump might be the worst president in American history but with his incompetence belligerence and intellectual deficits come a perverse advantage it s tough to shame someone who has no shame it s hard to hold a man accountable for a lie when he doesn t care if he s a liar you can t chasten someone for breaking the rules when he never believed the rules applied to him  But while Trump has snaked and slithered his way in and out of scandal corruption and self dealing his entire life there s one force that seems to truly destabilize him a competent woman Which is why in the Trump era there s no better speaker of the House than Nancy Pelosi 
JAN25	Fight for Europe – or the wreckers will destroy it	The idea of Europe is in peril  From all sides there are criticisms insults and desertions from the cause 
JAN25	Anti-vaxxers are thriving – because we live in a fact-phobic wild west	Half of all parents have seen anti vaccination messages on social media according to a report from the Royal Society for Public Health It s not all bad news of parents still have the sense to get their children vaccinated whatever they read just as almost all Mumsnet users mainly stay in secure family units rather than moving to all female communes despite the proliferation of fake news on the site about what husbands are like  Yet of course this is serious measles upon which the anti vaxxer conspiracy so often alights requires of the population in order for the inoculation to hold This is only true of contagious diseases If the anti vaxxers concentrated on spreading nonsense about the tetanus jab they would do no harm to anyone but themselves and their own children But where would be the fun in that They have surprisingly little to say on this soil transmitted disease 
JAN25	Zimbabwe dared to hope. Then the military arrived	Like the fleeting blossom of Jacaranda trees in spring faith in the government of Zimbabwe s president Emmerson Mnangagwa has waned following another round of state violence towards unarmed citizens  A Harare woman wounded in the leg by a close range gunshot from a soldier s gun is ferried in a wheelbarrow to seek medical help Elsewhere in the capital a young footballer is killed for standing outside his home his sole crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time These days on the streets of Harare an unnatural silence and fear have displaced the wild cheers of celebration that accompanied the resignation of Robert Mugabe as president Hope has turned into mourning in cities around the country where a general strike opposing Mnangagwa s fuel price hike turned bloody At least unarmed civilians have been killed and hundreds injured in a brutal crackdown led by the military 
JAN25	Britain is doing socialism for the rich again – this time for oil and gas	The free market is a creed that stirs up near religious devotion among its believers It is in fact a con a myth a great deception Take the latest striking example according to the National Audit Office British taxpayers are expected to cough up bn for tax relief given to oil and gas corporations for the removal of North Sea wells rigs and pipelines Better start saving up because if the companies suddenly go under that bill will only increase Indeed some companies have already defaulted on the costs of decommissioning leaving you and I to pay millions of pounds  Many questions arise here While Britain s Tory government frittered away its North Sea oil wealth Norway invested the proceeds into a sovereign wealth fund which is now worth tn We could have saved up the wealth to invest in the country s future what a tragic waste It is also a damning indictment that we are splashing out on tax breaks for big oil rather than properly investing in tackling the existential crisis of climate change and in doing so creating vast numbers of jobs in renewable energy as Germany has done 
JAN25	Living with a food allergy is difficult enough without restaurants making it worse	Living a life with food allergies can feel like you re walking through a minefield It means having to call up restaurants in advance to see if it s possible to eat there and then feeling like a nuisance every time you have to grill a stumped waiter about how certain foods are prepared It means developing a habit of meticulously reading through every single ingredient list and becoming an expert at studying any allergen guide handed to you And it means checking double checking and then living with the fear that you haven t checked enough and that any oversight can in severe cases cost you your life  It is a burden people like myself have no choice but to carry we simply have to learn how to cope But it s made even harder when people fail to give us relevant information Take Leon for example whose co founder and chief executive John Vincent advised diners with severe allergies to think carefully before choosing to eat at the health conscious joint In a blogpost he wrote The idea that Leon could cause harm to one of our guests is horrifying And we would therefore ask those of you with serious allergies to consider carefully whether you choose to dine with us 
JAN25	Technology need not be the enemy in the fight for better mental health	Effective treatment for children with mental illnesses is a pressing issue so much so in fact that a huge chunk of the recent NHS long term plan was dedicated to it It s long overdue child and adolescent mental health services CAMHS are suffering from both lack of funding and under resourcing with young people subsequently forced to wait months or even years for treatment  The plan has numerous suggestions more money pumped into services for one an overhaul of crisis care early intervention But according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Nice there could be another way to combat the issue apps They re recommending that the NHS administer cognitive behavioural therapy via phones and computers therapy specifically designed to help five to eight year olds 
JAN25	Trump must not be allowed to dictate Venezuela's democratic recovery	Venezuela s Nicol s Maduro and his Russian ally Vladimir Putin are predictably claiming that the swearing in of Juan Guaid as acting president is a coup organised by Donald Trump Those of us who want a democratic and as peaceful as possible end to Maduro s dictatorship must ignore the anti American rhetoric and throw our full support behind the president of the country s national assembly  Guaid must not be allowed to fail No one within the opposition is better suited to steer Venezuela back towards democracy Following years of seeing former president Hugo Ch vez abuse the rules of democracy an increasing number of Venezuelans has lost faith in politics and the power of the vote They are understandably angry and they seem to believe that the only way out is to take the fight to the streets Guaid who cut his teeth in the protests against Ch vez has enough credibility to convince this group that a democratic transition is still possible 
JAN25	Forcing social-media influencers to be clear about #ads? Good luck with that	Izzy just wants to tell the world about her skincare regime The blond teenager has suffered with acne for years at school one bully cruelly nicknamed her Dimple Pimple She has tried so many face washes she even had prescription meds It s no wonder her story told in a series of tweets earlier this month resonated with hundreds of people and was liked on the site more than times  Thankfully there is a happy ending One random Tuesday about six months ago Izzy found a cure for her troublesome skin Coffee Creations coffee scrub

JAN26	Diana Athill’s story was remarkable, and its end serene	Diana Athill had lots of confidence She understood the social class she came from and could stand outside it looking in whenever she chose As she wrote in Stet her memoir of her years in the publishing trade she was a member of a caste one of the London dwelling university educated upper middle class English people who took over publishing towards the end of the th century from the booksellers who used to run it But she was also a white woman who had several black lovers in an age when that kind of relationship could be seen as a political statement and she despised the self consciously beautiful writing of the quintessentially caste writer Virginia Woolf To her caste standards it ought not to need saying have no right to be considered sacrosanct  Her confidence helped her to be a writer of course it stands somewhere between talent and connection in the list of useful attributes but it made her a fine editor too She was clear in her judgments and certain in her encouragement We first met in the early s when a book I was allegedly writing for her publishing firm Andr Deutsch had long passed its delivery date I took the work in no progress to the office where Diana read some of the first chapter aloud with such elegant enunciation that I was almost though not quite persuaded to carry on with the rest At that time I didn t know she d been a writer but then I read her two books of memoir Instead of a Letter and After a Funeral and was struck as many others have been by her frankness and clarity and the wonderful rhythm of her prose 
JAN26	The ‘will of the people’ on Brexit was not fixed for all time in June 2016	They have only one argument left Back in the spring of the Brexiteers were promising sunshine and riches untrammelled sovereignty and m a week all the ice cream of EU membership and none of the spinach We would head out into the world and recover our destiny as a global trading nation with more money in our pockets and independence in our hearts You don t hear much of that kind of talk these days not when Airbus warns it could pull out of the UK taking its direct and indirect jobs with it Sony relocates its European HQ from London to Amsterdam and the carmaker Bentley says baldly It s Brexit that s the killer Instead the pro leave case now boils down to one argument it may be rough We won t be able to get certain foods like bananas or tomatoes in the words of one senior Brexiteer confident our Blitz spirit will get us through the coming storm but we have to do it We have no choice It is the will of the people and that will must be done  Theresa May is the most dogged exponent of this view A remainer in she cannot bring herself to make a positive case for Brexit Instead she repeats over and over that we are compelled to leave because that is what the British people voted for Any deviation would be a betrayal We are a man taking off his socks bracing himself to walk barefoot across hot coals for no better reason than he promised he would 
JAN26	Rees-Mogg plays his queen as Brexit enters a state of emergency	Although he failed to emerge from an Airbus waving it MP Mark Francois had in his hand a piece of paper My father Reginald Francois was a D day veteran he thundered to the news cameras on Friday shortly before ripping up the aforementioned document He never submitted to bullying by any German Neither will his son  Leaving aside the somewhat bathetic description of Rommel s Atlantic Wall defences as bullying can you guess what Mark s piece of paper actually was Certification of a history doctorate He amusingly already holds an MA in war studies A letter from his future self reading simply Don t be a thermonuclear dick Mark it ends badly 
JAN26	Fake-history films like Vice and The Uncivil War are the new threat to truth	Is this the death of journalism or just of history This week sees the screening of Vice a biopic of George W Bush s vice president Dick Cheney who is presented as the evil genius behind the Iraq war torture and other misdemeanours Its maker Adam McKay makes no bones about wishing to nail the misdeeds of a man about to sail over the horizon His star Christian Bale even thanked Satan for giving me inspiration to play the role  Vice follows hard on the heels of the British dramatist James Graham s Brexit The Uncivil War for Channel That set out to reveal the truth about Brexit with Benedict Cumberbatch as Dominic Cummings the eccentric fixer behind the Vote Leave campaign Graham declared a desire to make sense of how the fault lines began to do what journalism cannot do 
JAN26	Ban school league tables. They’re not just misleading, they’re harmful	Yet another piece of academic research has been produced which shows grammar school performance in school league tables is not quite what it seems You have to wonder how many more publicly funded research projects undertaken by leading academics it will require before such findings are taken seriously  This latest research conducted by Bristol University reveals what campaigners against academic selection and grammar schools have long argued when social and economic factors are taken into consideration grammar school performance is no better than any other school It is a point also made by Stephen Gorard and Nadia Siddiqui of Durham University in their exhaustive analysis of pupil data published a few months ago The reason grammar schools do well in league tables is because they select high attaining children who perform well in public exams This fact is so obvious that any year old sitting the plus exam would get it

JAN26	London’s exploited tenants deserve proper rights – not just rent controls	When Anabel and her flatmates were told the rent in their Kentish Town houseshare was due to increase by a month all of them had to find a new place to live In the space of just a few years increases by Ghazal s landlord left her paying of her wages on her Forest Gate accommodation on a monthly rent bill that jumped from to Kenny s Clapton landlord is currently trying to up the rent from to on the three bedroom ex council flat he shares with three others just two years after a previous hike  Renters in London struggle every month to make ends meet spending the bulk of earnings to live in what s often cramped insecure and poor quality housing Our rents rise faster than our wages and we rarely get much choice over where we re able to live In Newham some of the members of our London Renters Union spend of their monthly income on housing with little left for basics like food and clothing Without big changes many of us will be stuck paying rising monthly rents until we retire 
JAN26	Zimbabwe dared to hope. Then the military arrived	Like the fleeting blossom of Jacaranda trees in spring faith in the government of Zimbabwe s president Emmerson Mnangagwa has waned following another round of state violence towards unarmed citizens  A Harare woman wounded in the leg by a close range gunshot from a soldier s gun is ferried in a wheelbarrow to seek medical help Elsewhere in the capital a young footballer is killed for standing outside his home his sole crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time These days on the streets of Harare an unnatural silence and fear have displaced the wild cheers of celebration that accompanied the resignation of Robert Mugabe as president Hope has turned into mourning in cities around the country where a general strike opposing Mnangagwa s fuel price hike turned bloody At least unarmed civilians have been killed and hundreds injured in a brutal crackdown led by the military 
JAN26	Britain is doing socialism for the rich again – this time for oil and gas	The free market is a creed that stirs up near religious devotion among its believers It is in fact a con a myth a great deception Take the latest striking example according to the National Audit Office British taxpayers are expected to cough up bn for tax relief given to oil and gas corporations for the removal of North Sea wells rigs and pipelines Better start saving up because if the companies suddenly go under that bill will only increase Indeed some companies have already defaulted on the costs of decommissioning leaving you and I to pay millions of pounds  Many questions arise here While Britain s Tory government frittered away its North Sea oil wealth Norway invested the proceeds into a sovereign wealth fund which is now worth tn We could have saved up the wealth to invest in the country s future what a tragic waste It is also a damning indictment that we are splashing out on tax breaks for big oil rather than properly investing in tackling the existential crisis of climate change and in doing so creating vast numbers of jobs in renewable energy as Germany has done 
JAN27	I believe in Tory values, but the party is becoming repellent	I have had it up to here with the Conservative party Not perhaps an unusual sentiment to find expressed in the Guardian But as a centre right columnist I do not start from the proposition that all Tories are inherently evil champions of neoliberalism whatever that means intent on maximising suffering and despair I don t express this contempt for the party blithely or to prove a point This is not an exercise in rhetoric I mean it  By way of explanation I used to edit the Spectator I am proud to chair a centre right thinktank Bright Blue I wrote a book about the Conservative led coalition And if you think that s bad I was one of the few people in the world who applauded aspects of Theresa May s manifesto that s a really select club 
JAN27	No longer recognise your country? Look beyond our toxic public life ...	When I was just starting out as a screenwriter I was asked to go to Oslo to interview the great explorer Thor Heyerdahl It was the most glamorous and thrilling thing I d ever been asked to do My daughter worried that if I was going far away on a plane I might not get back in time for her class assembly I told her not to worry Hopping on a plane to do lunch with global icons was what I did now  I might have noticed something was up the moment someone pointed out that I was in their seat I just moved up If I hadn t been feeling so entitled I might have started to worry when the surprisingly extravagant in flight meal was served I just thought I was worth it It wasn t until I finished reading my book that I noticed that the two hour flight was taking a long time And covering a lot of ocean 
JAN27	Britons don’t grasp the EU’s essential motivation – a quest for the quiet life	What does the EU want This simple question has foxed Brits throughout the Brexit talks It is alleged that Brussels is desperate to retain Britain that it yearns to get rid of it that German car makers and friendly states such as the Netherlands will force Angela Merkel to let Britain cherrypick the best of membership that Europeans want to ruin Britain sending it on its way with a punishment beating pour encourager les autres None of this contradictory speculation has turned out to be right and Britain s negotiating efforts have been the poorer for it  European mainlanders can be hard to read The Friday before last prominent Germans including Annegret Kramp Karrenbauer Angela Merkel s heir presumptive wrote a saccharine letter to the Times urging Britain to stay On Monday the Polish foreign minister broke EU ranks to suggest that the Irish backstop be limited to get Theresa May s deal over the line Yet on Wednesday Merkel seemingly contradicted her own colleagues opining fatalistically that Britain an island had always had patchy relations with the EU and suggesting that its exit is inevitable The day after an exasperated Emmanuel Macron told a crowd near Lyon that Brexit has torn British society apart and cannot be delivered his tone so critical that it moved a Spectator writer to ask why the French president hates Britain so much The motivations and instincts of our continental partners sometimes baffle us Brits 
JAN27	Corrupt Maduro has broken his country. Now, democracy must have its day	Venezuela Nicol s Maduro s dwindling band of foreign supporters like to claim is a theatre in a new cold war Donald Trump s administration and his hawkish foreign policy advisers with their occasional threats of military intervention provide the perfect props So does Jair Bolsonaro the new far right president in Brazil But the real contest in Venezuela is between democracy and dictatorship Maduro leads a corrupt authoritarian regime that has stolen and broken a once prosperous country staging a coup against its own constitution  On Saturday January a power cut at the University Hospital in Caracas caused the deaths of six patients according to a union representative It was not an isolated incident in the two months from mid November hospitals in Venezuela monitored by a local doctors group suffered power cuts lasting an average of three hours a day But the deaths at the University Hospital were a particular embarrassment to Maduro Venezuela s ruler since Highlighting his country s descent into criminal public mismanagement they happened just after he was inaugurated for a second six year term as president in a sparsely attended ceremony at the supreme court and not the national assembly as the constitution requires 
JAN27	What’s a chap to do if he can’t be beastly to the Germans?	Mark Francois has made himself into the most famous ex TA lieutenant since Gareth Keenan in The Office by insisting on tearing up a letter he happened to have on him when the BBC was trying to ask him about something else The letter came from the chief executive of a vast and successful company formed in as a government initiative between the UK France and West Germany and which employs more than skilled people in this country Its boss was pointing out that just because factories are based in the UK now that doesn t mean they will stay here if we decide to leave the largest free trade bloc on Earth  Well and good you might think Sound free market common sense with which James Dyson would smile and agree although not with the cameras running But Francois s eagle infantryman s eye had spotted a gap in the Brexit enemy s defences and a chance to become memorable live on TV You see the current CEO of Airbus isn t just a businessman pointing out economic problems He is also a square headed jackbooted scar faced sausage noshing Sieg Heiling swab Cripes Lt Francois sir we ain t gonna let the likes of im shove us around are we 
JAN27	As awards season kicks off, how can we tell who are the real good guys?	Awards season is upon us first the Golden Globes and now Oscar nominations and it has struck me just how odd it is that these Hollywood functions have come to be connected to MeToo and Time s Up Was there ever an industry so comically unsuited to driving an equality movement  Take the struggles of the Academy to catch up with the times one year in The day after it selected Bohemian Rhapsody as a nominee for best picture reviews had been scathing but it did after all feature Aids and a bisexual storyline multiple allegations of sexual assault emerged against its director Bryan Singer Singer denied the accusations but they had not come out of the blue rumours of sexual misconduct had followed him for some years 
JAN27	Brexiters never had a real exit plan. No wonder they avoided the issue	The secret history of modern Britain is made in obscure corners between men and women taken seriously by no one but themselves A good time to begin it would be in the winter of when the Institute of Economic Affairs a rightist outfit that won t reveal where its money comes from offered a prize to whoever could devise a means of leaving the European Union  The reason why politicians are now stumbling towards disaster like prisoners marching to the scaffold ought to have been clear from that moment Obviously Britain can leave the EU but only if it is willing to pay an extortionate price Yet first the institute s judges led by Nigel Lawson and Gisela Stuart then the Leave campaigns of Boris Johnson Nigel Farage and Dominic Cummings and finally Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn who even now cannot speak plainly have refused to acknowledge the harsh truth 
JAN27	The academy revolution has swept England. It has left casualties in its wake	Walk into a school and some things will strike you right away Is the atmosphere respectful and warm How do children interact with their teachers What sort of project work takes pride of place on the corridor walls  One thing that you can t immediately tell from wandering from classroom to classroom is whether the school is an academy run by a not for profit organisation independent of the local council or a maintained school under local council oversight When things are going well parents may barely notice the difference But when things are going badly it matters and that s why the extraordinary growth of academy schools has become one of the most hotly contested developments in education policy 
JAN27	Demography is not destiny. Politics should be about winning minds	Peter Kellner s crossover day has caused some commotion Last Saturday according to the veteran pollster Britain became a majority Remain nation through demographic changes alone Kellner s calculations suggested that in the period since the referendum sufficient old folk who largely voted Leave had died and enough teenagers overwhelmingly Remain had reached voting age to have wiped out the majority for Brexit  Remainers seized on Kellner s projections as ammunition for a second referendum Critics not all Leave supporters condemned them as being in the words of the Labour MP Caroline Flint unhelpful ageist and divisive Whichever view one takes the ruckus over crossover day reveals the way that political demography the study of the relationship between population changes and political attitudes has become increasingly central to public debate 
JAN27	This is no time to make political capital out of Alex Salmond’s arrest	It s impossible to overstate the sense of shock that swept across Scotland when it was revealed what charges Alex Salmond is facing after his appearance on petition at Edinburgh sheriff court last Thursday Scotland s former first minister has been charged with two counts of attempted rape and multiple counts of sexual assault He immediately said that he was innocent of any criminality whatsoever and would defend himself in court to the utmost In Holyrood a little while later Nicola Sturgeon cut a weary figure as she talked about how shocked many people would be at this news  Scotland is weeks away from being dragged out of the European Union against its overwhelmingly settled will while even the most fervently rightwing publications have stopped pretending that all will be well across the nation following a possible no deal Brexit And yet this most profoundly damaging event will be submerged in terms of importance by the long list of very serious charges that Salmond must face It s highly unlikely that this case will be heard in court before another months have elapsed 
JAN28	What I learned about Viktor Orbán on a road trip with my dad	Like many families mine has been divided by politics in recent years I am British my dad has returned to his native Hungary I work for the Guardian he has become a supporter of Hungary s nationalist prime minister Viktor Orb n It had become a festering sore He loves talking politics and resented the fact that he couldn t discuss politics with me I couldn t talk about it because I resented his politics  So we decided to go on a road trip together We d spend seven days in a car travelling across Hungary and its political spectrum to have it all out What could possibly go wrong 
JAN28	A second Brexit referendum would not benefit the EU	When the prime minister s Brexit deal received its crushing defeat in parliament European council president Donald Tusk tweeted If a deal is impossible and no one wants no deal then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is This wasn t the first time that Tusk has suggested the UK could remain in the EU After the general election Tusk discussed reversing Brexit He said The European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible and then quoted John Lennon s Imagine adding You may say I m a dreamer but I am not the only one But is the EU serious about this Have Brussels and member states really thought things through  If a new remain campaign focused on the benefits of EU membership a new vote to leave would be a definitive rejection
JAN28	Stop ‘fighting’ cancer, and start treating it like any other illness	Do you have a cancer Or are you a brave hero fighting against the demon foe Have you something in your body that needs removing or are you a heroic victim in a war you may win or lose A poll by Macmillan Cancer Support has found that many people with cancer are fed up with the language of war They want to be treated like anyone else who is ill They want to discuss their treatment with a doctor It is as simple as that  Anyone with experience of a cancer knows well the lugubrious looks you get You poor thing We are so sorry How long have they given you Be brave Be positive Fight back Don t give in and lose It suggests you lacked courage and were beaten 
JAN28	The way we eat is killing us – and the planet	The distinguished medical journal The Lancet has issued not one but two apocalyptic warnings about our food in under a month One of its special commissions reported earlier this month that civilisation itself was at risk from the effects of the current food system on both human health and the Earth s ecosystems This week comes the next instalment from another special Lancet commission which finds that pandemics of obesity and malnutrition are interacting with climate change in a feedback loop and represent an existential threat to humans and the planet The modern western diet has become a highly damaging thing that needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe It concluded that we need to halve global meat consumption and more than double the volume of whole grains pulses nuts fruit and vegetables we eat  Cue howls of indignation from big food and its cheerleaders the libertarian right Those nanny statists have gone nuts eating their own double dose of nuts Cue cries of distress from champions of local low impact agriculture who include grass fed animals and their meat and manure in their sustainable mix These self appointed experts don t understand farming Cue grim food wheels with only a quarter of a rasher of bacon or a fifth of an egg a day Those miserabilist medics want us all to go vegan 
JAN28	Women still have to use their frozen eggs in 10 years – or lose them. Why?	Fertility experts are urging the government to dump legislation that demands women who have frozen their eggs must use them within years After this time fertility clinics are obliged to destroy the eggs irrespective of what the woman they belong to wants unless she has been through the egg freezing process because her fertility is compromised which can happen for a number of reasons  The law at present dictates that any woman who has had her eggs frozen for social reasons that is not medically indicated for instance she may not have met someone she wants to have children with yet has a maximum of years in which to use them Before we even begin to unpack the implications of such restrictions though the term social in itself warrants our attention Pejorative is putting it lightly 
JAN28	Looking on the bright side of climate change, think of all the money corporations can make	You know what I love about capitalism Its optimism Even in the direst of circumstances it is always able to find a silver lining  Take climate change for example After weird weather and ominous warnings of more to come many of us are freaking out about an environmental apocalypse Indeed a new poll shows record numbers of Americans are worried about climate change and after last year s heatwave concerns about the issue have soared in Britain 
JAN28	What has happened in Venezuela is a coup. Trump’s denial is dangerous	The picture shows him in the act of swearing himself in as interim president of Venezuela His right hand raised to the heavens as is proper of one who having no popular mandate proclaims himself in the name of God like the kings of old Only this is no kingdom but a revolutionary republic born of a people s war It has since protected its right to self determination by means of people power and persistent anti colonial struggle  In the th century the struggle was led by Sim n Bol var the liberator Rebelling against the laws of the time Bolivar stood up to the might of the Spanish empire in alliance with then free Haiti Bolivar made instant enemies of slaveholders in the newly formed US and the rest of the Americas upon embracing a universal right and call to happiness without hypocrisy That promise was realised only in part 
JAN28	England can be better than the Brexit caricature. We have to make the case for it	There are two kinds of questions to be asked about Brexit One of them defines the day to day grind at Westminster and is about an urgent set of issues that encompasses everything from the most basic framework for trade to the future of Northern Ireland and which still seem all but insoluble But as all the parliamentary drama on goes on it is the other big Brexit conundrum that shows even fewer signs of resolution To use a phrase habitually deployed by the prime minister herself what kind of country do we want to be Put another way who are we  To some extent we know the answer and it is not pretty Whatever the varied motivations of many of the people who voted for it our exit from the European Union looks to outsiders like an expression of nostalgia introversion and a very unbecoming belligerence Some of the most powerful branches of government seem to be operating on much the same impulses As evidenced by the Windrush scandal and a steady stream of heartbreaking deportation stories the Home Office now seems to be institutionally sociopathic So does the Department for Work and Pensions 
JAN28	Forget the 'big society'. Austerity is to blame for this army of volunteers	At first it sounded quite lovely didn t it The notion of a big society back in those heady days when David Cameron and Nick Clegg stood side by side in the Downing Street garden In May we were still ignorant of the devastating austerity these two men would go on to inflict And so they offered us the big society from the Cabinet Office a document was proudly produced Our Conservative Liberal Democrat government has come together with a driving ambition to put more power and opportunity into people s hands reads the opening We want to give citizens communities and local government the power and information they need to come together solve the problems they face and build the Britain they want  Cut to and it s unclear how much of what was promised ever materialised Broad brush pledges such as we will train a new generation of community organisers and the radical devolution of power and greater financial autonomy to local government meant little or nothing in practice one can only assume their full review of local government finance concluded with the line just take all their money away 
JAN28	Our flawed parliamentary system has let the Tories stifle the Brexit debate	Another fine mess that s what it is Parliament is logjammed The main parties are riven Two Tory MPs Jacob Rees Mogg and Desmond Swayne have called for the prime minister to suspend parliament indefinitely because they fear the House of Commons will talk about subjects and maybe even legislate for things they don t like It s not the first time that has happened Elizabeth I tried to stop MPs talking about her marital status and Charles I governed for years without parliament but Elizabeth failed and Charles ended up on the block  Our winner takes all parliamentary system isn t fit for purpose It is failing the nation at a moment of true crisis It builds in division and prevents compromise It leads ministers to believe in their divine right to govern unimpeded because only the government gets precedence for its business only a minister can raise a tax or spend money and only a minister can determine when there will be a vote or even if there will be a vote 
JAN29	Why I won't miss Tesco's fake 'posh' deli, fish and meat counters	The news that Tesco is to shut the fresh food counters at of its UK stores was surprising in one detail it has chosen to retain the butcher s cheese and deli counters at more Why The remaining counters will surely be streamlined but in is anyone really taken in by the supermarket fresh food counter that sentimental harking back to a world of town squares and traditional retailers Does anyone browse what Morrisons calls its Market Street and feel like they are in a market or a street No  In a Financial Times article which identified fresh food as the next major supermarket battleground tell that to up to people now facing redundancy at Tesco one expert revealingly described fresh food as the biggest single determinant of the quality image of a superstore operator Key words there quality image As opposed to actual objective quality Retail magazine The Grocer this week described fresh food counters as key to customer perception but an expensive luxury which say analysts have been haemorrhaging money for years Unlike in continental hypermarkets yes even here we are diverging from Europe fresh food counters contribute microscopic amounts to turnover 
JAN29	Here in Liverpool, we know what northern austerity looks like up close	This week started with me reporting a couple of things that many in Liverpool already know that their city has been ravaged by the austerity agenda of the past nine years and that the Conservatives don t care too much about them and their lives  Most people in this city know it and most people are angry about it but this week s report into local council funding cuts by the Centre for Cities thinktank brought into sharp focus just how unfair this all is 
JAN29	The Alex Iwobi ‘gorilla’ insult shines a light on south Asian anti-black racism	 Did you know Gandhi was racist A white friend sits opposite me grinning so widely I wonder if there s going to be a punchline We know I reply we all know Her smile fades quickly and she moves on I stop listening the noise in the cafe dies down and the soundtrack to a sad Bollywood film fills the moment She thought I didn t know Why don t I talk about it more I hide the trauma of black people because Gandhi was one of the few saviours we had in our toxic community Anti blackness was a punchline I wasn t expecting  One thing I remember from studying A level sociology is the idea of how you develop through your primary and then your secondary education something that contributes greatly to social dynamics Primary education is what you learn from your family home secondary education is what is passed on to us from institutions 
JAN29	The new 100% mortgage won’t help low-income Generation Rent	If there s anything more British than talking about the weather it s obsessing about house prices This is a country where it s taboo to ask someone their salary but perfectly acceptable to ask how much their house is worth and look it up on Rightmove if they won t tell you  In recent years it s been harder to avoid talking about house prices than ever because in many places around the country they re so out of control According to the Office for National Statistics the median price paid for a home leapt by between and while earnings only rose by 
JAN29	That brand new Tory plan for Brexit? Here’s why it’s dead in the water	There is considerable excitement in the Conservative party on Tuesday morning It looks like a deal has been reached on Brexit There s just one problem that from what we can gather of the so called Malthouse compromise it stands no chance of being acceptable to the EU  There seem to be three fundamentals to the plan the extension of the implementation period to technological solutions to ensure no border infrastructure requirements on the island of Ireland and an interim free trade agreement to be tabled immediately This has been termed a triple lock 
JAN29	Nick Clegg squirms as Facebook apologist-in-chief. Sound familiar?	Once upon a time there was a Tumblr account called Nick Clegg Looking Sad which consisted almost entirely of pictures of the then deputy prime minister looking miserable  It doesn t seem to have been updated since the general election presumably because that represented peak misery but I was reminded of it on Tuesday when Clegg made his first outing as spin doctor for Facebook He had been given some happy news to impart including the creation of a centre for electoral integrity to try to fight political disinformation campaigns aimed at skewing elections But the pained expression crept in when confronted on TV with examples of the kind of graphic Instagram posts that year old Molly Russell s bereaved parents believe had a bearing on their daughter s suicide and asked whether he would want his own children to see them There is something horribly familiar about the sight of Clegg publicly squirming over the consequences of things he doesn t quite have the power to stop as if the coalition years were happening all over again in slow motion 
JAN29	Don't know your James Charles from Zoella? Get with YouTube celebrity culture	There is a particular breed of middle aged man that prides itself on not knowing who Kim Kardashian is What s that they cry in comment sections throughout the land What s a Kim Kardashian This performative I m too busy with books to even turn on the TV intelligence usually backfires immediately you re telling me you ve read books but can t discern that Kimberly is a woman s name  Pretending not to know who celebrities are to seem clever is likely an age old phenomenon Spartacus Never heard of him but thankfully you no longer have to pretend After makeup artist and YouTuber James Charles brought Birmingham to a standstill on Sunday with traffic gridlocked as thousands of teenage fans flocked to see the year old at a shopping centre many people are realising that they actually genuinely haven t the foggiest who s celebrities are 
JAN29	Bill Gates says poverty is decreasing. He couldn’t be more wrong	Last week as world leaders and business elites arrived in Davos for the World Economic Forum Bill Gates tweeted an infographic to his million followers showing that the world has been getting better and better This is one of my favourite infographics he wrote A lot of people underestimate just how much life has improved over the past two centuries  Of the six graphs developed by Max Roser of Our World in Data the first has attracted the most attention by far It shows that the proportion of people living in poverty has declined from in to only today The claim is simple and compelling And it s not just Gates who s grabbed on to it These figures have been trotted out in the past year by everyone from Steven Pinker to Nick Kristof and much of the rest of the Davos set to argue that the global extension of free market capitalism has been great for everyone Pinker and Gates have gone even further saying we shouldn t complain about rising inequality when the very forces that deliver such immense wealth to the richest are also eradicating poverty before our very eyes 
JAN29	Labour councils and activists are at war. But it won’t stop austerity	Just because we stopped talking about austerity doesn t mean it went away The Centre for Cities published research this week on nearly a decade of Conservative fiscal tightening councils have now lost p in every pound of funding they got from central government under Labour Barnsley has suffered the greatest percentage cut in day to day spending on services at Liverpool has had the deepest annual cuts per head at Three of the top five cities affected are in Yorkshire there is a clear skew towards the north  A new funding formula explicitly redirects funds away from inner cities and towards the shires This is far from new news Simon Duffy from the Centre for Welfare Reform published an astonishing report in that detailed the cumulative effects of cuts to local authorities and to benefits To be reliant on both local authority services and welfare over this period has meant suffering hardships that simply would not have been approved by any voter had the consequences been spelled out in a manifesto So the effect on local democracy sounds abstract set against more concrete catastrophes such as that in adult social care Yet there are lessons here some harsh ones if we re ever going to get to the business of political renewal 
JAN29	Britannia rules the waves? After Brexit, it’ll be floundering	Never underestimate the Brexit romance the tug for an island nation set in a silver sea unconquered for centuries proud of its insularity The idea of the sea wrenches at British heartstrings you can hear it when you listen to the language of the Brexit groundswell Normandy landings D day pluck empire sailors leave voters use this imagery however far from the shore  Brexit leaders rub in that seafaring imagery but here s the paradox these buccaneers promoting free markets on the high seas are the same deregulators who have helped destroy British shipping 
JAN30	If Corbyn gets his hands dirty he can avert a hard Brexit	In spite of the upbeat signals that came from Jeremy Corbyn s meeting with Theresa May on Wednesday experience suggests that it will not prove a turning point on Brexit Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator These gifts are not part of their skill sets Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign Corbyn s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo s Inspector Javert look like a libertine May s default mode towards Corbyn on show again at question time this week is to give him her full Lady Disdain  What is more even if the two leaders wanted to patch something together their respective Brexit positions do not allow for much common ground anyway May s red lines on leaving the single market and the customs union ending free movement and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court are mostly mirror images of Corbyn s He wants a close relationship with the EU market and on customs and supports his own version of free movement The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen preferably under a Conservative government 
JAN30	Labour can’t be held responsible for the Brexit fiasco	This week s parliamentary votes on Brexit should mark the death of a delusion This may seem an odd argument parliament has just voted for an amendment demanding an alternative to the backstop which has been repeatedly ruled out by the EU Tory MPs voted for what they know is impossible David Lidington the prime minister s number two who three weeks ago denounced fantasies about magical alternative deals voted for what he knows is impossible Theresa May who has repeatedly declared that no alternative to her deal exists and then ludicrously whipped her MPs to vote against that deal voted for what she knows is impossible The DUP which at least has the excuse of being stranded in the th century voted for what it knows is impossible The Tory party is subjecting the country to a pantomime acting out a script it knows bears no relation to reality and is prolonging Britain s turmoil and our international humiliation all for the sake of its own partisan interests  No the delusion that died last night was the idea that Labour has any meaningful say over the substance of Brexit at all Labour put forward an amendment to strike out no deal and to provide the option of a second referendum It backed Yvette Cooper s amendment to extend article by a mere three months and Dominic Grieve s amendment to allow consultative votes on alternatives to May s Brexit plan All three of the amendments were voted down in parliament The reason for this is that the Tories have a parliamentary majority courtesy of the DUP and Tory MPs wherever they stand on the Brexit divide prioritise stopping a party split over the nation s interests Along with their ideological obsession with austerity this is the proximate cause of Britain s crisis This should be a statement of the obvious but sometimes to state the obvious is a revolutionary act 
JAN30	Outsourcing education to Clarks shoes: only a Tory could think of that	Parents we ve all been there a high street shoe shop in early September Everyone with a school aged child has simultaneously realised that if they don t get around to buying shoes today the kids are going to have to start the year wearing flip flops or wellies The queue is out of the door heaps of small black lace ups litter the aisles Babies are wailing Somebody s toddler has got a foot stuck in the measuring machine It s too hot in the store and there s a heady scent of sweat and wee Your own children are desperate to leave because you rashly bribed them to come here with the promise of a trip to the Lego shop and a doughnut  How you might wonder could this annual ritual get any more hellish As ever the government is one step ahead
JAN30	Labour’s immigration U-turn is a wake-up call for Corbyn supporters	We re here then The point at which a Labour leadership that won support for being different ends up being the same The stage that jaded observers warned was an inevitability of politics no matter who was in charge The day that a political project with impeccably pro migration credentials triangulated into abstention on a miserable destructive Conservative immigration bill  OK so it didn t fully triangulate in the end Let s start at the beginning On Monday the government s immigration bill their flagship legislation for what the country s immigration policy would be after Brexit was due a second reading The Labour party announced in the afternoon that it would be abstaining in other words not voting it down Within hours after an excoriating backlash from Labour MPs and Jeremy Corbyn s supporters alike the party shifted from abstention to a one line whip and the government bill passed with Labour MPs absent This bill among other things ends freedom of movement and strips million EU citizens of their rights in the UK while threatening them with the hostile environment that others are already cruelly subjected to It also cavalierly hands immigration powers to ministers and puts a salary threshold on skilled worker visas for EU citizens making it unattainable for skilled workers in key areas such as the NHS social care and beyond In this context Labour s approach to this bad bill really is staggering 
JAN30	As schools are forced to be academies, the will of the people means nothing	Saturday morning and Stevenage appears to be bracing itself for a riot Police cars block off road after road Sirens scythe the air Officers hurry about in hi vis And at the eye of this storm is not some motley crew of furious insurgents but hundreds of children and mums and dads marching last weekend to save the school they love   We are a small town and we aren t used to staging demonstrations says councillor Josh Bennett Lovell which explains both the law and order overkill and the bright eyed kids enjoying all the excitement of a big day out Only when the marchers hit the town square does the carnival spirit give way to speeches highlighting the seriousness of their situation 
JAN30	It’s not just Meghan and Kate – all women need social media protection	Being a royal secures unfathomable perks Whether it s getting a m home refurbishment gifted by the taxpayer ownership of all the swans or a lifetime of inherited privilege for you and your descendants royal status shields the bestowed from life s mundane troubles But even a five metre Givenchy wedding veil couldn t save Meghan Duchess of Sussex from misogynoir and a barrage of trolling  This week Kensington Palace had to reach out for help from Twitter and Instagram as staff members were spending hours each week reporting sexist and racist comments and threats aimed at Meghan and Kate Duchess of Cambridge The diatribe is so dire that Hello magazine has started a campaign HelloToKindness 
JAN30	Rat-infested prison cells are one difference between punishment and cruelty	The news that a year old pensioner serving a short sentence in Wormwood Scrubs prison developed symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder when he was locked in a rat infested cell for hours a day will not have come as a surprise to prisons chief inspector Peter Clarke Only last week Clarke s report on HMP Bedford revealed that a prisoner was catching and killing rats in his cell even as that prison was being inspected  The Scrubs pensioner is now suing the prison service for the vivid and terrifying nightmares anxiety attacks and depression he has suffered since the experience The saddest part of his story is that he says when he complained to prison officers about the rats he was told This isn t a hotel you know You re here to be punished Is that really the answer he deserved 
JAN30	Worse than plastic waste: the burning tyres choking India	What we see is not the economy What we see is the tiny fragment of economic life we are supposed to see the products and services we buy The rest the mines plantations factories and dumps required to deliver and remove them are kept as far from our minds as possible Given the scale of global extraction and waste disposal it is a remarkable feat of perception management  The recent enthusiasm for plastic porn footage of the disgusting waste pouring into the sea is a rare reminder that we are still living in a material world But it has had no meaningful effect on government policy When China banned imports of plastic waste a year ago you might have hoped that the UK government would invest heavily in waste reduction and domestic recycling Instead it has sought new outlets for our filth Among the lucky recipients are Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam none of which have adequate disposal systems as I write our plastic is doubtless flooding into their seas There s a term for this practice waste colonialism 
JAN30	Britain criminalising young BME people could spark a new crisis on the streets	The latest figures to emerge showing racial inequality are sadly as unsurprising as they are shocking Reading that more than half of the people locked in young offender institutions in England and Wales belong to an ethnic minority should be a cause for national alarm Somehow things are actually worse than in when the Lammy review put the figure at But we have become so desensitised to institutional racism that the nation is numb to the reality We are sleepwalking into the next crisis on the streets for a generation of black and brown young people  The criminal injustice system is offered as a solution to a problem that it is one of the principal forces in creating
JAN30	It shouldn’t take Pink Floyd to rescue Isis fighters’ abandoned children	 Pink Floyd rescues Trinidadian boys born to Isis dad it reads like a headline from US satirical outlet the Onion But the information is real and the issue it highlights is no laughing matter  On January Roger Waters co founder of the British rock band Pink Floyd helped rescue two young brothers from a camp in Syria that was holding wives and children of foreign Islamic State members Mahmud Ferreira and his brother Ayyub have been reunited with their mother and are poised to return to their native Trinidad The boys were taken to Syria by their father reportedly now dead in A few years later they were found abandoned on a roadside and put in the camp run by the Kurdish Arab forces controlling northeast Syria 
JAN31	‘Stress interviews’: another way to make millennials’ lives hell	It sounds like the job interview from hell Olivia Bland ended up crying at the bus stop after what the year old describes as being deliberately torn to shreds over everything from her writing skills to her posture apparently even my arms were wrong and the way I sat was wrong Tech company boss Craig Dean the man on the other side of the desk ended up posting what he called a sleep deprived and anxiety driven apology on Twitter after her account of it all went viral  Tell me your gender age and political leanings and I can probably guess with reasonable certainty whether your sympathies lie with her or with him But if nothing else the rejection email she sent explaining where Web Applications UK could stick the job it eventually offered her certainly demonstrates the timely concise and effective communications skills stipulated in the job description 
JAN31	An Android-only app for EU citizens' residency – finally, my time to shine!	Years of struggle have come to an end finally after a decade of taunting my people s time has come It has not been easy being mocked for the apps we inexplicably cannot get and the Instagram pictures we post that look like they were taken by a drunk child but now Android users have the upper hand  Maybe I should take the comical incompetency of the Home Office more seriously It is after all somewhat bonkers that EU citizens in the UK of which I am one are only able to apply for residency on one type of smartphone but if Brexit Britain has taught me anything it is to look for the silver linings 
JAN31	Lazy homophobia signals the end of the road for Clarkson and co	It s been a while since Jeremy Clarkson caused an upset The days of him punching a producer prompting his ejection from the BBC or straining diplomatic relations in Argentina seem so long ago it s enough to make one nostalgic But order has been restored with a fresh storm about homophobic remarks aired during the new series of The Grand Tour highlighted on Twitter by the singer Will Young   Enough is enough said Young I m pissed and fed up I want Amazon Prime and the producers of Grand Tour to meet young LGBT people who want to kill themselves because of shaming and laughter and normalising of shaming homophobic narratives 
JAN31	The backstop isn’t just about trade. Is that so hard to understand, Britain?	One of my earliest childhood memories is of a circling red light motioning cars to stop near the border silencing all who encountered its fiery glare That red light filled my young heart with fear I didn t know if the gloved hand holding the torch was that of the RUC the British army the IRA or the UVF  I grew up during the Troubles in the shadow of Cloghogue one of the largest British army bases in Northern Ireland Having to make detours to avoid customs and security checks along bomb alley an atrocity laden eight mile stretch of road between Newry and Dundalk was as frightening as it was familiar 
JAN31	The World Bank and IMF are in crisis. It's time to push a radical new vision	The president of the World Bank Jim Yong Kim will step down on February three and a half years before the end of his term in search of greener pastures His readiness to resign from the leadership of one the two most powerful international financial institutions is a worrying omen But it is also an important wake up call  The World Bank and the IMF are the last remaining columns of the Bretton Woods edifice under which capitalism experienced its golden age in the s and s While that system and the fixed exchange rate regime it relied upon bit the dust in the two institutions continued to support global finance along purely Atlanticist lines with Europe s establishment choosing the IMF s managing director and the United States selecting the head of the World Bank 
JAN31	If the police step up stop-and-search tactics, trouble will follow	Last month it emerged that there had been a rise in police use of stop and search powers And according to a recent Guardian report there is evidence that black people are being disproportionately targeted This is profoundly depressing There are real grounds for concern that once again use of this policing strategy is storing up trouble  Our new report Beyond Contagion published today supports the view that stop and search can have unintended but significant social and psychological consequences We examined patterns of data in the riots in particular how these events arose and spread The significance of the riots is indisputable this was the largest wave of disorder in the UK since the s and involved an estimated people with more than arrests It is important to understand the underlying causes 
JAN31	Supermarkets say Brexit could empty shelves. That's a risk they chose to run	 The shops will be empty and the lights will go out are the staple warnings of commercial interests that have an axe to grind or are looking for public support But the letter this week from store bosses sounding an alert about the impact of a no deal Brexithas added irony when delivered by some of Britain s biggest supermarket retailers whose centralised business model has done much to hollow out the economy making it so vulnerable in the first place  The companies focus on the threat of disruption to food supplies We ve been here before and recently While shambolic Brexit negotiations continue and place more stress on the system a whole range of other dynamics in recent years has left our food system more frail and at risk 
JAN31	If Corbyn gets his hands dirty he can avert a hard Brexit	In spite of the upbeat signals that came from Jeremy Corbyn s meeting with Theresa May on Wednesday experience suggests that it will not prove a turning point on Brexit Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator These gifts are not part of their skill sets Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign Corbyn s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo s Inspector Javert look like a libertine May s default mode towards Corbyn on show again at question time this week is to give him her full Lady Disdain  What is more even if the two leaders wanted to patch something together their respective Brexit positions do not allow for much common ground anyway May s red lines on leaving the single market and the customs union ending free movement and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court are mostly mirror images of Corbyn s He wants a close relationship with the EU market and on customs and supports his own version of free movement The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen preferably under a Conservative government 
JAN31	The UK isn’t ready to Brexit. Instead it’s heading towards a no-deal tsunami	Shellshocked MPs of the sensible tendency are now seriously alarmed You find them in a daze around Westminster and its news studio green rooms stunned by Tuesday night s failure of the modest Cooper amendment to prevent a no deal crash out  Each day the news gets worse not forecasts but actuality Today it s the UK motor manufacturers reporting a drop in investment last year and Barclays whisking bn of assets off to Dublin joining a torrential outflow including Jacob Rees Mogg s own investment company 
JAN31	Like Anne Hathaway, I ditched alcohol so I could be a better parent	As a child I used to lie to my mother about when parents evening at school was Not because I had been underachieving but because I was scared she would turn up drunk staggering around and slurring again  My childhood was mostly spent caring for myself and my mother as she took to her bed wailing with bottles of vodka She went in and out of hospital eventually ending up in a care home in her early s after years of absolute darkness and chaos having wrecked her mind and body 
FEB1	Brexit Britain is now the only argument on Earth for rising sea levels	So many people have been branded traitors in the past year of Brexit that many of us now have traitor fatigue But everyone should salute Ukip leader Gerard Batten for totally revitalising the genre this week by calling the Queen a traitor Gerard a sort of radicalised Just For Men box wrote to Her Majesty to ask her to prorogue parliament to save Brexit He also took the opportunity to inform Queen Elizabeth II that she had committed treason when she signed the Maastricht treaty   To presume to convey rights on or to impose duties on Your Majesty was and remains unlawful and treasonous under the bill of rights and the coronation oath wrote the Ukip leader whose treatment for low budget legal drama Better Call Gerard is thought not to have tempted the networks Your Majesty s ministers were gravely in error and wrongly advised you 
FEB1	May’s bribe won’t stop Brexit inflicting more pain on Labour's heartlands	It took years but now perhaps comes the final act of the miners strike that tore Britain apart for one long bitter year in the mid s Decades later the second woman prime minister is promising balm to heal the wounds inflicted by the first as Theresa May offers bundles of cash to areas of the country punched hard by Margaret Thatcher s war on the pits  Of course that s not how it s being presented It s true too that not every Labour leave voting area now being pledged transformative investment was once marked by pitheads Even so a map of the Labour heartlands that voted to leave the European Union in does match up remarkably closely with the old coalfields It would be easy to cast May s proposed multibillion fund as an act of atonement for the damage the Tories did by crushing the miners closing the pits and leaving many of those towns and villages to rot 
FEB1	How uplifting to hear David Bowie’s ‘girl with the mousy hair’ tell her story	How lovely to hear from Hermione Farthingale the girl with the mousy hair and muse of David Bowie for his song Life on Mars Finally we ll be able to get closure on those questions that have baffled us for the best part of half a century Why was her mother yelling no Why did her father tell her to go And why didn t she consider some sort of colouring product to brighten up her hair  In fact none of these questions is satisfactorily answered in the interview Farthingale gives for the forthcoming BBC film David Bowie Finding Fame We learn though that after they fell in love in He looked ridiculously young he looked about eight they formed a band called Feathers The following year the dancer and actor ditched him to make a film called Song of Norway 
FEB1	There’s something new on offer at these Nigerian elections – hope	Who would want to be president of Nigeria Well once upon a time me When I was I set out my manifesto on the BBC Africa website Some of my campaign promises included quality education constant electricity and running water for all I planned to use my honest smile as my most efficient tool to win votes and secure the presidency  By I d set my sights a little lower After some research I discovered that local government was the most effective place to implement real change So I decided that by I was going to be a local government chair in Lagos my home state I would be in charge of primary education waste management and primary healthcare for over a million people Two years from my deadline I am still ensconced in the suburbs of London with not a campaign flyer in sight 
FEB1	So, poorer Brexiters voted to be worse off? There’s nothing wrong in that	In Uncle Tom s Cabin there is a moment when Augustine St Clare who owns Tom suggests that he is better off as a slave than he would be as a free man No insists Tom Why Tom asks St Clare You couldn t possibly have earned by your work such clothes and such living as I have given you Know s all that Mas r says Tom But I d rather have poor clothes poor house poor everything and have em mine than have the best and have em any man else s  It has long been a challenge particularly for those who are comfortable to understand why anybody who is struggling would choose to be worse off Liberals can take it particularly personally when those who would most benefit materially from a change in policy or circumstance opt to reject it The assumption is that they must be misinformed ill informed uninformed stupid naive or cruelly misled 
FEB1	These Tories won’t fix the rough sleeping crisis, no matter what they say	The latest official figures for homelessness show that in England outside cities the number of people sleeping rough on any one night is down But this is where the good news ends Rough sleeping has increased by since with rises of as much as in major cities compared with last year The homeless charity Crisis s own research estimates that more than people sleep rough on any given night Meanwhile deaths of homeless people have more than doubled in the past five years  Most people agree that rough sleeping shouldn t exist in a healthy society especially not in the sixth richest economy in the world But it doesn t appear out of nowhere it s the product of political decisions So why is it being allowed to continue 
FEB1	Why Mariah Carey was wrong to play Saudi Arabia	All I want for is for much loved pop stars to stop being inadvertent propagandists for mass murdering dictatorships Mariah Carey is the latest musician to perform in Saudi Arabia following in the ignominious footsteps of Enrique Iglesias and the Black Eyed Peas in December This is bad on a number of levels Carey has famously always had a devoted gay fanbase in Saudi Arabia homosexuality is punishable by death  Women are deprived of fundamental rights and despite Saudi propaganda claims that social progress is being made scores of women s rights activists were detained and incarcerated last year One of them is Loujain Alhathloul whose brother has denounced Carey s concert as a pathetic attempt to show that the country is becoming more tolerant toward women appealing for the singer to at least call for her release on stage 
FEB1	Work isn’t working – but a four-day week would help fix it	Our current political moment is defined by a state of paralysis By refusing to face the reality of a broken economic model reactionary forces are driving us towards a future based on exclusion continued deregulation and the scrapping of workers rights Instead of conceding to this inevitable race to the bottom progressive forces of all kinds need to meet the crises of the st century head on by putting forward proposals that tangibly improve people s lives  As Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has demonstrated in the US with the green new deal fresh proposals can change political and economic narratives so as to embrace collective opportunity potentially avert catastrophe and move us towards sustainable futures What will make up our new deal here in the UK A new report by Autonomy a thinktank of which I am co director argues that a shorter working week should be a central pillar of our economic future 
FEB1	Theresa May is trying to bribe the people of Redcar. She can forget it	For nearly a decade my constituents have been told to put up with austerity in the name of the national interest We were told the nation was broke so grandmothers had to be forced out of their family homes by the bedroom tax council workers had to lose their jobs crimes had to go unsolved disabled people had to lose financial support NHS walk in centres had to close wages had to flatline with workers reliant on Redcar s new food banks and our steelworks had to close with no government bailout These measures alone are enough to make us angry and resentful particularly while other areas seemed to prosper and government investment continued to flow elsewhere  Yet we learned yesterday that there is after all money magically available for a programme of national renewal for areas like mine on the condition I vote for Theresa May s Brexit deal It s amazing how much money which should have been distributed on the basis of need and fairness can suddenly be found to bribe MPs to vote for a deal that was dismissed by the largest parliamentary margin in history 
FEB1	The polar vortex has turned New Yorkers into Brits for one week only	Once the basics are covered and one s face is set against the storm there is nothing like a good weather event to excite bipartisan unity For a British person in the US the advent of the polar vortex this week has been an embarrassment of riches the like of which we haven t seen since first encountering the term thundersnow It was C with wind chill in New York this week and in a household in which my children persistently refuse to put on their coats the weather finally won on the school run we all went the full Shackleton  I m aware you have to squint slightly to make this experience a fully detribalised issue The crashing temperatures including a contender for the lowest ever on record in Chicago are linked to Arctic air being pushed south by disruptions to the jet stream that experts say is caused by global warming And enjoying both the frisson of cold air and repeated opportunity to use the word vortex relies on the luxury of minimal exposure 
FEB2	Forget philanthropy. The super-rich should be paying proper taxes	A half lie dominates modern culture that is worse than a straight lie because it contains enough truth to persuade readers who otherwise wouldn t be fooled The people from somewhere have risen up against the people from nowhere it runs The globalised elites once as comfortable in Manhattan as Davos have been humbled by the left behind working class  The half of the lie that s true is that Brexit Trump and the rise of the European radical right are shocks to the system Yet they are shocks that leave the holders of wealth and power remarkably unruffled 
FEB2	‘Bullshit’, not lies, is the corrosive influence blighting our public life	 Bullshit the philosopher Harry Frankfurt observed in a seminal essay on the subject is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about He wrote that in but he might have been watching recent episodes of This Week BBC s late night politics show presided over by Andrew Neil Over the past two weeks it s thrown up two car crash interviews that serve as textbook illustrations of Frankfurt s thesis  First we had the rightwing writer James Delingpole waxing lyrical about a no deal Brexit If ever there were a case of someone talking without knowing what he is talking about this was it The simplest of questions reduced Delingpole who clearly is as familiar with economics as Theresa May is with dancing to incoherently mumbling I don t know the answer Michel Barnier could probably have made a better fist of arguing for Brexit 
FEB2	Using the big freeze to deny climate change... stupidity or cynicism?	The winters of the early s were very cold and snowy in the northeastern United States where I grew up as elsewhere around the US and Europe I remember snowfalls that came up to my chin though of course I was only a few feet tall back then We now call those old fashioned winters precisely because they have grown so rare as a consequence of yes global warming  If you re younger than I am I became a demi centenarian three years ago those winters are likely to be outside the range of your experience And so it may seem plausible to you that cold snaps that in reality simply reflect the sort of weather that was commonplace just decades ago might constitute record or unprecedented cold 
FEB2	Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: their secret for a happy marriage? Separate TVs	At a party last week I was told that my viewing habits are not in keeping with those of my peer group I was talking about watching programmes when they are on according to the TV guide using an actual television which sits in the corner of my living room and my friends seemed confused by this  I started to wonder if I was doing it wrong I had a sudden realisation that perhaps with this cold snap and self imposed January puritanism and all the rest of it I might have been watching more than normal a fact confirmed when I started to reel off the afternoon s quiz shows in scheduled order Tipping Point first 
FEB2	North to south, the seeds of division in Brexit Britain were sown long ago	The Australian writer and academic Donald Horne is best remembered in Britain for his vivid summation of one of its largest divisions that between the north and the south Writing in Horne decided that the Britain of what he called the northern metaphor was pragmatic empirical calculating Puritan bourgeois enterprising adventurous scientific serious and believes in struggle while in the southern metaphor the same country was romantic illogical muddled divinely lucky Anglican aristocratic traditional frivolous and believes in order and tradition The north s great sin was a ruthless avarice rationalised in the belief that humanity s prime impulse was a calculating economic self interest the south matched it with a ruthless pride that believed men are born to serve  Horne included Scotland with northern England as the north and if he d thought about it he might well have included Wales too because what he considered to be northern qualities had matured in the places most affected by the industrial revolution But it was not as though Horne believed these attitudes were strictly defined by geography as though the traveller left the village ponds of Sussex in fuzzy Technicolor and arrived at Manchester s mills in stark black and white

FEB3	An orderly Brexit depends on a united Tory party. So start stockpiling now	Let us take a stroll down the shabby corridors of Conservative history it is June and the party leadership vacated by John Major after New Labour s landslide is being contested in the second round of the race by William Hague John Redwood and Kenneth Clarke  In a desperate bid to see off Hague the arch Europhile Clarke and the arch Eurosceptic Redwood form a pact founded on the principle that Europe will be an open issue in the party and that Tory MPs will not be bound by a strict party policy There is much talk of a historic breakthrough an end to the long Conservative civil war over Britain s relationship with the EU and a new era of internal party unity But even those responsible for this brief alliance know it is nonsense on stilts In his memoirs Clarke jovially describes it as a last desperate idea quickly condemned by MPs on both sides of the divide as a Nazi Soviet agreement 
FEB3	Roma is a cinematic triumph. Can it teach Trump’s America the value of compassion?	Staying in Santiago Chile at the moment I see echoes and reflections of Cleo the servant at the heart of Alfonso Cuar n s wondrous film Roma everywhere Cuar n s consummate recreation of his Mexico City childhood in the early s has garnered Oscar nominations and is a favourite for the top prizes later this month including best picture best actress for Yalitza Aparicio who plays Cleo and best director for Cuar n  I see Cleo in the maids who trudge to work at seven in the morning after two hours of gruelling travel from the outskirts of the city They hurry along so they can make a hot breakfast for their employers I see Cleo in the caretaker who spends night after night sitting with an octogenarian friend who is dying of cancer I see Cleo in the women who sweep the floors of a nearby hospital and those who serve the food at a cafeteria in the civil registry office I see her in the female workers who water the municipal gardens in the morning and pick up the trash in the afternoons 
FEB3	I did Veganuary, and now I’m staying vegan. Here’s what I’ve learned so far	We know the world is eating too much meat and we know that we as individuals have to do something about it So I was one of the record people who signed up to Veganuary this year  I haven t actually eaten meat for years although I occasionally ate fish and felt bad about it Two years ago I visited a modern British dairy farm where the cows were kept in very clean conditions indoors all year round I hated it So I switched to oat milk and last year gave up eating cheese But there s still plenty of animal products in cakes and biscuits And so until January I wasn t vegan 
FEB3	With the right funding model, journalism can pay its way	The question most asked by journalists just now aside from the routine one about Brexit is how their trade will be funded in future Indeed at local level there is increasing concern about whether there will be any trade at all  Look at the state of the big three regional publishers JPI Media owner of the i newspaper the Scotsman The Yorkshire Post and about more titles was founded last November from the ashes of Johnston Press after it went into administration It began this year by announcing a series of cover price rises and followed up with a review aimed at relocating offices and merging newsrooms a euphemism for reducing journalistic staff 
FEB3	Leave Brigitte Macron alone. We French need to lay off our first ladies	It s almost a ritual In France it takes only a few months after the election of a new president for essays pamphlets picture albums novels even about the great man s political ideas but also his true or hidden personal story to start flooding bookshops More surprisingly and perhaps more revealingly France s first ladies get a similar treatment  Although Emmanuel Macron has been in power for only months his wife Brigitte has already been the subject of five books In January Brigitte Macron L affranchie came out followed four months later by Brigitte Macron La confidente We were also treated to Les Macron and Lettre Ouverte Brigitte Macron a plea for assisted dying by an author hoping she would pass the message on to her other half so he d make it legal 
FEB3	One day, a second people’s vote will bring us back into the EU. But when?	I marched for a people s vote I co wrote a book making the case for one a case that included a massive programme of reform I have argued for it in many public meetings Britain can and must be a member of this club of like minded European states at the global standard setting centre of the world s largest free trading network It transcends the World Trade Organization in importance and reach confirmed on Friday by the Japan EU trade deal  For the EU is the enabler of prosperity and guarantor of peace in Europe It is the friend of every principal economic interest group from farmers to magic circle law firms from university lecturers to trade unionists The British are culturally and philosophically Europeans even though too many still believe in the myth of our Dunkirk spirit exceptionalism 
FEB3	The Tories should heed Oliver Letwin. They won’t be forgiven a no-deal Brexit	One of the better because more honest speeches delivered during parliament s most recent Brexit debate came from Oliver Letwin While other Tories carried on fantasising and wrangling about what they would or would not permit Sir Oliver confessed that he was past caring what deal we have and would support whatever Mrs May comes up with next He would do so the former cabinet minister explained because if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal and the consequences are bad my party will not be forgiven for many years  Were I a Tory I d pay attention to that warning Sir Oliver speaks with experience of what follows when politicians wilfully inflict abominations on their voters He was one of the architects of the poll tax in the s Some readers may need reminding that this reckless experiment in changing local taxation without thinking through the consequences led to rioting in Trafalgar Square and the defenestration of Margaret Thatcher at the hands of her own party 
FEB3	We’re fixated by giving things up. After Dry January, I’m saying yes to indulgence	The dryness of January ended with overnight snowfall and according to the app on my phone the saving of units of alcohol and calories The calendar shows I managed drink free days One night is accounted for by a birthday party at which I drank three glasses of champagne and the hostess s daughter surprisingly burst out of a cake The night before having an early evening meal in an Italian restaurant I became so exasperated by the boredom the sheer even keel of my days their monotonous sameness of my mood that I ordered an Aperol spritz and felt that familiar surge of temporary joy and satisfaction that I associate with the varied world of cocktails  I ve never given anything up for Lent I ve never even managed hours of Yom Kippur fasting I m new to this world I didn t think there was a problem with my drinking I assumed I was a moderate drinker one or two units three or four times a week less if I m not going out more if I m on holiday when a glass of chilly white wine is the boundary between swimming pool and dinner table I don t go to pubs I almost never drink at lunchtime I don t go on benders It s many years since I had a hangover and it would never have occurred to me to give up alcohol were it not for the relentless nagging of the Dry January campaign promising me undreamed of benefits better sleep more money more energy weight loss and this was a new whammy lowering one s risk of cancer

FEB4	North-east England will pay the price for decades of dishonesty about Nissan	The sprawling site near Sunderland of the giant Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is a fine tuned product of Britain s participation in the European Union The company s decision to pull the making of its proposed new X Trail model out of that plant is a disastrous consequence of the failure to explain this to the British people  The virtual absence of public explanation about the benefits of EU membership was exploited in the referendum by the leave campaign and enabled its proponents to dismiss well informed warnings then and now as scaremongering Even on Sunday when Nissan itself explained that Brexit uncertainty was a factor in its decision to build the new SUV in Japan airtime was still given to Brexit campaigners denying this Prominent among them predictably was Jacob Rees Mogg a backbench Conservative MP with no discernible car industry expertise or experience whose Somerset constituency could hardly be further away from the north east 
FEB4	Nick Clegg betrayed the public – and now he’s failing upwards at Facebook	No amount of Auto Tuned apologies will make me forgive Nick Clegg Ever since he shone in televised electoral debates by remembering audience members names this trick is used by every snake oil salesman on the planet I do not want earnest young men in Currys or on my doorstep calling me Susan And this is but one of his legacies Nick I could a been a contender Clegg actually was a contender This is mind warping He was as my youngest said like prime minister or something He was in fact deputy prime minister and we are meant to be grateful to him for curbing the worst excesses of the Tories  No one is though In spite of fine speeches about liberal values no one cares about Nick s views now do they He betrayed the public and his core vote in student towns on tuition fees The Liberal Democrat compromise on proportional representation meant that a crucial argument on electoral reform was never made Under his leadership the Lib Dems went from a party of MPs to eight Clegg had been told that to act as a power in a coalition government he would need to deliver specifically in certain ministries Instead he insisted on a Lib Dem presence across the board It failed 
FEB4	Stop the new deportation flights to Jamaica. They shouldn’t be happening	Given the justified outrage there was when the Windrush scandal was exposed many Britons may be surprised to know that the government is planning a secret flight to forcibly remove more than people to Jamaica on Wednesday The last flight took place in Then more than people were each shackled and cuffed to two security guards throughout the entire journey Although for years I and other campaigners have been campaigning against such deportations and other aspects of the government s hostile environment it was the reporting on cases that became known as the Windrush scandal that finally drew attention to the gross injustices faced by many of that generation  In light of the scandal a planned charter flight to Jamaica last spring was cancelled Charter flights to Jamaica but not other countries were suspended Until now 
FEB4	Trump set a low bar for other deluded billionaires flirting with a 2020 run	Donald Trump has set a low bar for other billionaires who are contemplating a run for the White House  Why not me they ponder Trump had no experience in government before he won the Republican nomination He was just a popular TV reality star who branded his name on every piece of real estate he built He wasn t even that successful in business going bankrupt more than once He s a lazy bones too rarely hitting the Oval Office until am according to Axios which obtained his daily schedules His approval ratings may never again cross If President Trump runs again he certainly looks beatable 
FEB4	Faith should be no barrier to schools teaching respect for LGBT rights	Recently we ve seen several clashes between local communities and education leaders over the application of the Equality Act in Britain s schools Shraga Stern the Orthodox Jewish activist warned earlier this year that Haredi Jews would leave the UK if faiths schools were forced to teach children about same sex relationships and gender reassignment And last month the headteacher of a school in Birmingham was petitioned by mainly Muslim parents to do away with a pilot programme called No Outsiders which is centred around inclusion and diversity as part of sex and relationship education Although the programme addresses issues as broad as gender race ageism faith and disability the spotlight has inevitably fallen on the teaching of LGBT identities  Children will naturally have questions but it is dangerous to assume they will all be able to ask their parents
FEB4	Rebuild the faded towns of Britain to end our national malaise	For the past nine years or so I have been observing a regular journalistic ritual In pursuit of enlightenment over where the country may be going how people are going to vote and their opinions about such massive issues as Brexit and Scottish independence I have pitched up in scores of places and begun my inquiries with some version of a simple question how is this place doing  In most cases I can still depend on the same answer quickly cropping up in at least of conversations a loud complaint about the number of closed down shops and the dire state of the town centre To some extent such stories have now hardened into a grim cliche summed up by those shots of boarded up premises that are a staple of the TV news and weekly reports about the fate of our high streets But that does not make what people say any less true or detract from how passionately they feel about something that has now been happening for over a decade 
FEB4	I once stole a 99p book. Twenty years later it’s still stopping me getting a job	Twenty years ago I made two mistakes  First I was caught stealing a book worth p then I compounded this by missing an appointment before a magistrate I received two convictions 
FEB4	My son’s life depends on this cystic fibrosis drug. And ministers stand in the way	Luis was three weeks old when we found out he had cystic fibrosis Neither my husband nor I had heard of the condition before but we knew very quickly our lives were about to change for ever from that moment Of all of the stats thrown at you when you hear the diagnosis one sticks out more than any other Luis s life expectancy was my age at the time We would most likely outlive our baby boy  Luis is eight years old now and though parts of our routine will be recognisable to every parent he has a life of many challenges It starts in the morning with a medical regime that takes up to two and half hours Every day he takes tablets three nebulisers two inhalers nasal sprays and lots of supplements The condition means he struggles to put on any weight so we need to keep a constant eye on his eating to ensure he gets much more than the recommended calorie intake for children of his age He ll have physio sessions too and be surrounded constantly by adults worrying if he s OK Then before bed he ll have another hour and a half of his medical regime Those are the good days 
FEB4	Roma is a cinematic triumph. Can it teach Trump’s America the value of compassion?	Staying in Santiago Chile at the moment I see echoes and reflections of Cleo the servant at the heart of Alfonso Cuar n s wondrous film Roma everywhere Cuar n s consummate recreation of his Mexico City childhood in the early s has garnered Oscar nominations and is a favourite for the top prizes later this month including best picture best actress for Yalitza Aparicio who plays Cleo and best director for Cuar n  I see Cleo in the maids who trudge to work at seven in the morning after two hours of gruelling travel from the outskirts of the city They hurry along so they can make a hot breakfast for their employers I see Cleo in the caretaker who spends night after night sitting with an octogenarian friend who is dying of cancer I see Cleo in the women who sweep the floors of a nearby hospital and those who serve the food at a cafeteria in the civil registry office I see her in the female workers who water the municipal gardens in the morning and pick up the trash in the afternoons 
FEB4	I did Veganuary, and now I’m staying vegan. Here’s what I’ve learned so far	We know the world is eating too much meat and we know that we as individuals have to do something about it So I was one of the record people who signed up to Veganuary this year  I haven t actually eaten meat for years although I occasionally ate fish and felt bad about it Two years ago I visited a modern British dairy farm where the cows were kept in very clean conditions indoors all year round I hated it So I switched to oat milk and last year gave up eating cheese But there s still plenty of animal products in cakes and biscuits And so until January I wasn t vegan 
FEB5	Liam Neeson’s interview shows that for some, black people are still not fully human	 When I was coming up in Mississippi I never knew it was against the law to kill a black man the late Buford Posey told me when he was I learned that when I went in the army I was years old When they told me I thought they were joking I was grateful for his candour Back in the day they used to call it nigger hunting A posse of good ol boys would head out in search of a black man to pay the price for his melanin and their inadequacies It was a relief to have a white person offer an honest reflection on the racial mores of the time  So following Liam Neeson s recent interview we should at the very least admire him for his candour For all the talk of a post racial society and Enlightenment values here s a white man who admits he literally went out for a week or more looking for a black man to murder It seems the bad old days of Buford Posey s youth aren t as distant a memory as some would like to think When it comes to race and racism we are not simply far from the place many thought we were we are not even where even more still pretend to be The next time someone asks me why I have a chip on my shoulder I need no longer brush the question away with disdain I can say with all sincerity Because there may well be an Oscar nominated actor out there who wants to kill me so I have to be alert at all times 
FEB5	So Revolut, I’m a single woman. How does that make me a sad, lonely loser?	Face it You re a loser You re a sad lonely loser There you are slumped on your sofa gulping down a bowl of grease alone And you thought you could keep it secret Well we know exactly what you re doing and we think it s tragic but also quite funny So we thought we d get everyone else to titter at the mess you ve made of your life  This appeared to be the message one company was keen to send out to single women this week Next to a giant bank card on one of the billboard ads for financial technology company Revolut were the words To the people who ordered a single takeaway on Valentine s Day Followed by the punchline You OK hun 
FEB5	The UK right loves this youth group. But it has a worrying US history	As political launches go it fish tailed rather than flew Amid a raft of endorsements from conservative and reactionary figures Turning Point UK a local offshoot of an American conservative youth movement hit social media with all the grace of a pigeon slamming into a plate glass window Instead of a brave bunch of plucky young Britons ready to crowbar free the stranglehold the left supposedly has on UK youth our heroes were subjected to a sustained shower of ridicule the likes of which hasn t been seen on Twitter for well at least a fortnight  Turning Point UK says it aims to challenge the idea that young people are inherently left leaning and seeks to fight against socialism racism and identity politics But recommendations from such reactionary bad boys as Infowars Paul Joseph Watson Breitbart s James Delingpole and Westminster s Michael Heaver weren t enough to drown out the ridicule Nor were the endorsements from Tory right MPs such as Jacob Rees Mogg Ben Bradley Priti Patel Chris Green and Steve Baker among others The wisecracks particularly about star recruit Darren Grimes who is still looking at a fine from the Electoral Commission simply wrote themselves 
FEB5	The EU’s deal with Libya is sentencing refugees to death	Haftom a year old Eritrean dentist used to tell a joke that went like this God was watching the globe and saw Eritrea was green How did this country become so green he wondered and went to investigate But when he got there he saw the green was overcrowded militias  Of course this was black humour Like tens of thousands of others Haftom fled Eritrea one of the most isolated dictatorships in the world He wanted to get away from brutal leaders who controlled every aspect of his life from his profession and his salary to where he could live and what he could speak about Friends described him as a quiet smart man who had eventually despaired of any chance that things would get better 
FEB5	MPs, step away from the social media. Twitter is not your friend	In the early s politicians sometimes made the mistake of agreeing to be interviewed by Ali G the spoof character played by Sacha Baron Cohen It never went well for them In in the process of navigating Ali G s confusion over BLTs bacon lettuce and tomato sandwiches and WMDs weapons of mass destruction the American pundit Pat Buchanan ended up stating that Saddam Hussein was at one time using BLTs on the Kurds Is it ever worth fighting a war over sandwiches his interviewer replied The Green party presidential candidate Ralph Nader was lured by his host s questions into discussing the difficulties of getting cows to break wind into boxes so as to conserve energy Any good these people had imagined might be done them by the exposure was always entirely undone by the nature of that exposure They always ended up looking like idiots  A similar mistake is made when British politicians decide to join Twitter Almost all MPs have an account now and some tweet more than times a day But Twitter is not there to help them It is there to trip them up First it lulls them into a false sense of security rewarding chit chat about their pets or their constituency welcoming them into an environment where other people not MPs are free to tweet unguarded thoughts and opinions and then at some unspecified but certain point it brutally shames them in front of the whole world Twitter has nothing to lose and they do 
FEB5	Another Brexit referendum would be the EU’s worst nightmare	Is it not time for the Dis united Kingdom to adopt a new national anthem A song more suited perhaps to the extraordinary spectacle that it has been putting on for the world since June  I d vote for Hotel California by the Eagles We are all just prisoners here Of our own device You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave Britain reminds me of the drug addict of the song who wants to get clean but keeps failing 
FEB5	A statue of Margaret Thatcher? No plinth will be too high for the vandals	Place an obstacle in the path and many people will seek to overcome it Urban planners build footpaths pedestrians forge their own desire lines Hanging a Do not climb plaque is often a psychological incentive for people to clamber on to the forbidden edifice This aspect of human nature should have occurred to the people behind the proposed installation of an enormous Margaret Thatcher statue in her home town Grantham in Lincolnshire In order to prevent the statue being besieged by vandals it will have to stand atop a three metre ft plinth  Creative critics of Thatcher s legacy have already proposed workarounds paintball target practice hammer throwing competitions and the simple but trusty ladder The depth of antipathy to the former prime minister means no matter what is built in her honour it will draw vandals and dissenters Knowing in advance that a statue commemorating her is likely to be defaced immediately it is mystifying to insist on erecting it at all Thatcher s legacy remains with us today and is still comfortably within living memory that history therefore is still contested and fought over Her fans and critics are embroiled in a battle to have their perspective recognised and recorded in history s narrative 
FEB5	Who’s going to care about the women being forced out of work?	What would drive thousands of people a year out of jobs they love or need with no certainty about whether they will ever be able to come back  If you have parents of a certain age you might already have guessed the answer About people a day are giving up their jobs to look after elderly or sick relatives the charity Carers UK estimates a hidden exodus from working life that we don t discuss nearly enough Young women are bombarded practically from the cradle with conflicting advice about how to have it all as working mothers yet hear almost nothing about coping as working daughters in an age of unravelling safety nets And yes about of carers are male which means many thousands of men are also toiling unpaid round the clock but women are statistically more likely to care for parents and men for spouses meaning men are more likely to care in retirement and women when they are still young enough to be working 
FEB5	Parliament voted to get a Brexit deal done now. So let’s make it happen	Parliamentary turmoil over Brexit has lasted almost days and still the arguments rage Last week saw a glimmer of a solution  Strip away the theatrics and the parliamentary proceduralism and it became pretty clear what parliament voted for 
FEB5	Fantasies of Dunkirk spirit couldn’t survive a no-deal Brexit	There s a frisson of excitement in the air among Brexiters The coming crisis brings an eve of battle thrill to those who invented all this pointlessness They relish a cataclysm to blame on the enemy across the Channel There is hope says Jacob Rees Mogg Tick tock goes the clock and as it ticks down we get closer to leaving And when we leave we have taken back control we are in charge Geronimo  No deal Brexit will feel about as in control as a blindfold skiing novice pushed off piste from a black run But it certainly won t be dull We have lived years of boring peace on our shores so the Brexiters savour a faux war to test our mettle If you enjoy those olden days TV shows Back in Time for School Dinner no deal will let us play it at home Can we still survive hard times How s your kitchen cupboard How s your nerve How s your business and your job Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood it s time to test our national fibre 
FEB6	Climate change is the deadliest legacy we will leave the young	One of the strange things that happens when you start work on a novel is that you realise what s been preoccupying you sometimes without you knowing it I was about a third of the way into my new novel The Wall when I discovered that I was completely obsessed by intergenerational inequality In particular by the question of intergenerational inequality linked to climate change Who knew Certainly not me  Now there s nothing wrong with intergenerational inequality At least there s nothing wrong with the version of it that existed in the developed world for much of the th century That kind of inequality was based on the idea that life should be gradually better from one generation to another more secure more prosperous healthier longer That means that children got a better deal than their parents but that was fine indeed in this version of the social contract that was the whole point 
FEB6	A special place in hell? Donald Tusk didn’t go far enough	Donald Tusk should be criticised not for his malice but his moderation The European council president triggered a tsunami of confected outrage from leavers today when he observed with some justice that there should be a special place in hell for those who promoted Brexit without a plan But he should have said far more He should have added that within that special place there should be an executive suite of sleepless torment for those politicians who promoted Brexit without ever giving a stuff about Ireland  Once again Brexit is all coming down to Ireland This was always going to happen and rightly so Time after time in our history Ireland emerges as an awkward reality check that shames the fantasies of those who think the British are better and that Ireland can be ignored So there is something both fateful and tragic about the fact Theresa May should have prepared for the final showdown by having to make a rare visit to Ireland 
FEB6	We in the Stansted 15 have been treated like terrorists	Along with other peaceful protesters I was found guilty of a controversial terror related offence in December after stopping a mass deportation flight from taking off On Wednesday we avoided prison  The judge awarded most of us community service and three of us suspended sentences We could have been given life in jail and I m so relieved that hasn t happened But I m also angry We might not be going to prison but we ve still been found guilty of a crime we clearly did not commit We are a group of peaceful protesters but the state has convicted us of a terror related offence This was done without any transparency by the Crown Prosecution Service CPS and neither the CPS nor the attorney general have explained this decision It was an abuse of power that never should have happened 
FEB6	Dear Theresa May, your Brexit plan is doomed. Here’s a deal that will work	Dear Mrs May  I write to you at a time of grave national crisis beholden to no party a representative of no special interest and in nobody s pocket I am however a concerned citizen a mother and an employer and I am hopeful that in view of the deadlock in our politics just weeks before we are due to leave the European Union on March you will have the intellectual and moral honesty to consider a commonsense and pragmatic proposal 
FEB6	The talented Dan Mallory affair: is this high noon for the privileged white male?	There s a new work that has the publishing world gripped with editors in London and New York confessing themselves hooked It races along like a thriller with several dizzying twists and turns and a compelling central character What s more this sensational story is not fiction but a detailed well sourced work of journalism  I m referring to the New Yorker s word profile of Dan Mallory whose debut novel The Woman in the Window published under the pseudonym AJ Finn has been a monster hit The report makes an unsettling read charting what the magazine calls the trail of deceptions left by Mallory including claims that he has endured and survived cancer in various forms with tumours in both his brain and spine that his parents were dead and that his brother took his own life 
FEB6	The children skipping school aren't ruining the planet – you are	If there is one political subject that remains neglected and underestimated because of how we have for centuries run our societies economies and families then it is children Although the experience and process of growing up has in many ways profoundly changed through history our understanding of children has failed to keep pace  Nothing makes this clearer than the children s climate strikes These protests involving school age children refusing to attend class to focus the attention of political leaders on the global climate crisis have spread from Australia to Germany from Sweden to Belgium the first strikes in the UK take place this Friday and in the US later this month But instead of taking themseriously many adults usually though not exclusively old men in leadership positions are still dismissing them with the utterly paternalistic argument that all these protests are nice and cute but skipping school Why can t the children protest in their free time instead of endangering their own education and their future which we the adults supposedly have provided for them 
FEB6	Sajid Javid’s deportation flight shows the hostile environment in action	A private Titan Airways jet left Birmingham on Wednesday morning carrying about people forcibly expelling them from the UK on a flight bound for Jamaica It is the first such flight since the revelations surrounding the Windrush scandal and it left hours before the activists known as the Stansted were sentenced for peacefully grounding a charter flight in March For many in the Caribbean community and migrant rights campaigners this charter flight is a slap in the face a reminder that lessons from the Windrush scandal have not been learned and that the government s hostile environment immigration policy endures  However the charter flight is being seemingly justified on the grounds that the people on the flight have criminal records The home secretary Sajid Javid said on Tuesday Every single person that will be on that flight that is being deported is a foreign national offender they are all convicted of serious crimes very serious crimes It s not clear what the home secretary defines as very serious here as it seems that some people on the flight have been convicted of minor offences Take Akeem who is registered blind and suffers from epilepsy following a brain tumour as a child and who served a four month sentence for an assault conviction Javid used the same term when explaining that he would not assist wrongly deported Windrush migrants with criminal records But whether they committed crimes serious or not Javid reminds us that those fighting for migrant rights need to develop arguments that can include those with criminal records 
FEB6	A ‘duty of care’ for sexists – no wonder Warwick students are furious	The University of Warwick is renowned for academic excellence but for many who have studied there it has a reputation for very different reasons Today the student union is supporting a protest on campus against sexism racism and rape culture at the university  It was reported last week that two male undergraduates who were among a group who had used reprehensible racist antisemitic and ableist language while joking about raping their female peers were being allowed to return after a year s suspension despite the university s original decision to ban them from campus for a decade 
FEB6	Liam Neeson laid bare the logic of lynching, in all its horror	In an interview with the UK s Independent newspaper the action star Liam Neeson who was on a press junket to promote his new action movie Cold Pursuit admitted to wanting racist revenge Decades ago he said a friend of his had confided that she had been raped Neeson asked if she knew the man who had raped her and when she said no he asked the man s race She told him that the attacker had been black Neeson said that after this he was intent on murdering a black man He said he walked the streets carrying a cosh British slang for a bludgeon going into black neighborhoods and hoping to find himself in a fight so that he would have an excuse to beat a black man to death All of this came from a feeling of defensiveness toward his friend he said Thus he would murder a black man on her behalf  The comment sparked controversy and anger black people rightly pointed out that this attitude seeks to impose collective punishment putting their communities in grave and pointless danger Many were angry at Neeson for not condemning his own past racism instead saying that the episode had taught him a lesson about the danger and futility of revenge In response Neeson went on Good Morning America I am not a racist he said and added unhelpfully that he had overcome his urges by power walking While he was there he also promoted his new movie 
FEB6	Who smashed up Karl Marx’s grave? Here are the prime suspects	On Tuesday nearly years after his death somebody decided to stop the rise of communism by trashing Karl Marx s gravestone before it s too late  It s a weird time to do it Who could be mad enough at him that they want vengeance given that he is at most fairly politically inactive as a corpse The perpetrator is believed to have used a hammer not even paying him the respect of also using a sickle so they must really hate the guy 
FEB7	Why disaster capitalists are praying for a no-deal Brexit	Part of me wants to smash it all up I want to see the British bubble burst the imperial nostalgia the groundless belief in the inherent greatness of this nation the casual dishonesty of those who govern us the xenophobia the intolerance the denial the complacency I want those who have caused the coming disaster to own it so that nobody ever believes them again No deal Brexit Bring it on  Such dark thoughts do not last long It will be the poor who get hurt first and worst The rich leavers demanding the hardest of possible Brexits with their offshore accounts homes abroad and lavish pensions will be all right I remember the eerie silence of the City of London While the bosses of companies producing goods and tangible services write anxious letters to the papers the financial sector has stayed largely shtum Shorting sterling is just the first of its possible gains 
FEB7	Yes, I do give a sh*t about these sweary book covers	Among the boom in self help books on the shelves this year there is a title by life coach Andrea Owen called How to Stop Feeling Like Sh t It has a quote on the cover from Jen Sincero author of You Are a Badass and comes hard on the heels of Unf ck Yourself F ck Feelings F k Anxiety Calm the F k Down Unf ck Your Brain How to Make Sh t Happen and the mother of all sweary self help titles Mark Manson s juggernaut The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F ck  Most of these books present perfectly sensible ideas about how to stop jeopardising your own efforts and escape negative thought loops They compile lists of bad habits and address self defeating behaviours and a few years ago when the trend started taking off they sounded naughty and arresting in a light handed way 
FEB7	Labour will be punished by voters if it gives any backing at all to Brexit	Jeremy Corbyn s letter to Theresa May last night offering to slightly soften his Brexit stance risks stirring a backlash from Labour supporters A new poll makes it devastatingly clear that if Labour is perceived as having enabled Brexit it will lose seats including five of its seven precious Scottish seats  Labour s true heartlands are remain four fifths of Labour voters think May s deal will hurt the British economy and of them don t trust the government to deliver a good Brexit Remainers will desert and punish the party in droves unless it opposes Brexit This outlook comes from a large poll of more than people it was commissioned by TSSA the transport union which has always backed Corbyn It was meant to be private advice to him but it leaked There can be no disguising the sense of disappointment and disillusionment with Labour if it fails to oppose Brexit and there is every indication that it will be far more damaging to the party s electoral fortunes than the Iraq war the polling document reports 
FEB7	Teaching all pupils to act more like Etonians won’t help solve inequality	It really does take a special kind of inattention to observe public life today and conclude that what we need is more public school swagger Our politics is currently dominated by men who are so convinced of their own swag it s dangerous We know where politics as a debating society with no real world consequences leads Jacob Rees Mogg and Boris Johnson are exemplary only in their callous recklessness Still here we have the education secretary Damian Hinds I know no one knows who he is or what he does as Brexit has vacuumed all policy into its void suggesting that state school pupils should practise debating and public speaking to compete against Old Etonians in the workplace   Public school confidence is something he wants to call time on so that all kinds of everyone can hold their own Wow This is hardly an unfamiliar idea is it That one can achieve privilege through class mimicry instead of er having actual privilege In order to be taken seriously one must adhere to the mores of those who have effortlessly risen to the top because of their special education 
FEB7	How could a cheerleader for Ukip ever become CEO of Women’s Aid?	In early January I was due to speak at the opening of an exhibition about the domestic violence refuges of the s and s Out of curiosity I Googled the woman who was to speak alongside me Katie Ghose at the time the CEO of Women s Aid What I discovered astounded me  In two years before she joined Women s Aid she had as CEO of the Electoral Reform Society ERS spoken at the Ukip annual conference and enthused about the party s passion for a new way of doing politics referring to Douglas Carswell as an outstanding MP and praising Nigel Farage At a fringe event organised by ERS at the Ukip conference she had hosted Katie Hopkins who had ranted about gassing members of the House of Lords 
FEB7	Labour MPs must not be fooled by Theresa May’s Brexit promises	Just when we think we have reached peak Brexit complexity we always seem to go one better As Jeremy Corbyn s letter to Theresa May laying out Labour s terms for supporting her deal made the headlines I simultaneously got an email from a local party member decrying Labour facilitating Brexit and a text from a local resident saying Yay this is clear and offers a soft Brexit Putting aside issues of where such a move leaves Labour with members and the electorate where does this letter leave us in terms of the potential renegade Labour MPs willing to vote for May s deal as long as there are sweeteners  In the absence of May being able to ensure a permanent customs union it seems to make it more likely that Brexit bribes will be on offer and potentially more likely that they ll be taken up It s not just the political dangers of such a move that are a problem here it s that a politically motivated half baked short term regional investment programme will do nothing to address deep rooted inequalities in the UK 
FEB7	Climate change is the deadliest legacy we will leave the young	One of the strange things that happens when you start work on a novel is that you realise what s been preoccupying you sometimes without you knowing it I was about a third of the way into my new novel The Wall when I discovered that I was completely obsessed by intergenerational inequality In particular by the question of intergenerational inequality linked to climate change Who knew Certainly not me  Now there s nothing wrong with intergenerational inequality At least there s nothing wrong with the version of it that existed in the developed world for much of the th century That kind of inequality was based on the idea that life should be gradually better from one generation to another more secure more prosperous healthier longer That means that children got a better deal than their parents but that was fine indeed in this version of the social contract that was the whole point 
FEB7	Forget new trade deals – Britain’s struggling to keep the ones it has	 Global Britain advocates often fail to acknowledge the long list of countries the UK already has free trade agreements FTAs with by virtue of its EU membership The EU s trade partners include Turkey Israel Morocco South Korea South Africa Chile Mexico and more recently Canada and Japan  And these agreements matter to British business up to of UK exports are to countries the EU already has a trade agreement with It is of little surprise that the Brexit priority for most British businesses after securing a deep relationship with the UK s most important trading partner the EU is not future free trade agreements with the US New Zealand and others but replacing those that already exist 
FEB7	Only a small, sad nation robs its people of arts and culture	As it emerged Grantham Museum will soon look out on to a bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher I found myself thinking about the last time I stepped foot in there  Growing up in the town in the s the local museum was a cheap trip out for my primary school class a sea of sticky fingers smudging the glass I still remember the smell a sort of musty air mixed with a whiff of adventure 
FEB7	Why are so many women writing about rough sex?	Recently I have found myself wondering about the prevalence of rough sex in new fiction written by women It s viscerally present in You Know You Want This the new short story collection by Kristen Roupenian who shot to fame last year with Cat Person published in the New Yorker I found some of the scenes so unpalatable that I had to keep putting it down They spoiler alert include a woman strangled to death as part of a sex game a man who imagines his penis is a knife when he has sex and a woman who says to the guy she is sleeping with I want you to punch me in the face as hard as you can After you ve punched me when I ve fallen down I want you to kick me in the stomach And then we can have sex  Now my personal discomfort with the sexual content is no comment on its quality fiction that never challenges us isn t good fiction at all Each reader can make up their own mind about how good the work is But what is interesting about this rough sex is what it tells us about the current cultural moment It is supposed to be edgy and transgressive in You Know You Want This it feels deliberately put there to shock and yet it s everywhere More often than not it is women writing it and female characters desiring it and frequently those characters are using sadomasochistic sex as a way of processing their own trauma The MeToo and Time s Up movements have shone a light on abuse and harassment so it s no wonder a new generation of women are exploring how that manifests itself in sexual relationships 
FEB8	In the age of Trump and Bezos, public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase	Is there a Russian piss tape of Donald Trump Did a government agency intercept Amazon boss Jeff Bezos s dick pics How did Trump s cheerleaders at the National Enquirer get them Is this part of Trump s willy waving at Bezos as owner of the Washington Post Does the Enquirer s apparent blackmail threat to Bezos breach its plea deal with Robert Mueller s Trump Russia investigation which gave its owners American Media Inc immunity in exchange for evidence about Michael Cohen s role in its policy of buying and killing Trump sex expos s Is Riyadh somehow involved given AMI s business ties with senior Saudi figures and given that Bezos owns the Washington Post whose columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by the regime last October  Guys I don t know the answer to any of these questions but I am enjoying this reminder of why literally every American president has had a penis and why more than of Fortune CEOs do too Face it the plotlines are just better Public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase 
FEB8	We can’t wait for a people’s vote: make the case against Brexit right now	Sounding the klaxon and warning of imminent disaster is it turns out an even older British tradition than you might think A tour of the spellbinding Anglo Saxon Kingdoms exhibition at the British Library confirms that back in the year a scribbling sermoniser by the name of Gildas surely the Guardian columnist of his day was writing on the ruin of Britain Even before the country properly existed there were Cassandras to prophesy its demise  Still that same exhibition leaves the visitor in no doubt that what will befall these islands in less than days is of epic significance breaking a thread that has run through our long history Even in the age of Mercia the kingdom strained hard to connect with its neighbours in Francia Rome and Ireland The th century court of thelstan was a cosmopolitan magnet to scholars from all over the continent And need we mention that the Anglo Saxons were themselves migrants from northern Europe The Faragiste tendency which imagines a British past pure and unsullied by the taint of Europe imagines a past that did not exist 
FEB8	Liam Neeson started a vital debate. To condemn him is to end it	Everyone seems to have had their say on the Liam Neeson s racist interview including me I seem to be one of very few people defending him and I d like to explain why  I have been accused of being an apologist for a racist but let me start off by saying that I m sure that Neeson is as unconsciously racially biased as the next person Myself included This is perfectly understandable when you consider the value and worth ascribed to different groups by our society This is deeply ingrained in our history literature news reporting and beyond whether it s Muslim grooming gangs Nigerian conmen or Jamaican drug dealers 
FEB8	Whatever Luciana Berger’s politics, Labour members must stand with her against antisemitism	Some things in politics are far from being clear cut Here s something that is Luciana Berger Labour s MP for Liverpool Wavertree is the victim of antisemitic abuse and harassment She has suffered this for years In October a neo Nazi was jailed for sending her an antisemitic tweet Another online troll was jailed for spewing racist bile at her two years later Yet another was jailed in after calling Berger Jewish scum and suggesting she would get it like Jo Cox Berger has used Twitter to highlight some of the vile antisemitic abuse she received some of which looks like grotesque propaganda from s Nazi Germany  Berger has been courageous in confronting the hatred directed against her because she is Jewish and not only deserves solidarity but requires it The horror of antisemitism cannot be minimised Last year there were antisemitic incidents in the UK a increase on the year before including verbal abuse on the streets If you fail to extend solidarity to a victim of antisemitism because you do not agree with their politics then you do not truly oppose antisemitism at all Neither Labour s leadership nor the vast majority of Labour members are antisemitic but antisemitism does exist on fringes of the left and there has to be far more seriousness in rooting it out Those who deny it exists at all who think it s entirely a smear campaign and nothing else are part of the problem 
FEB8	Why disaster capitalists are praying for a no-deal Brexit	Part of me wants to smash it all up I want to see the British bubble burst the imperial nostalgia the groundless belief in the inherent greatness of this nation the casual dishonesty of those who govern us the xenophobia the intolerance the denial the complacency I want those who have caused the coming disaster to own it so that nobody ever believes them again No deal Brexit Bring it on  Such dark thoughts do not last long It will be the poor who get hurt first and worst The rich leavers demanding the hardest of possible Brexits with their offshore accounts homes abroad and lavish pensions will be all right I remember the eerie silence of the City of London While the bosses of companies producing goods and tangible services write anxious letters to the papers the financial sector has stayed largely shtum Shorting sterling is just the first of its possible gains 
FEB8	Goop has a Netflix deal – this is a dangerous win for pseudoscience	Are you wary of experts Do you enjoy a fact free lifestyle Are you itching to splurge on non toxic skin creams and carat gold sex toys Well I ve got brilliant news Goop Gwyneth Paltrow s controversial lifestyle brand has signed a deal with Netflix Soon we will all be able to stream Paltrow s glamorous strain of woo on demand  Keeping with the general theme of Goop facts about the new Netflix project are hard to come by All we know so far is that the docuseries minute episodes will be hosted by Paltrow and Elise Loehnen Goop s chief content officer Loehnen has also said the series seeks to dial up the aesthetics and quality of storytelling surrounding issues like mental physical and sexual health Which again keeping with the general theme of Goop sounds lovely but means little 
FEB8	My wife ended her life at Dignitas. Then the police came to talk to me	I could not fail to be moved when I read the Whaley family s story this week Geoff Whaley who had terminal motor neurone disease died on Thursday morning in the arms of his wife Ann at the Dignitas assisted dying facility in Switzerland He was able to fulfil his final wish to have control over his end and die peacefully rather than endure the final months of agony that his illness had in store for him  Their carefully laid plans had been jeopardised at the last moment when an anonymous call was made to social services alerted the police of their intentions Ann acting purely out of love and compassion was made to feel like a criminal for supporting her husband Anyone would feel for the family but this affected me more than most 
FEB8	The France-Italy row is theatrical – but such shows are dangerous for Europe	To describe this as the worst crisis between France and Italy since the second world war seems a bit of an overstatement It s not exactly as if troops are about to march across the Alps as Mussolini s did in Still when France recalled its ambassador from Rome this week after Italy s deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio had met a group of gilets jaunes protesters in central France it felt as if European politics had taken a dangerous turn Di Maio a leader of the anti establishment Five Star Movement had tweeted a photo of the meeting with the words the winds of change have crossed the Alps  No two European countries are culturally and historically closer than France and Italy They are founding members of the European project The two countries obsess about food and fashion alike they are Mediterranean and of a Latin culture 
FEB8	Think the backstop issue is insoluble? My Brexit plan will please everyone	What would prompt an academic from Germany to come up with a plan to try to end the current stalemate on the backstop the mechanism designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit The answer has three parts experience in negotiations gained during my time with a multinational company an academic interest in Brexit since including a study in which I compared it for complexity with the first moon landing and the third is that I m a father of two who can vividly imagine the consequences for families on both sides of the UK EU divide if these negotiations fail  My experience of business negotiations in China and Russia convinced me of how crucial trust is Without it any negotiation is doomed to failure You have to put yourself in the shoes of the other side and tough as that may be accept that you are not always right When we look at the deadlock between London and Brussels over the Northern Ireland backstop what we can observe after nearly two years of negotiations is the total breakdown of trust Once you hear from both sides the words this is a matter of principle you know you are very close to a showdown 
FEB8	Lung cancer needn’t be a killer. NHS mobile chest scans will save lives	A decade ago I decided to devote my career to tackling what many saw as one of medicine s biggest challenges lung cancer a smokers disease shrouded in unfair stigma prevalent among the most disadvantaged Patients would frequently arrive at clinic with the disease well advanced with few options beyond harsh radiotherapy and chemotherapy to buy a few extra months Curative surgery was effective only for a small fortunate proportion of patients who were diagnosed early  Ten years on much of this is still true The disease still claims lives prematurely every year many from the more deprived sectors of society Late diagnosis is still a huge issue with two thirds diagnosed at an advanced incurable stage In survival terms we re still doing worse than many comparable countries 
FEB9	A hidden government is preparing for Brexit… by keeping us in the dark	Brexit is killing many myths but its chief victim is the belief that Britain is not an absurd country The British establishment believed in our innate common sense as did admiring foreigners  Weirdly the supposedly cynical British public still does Voters damn politicians but assume they will somehow find a way through I doubt their confidence will last and they will soon see our new United Kingdom of Absurdistan for what it is a land where civil servants send military advisers into government departments as if the mandarins were planning a coup or draw up emergency measures to lift the Queen fall of Saigon style from Buckingham Palace or stockpile medicines as if we were at war We are at war in a sense only Brexit is a war the British have declared on themselves and still do not realise they are fighting 
FEB9	What does Liam Neeson’s ‘primal urge’ really tell us about racism?	It s been one hell of a week in the wide wide world of racism On Monday the Egyptian international Mohamed Salah was subjected to alleged racist abuse during Liverpool s match with West Ham On Wednesday memories of the Windrush scandal were awoken when people were forcibly expelled from the UK on a charter flight to Jamaica Then on Thursday Gucci released a polo neck jumper that covers the mouth and the chin of the wearer making them resemble a blackface minstrel You know like you do  Anyone hoping to cut through the background hum of structural inequality and racial insensitivity was really going to have to pull something special out of the bag Cue Liam Neeson who revealed that years ago he had entertained a racist lynching fantasy and actually gone out looking for a black man to murder The response of Neeson s co star Tom Bateman who was sitting beside him set the tone for what was to follow Holy shit 
FEB9	Since when was it a police job to impose sanctions on drill musicians?	The authorities ban musicians from playing without official approval The police prevent them from performing a song deemed unacceptable The courts threaten to imprison them when they do play it All this not in Russia or Iran but in Britain  Last month two drill musicians Skengdo and AM from the Brixton group were given nine month suspended sentences Their crime Performing their song Attempted at a gig in December In so doing they breached a court injunction issued in August It was producer and writer Ian McQuaid observed a watershed moment for the censorship of culture 
FEB9	In the age of Trump and Bezos, public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase	Is there a Russian piss tape of Donald Trump Did a government agency intercept Amazon boss Jeff Bezos s dick pics How did Trump s cheerleaders at the National Enquirer get them Is this part of Trump s willy waving at Bezos as owner of the Washington Post Does the Enquirer s apparent blackmail threat to Bezos breach its plea deal with Robert Mueller s Trump Russia investigation which gave its owners American Media Inc immunity in exchange for evidence about Michael Cohen s role in its policy of buying and killing Trump sex expos s Is Riyadh somehow involved given AMI s business ties with senior Saudi figures and given that Bezos owns the Washington Post whose columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by the regime last October  Guys I don t know the answer to any of these questions but I am enjoying this reminder of why literally every American president has had a penis and why more than of Fortune CEOs do too Face it the plotlines are just better Public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase 
FEB9	There will be no fake news in Martin Clunes’ Islands of America	The unwritten rules of documentary making can be a more controversial topic than one might expect remember Mary Beard s courageous admission that she isn t all that keen on re enactments but you know it s time to listen when Martin Clunes the king of gentle travel ish shows with a side serving of animals has something to say In the run up to his new series Islands of America last week Hawaii Alaska bear cubs Clunes told the Radio Times that he was not a fan of documentary cliches such as pretending to meet people for the first time when you ve already met them the night before If the crew want to shoot me doing a meet and greet it has to be genuine  Coincidentally I read this as I was watching the final season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt One of the episodes is a self referential documentary for the streaming service Houseflix in which a celebrity DJ attempts to uncover the truth about Jon Hamm s incarcerated kidnapper and rapist Richard Wayne Gary Wayne It s a collection of modern investigative documentary cliches from the grainy home footage compilation in the opening credits to the scruffy but tenacious lawyer working from his home office 
FEB9	We can’t wait for a people’s vote: make the case against Brexit right now	Sounding the klaxon and warning of imminent disaster is it turns out an even older British tradition than you might think A tour of the spellbinding Anglo Saxon Kingdoms exhibition at the British Library confirms that back in the year a scribbling sermoniser by the name of Gildas surely the Guardian columnist of his day was writing on the ruin of Britain Even before the country properly existed there were Cassandras to prophesy its demise  Still that same exhibition leaves the visitor in no doubt that what will befall these islands in less than days is of epic significance breaking a thread that has run through our long history Even in the age of Mercia the kingdom strained hard to connect with its neighbours in Francia Rome and Ireland The th century court of thelstan was a cosmopolitan magnet to scholars from all over the continent And need we mention that the Anglo Saxons were themselves migrants from northern Europe The Faragiste tendency which imagines a British past pure and unsullied by the taint of Europe imagines a past that did not exist

FEB10	Have MPs, finally, come up with a decent Brexit proposal?	It all has the feel of the world s most boring thriller Though there are only just under seven weeks left until Britain s official date of departure from the European Union public life seems drowsy with a lethal brew of fatalism insouciance and burrowing cowardice  On the BBC s Andrew Marr Show this morning James Brokenshire the communities secretary looked less like the minister charged with preparing local government for the social chaos of a no deal outcome than a beaming salesman politely urging a client to renew his contents insurance policy 
FEB10	Why study English? We’re poorer in every sense without it	The lack of science maths and language teachers has been talked about for years But a shortage of English teachers has gone under the radar Although last year s target for new trainees was met in the two previous years it was missed English used to be among the most popular subjects both to teach and to learn Lessons had a reputation for being creative thought provoking and even fun Philip Pullman David Almond and Joanne Harris were all teachers before they became authors But dramatic reductions in the number of A level entries and applications to study English at university suggest that some of the enthusiasm long associated with English has drained away  The figures are most startling at A level where the number of students in England taking English language or literature has fallen since a pattern mirrored in Wales and Northern Ireland but not Scotland While a demographic dip fewer year olds partly explains this the fall in English entries is far bigger than the overall drop in entries English has lost more students than other subjects Undergraduate enrolments on English degrees have also fallen from an all time high of around in to last year although the proportion of English A level students who go on to study it at university has hovered around for a decade 
FEB10	Why didn’t Liam Neeson just stick to the script?	Is it because of Liam Neeson I wonder that John Humphrys has announced he s going to retire from the Today programme Was Neeson s astonishing interview in the Independent what finally made the great Radio inquisitor realise quite how much you can get out of an interviewee if you give them a bit of space to speak  Interviews and interviewing have been in the news a lot Not only was there the extraordinary confession Neeson volunteered in the middle of what was supposed to be a perfectly vacuous press junket and Humphrys s equally unexpected proclamation but also Maureen Lipman writing in the Radio Times had a pop at the modern style of chatshow The sofa is crammed like a chapel pew with English actors telling their juiciest genitalia stories while the host sniggers in a three piece suit was how she described the genre 
FEB10	In revering Trump, the religious right has laid bare its hypocrisy	The annual anachronism known as the National Prayer Breakfast attracted its usual array of clergy military and political leaders in Washington on February Most prominent of all of course was Donald Trump who used the de facto pulpit to call for outlawing abortion among other positions dear to the Religious Right  Yet the presidential comment that most typified all that has gone morally haywire with the supposedly moral majority came when Trump praised the abolition of civil rights You can consider that statement an innocent if embarrassing misreading of the Teleprompter Or you can hear it as a Freudian slip 
FEB10	Ignorance of the Holocaust is different to wilful disbelief	And what has the world learned of all this is the handwritten question by Holocaust survivor Henri Obstfeld which appears beside his image in a book Survivor Introducing his portraits of survivors the photographer Harry Borden writes I grew up on a farm in Devon England My dad Charlie was a resolutely atheist Jew who derived nothing from his background except a fear of antisemitism When I was a boy he once told me that the Nazis would have killed us I was shocked I attended a Church of England primary school sang in the choir and had always considered myself a Christian like my mum  Disquieting also was the size of some responses to the assertion that the scale of the Holocaust is exaggerated

FEB10	Ivanka Trump’s a feminist? Yep – just like her father and her brothers	In a singular achievement for US conceptual art an installation by Jennifer Rubell has prompted three to date of Donald Trump s children to disclose their horror of sexism  The piece in question Ivanka Vacuuming recently opened in Washington DC A video shows a woman in the Trump preferred genre young high heeled blond impassively pushing a vacuum cleaner around a pink carpet on to which visitors are invited to throw crumbs from a generous pile on a pedestal Inspired by a figure whose public persona incorporates an almost comically wide range of feminine identities daughter wife mother sister model working woman blond Ivanka Vacuuming is say the organisers CulturalDC simultaneously a visual celebration of a contemporary icon a portrait of our own relationship to that figure and a questioning of our complicity in her role playing 
FEB10	We rush to condemn fakers such as Dan Mallory but the world has made impostors of us all	What s the difference between something going viral and a storm in a teacup Not an awful lot it often seems to me Last week everyone in publishing and quite a lot of people in the media were talking I mean online although presumably their offices were also ablaze with the subject indignation rising from their desks like smoke about a profile in the New Yorker  In the piece it was revealed that Dan Mallory aka AJ Finn author of the bestselling thriller The Woman at the Window is a fantasist who has told an awful lot of lies a series of grandiose and frequently ghastly deceptions that according to some may have helped his extraordinarily successful career in the book trade Before he was a writer he was a highly paid editor most recently at William Morrow in New York 
FEB10	Long untouchable, web giants now know what it feels like to be hunted	The key question to ask when a shocking tragedy comes to light is this does it signify a scandal or a crisis Scandals happen all the time in societies They generate a lot of heat outrage and public angst But eventually the media caravan moves on and nothing much changes  When in for example the Guardian printed shocking revelations of tabloid phone hacking and particularly the news that reporters had hacked the mobile phone of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler many observers concluded that this indicated a crisis for the British newspaper industry Initially the signs were promising solemn statement by the prime minister ubiquitous shock horror outrage closure of a big newspaper a judicial inquiry all the trappings of a democracy embarking on radical reform But in the end nothing much changed British tabloids are as intrusive and crass as ever And the industry remains self regulated It was just another scandal after all

FEB11	Trump offers socialism for the rich, capitalism for everyone else	 America will never be a socialist country Donald Trump declared in his State of the Union address Someone should alert Trump that America is now a hotbed of socialism But it is socialism for the rich Everyone else is treated to harsh capitalism  In the conservative mind socialism means getting something for doing nothing That pretty much describes the bn saved by the nation s largest banks last year thanks to Trump s tax cuts some of which went into massive bonuses for bank executives On the other hand more than lower level bank employees got a big dose of harsh capitalism They lost their jobs 
FEB11	There’s only one way to head off May’s threat of no-deal chaos	In a strange new twist Theresa May has replied to Labour s suggestions on Brexit in terms so opaque that this newspaper has interpreted them as a rejection of Jeremy Corbyn s terms while the Times believes her to be ready to compromise Like the death throes of a chess game the moves available to her are small and few and it s hard to figure out what decision she has taken  In shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer s lawyerly fashion Labour s terms were laid out fivefold a permanent customs union close alignment with the single market dynamic alignment on workers rights that is for the UK to keep pace with the evolution of rights and protections in Europe continued membership of EU wide agencies and funding programmes and an agreement on security arrangements such that we retain access to shared databases and the European arrest warrant 
FEB11	And the Bafta for most witlessly outdated awards ceremony goes to …	Deja vu is a common complaint during awards season The same faces shuffle down a carpet There are whopping frocks and usually some interpretative dance There are heroes and baddies causes c l bres and sacred cows hot bandwagons and atrocious jokes though rarely quite as dire as those told by Joanna Lumley last night  It s often hard to keep track Is this the year everyone refers to Harvey Weinstein as God or as the devil Has Glenn Close really never won anything or is she always winning everything Is that actor s photo being beamed big because they re triumphed or because they ve died 
FEB11	British ‘lethality’? Gavin Williamson’s brain has gone absent without leave	The defence secretary s brain has gone absent without leave Gavin Williamson said in a speech today that he intends to send his new aircraft carrier the HMS Queen Elizabeth round the world to frighten China He will equip it with a squadron of F fighter jets purchased from America In addition he wants to build two British military bases one in Asia and the other in the Caribbean They are to strengthen our global presence enhance our lethality and increase our mass  Brexit says the defence secretary has brought us to a great moment in our history when we must be ready to deploy hard power against those who flout international law What on earth is Williamson talking about apart from a desire to be Tory leader His budget was last week said to be bn adrift of reality The Queen Elizabeth cannot sail until It has no business whatsoever in the South China Sea where such a vast and unwieldy ship would be a sitting target The Chinese could sink it in an hour As for new military bases in the Caribbean and east of Suez they would cost billions and be an invitation to terrorists The Chinese must be laughing themselves sick 
FEB11	Surely British business can do better than Mike Ashley and Philip Green?	Here s a question Do you really think that two white billionaires with a penchant for excess questionable morals and a slew of scandals to their name are the ideal face of business in a country scrambling to keep the surviving scraps of its international reputation intact I didn t think so And yet here we are  Mike Ashley and Philip Green shared the business headlines over the weekend with stories very different in nature but nonetheless all serving as a reminder for why British businessmen are in desperate need of a dramatic image overhaul Sports Direct headed up by Ashley the mouthy retail entrepreneur who also owns House of Fraser and Newcastle United was last week hailed as a possible buyer of Patisserie Valerie after the cafe chain spectacularly crashed into administration in January putting hundreds of jobs at risk 
FEB11	Britain deports people who grew up here. This racialised system must end	Last week mass deportations resumed in Britain It s less than a year since the Windrush scandal broke and the review into the events leading up to it hasn t even reported back yet This was a stark reminder that the government s compliant environment policies have changed in name only otherwise they remain as hostile as ever and continue to destroy the lives of black and ethnic minority people BME people many of whom have lived in the UK since they were children  Before the deportation flight the home secretary Sajid Javid declared that many of the foreign national offenders on the flight had committed very serious crimes but soon after this the Home Office admitted that most of the deportees had committed minor crimes such as single drug or driving offences More worryingly people on the Jamaican charter flight had come to the UK as children nine of them were under the age of had indefinite leave to remain ILR and one person even had a British passport Not only were most of the people on this flight more British than foreign they were also being punished twice three times if you include immigration detention for crimes they had already served sentences for 
FEB11	The country I walked through deserves better than Brexit	In May a few weeks before the EU referendum I walked miles from Liverpool to London to see what was happening to my country I was travelling in the footsteps of a march against unemployment that my late father had helped to organise In that year Tory policies had devastated industry and sent unemployment skyrocketing In Tory austerity was putting the final nail in the coffin of those broken communities  Even so on my walk I was shocked by the level of poverty by the sheer number of homeless people in doorways and parks and by the high streets of boarded up shops and pubs full of payday loan outlets and bookies People in those former industrial towns spoke of their anger and betrayal of having being forgotten by Westminster politicians of their communities having been destroyed as the manufacturing that had sustained them either folded or moved to low wage economies 
FEB11	The Green New Deal offers radical environmental and economic change	The revival of the Green New Deal framework first developed in a report published in and popularized by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Justice Democrats in the US is a huge advance for green campaigners and hopefully for our threatened species That is because it has a single radical ask an ecological and economic transformation of the current system to end our addiction to fossil fuels and endless consumption of the earth s finite assets  The Green New Deal demands major structural governmental and inter governmental changes not just behavioural change in our approach to the ecosystem In addition and as in the s such change to be driven by radical structural transformation of the finance sector and the economy It was developed on the understanding that finance the economy and the ecosystem are all tightly bound together Protecting and restoring the ecosystem to balance cannot be tackled effectively without transformation of the other sectors Financing the transformation of the economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels cannot be achieved without a transformation of the finance sector 
FEB11	If Sisi’s brutality in Egypt continues, the results could be dire for Europe	The outpouring of joy that followed Hosni Mubarak s resignation was palpable It was February eight years ago to this day Egyptians of all faiths and ages and backgrounds united by a desire for freedom gathered in Tahrir Square to bring years of tyranny to an end We believed that as the people of the region s most historic power inspired by the success of the Tunisian revolution we were setting in motion a chain of events that would guarantee Egypt s freedom  But after months the dream became a nightmare Letting the military manage the transitional period was probably the biggest mistake of all revolutions never give power to pillars of the old regime Perhaps later on we were complacent our first free presidential election and the subsequent referendum on a new constitution gave us confidence that the changes taking place could not be stopped or undone But the solidarity that defined the protests in Tahrir Square was disintegrating and neither the government of Mohamed Morsi nor any of the other political powers could resolve the differences or abate the fears of the old regime the political parties the army and the people in the street that had started to infuse public life

FEB12	Deal or no deal, both Labour and the Tories will split over Brexit	A casual observer seeing Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn exchange rhetorical blows over Brexit in the Commons today might imagine that they stand on opposite sides of this totemic issue But veterans of the debate know they are equal in determination that Britain should leave the EU They are separated from consensus by small technical matters that can for theatrical effect be inflated into irreconcilable differences That process is testimony to the hold that the two party system exerts over English politics and to much of what is wrong with it  Brexit keeps promising to break party lines and then failing to do so That is partly because pro Europeanism and the British left stand on overlapping cultural ground The remain proposition goes well beyond attachment to EU membership it is driven by revulsion at the nativist spirit of Brexit s marauding generals Nigel Farage Boris Johnson Jacob Rees Mogg and shock that they have hijacked Britain s political identity But that dismay is not exclusive to Labour It is felt by liberal Tories and swing voters who just pine for competent rational government 
FEB12	Polar bears in the playground, Insectageddon … and it’s all our fault	Children s books are filled with fantastic friendships between humans and beasts From a young age we learn that if a tiger comes for tea we should expect it to eat all our sandwiches and if a Peruvian bear drops in for lunch we had better have some marmalade in the cupboard  In this fantasy world we can coexist peacefully with large mammals Meanwhile in real life young people are having fewer wild interactions than ever before In part this is a result of increased screen time and decreased access to wild spaces Perhaps it doesn t help that many countries drove out their most exciting inhabitants lynx bears and wolves centuries ago 
FEB12	The EU looks like the Soviet Union in 1991 – on the verge of collapse	Europe is sleepwalking into oblivion and its people need to wake up before it is too late If they don t the European Union will go the way of the Soviet Union in Neither our leaders nor ordinary citizens seem to understand that we are experiencing a revolutionary moment that the range of possibilities is very broad and that the eventual outcome is thus highly uncertain  Most of us assume the future will more or less resemble the present but this is not necessarily so In a long and eventful life I have witnessed many periods of what I call radical disequilibrium We are living in such a period today 
FEB12	Why it matters to call external female genitalia ‘vulva’ not ‘vagina’	When you find yourself mansplaining the term mansplaining to a worked up faction of Twitter on a Sunday evening you can assume you re not getting the best out of your leisure time And that s not even the most foolish thing a man called Paul Bullen did over the weekend  On Saturday the Guardian published an extract from an upcoming book Womanhood The Bare Reality by the photographer and writer Laura Dodsworth Alongside photographs of external genitalia was first person testimony from the subjects pictured Titled Me and my vulva women reveal all it was an arresting story Bullen spotted the article on Sunday and responded with a tweet that he probably well hopefully now regrets The correct word is vagina 
FEB12	Humanity faces an existential crisis – Labour must join the fightback	Here s the bad news We are quite in a lot of trouble A new study by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that a series of crises from global warming to soil infertility are set to hit us at the same time The consequences could include massive destabilisation not just in individual countries but on a global level From the damage inflicted on human health to a possible economic meltdown caused by mass insurance claims if the US is ravaged by floods and forest fires we are not remotely prepared  Consider just one scenario According to Laurie Laybourn Langton the lead author of the report climate crisis could lead to times more refugees from the Middle East than the million who fled during the past few years of upheaval and turmoil The far right skilfully manipulated and inflamed backlash over this last refugee crisis that s partly why Donald Trump is now president of the US why the far right are in coalition governments in Italy and Austria and why Viktor Orb n s Hungarian regime has been able to consolidate its authoritarian rule What will happen when refugees come in far greater numbers A twisted irony beckons that extremists in the Trump administration aptly labelled climate change arsonists by writer Naomi Klein will make mass forced migration more likely because of their environment wrecking policies and then reap perverse political benefits by whipping up hatred against the resulting tide of human misery 
FEB12	The #ligueduLOL cyberbullying case is the French media’s day of reckoning	The French media world has been in the grip of a deep crisis for the past few days The people at the heart of the scandal say it started as a joke and stemmed from a desire to share some black humour If that is the case the ligueduLOL controversy has turned out to be something much darker and has exposed the everyday abuse that women and minorities face on social media  The Ligue du LOL is the name of a closed Facebook group in which about young and successful journalists media professionals and early day Twitter influencers allegedly coordinated cyberbullying trolling and Twitter campaigns against other social media users mostly women as well as feminist and LGBT activists between and Some of them continued their activities for years after the group was closed 
FEB12	Free money wouldn’t make people lazy – but it could revolutionise work	The danger of so called free money not only underpins critiques of universal basic income UBI but also the incredibly strong narratives that underlie the attitudes to work in the UK and elsewhere and our unemployment benefit system Paid employment is held up as one of the ultimate markers of being a valuable member of society with those not in paid work always described in these narratives as a voluntary position rather than as the result of issues outside their control seen as a drain on society Those out of work are positioned in direct contrast to those in paid employment the shirkers versus the strivers the welfare dependent versus the hardworking families  For those in paid work working hard and being constantly busy are worn as a badge of pride and there are whole industries promising to make us more productive and efficient For some hard work is enforced through workplace monitoring impossibly short breaks or expectations of staff being always on for example responding to emails outside work hours Work is idealised as providing meaning in our lives while at the same time removing us from other sources of meaning such as family friends and our communities through long hours and unpaid overtime The negative psychological social and physical effects of these narratives and assumptions are now being investigated and the centrality of work in our lives and society questioned 
FEB12	Northern Ireland’s young people know their history. If only the rest of Britain did too	Touts are a three piece rock band from Derry The name is a reference to the Northern Irish colloquialism for a police informer which is scrawled and sprayed around their home city the music they make is full of a sense of Derry s violent past and its uneasy present It harks back to the distant days of punk rock but its sheer velocity also speaks of an urge to get on with the future whatever that might be The band are part of a lineage of music interwoven with Northern Ireland s difficult politics and history as the Belfast based music writer Stuart Bailie s brilliant book Trouble Songs puts it raw art that has challenged given stories and provided succour and a sense of collective worth  All three Touts members were born at a time when the Troubles were receding into history two of them were too young to vote in the EU referendum Last week I watched them rehearse in a freezing room on an edge of town industrial estate They talked about Northern Ireland s political predicament with the kind of incisive eloquence that most English musicians seem to have lost Politics is just inescapable coming from here said year old bassist and co vocalist Luke McLaughlin If you have a platform you may as well say something 
FEB12	Spain’s trial of Catalan separatists is an alarming act of state repression	The most important political trial in Catalonia s recent history is about to begin in Madrid The trial is against members of the former government of Catalonia the speaker of the Catalan parliament at that time and the leaders of Catalonia s two largest pro independence civil society groups  These individuals will be prosecuted for having organised Catalonia s referendum on self determination on October The charges brought by the public prosecutor s office and by the far right Vox party representing the private accusation are among the most serious of those envisaged by the Spanish criminal code rebellion misappropriation of public funds and civil disobedience 
FEB12	The NHS lives by co-operation. The privatisers are still trying to wreck it	Some bad ideas are very hard to kill The NHS in England is finally trying to strangle the notion that competition between hospitals is like competition between supermarkets an anti cartel spur to quality and low prices But zombie like the competition mania keeps being resurrected by those who think nothing works without red in tooth and claw markets This ideological fight has battered the NHS for decades  The latest NHS England year plan is all about urging everyone into closer collaboration between community GPs and hospitals and at a stretch social care too without pointless duplication or destructive competition for staff and resources With lengthening waiting lists where s the spare capacity to compete for patients If that sounds like blindingly obvious common sense it isn t to privatisers and marketisers 
FEB13	Carney is right. Brexit could lead to a better, fairer kind of globalisation	It all seemed so simple back in the s Barriers were coming down the free market was advancing to all corners of the world and in return for production being shifted to low cost countries consumers in the west were getting cheaper clothes and gizmos Globalisation was said to be unstoppable The end of history was nigh  The financial crisis and its aftermath have changed the political weather with a decade of low growth unevenly distributed pain and business as usual prompting a backlash Voters in the west have started to focus on globalisation s dark side the multinational companies that avoid paying tax the towns hollowed out by de industrialisation the loss of democratic control over market forces the uneasy sense that the entire edifice is poised precariously on a mountain of debt 
FEB13	Let’s give citizens free cash to save not-for-profit journalism	A flourishing diverse media is essential to a functioning democracy We have neither An already broken model faces an existential crisis Back in the media mogul Lord Beaverbrook told a royal commission on the press that he ran the Daily Express purely for the purpose of making propaganda and with no other object I look at it as a purely propagandist project Today most of the British press remains the plaything of media moguls who profit from a broken status quo  Ideas such as public ownership are popular with the public a poll by one rightwing thinktank found that back nationalisation of the water industry as do more than three quarters with regard to electricity gas and the railways The vast majority of people back higher taxes on the rich Yet these are fringe ideas within most of the mainstream media which marginalises those who support them 
FEB13	For Theresa, bad jam is better than no jam – that's just common sense	Yesterday in Brexit news stockpiling bodybags Today scraping the mould off jam Because this is where we are now Never mind the special place in hell Donald Tusk hopes is reserved for key Brexiters we are already there Truly daily the flames are licking  There was a time when waking up in the morning and seeing the headline Theresa May I scrape the mould off the top of jam and eat what s underneath would be surprising it s the kind of thing someone randomly and without context would come out with in group therapy to an awkward silence But no longer There was a time when an MP moaning that there was a lack of positivity around Brexit news which was prompted by the aforementioned news of stockpiled bodybags would have struck me as odd But no longer The MP was Kate Hoey by the way to absolutely no one s surprise 
FEB13	Football is addicted to gambling – and it’s harming children	It s a fair bet that the new rules announced today aimed at preventing the gambling industry from targeting children will be welcomed by almost everyone Who could be against a ban on betting ads popping up on sites computer games or apps popular with kids such as the promos that were once embedded in the I m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here or Mario Kart apps Given the extraordinary stats that show no fewer than children aged to gamble each week with of those classed as problem gamblers surely any move to keep young eyes away from temptation is to be applauded  But you only have to set out the planned steps to see why they don t go far enough The new rules from the Committee of Advertising Practice insist for example that gambling companies stop featuring celebrities or others who look under in their ads Sounds good until you reflect that the betting companies could simply find a footballer who s or older to do the job instead John Stones say could be subbed off to be replaced by I don t know the new a week man Aaron Ramsey 
FEB13	Dark money is pushing for a no-deal Brexit. Who is behind it?	Modern governments respond to only two varieties of emergency those whose solution is bombs and bullets and those whose solution is bailouts for the banks But what if they decided to take other threats as seriously  This week s revelations of a catastrophic collapse in insect populations jeopardising all terrestrial life would prompt the equivalent of an emergency meeting of the UN security council The escalating disasters of climate breakdown and soil loss would trigger spending at least as great as the quantitative easing after the financial crisis Instead politicians carry on as if nothing is amiss 
FEB13	The self-driving car is a marvel doomed by unpredictable humans	A few years ago I wrote a Guardian article about jetpacks  A mode of transport that seemingly everyone wants and has been expecting and angrily demanding of us scientists for a good while but which is still essentially nowhere in sight I did my best to write about why jetpacks are not likely to be a household item any time soon 
FEB13	Forty years for a mosque killer, when murderers of white victims get 75?	Two years ago Alexandre Bissonnette walked into a Quebec City mosque and opened fire on men at prayer killing six injuring and ensuring that children would grow up without their fathers Known to Quebec feminist and refugee support groups as an internet troll Bissonnette s search history suggested he had been influenced by racist misogynistic shooters such as Dylann Roof Elliot Rodger and Marc L pine After the attack Bissonnette told a social worker he regretted not having killed more people  In court he pleaded guilty and expressed remorse Last Friday in an unusual judgment Bissonnette was sentenced to life in prison with years before he is eligible for parole 
FEB13	Take that, Salvini! How musical justice was served in Sanremo	Italy s Sanremo Music Festival the model for everything from Eurovision to The X Factor is one of the oldest and most prestigious of its kind On Saturday evening year old Alessandro Mahmoud who goes by the stage name Mahmood won the th edition of the festival with his song Soldi Money But this was no ordinary win This win was about much more than music it was political and important  Mahmood was born in Milan to an Italian mother and an Egyptian father His winning song contains Arabic and references Ramadan He has criticised discrimination against gay men in Italy and Egypt The singer embodies much of what Matteo Salvini and other far right figures in Italy would love to erase from their notion of traditional Italian identity the white Christian heterosexual northern model from which Salvini s party the League first took its name 
FEB13	Nationalist strongmen are bent on controlling women’s bodies	When Brazil where I am writing from this week became worried that almost two thirds of its population was black or mixed race radical steps were taken Never mind that the blackness of its population was thanks to its own dependence on African slavery in the first part of the th century Brazil actively recruited European migrants with the explicit aim of whitening itself or keeping in the words of a presidential decree of the most convenient features of its European ancestry  The resulting class and race inequalities in the South American country are part of a complex mix that has resulted in Brazil s own variation on the populist theme Now under the Trump of the tropics as Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro is sometimes described reproductive fascism is back and focused so far on controlling women s bodies 
FEB13	Voter ID trials are dangerous. That’s why I’m taking the government to court	On Wednesday I received a date to attend the high court to fight against the government s dangerous voter ID plans  This case is particularly significant for everyone who lives in my community because next May for the first time ever we will be asked to show identification in order to cast our vote at the local government election Braintree district council my local authority in Essex is one of boroughs across England taking part in the government s pilot scheme before it plans to roll out voter ID at the next general election 
FEB14	History will not forgive May’s reckless push to the no-deal precipice	Just another Brexit day of dither delay and dawdling Just another humiliating defeat for Theresa May at the hands of the party within her party that she dare not confront Clever Anna Soubry won a significant victory the Conservative MP forced the government to agree to publish its no deal advice we shall now know what the cabinet knows We shall see the full horror of the damage a no deal Brexit would do to business and trade Those who brought us to this pitch should remember that a day of judgment will come Someday a judicial inquiry will expose the reckless Brexit chaos into which the Conservative party cast this country Inquiries go on for years but in the end a mighty Domesday tome will record what was done by whom and why If anyone in Labour aided and abetted Brexit they too will be recorded in the annals  The civil service knows observers note the scrupulous care with which officials insist ministers personally sign every decision delay or absurdity they are ordered to carry out They know someday the recording angels will write down the names of everyone to blame 
FEB14	Shamima Begum is just a teenager. Britain should be strong enough to take her back	Shamima Begum who achieved notoriety in as one of three young schoolgirls from Bethnal Green who left the country to join Islamic State has re emerged in a refugee camp controlled by the Syrian Defence Forces in north eastern Syria Understandably given her situation she is about to give birth and has already lost two children she would like to get home But where is home and what does home mean  By her account as reported in The Times she enjoyed living under Isis control even as it beheaded its enemies and left their remains for all to see She was married to a Dutch member of the group who was presumably fighting for the cause and she was ready to bear children who could follow in his footsteps to the frontline She appeared therefore not only to have abandoned her family but also to have firmly rejected the broader society in which she grew up 
FEB14	The Churchill row is part of the glib approach to history that gave us Brexit	Churchill hero or villain Prince Charles goodie or baddie Jesus Christ yes or no John McDonnell modern Herodotus or fool Tick the boxes and pass the GCSE Welcome to the new history McDonnell the shadow chancellor is entitled to dislike Winston Churchill but why for Tonypandy Churchill happened to be Liberal home secretary in and was asked to authorise a small company of soldiers to help local police during the Rhondda disturbances He did so with reluctance and later professed sympathy for the miners The one man who later died was hit on the head by a Glamorganshire policeman The soldiers were not involved  What is this really about The answer is yah boo history binary storytelling charged with fake emotion sucked dry of fact or balance It is history as partisan docudrama Why did McDonnell not mention Churchill s role in the death of hundreds of thousands of innocent Germans Does he not care about dead Germans Is he for bombing civilians 
FEB14	From Tahrir to Trump: nationalism has hijacked the hope of the people	Thousands of people in Tahrir Square chanted the slogan Bread Dignity Freedom It was and the height of the Arab spring Standing on my own in the crowd I recalled a middle aged worker I d met in Buenos Aires a decade earlier telling me why he and his colleagues had taken over a factory during Argentina s economic collapse He rattled off reasons such as hunger poverty and inequality But then his voice changed And the boss he said Well he never said good morning to us and you know that destroys your dignity  Defending one s dignity sometimes tastes sweeter than the bread yes even when you re hungry
FEB14	Who’s the biggest failure in the Brexit cabinet: Chris Grayling – or Liam Fox?	How badly do you have to mess up these days before you re not allowed in Theresa May s cabinet Just how far does tolerance stretch You might imagine Chris Grayling to be the ultimate prototype in this real world experiment with his granting then cancelling of a m ferry contract to a ferry company with no ferries but let us also observe the progress of Liam Fox  Fox is one of the most vocal and optimistic Brexiteers in politics In he declared that a trade deal with the EU would be one of the easiest in human history In he promised to replicate the EU free trade agreements that exist before we leave the European Union so we ve got no disruption of trade and they would be ready one second after midnight in March 
FEB14	Shamima Begum was groomed. She deserves the chance of rehabilitation	It s impossible not to feel a jolt of shock when confronted with the photo of Shamima Begum on the front page of this morning s Times Four years ago when we last saw her it was accepted that Begum had been brainwashed There was consensus that she was an innocent child who d been groomed online Begum was allowed to be the victim in the nation s narrative one that over decades had grasped the power and dangers of grooming because that demanded nothing from us She was the little girl who d been caught up in a dangerous death cult the pixelated image of a kid caught on CCTV about to fly and that was sad  It was also made easier by her absence We only needed to empathise with Begum s situation in the abstract Of course we wanted her to be rescued and returned to Britain immediately But that was just a fantasy I can t have been alone in assuming these girls would simply meet a horrible fate in the fighting abroad Having been found alive and nine months pregnant in a Syrian refugee camp Begum is no longer an abstract concept Instinctively it feels a little harder to say we should bring her back to her home in the United Kingdom especially given her apparent lack of remorse And yet is she not still a victim of grooming Still a British citizen we should be looking to help 
FEB14	The secret to happiness? Health, housing and job security	For some time sensible people have been arguing that governments need to focus less on economic growth and more on the wellbeing of citizens Be careful what you wish for  In response to this demand from David Cameron instructed the Office for National Statistics to gather data on people s self reported happiness and life satisfaction Little practical good has come from this so far but a new report by George Bangham for the Resolution Foundation is one of the best attempts to make useful sense of the data He concludes The best prospects for policymakers targeting future increases in national wellbeing lie in raising job quality raising incomes particularly at the lower end and policies to improve security in the housing market 
FEB14	Chimpanzees ‘talk’ just like humans. It’s time to realise how similar we are	It s a bit garbled but you can definitely hear it in the mobile phone footage As the chimpanzees arrange their branches into a makeshift ladder and one of them makes its daring escape from its Belfast zoo enclosure some words ring out loud and clear Don t escape you bad little gorilla a child onlooker shouts from the crowd And POP with that a tiny explosion goes off inside my head Something knocks me back about this sentence It s a kids say the funniest things kind of sentence and in any other situation I d offer a warm smile and a chuckle of approval But not this time This statement has brought out the pedant in me  At this point you may wonder if I m capable of fleshing out a word article chastising a toddler for mistakenly referring to a chimpanzee as a gorilla The good news is that though I am more than capable of such a callous feat I don t intend to write about this child s naive zoological error In fact this piece isn t really about the gorgeous I m sure child It s about us You and me and the words we use 
FEB14	Ignore the free-trade evangelists. Brexit can create a fairer economy	It all seemed so simple back in the s Barriers were coming down the free market was advancing to all corners of the world and in return for production being shifted to low cost countries consumers in the west were getting cheaper clothes and gizmos Globalisation was said to be unstoppable The end of history was nigh  The financial crisis and its aftermath have changed the political weather with a decade of low growth unevenly distributed pain and business as usual prompting a backlash Voters in the west have started to focus on globalisation s dark side the multinational companies that avoid paying tax the towns hollowed out by de industrialisation the loss of democratic control over market forces the uneasy sense that the entire edifice is poised precariously on a mountain of debt 
FEB14	Confused? Here’s my guide to Valentine’s Day in the #MeToo era	I ve always liked Valentine s Day and believe men who dismiss it as commercialised nonsense are joyless tightwads My enthusiasm dates back to primary school My teacher made us cut scraps of shiny red paper into heart shapes glue them to flimsy cards and write messages inside to our mums although I remember wanting to give my card to a girl named Demelza  Ernest Hemingway said he had to be in love to be able to write When I was a teenager in the s I had to be in love to go to school My love was usually unrequited so Valentine s Day offered an annual shot at redemption In year I loved Tammy so I wrote a haiku inside a Valentine s card and placed it on her desk along with a Terry s Chocolate Orange Thanks said Tammy I said I loved her You don t know what love is she said and went to maths 
FEB15	The school climate change strikes are inspiring – but they should shame us	Such is the upside down topsy turvy state of our world that the children are now the adults and the adults are the children In Westminster our supposed leaders men and women of mature vintage keep stamping their feet and demanding what no one can give them  They insist they should be allowed to gobble up all the birthday cake and still have cake left to eat threatening to storm out of the European Union and slam the door behind them As Dominic Grieve the former attorney general rightly puts it Threatening to leave is the behaviour of a three year old who says that they are going to hold their breath if they do not get the toy that they want 
FEB15	Our destiny is in the hands of Rees-Mogg’s unfinished robot sidekick	Where are you on Steve Baker on a scale of one to so completely over him The deputy chair of the European Research Group took to the airwaves today to warn mildly that parliament passing Theresa May s withdrawal agreement would collapse the government Furthermore Baker complained I really do rather object to being called hardline  Oh dear Given the need to find alternative arrangements for describing Steve Baker let s look at technological solutions It s as if someone had half an idea to build a fun geeky robot sidekick for Jacob Rees Mogg then became so bored or repulsed by the task that they gave up before they d fitted him with a cool metallic exoskeleton Somehow the unfinished unit picked itself off the workshop floor and found its way to parliament By rights Steve Baker is just the innards of something that had it been completed you might find in the background of a Mos Espa docking bay scene in The Phantom Menace Instead he s one of the fanatics holding our national destiny in his partially assembled hands The more versatile politicians of this golden age have two expressions Steve Baker has one Steve Baker s sole expression is cocking his head slightly to the side as if to say I m listening politely and reasonably when what he is actually saying is Let s just fucking burn it all down and see what happens 
FEB15	My generation trashed the planet. So I salute the children striking back	The Youth Strike Climate gives me more hope than I have felt in years of campaigning Before this week I believed it was all over I thought given the indifference and hostility of those who govern us and the passivity of most of my generation that climate breakdown and ecological collapse were inevitable Now for the first time in years I think we can turn them around  My generation and the generations that went before have failed you We failed to grasp the basic premise of intergenerational justice that you cannot apply discount rates to human life In other words the life of someone who has not been born will be of no less value than the life of someone who already exists We have lived as if your lives had no importance as if any resource we encountered was ours and ours alone to use as we wished regardless of the impact on future generations In doing so we created a cannibal economy we ate your future to satisfy our greed 
FEB15	AI can write just like me. Brace for the robot apocalypse	Elon Musk recently busying himself with calling people pedo on Twitter and potentially violating US securities law with what was perhaps just a joke about weed both perfectly normal activities is now involved in a move to terrify us all The non profit he backs OpenAI has developed an AI system so good it had me quaking in my trainers when it was fed an article of mine and wrote an extension of it that was a perfect act of journalistic ventriloquism  As my colleague Alex Hern wrote yesterday The system GPT is pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible both in terms of the quality of the output and the wide variety of potential uses GPT is so efficient that the full research is not being released publicly yet because of the risk of misuse 
FEB15	I swallowed the Brexit lies. Now I regret telling curry house workers to vote leave	One of the many myths and mysteries of the referendum campaign is that people from the south east Asian community backed a leave campaign that was so often linked to bigotry  The truth is they didn t A majority of voters of south east Asian heritage supported remain but more of us voted for Brexit than anyone expected Not only was I one of them I also bear some responsibility as the head of an organisation that urged our members and restaurants to vote leave 
FEB15	Call the Midwife takes women’s side over abortion. But the BBC is failing us	Call the Midwife is a wonderfully successful programme a slice of dramatised social history that centres on women s experience It tackles many difficult issues recently we saw a young woman find out that she was intersex and the introduction of the cervical smear It manages to be warm and moving while reflecting the quiet bravery of so many women A triumph It is if you like always on our side  I never thought of it this way before even though I know the BBC as an institution is not always great for women It does not promote women into its senior management roles it does not pay women equally and it is happy to crank out routine misogyny on many of its flagship shows such as Today in the guise of banter 
FEB15	Measles is on the rise. But telling anti-vaxxers they’re stupid won’t fix it	After reading the news that cases of measles have soared by in the last year I recalled the first time I heard an anti vaccination conspiracy theory It wasn t from a member of Donald Trump s administration or part of a frenetic grammatically challenged Facebook post it was from a classmate when I was at school Her family wasn t waging a crusade against medical science they simply gave credence to disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield s study that wrongly asserted a link between the MMR vaccine and autism Back then the study had not yet been discredited  One only has to stray into anti vaxxer internet forums for a few minutes to see that they re stuffed with conspiracy theorists opportunists reactionaries and worst of all hubristic idiots This is the vanguard of the anti vaxxer movement But behind that vanguard are a lot of concerned parents who are being convinced of wild and dangerous ideas because we and by we I mean those of us who recognise the incontrovertible fact that vaccines are essential aren t talking to them properly A number of the anti vaxxer vanguard may have started life as concerned parents but have gradually sunk into increasingly extreme positions because the only communication they re getting from the other side is that they re foolish and irresponsible Almost every week the internet produces another diatribe against anti vaxxers or a listicle of their horrifyingly stupid social media posts 
FEB15	Attacks on the media show Duterte’s Philippines is heading for despotism	 I will do the right thing Maria Ressa CEO of the Philippines news site Rappler told reporters as she was led away by police officers having been served a warrant for her arrest in her own newsroom Agents from the Philippines National Bureau of Investigations arrested Ressa concerning a continuing and much inflated digital libel case this Wednesday in Manila She was freed a day later having paid a bond of Philippine pesos This is now the sixth time the veteran journalist has been obliged to post bail  In what has been a damaging but depressingly predictable blow to press freedom in the Philippines it s yet another warning sign that President Rodrigo Duterte is accelerating towards an all out authoritarian state 
FEB15	The arts were supposed to champion diversity. What went wrong?	In February the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence made recommendations for eradicating institutional racism within the police Although the arts culture and media sectors were not a target of the report we can similarly trace the uptake of what would later become known as cultural diversity within these institutions particularly at a time when the political context was invested at least rhetorically in eradicating racial prejudice  This week years on from the report Arts Council England published its annual report on diversity within the arts sector showing that in some areas arts organisations are treading water 
FEB16	Brexit extremism is going nowhere. Now the moderate millions must act	For three years the worst of Britain has been in charge The Britain that says it is elitist to tell the electorate it can t have the impossible The Britain that has patted itself on the back for threatening the rule of law and the independence of MPs The Britain where it is normal for supporters of Jeremy Corbyn to call the BBC s political editor a bitch and a whore and demand her dismissal for crimes against the party line and for supporters of Nigel Farage to send death threats to MPs The Britain with no middle only extremes  Millions have been airbrushed from the national story Conservatives who voted to remain Europeans who have made Britain their home for so long they are British in everything except their paperwork British citizens living in the EU and everyone in the UK who wants to live in the EU but whose rights are being taken away in a vast state power grab 
FEB16	Andrea Levy gave a voice to all my silenced forebears	Andrea Levy wrote to understand where she came from I read her to understand where we come from I was when Small Island was published in and had just started working at the London Review Bookshop The voice of the protagonist Hortense a Jamaican woman who worked hard and expected more from everyone reminded me of my maternal grandma and her nursing friends all of whom I respectfully called aunty It was the first time I had read a depiction of people like my relations in the pages of a novel I had already encountered another Jamaican Hortense in literary fiction in Zadie Smith s triumphant debut White Teeth However it is Levy s Hortense who is devoted to Britain the Mother Country who truly brought me a deeper understanding of home  How often it seems the Windrush generation is often more British than the British their upbringing was strict under traditional British colonialism They honoured and adored the Queen as their head of state their language is formal and accented RP and their manners correct they are so serious that you cannot help but smile 
FEB16	Tormenting Meghan Markle has become a national sport that shames us	In the period when the acquisition of the former Meghan Markle was depicted as little short of a national triumph much was written in the British press about her various accomplishments These are after all roughly as common in royal spouses as successful independent careers Meghan the actress and blogger and charity worker is also it emerged a skilled calligrapher   I ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well she once told an Esquire journalist who d described her writing as incredible What it evolved into was my pseudo waitressing job when I was auditioning 
FEB16	Nan Goldin on art, opioids and the need for positive action	Netflix recently sent up the art world in its feature film Velvet Buzzsaw It s a strange hybrid of spoof and horror but an early section in which ludicrous money is thrown around and gross consumption and cut throat competition are par for the course is the most successful A later gag in which a gallerist mistakes a pile of bin bags for a new work is surely the dad joke of satire It descends into a mess of blood and gore when the paintings of a freshly discovered outsider artist become sentient and take their revenge on the people who profited from them  The artist Nan Goldin famous for her intimate photographs of a certain kind of New York life is continuing her admirable fight to highlight the more gruesome aspects of the real art world After a call to arms on Instagram Goldin and her activist collective Pain Prescription Addiction Intervention Now staged a die in at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan scattering fake prescriptions chanting and unfurling signs The statistics laid bare by the red and black banners were stark dead dead each day Shame on Sackler read one Take down their name read another

FEB16	Tate Modern’s neighbours missed the point: cities make voyeurs of us all	When you live in the city the world is full of nosy parkers I should know because I am one I remember my early forays up to London from the West Country on the National Express coach coming in via the Westway as the sun was setting  As the sky turned indigo lights would flicker on in the flats that overlooked the dual carriageway giving me a direct view into the lives of strangers I would glimpse them standing at stoves slumped on sofas or sitting on the phone clutching a fag and a bottle of beer These domestic scenes were for the teenage me fleeting urban postcards idyllic snapshots of what my own life could be 
FEB16	The trip from London to Lincolnshire showed me the Brexit divide’s depth	What was it the Queen said As we look for new answers in the modern age I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view coming together to seek out the common ground and never losing sight of the bigger picture She spoke those words last month at the centenary of the Sandringham Women s Institute humble occasions are no enemies of wisdom and they are understood to refer to the social and political division caused by the Brexit vote I remembered the gist of them last weekend as our train trundled towards Boston in Lincolnshire a town on the other side of the Wash from the monarch s Norfolk estate  The division between migrants and natives long predated Brexit and the vote was a consequence rather than a cause of it

But council tax is broken	 The most boring and complicated subject in all of public life declared William Waldegrave former minister and an architect of the fateful poll tax when speaking of local government finance But this is misleading the consequences of local government austerity are anything but boring for those on the lowest incomes The design of the council tax system and recent reforms to it hits the poorest hardest Here s why  Since the central government grant to local government has been cut by almost This has had a devastating impact on local public services with spending falling in real terms by nearly one fifth excluding education and public health since the start of the decade So it s little surprise that council taxpayers in England face substantial increases in their bills with nearly all councils set to increase them this April 
FEB17	Theresa May would rather risk an election than lose a referendum	Fifty years ago in an address to the nation the US president Richard Nixon immortalised the phrase silent majority In the febrile context of he was referring to the millions of law abiding Americans who were not involved with or sympathetic to s counter culture the protests against the Vietnam war and angry campus campaigning  Does the idea still have meaning Social media smartphones and the resulting digital cacophony have pretty much seen off the possibility of silent anything But noise is not the same as democracy 
FEB17	Mrs May and Mr Corbyn are complicit in Britain’s drift towards disaster	High noon Mexican standoff Last chance saloon There s been no end of opportunities to deploy metaphors drawn from the Wild West to describe Brexit This is kind of appropriate since the benighted enterprise was triggered by a bunch of cowboys and peddled by snake oil salesmen  In another way talk of shootouts and showdowns is a bad journalistic habit of which I ve been occasionally guilty myself Describing Brexit in these dramatic terms suggests we are about to reach some kind of resolution and the end credits can finally roll Yet we never do Every exchange of gunfire at the Not O K Corral is followed by the grim realisation that the plot has not been advanced at all We are still stuck where we have been marooned for months without a deal that parliament will pass and without a proved majority for any alternative In Brexitland it is always crisis and never catharsis 
FEB17	Italy needs a hero, and in this 16th-century martyr it can find one	Every year on February a crowd gathers in Rome s Campo de Fiori to lay wreaths poems and candles at the foot of the statue that glowers towards the Vatican from beneath its friar s cowl The man it memorialises the Neapolitan philosopher Giordano Bruno was burned alive by the Inquisition on that spot in for heresies including several books in which he advocated the heliocentric cosmology of Copernicus and argued that the universe was infinite and contained multiple other worlds  The charges were similar to those brought against Galileo years later unlike Galileo who recanted Bruno s defiance has lent an air of heroism to his execution A witness at his trial reported that when the death sentence was pronounced Bruno replied You may be more afraid to bring that sentence against me than I am to accept it 
FEB17	Without territory or new recruits, Islamic State is in its death throes	The last fighters are holding out just The leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi is still alive but hiding somewhere in the desert We have already had one final defeat of Islamic State This came months ago when the organisation s capital Raqqa fell Once it held territory the size of the UK now it holds a square kilometre of the remote town of Baghouz in eastern Syria Soon it will no longer hold even that  There is a strong argument for caution before anyone talks of mission accomplished Many of the circumstances that favoured the rise of the organisation remain In Iraq these include the weakness of the state and security forces the dominance of the Shia majority and the shortsightedness of its leaders as well as the alienation and marginalisation of the Iraqi Sunni minority long the extremists core constituency Deeply rooted criminal networks don t help nor does the legacy of radicalisation and brutalisation of decades of violence Syria remains an anarchic battleground of factions militia and forces where powers great and small near and far still seek advantage So it should be no surprise that recent attacks in Iraq suggest that a new Isis led insurgent campaign is well under way 
FEB17	Metro’s success is good news for life beyond the web	I am sitting in a newspaper conference listening to the news editor reciting her list of goodies for tomorrow s issue new Brexit controversy latest Trump shenanigans ongoing Venezuelan dramas a hunt for a missing girl a warning of mph gales  The editor and his team react appropriately a concerned comment here a murmur of sympathy there and the occasional joke especially in reaction to the day s really surprising story The pope has revealed that priests used an order of French nuns as sex slaves 
FEB17	An absurd vanity project for our age – Boris Johnson’s garden bridge	We are invited to embark on an adventure It will be an emblem of the enterprise of a proud people Its cost will be zero or not much or a sum that if quite large will absolutely be worth it Naysayers are pooh poohed Practical objections are for losers A deadline is imposed meaning we have to rush ahead with it at all costs And driving it all forward are the quipping gurning dissembling features of Boris Johnson  For Brexit read the garden bridge an earlier vanity project promoted by the former mayor of London and foreign secretary For it was Johnson who picked up the charming sounding idea conceived by Joanna Lumley of building a flower filled crossing from London s South Bank to the Temple For whatever selfless or selfish reasons you decide he chose to throw his mayoral power behind it steamroller objection and commit public money to an architectural unicorn 
FEB17	Tormenting Meghan Markle has become a national sport that shames us	In the period when the acquisition of the former Meghan Markle was depicted as little short of a national triumph much was written in the British press about her various accomplishments These are after all roughly as common in royal spouses as successful independent careers Meghan the actress and blogger and charity worker is also it emerged a skilled calligrapher   I ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well she once told an Esquire journalist who d described her writing as incredible What it evolved into was my pseudo waitressing job when I was auditioning 
FEB17	Brexit extremism is going nowhere. Now the moderate millions must act	For three years the worst of Britain has been in charge The Britain that says it is elitist to tell the electorate it can t have the impossible The Britain that has patted itself on the back for threatening the rule of law and the independence of MPs The Britain where it is normal for supporters of Jeremy Corbyn to call the BBC s political editor a bitch and a whore and demand her dismissal for crimes against the party line and for supporters of Nigel Farage to send death threats to MPs The Britain with no middle only extremes  Millions have been airbrushed from the national story Conservatives who voted to remain Europeans who have made Britain their home for so long they are British in everything except their paperwork British citizens living in the EU and everyone in the UK who wants to live in the EU but whose rights are being taken away in a vast state power grab 
FEB17	Andrea Levy gave a voice to all my silenced forebears	Andrea Levy wrote to understand where she came from I read her to understand where we come from I was when Small Island was published in and had just started working at the London Review Bookshop The voice of the protagonist Hortense a Jamaican woman who worked hard and expected more from everyone reminded me of my maternal grandma and her nursing friends all of whom I respectfully called aunty It was the first time I had read a depiction of people like my relations in the pages of a novel I had already encountered another Jamaican Hortense in literary fiction in Zadie Smith s triumphant debut White Teeth However it is Levy s Hortense who is devoted to Britain the Mother Country who truly brought me a deeper understanding of home  How often it seems the Windrush generation is often more British than the British their upbringing was strict under traditional British colonialism They honoured and adored the Queen as their head of state their language is formal and accented RP and their manners correct they are so serious that you cannot help but smile 
FEB17	The possibility of redemption is central to a humane society	How do you solve a problem like Shamima In February year old east London schoolgirl Shamima Begum travelled to Syria with two friends Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana to join Islamic State Last week she was discovered in al Hawl a Syrian refugee camp by the Times reporter Anthony Loyd She is nine months pregnant and wants to return to Britain  For some Begum is a victim a child brainwashed into jihad For others she is a villain who willingly joined Isis and should be barred from this country The home secretary Sajid Javid insists that he will not hesitate to prevent her return if necessary 
FEB18	I backed the SDP. But this Labour schism makes no sense at all	The great Brexit crisis slices through both parties dividing families friends neighbours and colleagues It may yet break apart the moribund political system But that seismic rupture didn t happen today when seven MPs walked out of the Labour party  Seven is a pitifully small number The timing is monstrously badly judged and the reasons the MPs give are oddly scattergun lacking political punch and focus To be sure they are not alone in thinking Jeremy Corbyn a weak leader with many failings his poll ratings show most of the country agrees as did the Labour MPs who voted no confidence in him two and half years ago as his kinder gentler politics turned poisonous 
FEB18	Britain could deradicalise Shamima Begum – with compassion	The CCTV images of the three teenage girls Shamima Begum Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase passing through Gatwick airport four years ago en route to join the Islamic State caliphate were shocking for much of the British public That Isis was radicalising people online was no surprise but the fact these three girls were as young as and from the same academy school in Bethnal Green east London cast the risks of radicalisation closer to home  The discredited counter radicalisation strategy Prevent was meant to stem the recruitment of homegrown terrorists including those recruited into the far right but has disproportionately focused on Islamist extremism without yielding any significant concrete results Last year for example an essay by the late Marxist political theorist Norman Geras on the political uses of violence was deemed so dangerous under the Prevent programme that Reading University students were warned not to leave it lying around where it could be seen by those who are not prepared to view it The university flagged the text as an extremist piece of work that should only be read in a secure setting 
FEB18	History will judge the selfish breakaway Independent Group	The reasons offered by the Independent Group for their departure from Labour at their launch press conference simply do not stand up to scrutiny  First Brexit Labour has opposed the Tories at every stage fighting Theresa May s broken exit plan voting against no deal and putting Labour s policy including the possibility of a further referendum to a vote by MPs 
FEB18	Wake up, humanity! A hi-tech dystopian future is not inevitable	When is the future no longer the future Only a decade ago air travel seemed to be moving ineluctably towards giant planes or superjumbos But last week Airbus announced it will cease manufacturing its A the world s fattest passenger jet as current trends favour smaller and more fuel efficient craft Progress changed course A more vivid reminder of lost dreams will come in a few weeks March marks the th anniversary of the maiden flight of Concorde Once upon a time all aviation was going to be supersonic But sometimes the future is cancelled  What if what we think is going to be the future right now is cancelled in its turn We are supposedly on an unstoppable path towards driverless vehicles fully automated internet connected smart homes and godlike artificial intelligence but then we ve been promised flying cars for half a century and they are still allegedly just around the corner We live in a time when technological change is portrayed as an inexorable impersonal force we d better learn how to surf the tsunami or drown But as a society we always have a choice about which direction we take next And sometimes we make the wrong decision 
FEB18	If Corbyn doesn’t want the Labour split to worsen, he has to listen	The ball is now in Jeremy Corbyn s court Whether the new Independent Group of MPs that split from the Labour party on Monday takes off largely depends upon what the leader does now to address the three crisis issues dividing him from the mainstream in his party Europe antisemitism and the attempted mass deselection of Labour MPs  The group if it coalesces into a party of some kind will struggle in the unforgiving world of our first past the post electoral system The SDP of which I was an enthusiastic founder member shortly after my th birthday because of my admiration for Roy Jenkins and Shirley Williams is not an encouraging precedent The SDP got to of the vote in alliance with the Liberals in the election but the two parties combined won only seats and most of the Labour MPs who defected to it lost their seats Significantly for the Independent Group far more Labour MPs lost their seats from joining the SDP than from deselection at the hands of far left activists 
FEB18	You get the heroes you deserve. And Brexit Britain has Gavin Williamson	What a time to be alive for Conservative former chief whip turned defence secretary Gavin Williamson  Keen to turn back the clock to the days when Britain s men in uniform could brutally quash a native uprising in the morning appropriate half of India s wealth in the afternoon and enjoy a G T or seven in the evening the man who once kept a pet tarantula in his office to cultivate an air of ruthless cunning has appropriated an image befitting his new role action man 
FEB18	Facebook is out of control and politicians have no idea what to do	Death threats bullying mental torture privacy invasion election rigging fake news monopoly abuse as was said of a medieval pope this is merely to suppress more serious charges It is hard to recall the social media of years ago and its offer of universal love democracy and global peace Britain s parliament has finally caught up and today s Commons report is at least unequivocal A menace stalks the land and must be curbed  Some of the report s accusations are astonishing Facebook purposefully obstructed the committee Its boss Mark Zuckerberg who continues to choose profit over data security held parliament in contempt His rambling empire is portrayed as lying thieving digital gangsterism Yet British electoral law is puny It is unfit for purpose leaving elections vulnerable to foreign influence disinformation and voter manipulation Not a week passes without evidence that cybersecurity is inadequate and public services have been left vulnerable to hacking 
FEB18	Stop the online conspiracy theorists before they break democracy	Organised conspiracy theorist networks have launched an all out information war across Europe At the heart of this is the QAnon movement It expanded from the US to Europe and the UK at rapid speed hijacking political debates on social media as well as mass protests in the streets in recent months Our new analysis at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue shows that European conspiracy theorists run increasingly sophisticated campaigns around critical junctions in national regional and global politics They even carried out social media operations to influence voters in German state elections including the election in Bavaria  The QAnon community which began on the message board site chan strongly overlaps with the support networks of far right movements such as the EDL and Pegida Most recently it co opted yellow vest demonstrations and boosted hardline Brexit campaigns and Tommy Robinson protests By injecting conspiratorial narratives into these movements its members can leverage existing networks and alter their political direction A commonly used tactic is to combine conspiricist hashtags with those of viral campaigns and trending topics The scale this generates is disproportional enough to distort public perception In ISD identified close to m uses of the word QAnon across Twitter YouTube and forums such as Reddit and chan 
FEB18	Brexit-led nationalism is destroying Britain’s overseas aid effort	Wearing a colourful dashiki shirt given to him by the president of Rwanda Andrew Mitchell leaned forward in his armchair eyes gleaming and explained why the Conservative party s pledge to spend of GDP on international development was solid Any attempt to change party policy on aid would fail Mitchell told me because there are too many of us who won t put up with it  That might have been the case when we met months ago it s not now The political consensus on aid which has lasted two decades and led to Britain becoming a world leader in aid and development has fallen apart 
FEB18	England lacks white working-class graduates. Quick fixes won’t change that	At half of England s universities fewer than of students are classified as being from disadvantaged white backgrounds according to a new report from the National Education Opportunities Network Neon This fact is bluntly stated as being a problem in the introduction of the report rather than the conclusion but it is worth looking beyond these headline figures What do reports like this really tell us  Who attends university and which university they attend is a question that captures commentators and policymakers for reasons that are related to but not fundamentally about education Universities are both pathways and gateways They can help train you to get somewhere new but they also work to make sure that only the right sort of people get into positions of power These functions overlap but aren t the same 
FEB19	The choice is clear for Labour MPs. Stay with Corbyn or leave the party	There is a phrase that has a lot of currency among Labour MPs who hate the direction their party has taken under Jeremy Corbyn They say they will stay and fight The vow is sometimes taken in private sometimes declared on social media alongside a plea for others to do the same It has become so familiar that its meaning is rarely interrogated  But what is this fight Who is it against What does victory look like The answers are not comfortable for the stayers The enemy is the elected leader of their party and he enjoys the overwhelming support of its members Corbyn s position is so unassailable that his would be assailants hardly dare to criticise him They grumble about Labour s position on Brexit and agitate for the endorsement of a second referendum They express horror at the way antisemitism has eaten into the party like gangrene and demand surgical intervention But in public the dissenters avoid pointing blame squarely at the leader or even at individuals in his entourage 
FEB19	The return of King Rat Derek Hatton marks a new low for Labour	In a single day the Labour party has lost Luciana Berger and gained Derek Hatton As swaps go this isn t dissimilar to giving someone an orgasm and them giving you gonorrhoea the loss of a hard working campaigning constituency MP Berger was among seven MPs to resign from Labour and the official welcoming back by a three person panel of a man so odious that he infamously delivered redundancy notices by taxi to his own council staff  To sum up Hatton in a brief vignette at the Labour party conference in Liverpool I was in a coffee shop searching for wifi and hit on a hotspot someone had called Derek Twatton 
FEB19	Carmakers quitting Britain won't blame Brexit – it's not in their interest	In a wave of anti Japanese nationalism gripped China Angry crowds burned down Japanese owned factories smashed Japanese made cars and pelted Tokyo s embassy in Beijing with eggs It was an experience that jolted Japanese business leaders and they decided to make sure they never again relied on one country for essential widgets and especially the finished article  In the months before the Brexit vote Japan s government warned that a victory for the leave campaign could have a negative impact on investments in Britain The Japan Business Federation noting that more than Japanese firms have a presence in Britain joined the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in pleading with Britain to remain in the EU 
FEB19	At last, a Brexit dividend – shame it’s for the pedlars of fake medicine	Some crimes are just worse than others When I tell people I research the market for fake and substandard medicines their most common reaction is Fake cancer medicines That s horrible Why would anyone do that  The World Health Organization reported earlier this month that fake leukaemia medicine packaged for the UK market to look like the genuine drug Iclusig was circulating in Europe and the Americas The short answer as to why anyone would do something as morally awful as this is of course to make money The fake leukaemia drug containing mostly paracetamol is being sold for a pack a pill in the US or a pack in the UK There is now a far larger market for legal medicines than there is for illegal drugs such as heroin or cocaine and there s a much smaller chance of getting caught The genuine pills are for seriously sick people so if a patient doesn t blossom back to health after taking fake treatments doctors generally blame the tumour not the pill 
FEB19	A poll shows support for Labour’s defectors – it could tempt Tory MPs to follow	For a party that doesn t actually exist yet the movement born from the wreckage of what was once the Labour mainstream seems surprisingly popular  The first poll to test the water since seven MPs abandoned Jeremy Corbyn shows a new centrist party against Brexit in third place behind Labour and the Tories and already beating the old centrist party against Brexit otherwise known as the Liberal Democrats Or to put it another way in hours it s achieved the kind of market share that Ukip took decades to get near 
FEB19	Can Bernie Sanders repeat his surprising success this time around?	Bernie is back  It s easy to forget the condescension and amusement that greeted himwhen he announced his first campaign for president in May 
FEB19	The British far right is leaderless – and all the more dangerous for it	Over the past year there have been a number of far right demonstrations in London some of which have attracted as many as people Whether it was the Free Tommy Robinson event in July or the Brexit betrayal demonstration in December the far right descended on the capital in numbers not seen in decades perhaps not since the interwar period of the s  The primary focus of this string of demonstrations has ranged from the imprisonment of anti Muslim activist Robinson real name Stephen Yaxley Lennon to the supposed suppression of free speech especially in regards to speaking about Muslims and the perceived betrayal of the Brexit vote by politicians and elites Similarly has kicked off with a number of small yellow vest demonstrations also focusing on Brexit 
FEB19	How would I deradicalise Shamima Begum? With Islamic scholarship	How do we deradicalise young indoctrinated people like Shamima Begum As part of their ideology takfiri terrorist groups such as Islamic State and al Qaida justify their aggression towards the west by creating a divide between Muslims and non Muslims They argue that the modern nation state model of governance is incompatible with Islamic principles and that the Muslim world must be governed by a caliphate based on medieval Sunni Islamic jurisprudence From her recent interviews it is clear that Begum is confused and conflicted about these issues she has clear loyalty to Isis but did also criticise them and called Britain home  The medieval Muslim model of the world has been adapting and evolving for at least years and modern Islamic jurisprudence accepts that the nation state system is entirely compatible with Islam 
FEB19	Bees brought Bavarians together. And they have a lesson for us all	Last week Bavarians forced their state legislature to change farming policies with the most successful petition in the state s history And while the law proposed by the petition covers a range of measures it s no surprise that campaigners rallying cry quickly became save the bees Bees stand for diligence dedication and orderliness But they are also a symbol of our relationship with nature and everything that has been wrong with it for decades Bees are emblematic of how the fight to save our planet and stop runaway climate change cannot wait They are our canary in the coalmine  Bees are essential for our food supply apples courgettes almonds one in every three bites we eat depends on bees and other pollinators But soil sealing and industrial monocultural agriculture using bee harming pesticides have caused a massive decline in bee populations worldwide to the extent that apple farmers in China have to pollinate their trees by hand 
FEB19	Podemos was the dazzling new force in Spanish politics. What went wrong?	It was only five years ago that Spain s break out party Podemos became a dazzling new lodestar for Europe s lost and troubled left But with a snap election just weeks away it now risks a crash as spectacular as its rise Has the leftwing populist model of ponytailed rebel Pablo Iglesias and his gang of talented young thinkers so admired by many Jeremy Corbyn backers and others around Europe proved a failure  Polling suggests the party is in deep trouble Podemos once led the polls and very nearly snatched leadership of Spain s left from prime minister Pedro S nchez s Socialist party at the elections but it is now only the voters fourth favourite party The meltdown means it is slated to lose half its deputies while S nchez gallops ahead taking well over twice as many votes as Podemos on April 
FEB20	The splitting of the Tories and Labour could redefine British politics	Heidi Allen Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston are not the first MPs to break away from the Conservative party The list of Tory resigners goes back to Winston Churchill in and beyond And they are unlikely to be the last Back in October I had a coffee at the Tory conference with a cabinet minister who confessed Part of me is longing for Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees Mogg to become leader so the rest of us can just leave and join a new party  Wednesday s departure of the three amigos as Allen called them at their press conference does not make that much larger Tory fissure a certainty much will depend on the Brexit endgame But it makes it more likely It also marks a potential watershed for the st century Conservative party When the three former Tory female MPs and their gender is definitely part of the story crossed the floor of the House of Commons this morning they threw down the gauntlet to an entire generation of st century Tory modernisers to either stand up or stand down 
FEB20	Whatever Meghan does, she’s damned. Let’s not repeat history	Last month I nominated Meghan Duchess of Sussex as a hate figure for the nation in the person we all need to get us through a difficult time like your cousin s girlfriend who waxes her eyebrows and yammers on about yoga at the start of a fraught Christmas As I then explained about a million times on Twitter I was joking I do not hate Meghan or even consider her vaguely hateful I could no more despise the woman than I could flick through the pages of a magazine and take against a salt and pepper male model with a watch on She wasn t the point the point was that society quests ceaselessly for an enemy and if you re going to have one at least let it be one who probably won t care  This was right in an ambient premonitory way but I was wrong to think it was funny The poor woman is being vilified round the clock this week for having the audacity to have a baby shower with her friends in New York It has gone beyond the point of mattering what her personality is like were anyone in any position to know she would have to be so thoroughly bad to warrant this level of scrutiny so devoid of human feeling so malicious in every intention that the media s daily censure wouldn t be enough We d have to paint her yellow and black like a bee 
FEB20	The Independent Group will at last give us real opposition to Brexit	Democracy abhors a vacuum The realignment that is happening now in our politics is the inevitable consequence of of the electorate feeling politically homeless A majority of our people who feel that neither of our main parties share their values principles and integrity  The decision of Heidi Allen Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston to join the existing Labour members of the Independent Group begins what I hope will be a process that will finally give a voice to a so far silent majority of voters I admire them for beingwilling to put their heads above the parapet to defy the onslaught of abuse I know too well and to be brave enough to look beyond a vote taken nearly three years ago and to acknowledge the clear and present danger Brexit now poses to the livelihoods jobs and quality of life of both leavers and remainers 
FEB20	UK museums should be honest about being stuffed with stolen goods	Museums are in crisis In the past their social role has been taken for granted they re spaces for preserving objects and educating the deferential public that comes to admire them It s a tidy completist dream wouldn t it be nice to see the whole of human history free and open to all  Except that history is nasty and ugly It s full of violence every moment every event takes place within a power dynamic there s always a hierarchy in play The whole concept of The Museum is a colonialist imperialist fantasy born from the fallacy that somehow the whole world can be neatly catalogued contained in a single building mapped out for easy digestion There s no such thing as a free object and every piece in a museum has been moved from its original context It s uncomfortable and rude to look too closely at what that move involved 
FEB20	New York is right to ban hair discrimination. Now how about the UK?	New York City s new legal guidance on discrimination based on hairstyle is a thing of beauty It points out that there is a widespread and fundamentally racist belief that black hairstyles are not suited for formal settings and may be unhygienic messy disruptive or unkempt and deems natural hair textures that are tightly coiled or tightly curled and black hairstyles such as locs cornrows braids fades and afros a protected racial characteristic This means that is now illegal to target black people based on their hair or hairstyle at work school or in any public place and if you do you may get fined  In a country where our elected representatives think it s OK to describe ethnic minorities as having a funny tinge on live television it appears that British conversations around the nature of hair texture and hairstyle discrimination and how they intersect with race are rudimentary at best But now is the perfect time to consider the experiences of those of us living in Britain with kinky coily hair and whether Britain should introduce similar laws 
FEB20	The clitoris is a gift, so why is there an ingrained fear of talking about it?	The first UK conviction for female genital mutilation FGM this month was a milestone in the fight for the basic human rights of women and girls But one of the things that stands out from the news reports of that case is how oddly furtive they were about communicating the key facts in particular their avoidance of the C word clitoris  In reporting such a prominent case are readers unable to be shown the correct medical terminology Why do the media carefully avoid mentioning what occurred using highly generalised anatomical terms before quickly moving on If this lack of detail was to spare the victim the indignity of having such a personal matter discussed so publicly I would have sympathy however I do not think that this is the case here What I think is at play is a deep rooted fear of the clitoris 
FEB20	Javid’s decision on Shamima Begum demeans his office	Politics has always to some extent been the art of combining doing what s right with doing what s in one s own political interests It would be naive to pretend otherwise But in recent months with a weak prime minister desperately trying to cling on to power and senior Tories hungrily eyeing the top job it feels like naked political ambition is shaping real world outcomes more than ever before  Nowhere is that more evident than in Sajid Javid s decision to revoke Shamima Begum s British citizenship In trying to position himself as Theresa May s successor the home secretary is signalling to the tabloid press just how tough he is on national security and immigration Perhaps as a son of immigrants he feels he has more to prove 
FEB20	My grandfather was a Nazi. I’ve seen why we need the EU	Until his death in the early s my grandad was a committed Nazi Most of his elder brothers died in one night at the battle of the Hartmannsweilerkopf in the first world war In a bitterly traumatised interwar Germany defined by hatred against foreigners Jews and democracy as well as delusions of national grandeur he was unemployed for most of the s He joined the Nazi party early and volunteered to fight in He became a staff sergeant in the Wehrmacht and led a so called anti partisan unit on the eastern front and participated in the capture of Kiev  We believe he took part in the September Babi Yar massacre in which more than Jewish inhabitants of Kiev were shot Until his death he would rant about Jews the French and the perfidious Albion He never left the country again and he d be in a near panic when coming close to a border 
FEB20	How to cure the shopping addiction that’s destroying our planet	I ve always thought of myself as someone who cares about the environment I ve recycled for as long as I can remember I m on my way to having a plastic free kitchen and I always try to take public transport instead of driving But until last year I was guilty of unknowingly contributing to m tonnes of waste a year more carbon emissions than the shipping and aviation industries combined and microplastics ending up in the ocean just by buying new clothes  A cross party report has found that people today buy and discard clothes faster than ever and it means we get rid of more than m tonnes of clothes a year with m worth going to landfill every year The implications of this are so bad that there have been recent claims that the fashion industry can be listed alongside the oil industry as one of the five most polluting industries in the world 
FEB20	Young climate strikers can win their fight. We must all help	This one has to succeed It is not just that the youth climate strike now building worldwide with tremendous speed is our best and possibly our last hope of avoiding catastrophe It is also that the impacts on the young people themselves if their mobilisation and hopes collapse so early in their lives could be devastating  To help this movement win we should ask why others lost We should ask for instance why Occupy despite the energy and sacrifices of so many came to an end while the institutions it confronted remain intact We should wonder why the global justice movement of the late s and early s despite the numbers involved their courage and determination has not changed the world We should consider why Podemos the Spanish party that rose so high on the optimism of the indignados movement now seems to be spiralling into recriminatory collapse 
FEB21	Shamima Begum has a right to British citizenship, whether you like it or not	When I was I stopped off in Holland during a camping holiday with a friend We bought as much marijuana as we could and smoked it all in an afternoon Sat behind a housing estate in the border town of Nijmegen we giggled rambled and lay around until the local police came They took us back to the campsite we found the fact that they spoke Dutch hilarious where we were asked for our passports and train tickets They already had our number a couple of idiots out of their minds and out of their depth They told us to get on the next train in the direction of the port We d stopped laughing by then We went home  Adolescents do stupid things Often they know they are stupid at the time
FEB21	These Tory defectors are the Thelma and Louise of British politics	At the end of Thelma Louise as the net closes in on the outlaws Geena Davis s character turns to her friend and says she doesn t ever remember feeling this awake The freedom they craved may be violent and volatile compared to the steady suburban unhappiness of the lives they left behind but at least now it feels as if there s something to live for  There was a hint of something similar about a gleeful Heidi Allen declaring as she left the Conservative party this week that she was tired of feeling numb about politics that she hadn t felt this excited in years The self styled three amigos driving away from the Tories into an uncertain future as independents will no doubt have suffered their share of sleepless nights over this particular road trip But compared with the rather grief stricken press conference given by their colleagues leaving the Labour party the excitement was palpable and for a certain kind of female voter it s undoubtedly infectious 
FEB21	The EU must resist impatience with Britain – for its own sake	 I will celebrate said an emphatic German voice behind me while some dignitary on stage mouthed the conventional polite platitudes of regret about Britain s departure from the EU I will celebrate when it s over at last A week spent talking to politicians officials and opinion makers on the continent tells me that this captures the prevailing mood among Britain s frustrated and increasingly contemptuous European partners just get the negotiated withdrawal agreement across the line and Britain out of the door then we can go back to fighting the real battles for Europe starting with the European elections  While I understand all the feelings and calculations behind this view it is profoundly shortsighted It abandons those of us still fighting for Europe in Britain and underestimates the EU s role in deciding Britain s future A divided country in the midst of a collective nervous breakdown is painfully dependent on the reaction of its now much stronger EU negotiating partner This explains why every tweet from Donald Tusk every hint from Jean Claude Juncker every nuance from Michel Barnier is pored over in the British media with almost Sovietological attention The EU is a major actor in the British debate not merely a reactor to it The conclusion is clear it s not just Britain that faces a big choice over Brexit it s also Europe 
FEB21	The City may thrive despite Brexit, but the rest of us won’t	An iron law of modern British government says that whatever London wants London gets On Monday with no fuss or publicity the Bank of England and a group of City interests reached an apparently boring deal in Paris with the European Security and Markets Authority It follows a similar deal with the European commission last December Both state in effect that as far as the City is concerned if there is a no deal Brexit Brexit did not happen It was just play acting by idiots down the road in Westminster  Up to tn in financial guarantees insurances hedges and other derivatives all within the EU s regulatory regime is said to be at risk in the City s clearing houses For everyone involved this is a grownup business not to be left to the mercies of the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees Mogg The regulators have duly issued licences to the clearing houses allowing Europe s banks to disregard EU rules and continue trading on London s derivatives platforms Financially speaking London is to become a free port Sighs of relief all round 
FEB21	Barbie, a kitsch throwback? At least she wears it on her sleeve	There is a lot of excitement over the release later this year of the sequel to Frozen but in my house greater anticipation is reserved for the Barbie live action movie due out in with Margot Robbie in the title role For the last few years Mattel Barbie s makers have been fighting competition from more modern Disney heroines and the movie in which Barbie is reportedly expelled from Barbie world for not being perfect enough is part of the brand s attempt at a feminist rejigging  I was never big into Barbie as a child She and Ken seemed underpowered compared with my gang of hulking great Sindy dolls and their single beau Action Man with his weird felt hair and khaki jeep and switch at the back of his head that actually made his eyes swivel Sindy has no presence in America however and among my daughters fourth birthday presents were palaeontologist Barbie and scientist Barbie They are also committed to a seven season Barbie animation on Netflix called Life in the Dreamhouse 
FEB21	Once Brexit is over, what’s left? A two-party system that kills optimism	Brexit breaks everything it touches scything through the country risking the union itself Now it bites chunks out of both main parties both richly deserving these desertions More defections may follow up to from Labour are said to have considered it while Heidi Allen claims a third of Tories would jump if no deal is in prospect Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve have confirmed they are among them  This is as it should be because Brexit is the most momentous political crisis of our lifetimes overriding all other political issues crossing party lines Right now in these crucial weeks every good MP should put the fate of the country first and do all they can to stop Britain teetering over the Brexit precipice They should threaten their rigid leaders with whatever damage they can inflict to make them change direction 
FEB21	Gay conversion therapy proves there’s still bigotry towards LGBT people	The results of a new survey on the evidence and impact of gay conversion therapy in which same sex attracted individuals are treated in order to become straight are shocking But I for one am not surprised that there still exists bigotry and prejudice towards us As an out lesbian I witness it on a regular basis  The survey by the Ozanne Foundation led by Church of England lesbian activist Jayne Ozanne attracted more than responses Of those people said they had tried to become straight had attempted suicide and had been forced to have sex with someone of the opposite sex 
FEB21	We cannot allow Liam Fox’s post-Brexit trade plans to go unscrutinised	The government cancelled parliament s recess at short notice so as not to give the impression MPs were on holiday a matter of weeks before we face crashing out of the EU  The international trade secretary Liam Fox is using the opportunity to avoid proper scrutiny of plans that threaten our rights our environment and our democracy He tabled a general debate on post Brexit trade agreements with the US Australia New Zealand and the Trans Pacific Partnership for Thursday And he is expected to launch negotiations soon after the debate with no chance for parliament to stop him 
FEB21	What next for the Independent Group? Here’s a winning manifesto	This week s eruption of the new Independent Group in parliament has been caused in part by the toxic culture that has taken hold within each of the established parties Bullying intimidation and racism covert and overt have already persuaded MPs to jump ship probably to be followed by more in due course But if they are to gain a permanent foothold in British politics they will need to morph into a more normal party and establish policies that distinguish them from Labour and the Conservatives What policies might appeal to both social democrats and liberal conservatives alike  Start with this the stale brand of politics practised on both frontbenches is inherently conservative It looks back to a mythic past that never was and never could have been Tories increasingly look askance at the liberal open and cosmopolitan Britain that is emerging many of them want to shut off the world raise our borders reduce immigration insist on social modes and mores that went out of fashion decades ago Labour now seems like something of a s tribute band champing at the bit to nationalise the public utilities re establish a ministry of labour bring back sectoral wage bargaining and repeal most of the Trade Union Acts Each of these pasts is a deeply nostalgic vision of a Britain that is not coming back however much governments huff and puff 
FEB21	I served in the Met. The lack of progress on diversity is disgusting	The question that needs to be asked is not are the Metropolitan police institutionally racist or why does black and minority ethnic recruitment for the police still lag so far behind the diversity of London as a whole It should simply be Why do young black and minority ethnic people reject the Metropolitan police as a career choice  This week marking years since the landmark Macpherson report on institutional racism in the police the Met said it would take years for the force to mirror the wider diversity of London and will remain disproportionately white Why 
FEB22	Charles Dickens was a ruthless Victorian husband. Like my great-grandfather	Domestic tyranny was a fact of Victorian life men who were saintly in public could behave very cruelly behind their front doors In close to the end of her life Catherine Dickens began to confide to her neighbours in Camden north London a few details of how her late husband had treated her Charles was by now eight years dead and the couple had last lived together in around the time the novelist began his long affair with the young actress Ellen Ternan But the public knew nothing of this relationship  Dickens worldwide reputation as a compassionate moralist the enemy of humbug and suffering continued to flourish untainted by the facts of his private life Naturally the neighbours Edward Dutton Cook and his wife were shocked when Catherine told them how Charles had once tried to have her locked up as a madwoman 
FEB22	Just when the country needs Tom Hanks, we get Derek Hatton	Derek Hatton George Galloway Chris Williamson Ken Livingstone these guys may not physically sit together in public life but I definitely think of them as a grouping In fact it is perfectly possible that over time they could be joined by like minded individuals from the right Galloway got on like a house on fire with Nigel Farage during the referendum Unfortunately both of them seem to have been pulled from the inferno unscathed  Yup you can totally picture their independent minds dovetailing with disaffected MeToo defendants or even defectors from the daytime schedules such as Noel Edmonds If things were different they d hang out more with their brother from another mother Julian Assange Like I said it s a mood it s a feeling They don t have to share every view Most of them will have an objection to paying the licence fee say while only some of them will get slightly aroused when they think about Marine A Quite a lot of them actually And not just the obvious ones 
FEB22	The odds are against them, but these MPs could yet change our politics	Westminster has a new parlour game Since Monday a conversation with anyone in or around politics will open with a round of So what are the chances for this new Independent Group Players are encouraged to produce ever smarter reasons why the cluster of MPs who broke from their former parties eight from Labour three from the Tories is doomed to fail Bonus points are awarded for historical references or imaginative use of polling data By way of a warm up there are the obvious early arguments New or third parties do notoriously badly under our first past the post electoral system just look at the SDP There are no heavyweight figures to match the Gang of Four who broke from Labour in The Independents have no leader and no clear policy stance  What s more within three hours of launching they were playing defence after one of their number Angela Smith seemingly referred to black and minority ethnic people as having a funny tinge a racism so crude it was bewildering Notice too how they struggle to surmount the contradiction of demanding a people s vote on Brexit while refusing a people s vote on themselves by refusing to trigger byelections in their own seats 
FEB22	The ugly truth about Karl Lagerfeld’s reign	Karl Lagerfeld is dead and the fashion industry he presided over from the house of Chanel rends its garments and calls itself heartbroken His muse a white cat called Choupette which exists largely on Twitter a metaphor for his misanthropy so pure I thank him was photographed in a mourning veil thanking us for our words of condolence That his best beloved was literally inhuman and very small is no surprise It is rumoured that if she exists she will inherit his fortune though that is illegal in France  I do not think Lagerfeld really liked women It is impossible to watch his work and think he did It is impossible to watch his face immobile from surgery or not I can t say and think he liked himself It is obvious and often noted that fashion doesn t have to be misogynistic and exclusionary fashion is merely expression and expression is morally neutral But it certainly became those things in the era when Lagerfeld was dominant In a world that is pure hierarchy he had the power of a medieval pope and he could have used it to make fashion less exclusionary and more joyful Consider the changes that Edward Enninful is making at British Vogue He employs Paris Lees a trans woman as a columnist and his first cover featured Adwoa Aboah a mixed race woman Lagerfeld was rarely so benevolent or brave profit was his calling and misogyny his method At home meanwhile he preferred to idolise a cat 
FEB22	Calling everyone who criticises Corbyn ‘Blairite’ is crazy	Splitters Traitors The People s Front of Judea I am quite enjoying the current shenanigans of those people who say they just can t take it any more Some are sick of Brexit Some want a people s vote Some are disgusted at the acceptance of antisemitism Some are probably terrible careerists out only for themselves though this seems a rather unlikely way to do it Some may be people you want to go to the pub with Some you would cross over the street to avoid I couldn t possibly comment  Never mind Some probably just look at their own their leaders and wonder what they have to lose Jeremy Corbyn nonchalant about George Galloway being readmitted Galloway Oh why not Degsy Hatton lasted all of two days in the in out shake it all about Labour party where you can say nasty things about Jews to some of the people just some of the time As usual none of this matters if you utter the magic word neoliberalism every other sentence 
FEB22	If news is dying, who will safeguard democracy?	Journalism has joined the list of endangered professions teaching it appears to be more lucrative than doing it A great deal of brilliant and high quality journalism is still being pursued around the world every day but the news industry is steadily shrinking Why is that  Let s make a distinction here between journalism and news News is only one of the many kinds of journalistic output News as a standardised non fiction literary form was invented more than years ago in response to very specific social and cultural conditions and was ignited by a new technology called the telegraph The invention of the electric telegraph in the s allowed the fast and international transmission of bursts of information in short staccato messages which were ironically not unlike tweets 
FEB22	France has an antisemitism problem – and not just from the gilets jaunes	The issue of antisemitism has taken centre stage in France in the last few days following a spate of violent attacks President Emmanuel Macron even said that it was at its worst level since the second world war The gilets jaunes yellow vests movement has also been infiltrated by this bigotry Last weekend gilets jaunes protesters hurled antisemitic slurs at Alain Finkielkraut a prominent philosopher and ardent supporter of the movement as he was walking by a rally While the movement as a whole is not antisemitic extremist groups both far right and far left have effectively co opted it turning it into a platform for a range of hateful narratives As support continues to decline the movement is becoming increasingly dominated by a radical and sometimes extremist minority  Yet reading the attack against Finkielkraut as an isolated episode or as a symptom of a movement spinning out of control misses an important truth that early on the very nature of the movement has allowed hateful voices to weave their way into its ranks 
FEB22	Burberry’s noose hoodie is part of a shameful fashion tradition	A year ago Gucci put an offensive jumper on their Milan catwalk although it took that long to actually cause offence  The wool balaclava jumper was black with a cut out mouth and red lips which when pulled up over the wearer s face bore a disturbing resemblance to blackface At the time no one seemed to notice I missed it too and I missed it again when it went on sale last autumn both of which now seem inexcusable looking at it it couldn t be anything else Yet it wasn t until February this year that flags were raised on Twitter as is often the case these days and even then only within the context of Black History Month Gucci apologised and took the jumpers off the shelves even though they had already sat there for a good six months 
FEB22	The EU must resist impatience with Britain – for its own sake	 I will celebrate said an emphatic German voice behind me while some dignitary on stage mouthed the conventional polite platitudes of regret about Britain s departure from the EU I will celebrate when it s over at last A week spent talking to politicians officials and opinion makers on the continent tells me that this captures the prevailing mood among Britain s frustrated and increasingly contemptuous European partners just get the negotiated withdrawal agreement across the line and Britain out of the door then we can go back to fighting the real battles for Europe starting with the European elections  While I understand all the feelings and calculations behind this view it is profoundly shortsighted It abandons those of us still fighting for Europe in Britain and underestimates the EU s role in deciding Britain s future A divided country in the midst of a collective nervous breakdown is painfully dependent on the reaction of its now much stronger EU negotiating partner This explains why every tweet from Donald Tusk every hint from Jean Claude Juncker every nuance from Michel Barnier is pored over in the British media with almost Sovietological attention The EU is a major actor in the British debate not merely a reactor to it The conclusion is clear it s not just Britain that faces a big choice over Brexit it s also Europe 
FEB22	Tory defectors are just getting involved in a Labour party tussle	I find it difficult to fathom why three Conservative MPs would wish to join the Independent Group formed by Labour MPs They argue that the Conservative party has shifted away from them under Theresa May over the last year and a half There is no evidence to support this  The party is rightly moving away from the austerity of the David Cameron George Osborne years It is highlighting the need to govern for the whole nation and to take care of those places and people that need more support It has championed the higher living wage building on Labour s introduction of the minimum wage It has taken care to progress policies of toleration and support for minorities to give more weight and money to mental health issues and has now announced major new funding for the NHS These are all things I as a supporter of the European Research Group also support 
FEB23	Put yourself in Shamima Begum’s shoes before you damn her out of hand	Less than two weeks after Shamima Begum was discovered in a Syrian refugee camp she s public enemy number one Eight in people believe she should be stripped of her British citizenship say so even if that leaves her stateless  The home secretary Sajid Javid might regard this as vindication of his disgraceful decision to deprive Begum of her citizenship last week But others have expressed dismay at the level of public vitriol 
FEB23	May I have a word about… actors, hackers and shape-shifting balls	Did you know that there was a league table of state sponsored hackers  No me neither but apparently Russia is the quickest out of the blocks for launching aggressive global cyber attacks with an average breakout time the time it takes to move from a compromised computer to others in an organisation of minutes and seconds while Iran is a positive sluggard with an average breakout time of hours and minutes This research comes from an organisation called CrowdStrike which as you might expect goes big in its mission statement 
FEB23	Asbestos has haunted Scotland for decades and our children still at risk	In the dismal argot of government few working class families in west central Scotland have not been adversely affected by bad health choices and outcomes  Heart disease and cancer in particular seem to have developed a peculiar attachment to those who lived and worked near yards and factories and inhaled the fumes of mass production Politicians academics and health professionals almost all of them sincere and intent on doing the right thing like to reduce their analysis of these patterns of bad health into easily digestible bites that seem to make sense to the rest of us If only we would all drink less eat better and reduce our salt and sugar intake why Scotland could become the gym bunny of Europe 
FEB23	Buoyed by freedom, the rebels are now able to follow their consciences	Of all the party s factions Labour First was the most practical It wasn t filled with rosy cheeked Blairite missionaries from the upper middle class or with Corbynites who had never recovered from their first reading of Lenin as the joints were passed around in the s  Working class and hard headed the Labour First rally at last year s conference echoed to calls of stay and fight Corbyn Show offs would walk away hawking their conscience around from body to body asking to be told what to do with it as Ernie Bevin hero of old Labour s right put it Real Labourites would do the hard work to recapture the party from the far left 
FEB23	In exploring this united kingdom, I discovered a still proud separateness	I am English by birth and British by nationality Brexit reminded me that I am Celtic by origin Not for emotional reasons but because my paternal grandfather was born in Newry County Down And that entitles me to Irish citizenship which I was granted last year and an Irish passport which is being processed at the moment Thanks to Dublin I have salvaged my European identity which I hold as dear as I do my Englishness and Britishness  Growing up in London I had no sense of an Irish or Scottish identity But inspired by my newfound Irish citizenship I found myself last month staring at an imposing stone oblong slab at St Patrick s church in Newry a couple of miles from the border with the Republic of Ireland The words The Glennys of Newry were engraved in large letters and behind it lay the graves of my great my great great and my great great great grandfathers 
FEB23	‘Barking mad’... how Dickens led to our modern gaslighting men	If not exactly a local saint like Churchill or Florence Nightingale Charles Dickens comes close enough for his reputation to have largely survived to date the documented mistreatment of his wife Catherine mother of his children She was publicly dumped by him denigrated and separated from all but one of their children having become fat and to Dickens dull  Indeed as the playwright Martin McDonagh demonstrated in a recent play A Very Very Very Dark Matter the reputational damage has been so scant that his hilarious reimagining of the creator of Tiny Tim as a foulmouthed lecherous fraud came across as not so much counterfactual as wildly blasphemous 
FEB23	The Observer view on the robust action needed to curb 'online gangsters'	It would have been fascinating to be a fly on the wall or a bug in the software at last week s meeting in San Francisco between Jeremy Wright the culture secretary and Mark Zuckerberg the elusive boss of Facebook Mr Wright did not willingly share a lot of data afterwards though who knows what might end up online He described the talks as useful while Facebook reported a positive and productive conversation  The fact that a cabinet minister was obliged to travel to California after Mr Zuckerberg declined repeated invitations to appear before parliament gives an insight into the relative balance of power as pressure grows to impose a semblance of order integrity and legality on a chaotic online digital world By deigning to meet Mr Zuckerberg gave the impression that he was doing Wright a big favour 
FEB23	The Observer view on the future of the Independent Group	More than half of the UK electorate think the political system is broken That s according to a poll published by the charity Hope not Hate last week Just under seven in of those polled also said that they think none of the main political parties speaks for them It s not hard to imagine what s motivating these sentiments Parliament remains gridlocked on the most important question facing the country for decades Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are plainly putting their party interest before the national interest on Brexit Other issues that matter to people school funding how we care for older people have been all but squeezed out of the debate  Could a new political party go some way towards fixing these problems That s the question facing newly independent MPs who left the Labour and Conservative parties last week of whom have formed a loose grouping the Independent Group There was something refreshing about watching these MPs call time on their parties floundering leaderships And there was much to agree with in their critiques For Labour by far the most serious charge is the leadership s failure to respond adequately to the antisemitic abuse being committed by some of its members It is damning and shocking to witness a Jewish Labour MP leaving a party with a proud anti racist history because the disgusting abuse shows no signs of abating in Of course Mr Corbyn s failure to adopt a coherent position on Brexit was also a big factor for most of the departing MPs 
FEB23	Breakdancing at the Olympics? Bring it on...	Good for Paco Boxy the face of British breakdancing who came out with a punchy one might say nominatively characteristic comment on hearing that the sport was to be included pending ratification in the Olympic Games in Paris   A lot of people will look at breakdancing as just spinning on your head or doing the worm he said but the people that I know train like athletes They go to the gym swimming train every day For this to go in the Olympics is massive 
FEB23	The Japanese aren’t daft – that’s why they’re getting out of Brexit Britain	One of the few remaining elegant wooden buildings in central Tokyo that survived allied bombing in the second world war is the Mitsubishi lodge The Kaitokaku set back from the main thoroughfares its gardens overshadowed by skyscrapers is a web of beautifully carved wood rooms where executives bankers and clients who are part of the Mitsubishi keiretsu or conglomerate network socialise with top officials from the phenomenally influential ministry of international trade and industry MITI and discuss business privately drinking sake until three or four in the morning Deals are done new technologies discussed and consensus reached on what is happening geopolitically to Japan s markets and how it should react  The closeness of the relationship between business finance and state is a universe apart from anything we know in Britain Critics argue that the keiretsu represents a destructive corporatism and an obstacle to the operation of free and open markets admirers that it allows member companies to share risks find synergies lower financing costs and encourage long termism so informing Japan s agile industrial policy and directly leading to Japan having dozens of world beating companies and brands By contrast Britain is not at the races 
FEB24	If Labour aids a Tory Brexit it will be destroyed by what follows	Even now after all that s happened over the past few days and with everything to come Labour politicians and their aides cling to one of two excuses for their position on Brexit The first will come most often from an MP for some kicked about northern seat I voted remain of course they generally begin but my constituents wanted Brexit And so despite all misgivings Brexit they shall have Soft Brexit naturally as soft and as yielding as a goosedown pillow because our clear eyed good hearted representative looks at the tragedy at Honda and knows they want no more of that but enough Brexit they hope to satisfy the voters appetite  The second excuse usually comes from those closer to Jeremy Corbyn by employment or inclination For them Brexit is something to be endured for the greater good of enabling Labour to kick out the Tories So nail those six tests to the door even if they are to use a technical term bollocks offer to help Theresa May with her deal strike a tone both constructive and ambiguous 
FEB24	Jussie Smollett’s story shows how intolerant of ‘victims’ we really are	One of the many moral panics of our time is that of victimhood culture Apparently we are too indulgent of those who can claim victim status a state especially rife among students The story goes that this has turned us all into eternal babies coddling us protecting us from micro aggressions and signalling an erosion of individual grit and autonomy in favour of mimsy whining  In an effort to invert unfair power structures some claim victimhood culture has only succeeded in replacing them with different unfair power structures where those who used to be at the bottom now hold the whip hand over those who used to be at the top Women terrify men who are forever fearful an offhand remark will become a harassment lawsuit and racial minorities secure jobs at the expense of white people the moment their unusual names are spotted on a CV The writer Lionel Shriver called it privileging the disadvantaged Shriver also told BBC Radio that white men in the UK are on the bottom rung of society because they are considered to be the most powerful demographic reader I can reveal they are Victimhood culture advocates engage in a lot of doublethink 
FEB24	I salute the new independent MPs – here is my advice to them	Let us start with the wisdom of Edmund Burke the founding father of not so thoughtless conservatism The unfortunate independent member has nothing to offer but harsh refusal or pitiful excuse or despondent representation of a hopeless interest In the House he votes for ever in a dispirited minority Can we conceive of a more discouraging post of duty than this  I did it for four years from to and believe that Burke was wrong Looking back on it I reflected that being an MP like being a soldier was something that I did not much enjoy doing but I enjoyed having done And I found a friendly space in the House of Commons MPs on all sides treated me as an historical oddity rather than a threat to their party system My parliamentary friends were of the awkward squad 
FEB24	There is now a force to disrupt Brexit. MPs, it’s time to act	One of the great lessons of the th century is that history has no direction as Isaiah Berlin and Karl Popper argued and as the transformative upheavals of showed to thrilling effect there is no secular version of providence no ideological script to follow So it has been alarming in the past few years to watch the two main parties surrendering to different versions of the teleological delusion  The Conservative party has embraced Brexit as a mythic nativist destiny towards which we must all march loyally Labour meanwhile is in thrall to the old left determinism in which all the core debates have long since been settled devotion to the leadership must be absolute and all that remains is for those who are foolish enough to think otherwise to be stripped of their false consciousness For those of us who believe in pluralist politics it has been a depressing spectacle a battle between desperate certainties that slide pointlessly over the gritty unpredictable reality of st century life Which is the principal reason why the foundation of the strong Independent Group of formerly Labour and Tory MPs has been so refreshing 
FEB24	Real pain lies behind the fiction of true-crime dramas	Though I m better known as an arts journalist for most of my career I ve been a crime reporter I ve covered headline making cases from the serial killer Levi Bellfield the subject of ITV s recent drama Manhunt to that of Shannon Matthews whose abduction was the subject of the BBC drama The Moorside I m proud of the careful responsible reporting of those cases by journalists and am always inspired by the diligent work of police lawyers and jurors in public courtrooms all over the country  That s why I m wary of fictionalised true crime Writers of dramas take the trauma of real lives but then without the same obligations of accuracy and fairness that journalists or documentarians have can play fast and loose to make fiction about relatively recent crimes Some is breathtakingly casual Who did not wince at John Malkovich s recent musings on the Today programme about David Mamet s new black farce about a very badly behaved movie mogul It s a terrific piece of writing he told us 
FEB24	Sajid Javid is pandering to rightwing press over Shamima Begum	A media rule of thumb beware those moments when competing editors leader writers and commentators agree with each other and politicians leap on the bandwagon It always heralds a moral panic  This has been perfectly illustrated by the case of Shamima Begum the year old Islamic State recruit who gave birth to her third child the previous two having died in a Syrian refugee camp She would have been an easy target at any time Now with Britain s parliament in disarray and the country hopelessly split over Brexit here was a rallying point for collective outrage Nobody surely could disagree 
FEB24	Why binary politics leaves Britain all at sea	Eton College s most admirable attribute I ve long thought is its motto A Latin phrase but not one that would have been familiar to the Romans Floreat Etona translates as May Eton flourish Contractually speaking that s watertight No bombast and no virtue signalling Good luck anyone saying that particular institution has hypocritically betrayed its aims or principles This place is about this place It s like someone proclaiming I m all about me it steals the thunder of any accusations of selfishness  On consulting the college s website however I discovered that Floreat Etona is not strictly speaking its motto Eton s motto is often thought to be Floreat Etona it says but Esto perpetua May it last for ever came into usage if anything a little earlier I m not sure what the if anything is doing for that sentence I think if anything it s superfluous That s to say I think it s a superfluous if anything If anything The website carries on In fact neither phrase is officially a motto they are unofficial creations that over time have stuck 
FEB24	Shock value has its role for animal rights campaigners	Judging by its wiry dun coloured fur its ears and snout the dog was perhaps an airedale lying side on and close up to the camera But identification was difficult because most of its body had been skinned and it seemed in the process of being barbecued whole The arresting image was the title screen still from a video about the protest methods of animal rights activists  Readers reacted quickly Please get this off our screens without delay It is horrible that the Guardian would stoop so low and call it journalism One person complained that the title and content of the article gives no clue that a close up image of the face and body of a butchered animal will appear and it is not directly related to the content either In the context of serious video journalism exploring a strand of contemporary political activism there was clear editorial justification for reporting signposted the mock barbecue staged by protesters in a shopping precinct in Sydney Their sign on the barbecue read If you wouldn t eat a dog why eat a lamb Go vegan 
FEB24	Independents offer hope to those who despair of our broken politics	Winston Churchill who left the Tories to become a Liberal and then went back to the Conservatives wryly congratulated himself Anyone can rat but it takes a certain ingenuity to re rat  He is the exception to the rule that switchers don t succeed in British politics It is an enormous decision when an MP chooses to break with a party to which the politician will very often have committed decades of his or her life It means the ruination of friendships and the wrecking of family relationships And it is much more often than not a choice that leads to doom This is why so many Labour and Conservative MPs stay within their parties even when they are in the most profound despair with where they are going or how they are being led They resign themselves to bitter self imprisonment in the belief that splitters never prosper 
FEB24	A new politics? That lies with the people, not the Independent Group	The launch of the new Independent Group was a golden opportunity to do politics differently The most high profile of its eight former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna even described it as the beginning of a new politics Really It all felt frustratingly dispiritingly same old same old Politicians behind podiums at a press conference a stone s throw from parliament telling us it s about them what they know what they will do and why they should be in charge This categorically is not a new politics because that wouldn t be about them it would be about us  This is what those MPs should have done to demonstrate a new politics They would have gone anywhere but Westminster to a vibrant community hub for example They would have brought together lots of different people from varied backgrounds especially the young They would have sat with them not in front of them The people would have talked first and the politicians would have responded It would have been live streamed with people asking questions and making points from wherever they were Climate change would have been a key issue 
FEB25	At last, Jeremy. Now Labour’s mission must be to prevent any Brexit	Sliding closer day by day you can hear the swelling excitement of the catastrophists at the thrilling prospect of a no deal smash out Into the unknown Hurl all the old certainties into the air and see what new patterns the broken fragments make on the floor Break all rules start again bring on the Brexit revolution  They take no heed when the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte cautioned them on Monday We are sleep walking into no deal scenario It s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you Wake up This is real European council president Donald Tusk and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar added warnings of a chaotic Brexit the grown ups trying to restrain the out of control teenagers punching each other up inside what purports to be the British government Since there can t be a reopening of the withdrawal agreement or a breaking of the backstop in the Irish border settlement Tusk says It s absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal So Theresa May tiptoes closer to the edge at serious risk of an accidental last minute plunge 
FEB25	Green Book’s Oscar shows Hollywood still doesn’t get race	It s now four years since the OscarsSoWhite hashtag put Hollywood movie making in the dock over its failure to acknowledge black achievement A lot has happened since Moonlight memorably won the best picture Oscar two years ago Mahershala Ali and Viola Davis have won supporting actor prizes and Jordan Peele has a best original screenplay gong Alongside them several other black artists have been nominated  But the OscarsSoWhite campaign was not meant merely as a tick box exercise in counting the number of nominations It was meant to make Hollywood rethink how it tells black people s stories and to reward black artists in the best possible way by giving them the chance to have their voices heard 
FEB25	What lunch with the PM taught me: her dullness disguises a dangerous power mania	Have I told you about the very long lunch I once had with Theresa May I was reminded of it as I watched a clip of her playing pool with the Italian prime minister at an EU summit at the weekend The lunch went on for several hours or so it seemed All space and time came to a halt as I sat there staring at my cutlery in a state of existential despair failing somehow to communicate with her I gave up the will to live between the starter and the main course and just kept glancing over at her security detail on another table wishing I could be with them Ordinary people talking  This was when I worked at a rightwing newspaper and would often be taken along as a token woman to meet Tory grandees Some of them were quite a laugh Some sort of fun and gossip could be had Some were incredibly dull and thick Some sent me into a trance they were so boring And some were just obnoxious Ann Widdecombe for instance was I felt nasty to the waitress To me that breaks the th commandment I remember asking her what star sign she was just to annoy her 
FEB25	If Labour aids a Tory Brexit it will be destroyed by what follows	Even now after all that s happened over the past few days and with everything to come Labour politicians and their aides cling to one of two excuses for their position on Brexit The first will come most often from an MP for some kicked about northern seat I voted remain of course they generally begin but my constituents wanted Brexit And so despite all misgivings Brexit they shall have Soft Brexit naturally as soft and as yielding as a goosedown pillow because our clear eyed good hearted representative looks at the tragedy at Honda and knows they want no more of that but enough Brexit they hope to satisfy the voters appetite  The second excuse usually comes from those closer to Jeremy Corbyn by employment or inclination For them Brexit is something to be endured for the greater good of enabling Labour to kick out the Tories So nail those six tests to the door even if they are to use a technical term bollocks offer to help Theresa May with her deal strike a tone both constructive and ambiguous 
FEB25	Brexit is too important to be rushed. Let’s calm down and press ‘pause’	Delay delay delay Today s parliament well mirrors the nation It is implacably split It cannot make up its mind on how to leave the EU next month So it should just stop calm down and think  There is a sensible way forward into the two year transition period and it is called Theresa May s deal with the EU But since some Tory fundamentalists will not have it and hold her in an arm lock to move forward requires Labour cooperation EU negotiators are at a loss as to why such cooperation has not been forthcoming The answer is that Labour s Jeremy Corbyn is as much an anarchist as the Tory fundamentalists So there is stalemate Hence the wisdom of delay A decision has been made to leave the EU Every bit of evidence from business and trade to opinion polls and lobbyists shows a desire to maintain frictionless trade at least in goods and services with a future Europe It is equally plain that MPs have shown that finding such a compromise is beyond them The House of Commons will stand with the Rump Parliament as among the worst in history 
FEB25	How big tobacco keeps cancer rates high in countries like mine	Caring for people with cancer in Bangladesh as I do every day should be getting easier After all we ve had a decade long economic boom with extreme poverty rates halved This in turn has led to dramatic health benefits with large reductions in maternal and child mortality  So why aren t we seeing similar improvements in cancer 
FEB25	A huge land grab is threatening India’s tribal people. They need global help	About million indigenous people in India are in danger of being evicted from forests that their ancestors have lived in for millennia This grave injustice follows a shocking supreme court ruling that rides roughshod over the rights of India s indigenous people known as Adivasi or tribals  According to the census these tribal people number million almost of the country s then billion population It is the largest indigenous population in any country in the world occupying of India s geographical terrain 
FEB25	Don't trust the adults in the room on climate change	There s an inspiring new slogan gaining traction among venerated pundits and politicians of a certain age that claim steadfast commitment to the cause of stopping catastrophic climate change Get off my lawn  Most recently California senator Dianne Feinstein scolded a group of middle schoolers with the group Youth v Apocalypse who had joined the Sunrise Movement to call on Feinstein to back a resolution in the Senate supporting a Green New Deal In a now infamous exchange Feinstein barked that I know what I m doing and that she has been doing this for years so they better just bugger off and let the adults work To be fair the video was edited to comply with Twitter s content guidelines In the full clip she also offers them an internship 
FEB25	Homeless people need a home first, support second	As news breaks of the scarily high numbers of homeless people arriving in British hospitals with diseases we thought we d left in the past such as tuberculosis there s yet more soul searching about what can be done to help So what do homeless people really need It sounds naive and obvious but the answer is housing They need homes more than anything else Rough sleepers especially urgently need a permanent roof over their head as of right  Recently I have been sofa surfing It was more difficult than I can really explain I endured daily insecurity often not knowing where I would stay that night I applied successfully to be housed and have now been offered a home Because that is what I needed it doesn t take a genius to work out that homeless people need some sort of a home 
FEB25	Deportation for being single? This shows the real bigotry gay people face	Last week it was revealed that a year old man faces deportation to Malaysia because Home Office officials and a tribunal judge refuse to believe he is gay Yew Fook Sam known as Sam came out two years ago and spent months in Harmondsworth immigration removal centre He arrived in the UK in after his wife found out he had been having sex with ladyboys in Thailand and left him  The Home Office has suggested the fact that Sam does not have a boyfriend raises suspicions about the legitimacy of his asylum claim leading to a rejection of his claim His lack of sexual partners lent weight to their suspicions 
FEB26	Another referendum has edged closer. With Labour behind it, remain can win	No unnamed Labour source can mask what s happened and no professional Corbyn sceptics can derail it There is now a real prospect of another referendum Labour has committed to several parliamentary manoeuvres including one final stab at its own Brexit which will certainly fail another to support Yvette Cooper s attempt to push no deal further into the realm of destructive fantasy where it belongs and a vote on an amendment demanding that any Brexit deal approved by the Commons must be ratified in a public referendum In that public vote Labour will campaign to remain in the EU   Sources within Labour continue to deny this new reality even as its senior frontbenchers have announced it It s a disgrace one told me that unelected unsourced voices are briefing against Labour s frontbench If they want to speak for the Labour party a staffer said they should stand for the Labour party The position as it stands now is not the seismic shift some suggest It is a continuation of the policy adopted at Labour s party conference last September And credit for it belongs with the grassroots of the Labour party 
FEB26	What do Labour MPs think of the party’s shift on a second Brexit vote?	As the dust settles on Labour s announcement this week major problems emerge The first is the belief that you can game the system from a desk in Westminster to get the outcome you want When significant numbers of voters want to leave without a deal at all a choice between May s deal or remain is not democratic MPs rightly want to avoid no deal but to pretend we can settle the will of the people when a major popular option is simply left off the ballot paper treats people as if they are stupid They aren t Why aren t we learning  The second problem is the message this decision sends to the wider Labour party Apparently you can have more impact on Labour policy by leaving the party than by staying in it For a political party that seeks to govern effectively that is just not sustainable Above all none of these elite power plays deal with the reality already upon us In towns across Britain the ongoing uncertainty is already costing jobs There has been no effort to build consensus for a referendum in parliament let alone the public As a short term tactic it may help the party through a difficult week but look through a longer lens and the future looks much more fraught than it did a week ago for us and more importantly for the country 
FEB26	For the Independent Group, even Nando's is a photo opportunity	It is day eight of the existence of the Independent Group which is currently polling at according to YouGov The group has said it will hold off calling byelections for now and is not at this stage registered as a political party but in its early days it is of course keen to raise its profile This has led to a number of beautiful photo opportunities press conferences and broadcast appearances Let s take a look shall we  A photo of the group s first outing was tweeted last night by Chuka Umunna As so often with politicians trying to appeal to the people it was a food based photo opportunity 
FEB26	At last, Jeremy. Now Labour’s mission must be to prevent any Brexit	Sliding closer day by day you can hear the swelling excitement of the catastrophists at the thrilling prospect of a no deal smash out Into the unknown Hurl all the old certainties into the air and see what new patterns the broken fragments make on the floor Break all rules start again bring on the Brexit revolution  They take no heed when the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte cautioned them on Monday We are sleep walking into no deal scenario It s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you Wake up This is real European council president Donald Tusk and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar added warnings of a chaotic Brexit the grown ups trying to restrain the out of control teenagers punching each other up inside what purports to be the British government Since there can t be a reopening of the withdrawal agreement or a breaking of the backstop in the Irish border settlement Tusk says It s absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal So Theresa May tiptoes closer to the edge at serious risk of an accidental last minute plunge 
FEB26	If we’re heading for a hard Brexit, then we’re heading for a united Ireland	The year is and the prime minister David Lammy has just phoned the Sinn F in leader Mary Lou McDonald to congratulate her on victory in Ireland s unification referendum The deputy prime minister Nicola Sturgeon tweets that she hopes Scotland will follow suit in the referendum she secured at the last election for taking the Scottish National party into coalition with Labour Gerry Adams gives the dedication as a statue of Jacob Rees Mogg is unveiled in Crossmaglen The Tory leader Amber Rudd refuses to publicly blame her predecessor Boris Johnson for the breakup of the union but like the rest of what s left of the country she knows the truth  As anyone involved in the Good Friday agreement will tell you principles guarantee no deal It s why the current Brexit negotiations between the UK and itself are going so well Theresa May has red lines the European Research Group ERG has absolute red lines the Democratic Unionist party DUP has blood red lines and Jeremy Corbyn has blurred lines featuring Pharrell If they all hold firm we re heading for a hard Brexit And a united Ireland 
FEB26	This change in the law on organ donation will save hundreds of lives	Lives will be saved Hundreds of them every year That s the first and most important thing to say about the organ donation deemed consent bill which is expected to clear parliament today and become English law in  You may already know it as Max and Keira s Law after the young boy and girl whose story inspired politicians of all parties to get behind a change that will take us from having to opt in as an organ donor to having to opt out The government expects that as many as lives a year may be saved as Max Johnson s was 
FEB26	Gunboat diplomacy can only harm Britain’s relationship with China	A certain British politician s hyping up of the China threat in a recent speech struck a discordant note with the mainstream view in the UK that the country has a strong and constructive relationship with China It has led me to think about how much could be learned from the world class concerts by London s leading symphony orchestra that I have attended the beauty of which comes from the harmony of various sounds and the coordination between the players If the China UK relationship were compared to a symphony its success would depend on close coordination between the two countries and a firm resistance to interruptions and noises  In this symphony China and the UK rely on mutual respect and trust to keep us in tune and keep out the noise of enmity and confrontation 
FEB26	Am I the only one who’s terrified about the warm weather?	They were everywhere in London on the weekend The people in short sleeves or sandals The ones with sunglasses ostentatiously hanging from the front of their shirts or balanced on top of their heads The beer gardens and riverside pubs of the capital were heaving corner shops ran out of ice cream Outside it was C F  Monday was another warm day without a cloud in the sky and in the late afternoon the light took on a magical honey coloured hue It brought to mind one of those summer evenings you remember from childhood when you d be in the park all day and your parents let you stay out until bedtime and you felt like you were doing something deliciously naughty just by being there 
FEB26	Green Book’s Oscar shows Hollywood still doesn’t get race	It s now four years since the OscarsSoWhite hashtag put Hollywood movie making in the dock over its failure to acknowledge black achievement A lot has happened since Moonlight memorably won the best picture Oscar two years ago Mahershala Ali and Viola Davis have won supporting actor prizes and Jordan Peele has a best original screenplay gong Alongside them several other black artists have been nominated  But the OscarsSoWhite campaign was not meant merely as a tick box exercise in counting the number of nominations It was meant to make Hollywood rethink how it tells black people s stories and to reward black artists in the best possible way by giving them the chance to have their voices heard 
FEB26	Why was Alesha MacPhail killed? Perhaps we should stop asking	One aims not to weep on the job so I just about made it to the ladies after sitting through the pathologist s report The extent of the brutalisation endured by six year old Alesha MacPhail who was found dead on the Isle of Bute last July has not been reported by the media and I hope never will be But it goes some way to explaining why experienced police officers and scientific experts struggled to maintain their composure while giving evidence during the nine day trial of her killer  A year old boy was found guilty of Alesha s abduction rape and murder at the high court in Glasgow last Thursday The following day the trial judge agreed to lift the legal protection usually afforded to young people who are an accused victim or witness in criminal trials in Scotland and allowed Aaron Campbell to be named 
FEB27	Time is on the side of remainers amid Brexit’s smoke and mirrors	Ever since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June two things have been clear No serious attempt to reverse or even moderate the leave decision would ever be uncontroversial And any such attempt would require a degree of present legitimacy that could be acquired only in the light of new events and with the passing of time The question today is whether we have now reached such a moment  Very clearly there was no such moment in the immediate aftermath of the referendum It would have been too soon It would have been merely a spasm of outrage The voters had only just expressed their will No government could defy that decision even if it had wanted to Theresa May rightly grasped that she had become prime minister with a mandate to deliver on the vote 
FEB27	For Kashmir, there is only one strategy left to try: peace	In the summer of I was standing outside our ancestral home in Srinagar the capital of Indian administered Kashmir when I saw fighter jets roar past in the skies above me The Indian air force was carrying out sorties towards the mountainous district of Kargil to dislodge Pakistani militants and as we found out later Pakistani soldiers The troops had quietly occupied the snow capped peaks as part of a stealth operation masterminded by the then Pakistani general and future president Pervez Musharraf  The sight and sound of sophisticated military hardware provided a brief thrill but it soon turned into panic What if these bombers dropped their lethal cache on our home At night as I lay in bed I imagined our neighbourhood as rubble from which acrid smoke rose I imagined dear ones lying dead in homes and on streets like in war films I saw friends and myself as bodies in pools of blood It was terrifying 
FEB27	Labour doesn’t have zero tolerance of antisemitism if Chris Williamson is an MP	Credit to Chris Williamson for originality Not many have suggested that Labour s chief problem with antisemitism within its ranks is that it has been too apologetic to the Jewish community that it has shown an excess of concern and contrition Yet that is the argument the Derby North MP made to activists in Sheffield last week in footage obtained by the Yorkshire Post   I ve got to say I think our party s response has been partly responsible he said Because in my opinion we ve backed off far too much we ve given too much ground we ve been too apologetic 
FEB27	How not to infuriate your spouse: a short guide to the marriage lessons all couples need	When I heard that a hotel was offering groom courses for fiances with classes on making breakfast in bed and doing the laundry I immediately assumed it was in Japan where themed accommodation is commonplace But the training is actually being offered at Rosslea Hall in Argyll and Bute   We are calling all lovely brides to be before they say I do so they can whip their men into shape and cut the mothers apron strings said a spokeswoman for the establishment although it read like a Russian troll bot programmed to inflame men s rights activists And boy did they bite Are these women looking for a husband or a servant asked one Twitter user amid more generalised griping about how this was and how do people think men manage before they get married 
FEB27	Did Iran’s foreign minister ‘resign’ just to boost his influence at home?	Almost hours after the apparent resignation of Iran s foreign minister there are finally some answers to the many questions it raised For instance his superior president Hassan Rouhani has not accepted his resignation which is required under Iranian law Neither has the top decision maker in the country Ayatollah Ali Khamenei if one is to believe cryptic rumours of a high ranking official having told the diplomat that his exit is not expedient Mohammad Javad Zarif is back at work joining Rouhani in greeting a visiting Armenian delegation early on Wednesday  But there is still the question of why Zarif suddenly decided to go on Instagram at midnight on Monday expressing gratitude to the dear and honourable Iranian people for the last months and apologising for his incapacity to continue serving in his post Being under fire from all sides is certainly not a novelty for the ever smiling Iranian chief diplomat For years he has been adored and despised for essentially the same thing his ability to convincingly make Iran s case to the world in fluent English with a strong grasp of how western media works 
FEB27	Chagos Islanders remind us that Britain is a shameful coloniser, not a colony	At a time when Britain needs goodwill and great branding the world was reminded this week of our nation s shame courtesy of the families of people dispossessed from their Indian Ocean home in the s and s It s a shame that looms large in the history of the Chagos Islands an archipelago whose tiny size is in perfect contrast to the scale of the wrongs its people have witnessed They are wrongs stretching back centuries since the British formally acquired the islands from France as part of the bigger colony of Mauritius and forced slaves from Mozambique and Madagascar to work on British owned coconut plantations  Britain the colonial power is not quite the image its leaders are trying to project just now
FEB27	Student halls for all? That's not an answer to Britain’s housing crisis, it's a living nightmare	Due to a lack of affordable housing a new report suggests childless millennials should be offered living spaces that comprise a small bedroom with shower plus shared kitchens and living areas The report points to co living communities already springing up in London New York and Beijing which make it easier for people to interact with each other Let s call a spade a tool for digging our graves What they are talking about is living in student halls For the rest of your days  When you re young dorm life can be thrilling Listening to the pound of house music through plasterboard walls battling for space on the kitchen hob like it s Iwo Jima A part of growing up But that is the crucial aspect No one should be sentenced to live like this once they no longer have their photo on their travel card If normal sized homes will in future be offered only to couples with babies it is hard to not consider it a punishment for the childless The idea could be a sticking plaster for the housing crisis but a pint of vodka and Red Bull for the overpopulation crisis

FEB28	Trump’s a racist conman – and that’s the brand America bought	Shortly before November s midterm elections I interviewed a Donald Trump supporter coming out of a debate between three local candidates in a congressional race asking how she felt about the president s attitude to women I need to see the facts and the actual documentation she said I can t just do all this hearsay   What about when he says he personally grabs women and kisses them I prodded That was him saying that 
FEB28	‘White saviours’ belong in the 1980s. Let’s keep them there	Bare faced and clad in jeans clutching a rather uncertain looking black toddler on her hip Stacey Dooley stands beaming in the dust of a parched African landscape At first glance you could mistake it for a gap year snapshot destined to be pinned up somewhere in a student bedroom Dooley is of course one of the breakout stars of this year s Strictly Come Dancing and the picture was taken in Uganda where she is making a film for the upcoming Comic Relief Yet as with so many gap year experiences it isn t entirely easy to tell who is having the more emotionally rewarding time here the volunteer who feels privileged to have seen what they ve seen or the children they re actually supposed to be helping  Which is perhaps why the Labour MP David Lammy touched such a nerve when he responded to the image by tweeting that the world doesn t need any more white saviours or western do gooders flying in believing they are solving the developing world s problems while blissfully ignorant of the colonial baggage they carry 
FEB28	Parents: don't panic about Momo – worry about YouTube Kids instead	I first heard about Momo in my local parents WhatsApp group Someone had screenshotted a Facebook post about a creepy puppet that supposedly appeared in unsuspecting children s phone messages and spliced into YouTube videos dispensing advice on self harm and violent acts I reacted with suspicion this would hardly be the first time that something on Facebook turned out not to be true and the Momo challenge seemed a bit too on the nose too obviously sinister to be real  It turned out that Momo was indeed a hoax a viral shock story driven by a frightening image and well intentioned worry about children s safety online 
FEB28	Trump was out of his depth in Hanoi. This failure is his greatest flop yet	Donald Trump s self reverential style of personalised fly by the seat of your pants diplomacy just crashed and burned in Hanoi It is fitting perhaps that Vietnam scene of past American humiliations was the setting for the blunderer in chief s greatest flop Trump tried to wing it in nuclear talks with North Korea s more canny leader Kim Jong un and got what he deserved precisely nothing The summit like last year s effort in Singapore was a Trump vanity project and proved a labour in vain  In principle just about everybody including close neighbours South Korea China and Russia would like to see North Korea s nuclear arsenal brought under international supervision and preferably eliminated altogether To make such a mess of things given this exceptional consensus is a true measure of Trump s incomparable incompetence Yet this is barely a surprise It is entirely of a piece with his amateurish approach to key foreign policy challenges the world over 
FEB28	Excellence is overrated. Let’s embrace being good enough instead	We live in a society obsessed with being exceptional Whether it is as workers parents students lovers or cooks we are expected to be outstanding We must strive to be the best employee craft an outstanding body have an amazing relationship all while being exceptionally happy Even the most ordinary institutions also are expected to be nothing less than excellent Companies want to be world class schools have become academies of excellence and humble local GP surgeries strive to be outstanding Being good enough is seen as simply not good enough  Our quest to be excellent has many positive consequences but it also can be damaging Lionising excellence can create huge inequalities When high performers are showered with rewards the great mass of us who are average miss out This can spark resentment in those who feel that they don t measure up But the obsession with being exceptional does just harm the great mass of average people It can also do damage to people at the top as well 
FEB28	The environment was once a safe space for activism in Iran. No longer	In early nine environmental experts and activists from the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation PWHF were arrested in Iran Disregarding their international reputation for tireless efforts to protect Iran s endangered Asiatic cheetahs the country s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC accused them of being agents of the CIA Mossad and MI The IRGC which acts as an alternative hardline centre of power in Iran claimed that PWHF was using environmental activism as a cover for a mission to disrupt national security It accused them of collecting sensitive environmental information and using camera traps to monitor Iran s ballistic missile programme  A few weeks later one of them Kavous Seyed Emami died suspiciously in an alleged suicide at Tehran s notorious Evin prison His grieving wife Maryam Mombeini is still banned from leaving the country to join her two sons in Canada The rest of the group are still in temporary detention Four of them have been charged with spreading corruption on the earth a crime that can carry the death penalty The rest face serious security charges for cooperation with hostile governments and acts against national security Their page indictment was finally disclosed to them in a trial behind closed doors that began a few weeks ago 
FEB28	The fight for EU citizens’ rights could become another Windrush	As theatre Brexit loses out to drying paint It is mostly excruciating Time and again we are promised a high noon shoot out with cabinet walkouts and armies of pitchfork wielding Tory rebels but then anti climax the real drama happens behind the scenes as our flawed heroine surrenders leaving a damp squib finale in the Commons It s like the Richard II scene when the king calls off mortal combat between two nobles that doesn t end well Today s virtually Brexit free front pages tell the story no fighting is boring boring boring  Yet what happened this week in Brexit has been momentous even if we were denied catharsis Battle honours go to Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin demanding the Commons right to vote down a no deal and extend article They have saved the nation from the utter catastrophe revealed in the no deal documents Anna Soubry prised from the cabinet Backing for the Cooper Letwin amendment from an unprecedented ministers threatening resignation forced Queen Theresa to concede she is ordering her troops to vote for a contradiction to her every Brexit word so far 
FEB28	Nadine Dorries’ TV junk-food binge: now that’s a hard act to swallow	MPs should not go on reality TV The results are conclusive George Galloway shouldn t have gone on Celebrity Big Brother years later the image of Galloway pretending to lick milk from a bowl held by Rula Lenska another contestant still overshadows in most minds anything else he has ever done  Penny Mordaunt shouldn t have gone on the diving show Splash like it or not her political legacy will now include one spectacular belly flop lovingly captured and replayed in slow motion from four angles during the show And Nadine Dorries shouldn t have gone on I m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here for which she was suspended from the Tory party just a few days before she was humiliatingly booted out of the jungle itself 
FEB28	Ivanka Trump occupies a different reality from most working women	Responding to a question about Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez s proposed Green New Deal and its call for a federal job guarantee Ivanka Trump this week offered sage wisdom I ve spent a lot of time traveling around this country over the last four years she said People want to work for what they get So I think that this idea of a guaranteed minimum is not something most people want  The statement sparked outrage including from Ocasio Cortez She tweeted in response As a person who actually worked for tips hourly wages in my life instead of having to learn about it nd hand I can tell you that most people want to be paid enough to live 
FEB28	The Romans took their graffiti seriously – especially the phalluses	Leave an image of a penis up long enough and it will become part of our national heritage The rush to record inscriptions made in a Cumbrian quarry in AD has cast a spotlight on the rich legacy of graffiti in Britain by the Romans Masons sourcing stone blocks for the nearby fortifications of Hadrian s Wall carved a date a phallus and the caricature of an officer They were not alone in leaving their mark Hunting for images of phalluses is one of the great pleasures of walking the wall Look attentively enough and they can be found repeatedly along its line  Graffiti was always a mark of Roman life In Rome the right to draw it was widely regarded as a civic prerogative In a society rigidly stratified by wealth and rank it provided an essential safety valve Slogans scrawled across the city served up to everyone who could read such a relentless dishing of dirt that people fretted that its sheer weight might bring walls crashing down Even the illiterate would defecate on the monuments of those who had offended them Soldiers by virtue of the oath of duty they swore when signing up to the army had abdicated the rights that were the essence of citizenship but many were the legionaries who sought to ease their boredom by scratching doodles on quarry walls Tiles stamped with a unit s name would often bear graffiti Ferocious though military discipline invariably was it did not serve to iron out all the habits of civilian life 
MAR1	Chris Grayling is the Berk du Soleil as Farage maps out a road to nowhere	Say what you like about Chris Grayling and I m about to but his face at least has the decency to get it No matter what bullish self justification is coming out of the transport secretary s mouth the face knows the truth Look at literally any photo of Chris Grayling honestly go to Google Images now and you will see the eyes of a man whose inner monologue is telling him right at that second that this one was a follow through Now it s just a question of butching it out till he s off camera  As I write this Chris is on a hat trick On the very morning it emerged that Grayling s probation reforms from his era as justice secretary will cost the taxpayer at least m it also emerged that the government has been forced to pay m to Eurotunnel over his no deal Brexit ferry fiasco By the time I have finished typing Chris could have lost a battle of wits with the A or de invented trains If you want to put how expensive Chris Grayling is into some kind of meaningful perspective he s cost more than new Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers entire transfer budget 
MAR1	We now know the great prize of Brexit: becoming Trump’s prey	Shall we take a gentle amble down memory lane a nostalgic trip back to the heady days of the referendum campaign of So many sweet promises were murmured into our ear it can be hard to remember them all No talk then of shelling out m to settle a legal case with Eurotunnel or ferry contracts for companies with no ferries or spending billions to prepare for the cataclysm of a no deal departure No back then it was all cash bonanzas of m a week and assurances that Brexit would be smooth and seamless the Europeans needed us more than we needed them after all so that by the time June came around voting leave seemed like a painless risk free option Not only was there nothing to lose there was so much to gain And top of the list was a big shiny trade deal with the United States of America   Within two years vowed the soon to be Brexit secretary David Davis a few short weeks after the vote we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU A deal with the US along with China would give us a trade area almost twice the size of the EU he gushed apparently unaware that under European law it was illegal for a Britain that had not formally exited the EU to so much as enter talks with those nations let alone sign an agreement with them 
MAR1	Society is breaking down. Every day a new horror arises and I’m terrified	How many things is it possible to be scared of at the same time I am asking for a friend Actually for all my friends Indeed everyone I ever met Every day a new horror arises Sunbathing in February Well that s not normal is it Police tape up again Another stabbing Another young woman missing Then various Apocalypse Now style scenarios played out on Twitter by the minute Donald Trump excusing more murder and torture People I admire dying way too young Bodies in sleeping bags on the street Camps in China Kashmir People shooting at the face of Shamima Begum for fun and on and on it goes  I used to watch a lot of horror films Then I stopped and I don t really know why or perhaps I do I used to think in a mindless way that some sort of technology would come along and solve everything and now I feel I don t know anything despite the endless flow of information that technology enables 
MAR1	Long before Shamima Begum, Muslim women were targets	What progress if any have we made in the last decade when it comes to our understanding of Muslim women I found myself asking this question when the BBC s Bodyguard won best new drama last month at the National Television awards having amassed million viewers including of the audience share for its finale  Spoiler alert the Muslim woman at the heart of the story starts out as the groomed victim of a brutal jihadi husband but by the end of the season her character is unmasked as the violent terrorist 
MAR1	Right to Rent’s demise should spell the end for the hostile environment	Seven years after the then home secretary Theresa May announced her intention to create a really hostile environment for undocumented residents in the UK the high court has declared one of her flagship schemes to be unlawful  The Right to Rent scheme which threatens landlords with unlimited fines and up to five years in jail if their tenants can t produce all the right immigration paperwork has been found to encourage racial discrimination against anybody with a foreign sounding name or a foreign passport The court has found that the government ignored evidence of these risks and in turn that it failed to provide any evidence the scheme delivers anything but misery and state sanctioned hostility targeted predominantly at minorities people of colour and people who just happen to have been born somewhere else 
MAR1	Justin Trudeau’s disgrace is like watching a unicorn get run over	For Canadian liberals or indeed any of us who cling to outdated ideas such as good governance and liberal democratic values it was like watching a unicorn get flattened by a lorry Earlier this week Canada s undeniably gorgeous halo bound Liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau proud feminist defender of minority rights advocate for transparency inclusivity and decency and prince of the one armed push up was morally eviscerated over four hours of astonishing testimony by his own former attorney general and justice minister Jody Wilson Raybould a woman of great integrity and a rare Indigenous Canadian cabinet minister  To recap Wilson Raybould was demoted to the position of veterans affairs minister in a cabinet shuffle earlier this year Shortly thereafter reports emerged that she and her staff had been subjected to a sustained campaign by the prime minister s office over the handling of corruption charges against SNC Lavalin a Montreal based engineering giant accused of bribing Libyan officials It happens to be a large employer in Quebec Trudeau s home state the prime minister s office made sure to remind her of that the job losses such charges might cause and the fact that it was an election year There was a string of increasingly irate calls texts and emails Still Wilson Raybould held her ground The prime minister lost the battle Then she was demoted 
MAR1	There is no magic ‘stop Brexit’ button for Labour. There never has been	The problem with recommending good options for Labour on Brexit with regards to their electoral prospects is that none exist Here is a party whose members and existing voters supported remain but which cannot win a general election without leave voters The only six seats lost by Labour in heavily opted for Brexit in the referendum such as the ex mining community of Mansfield and post industrial Stoke on Trent South And of the top Tory held target seats without which Labour cannot form a majority voted leave As long as Brexit dominates and defines political debate Labour will suffer Its popular domestic policies are sidelined  Corbynism is an insurgent project with a clear sense of the people versus the elite at its heart but in order to keep its electoral coalition together it has been forced to triangulate on the most important political issue of our time sapping it of the radical energy it thrives on Brexit has unleashed a culture war too which divides and polarises Labour s electoral coalition 
MAR1	Art rarely touches on disabled siblings – that’s why a new play made me cry	I don t often cry when I go to the theatre I certainly don t often have to dig my fingernails into my palm in order to keep my feelings under control but that is what happened during a performance of Christina Murdock s one woman play Dangerous Giant Animals next on at The Vaults in London between and March Described as a darkly comedic show about finding your voice amid your sister s screams it tells the story of Christina s San Francisco childhood with her younger sister who has atypical Rett syndrome speech apraxia and severe epilepsy She loves the spotlight and movies like Jurassic Park and Jaws hence the title of the show Murdock tells me  The play resonated with me because as many Guardian readers will know from my writing my own brother has severe autism I encountered Murdock s work for the first time last year at a meeting for the charity Sibs for brothers and sisters of disabled siblings and adults where I was making a speech The day was an intensely moving experience because it was the first time that I had ever sat in a room with people whose experiences were very much like mine who understood profoundly the emotions that I was describing as the sibling of a vulnerable person lurching between protectiveness and fury sadness and hilarity heartbreak and love 
MAR1	I backed Sadiq Khan – but now his racist minicab policy has betrayed me	They say you can get used to anything in time but I am not sure that is true Some things in life such as the loss of a loved one we must find the courage to accept Others like discrimination and exploitation we must find the courage to fight Two weeks ago I lost my dear son Hadi to leukaemia at and somehow my family and I must find a way to grieve and carry on though I doubt we will ever get over it  I have worked as a minicab driver for Uber since Hadi first became ill The job provided much needed flexibility while my wife and I juggled lengthy stays at Great Ormond Street hospital and tried to keep things as normal as possible for Hadi s two sisters at home I borrowed money to buy a vehicle applied for a Transport for London TfL minicab licence and went to work trusting that I would be paid fairly Shortly after Uber dropped fare prices to grab market share and TfL flooded the streets doubling the number of minicab licences in a few short years Now there are just too many drivers chasing too little work leading to too much congestion and too little pay The upshot is that drivers like me work as much as hours each week to earn just per hour 
MAR1	Democracy has failed in Nigeria when voters no longer care who wins	You know a democracy is in trouble when two out of three voters don t bother to turn up for a presidential election In Nigeria s just concluded presidential poll incumbent Muhammadu Buhari was re elected with the backing of million voters compared to the million votes his main rival Atiku Abubakar was able to amass  Although this gave Buhari of the total votes cast in a country with a population of close to million including more than million registered voters million votes hardly qualifies as a huge mandate The voter turnout was down from in the presidential election and way down from the turnout in In fact turnout for Nigerian presidential elections has been dropping at an alarmingly consistent rate since So why are increasingly fewer Nigerians feeling the need to vote in elections that decide the most powerful political office 
MAR2	The Satanic Verses is still creating monsters, even new book-burners	Sometimes you just have to shake your head to clear it and look again Did he really write that So it was when I read a review in the Independent by Sean O Grady of The Satanic Verses Years On a BBC documentary on the Rushdie affair and its legacy  But yes in the last paragraph he really wrote Rushdie s silly childish book should be banned under today s anti hate legislation It s no better than racist graffiti on a bus stop I wouldn t have it in my house out of respect to Muslim people and contempt for Rushdie and because it sounds quite boring I d be quite inclined to burn it in fact 
MAR2	Thought for the day: is it time to silence BBC preachers who keep women down?	And welcome to the amoral maze where our dilemma of the week is just how insufferable does a spiritual leader have to be before he or she becomes unqualified to preach at the general public Or to put it another way why should the church have a monopoly on excommunication  The question is not emphatically restricted to the case of the ubiquitous prelate blogger and speaker Giles Fraser although with his recent blog chastising women who fail to stay near home for the future convenience of incontinent fathers he has done more than most to focus attention on the sort of qualities that should ideally distinguish a Thought for the Day contributor from say Jacob Rees Mogg 
MAR2	André Previn, the classical maestro who knew the value of pop culture	In Andr Previn was so famous that he had his own chatshow on BBC In one episode wearing an expensive looking brown suede safari jacket with big collar and clutching his oversize glasses in his hands he introduces the studio audience to Jonathan Miller They discuss Miller s new production of The Merchant of Venice the director going on to predict the slow disintegration of English theatre  It s a real spirit of the age moment There is no apology for the elevated tone of their conversation the format is simple two cultural polymaths ruminating on the arts on primetime television 
MAR2	Ariana Grande is the right person to lead Manchester’s Pride party	Ariana Grande headlining this year s Manchester Pride seems on the surface as if it should be a perfect fit After the horrendous tragedy of the Arena bombing in the singer has a unique and close connection to the city She is one of the biggest pop stars in the world if not the biggest there are so many numbers on her Spotify or YouTube that they look like the answer to a final grade University Challenge maths question She has a back catalogue bursting with irresistible pop hits  Yet this is and the idea of any kind of announcement occurring without any kind of backlash immediately following it is as old fashioned as me wondering why Grande can t use capital letters on her album tracklistings In this case the controversy came in two parts Manchester Pride almost doubled the cost of tickets this year organisers claim that it s a new event and can t be compared with last year s pricing When this was first revealed at the end of January many objected to one more indication that another Pride was being further commodified and made more exclusive Pride was a protest so the history teaches us It wasn t about booze brands issuing limited edition rainbow bottles and VIP wristbands it was about fighting for one s right to exist You can see why charging people to celebrate that history might stick in the teeth 
MAR2	Remember the days when we weren’t freaked out by freak weather?	There was a time on these temperate islands when freak weather thrilled us with its bouts of exceptional heat wind rain or snow Unless you were at sea in a gale fear was a rare emotion Even in when the so called Great Storm hurtled through southern England and northern France on a night in mid October it was possible to be more awed than afraid Crashing branches and tumbling slates woke people but when they turned to each other in bed it was to exclaim about the wind s strength Would you just listen to that rather than to see it as a portent of something larger or more terrible Thirty odd years later most of the people who lived through the Great Storm remember it mainly because a BBC weatherman got the forecast wrong  In England the wind gusted at mph that night and at least people were killed on both sides of the Channel But unless you were among the bereaved or had a tall oak fall through the roof nobody felt anxiety or despair There was no prevailing gloom 
MAR2	The Tories’ response to raging Islamophobia? Turn a blind eye	On Thursday s BBC Politics Live show the Conservative MP Henry Smith dismissed claims of Islamophobia in the Conservative party citing the fact he personally had not seen any anti Muslim discrimination  Yet we have a fair idea as to just how Islamophobia has taken hold among the party s support base and how its leadership is responding to such attitudes 
MAR2	Chris Grayling is the Berk du Soleil as Farage maps out a road to nowhere	Say what you like about Chris Grayling and I m about to but his face at least has the decency to get it No matter what bullish self justification is coming out of the transport secretary s mouth the face knows the truth Look at literally any photo of Chris Grayling honestly go to Google Images now and you will see the eyes of a man whose inner monologue is telling him right at that second that this one was a follow through Now it s just a question of butching it out till he s off camera  As I write this Chris is on a hat trick On the very morning it emerged that Grayling s probation reforms from his era as justice secretary will cost the taxpayer at least m it also emerged that the government has been forced to pay m to Eurotunnel over his no deal Brexit ferry fiasco By the time I have finished typing Chris could have lost a battle of wits with the A or de invented trains If you want to put how expensive Chris Grayling is into some kind of meaningful perspective he s cost more than new Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers entire transfer budget 
MAR2	We now know the great prize of Brexit: becoming Trump’s prey	Shall we take a gentle amble down memory lane a nostalgic trip back to the heady days of the referendum campaign of So many sweet promises were murmured into our ear it can be hard to remember them all No talk then of shelling out m to settle a legal case with Eurotunnel or ferry contracts for companies with no ferries or spending billions to prepare for the cataclysm of a no deal departure No back then it was all cash bonanzas of m a week and assurances that Brexit would be smooth and seamless the Europeans needed us more than we needed them after all so that by the time June came around voting leave seemed like a painless risk free option Not only was there nothing to lose there was so much to gain And top of the list was a big shiny trade deal with the United States of America   Within two years vowed the soon to be Brexit secretary David Davis a few short weeks after the vote we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU A deal with the US along with China would give us a trade area almost twice the size of the EU he gushed apparently unaware that under European law it was illegal for a Britain that had not formally exited the EU to so much as enter talks with those nations let alone sign an agreement with them 
MAR2	Society is breaking down. Every day a new horror arises and I’m terrified	How many things is it possible to be scared of at the same time I am asking for a friend Actually for all my friends Indeed everyone I ever met Every day a new horror arises Sunbathing in February Well that s not normal is it Police tape up again Another stabbing Another young woman missing Then various Apocalypse Now style scenarios played out on Twitter by the minute Donald Trump excusing more murder and torture People I admire dying way too young Bodies in sleeping bags on the street Camps in China Kashmir People shooting at the face of Shamima Begum for fun and on and on it goes  I used to watch a lot of horror films Then I stopped and I don t really know why or perhaps I do I used to think in a mindless way that some sort of technology would come along and solve everything and now I feel I don t know anything despite the endless flow of information that technology enables 
MAR2	Long before Shamima Begum, Muslim women were targets	What progress if any have we made in the last decade when it comes to our understanding of Muslim women I found myself asking this question when the BBC s Bodyguard won best new drama last month at the National Television awards having amassed million viewers including of the audience share for its finale  Spoiler alert the Muslim woman at the heart of the story starts out as the groomed victim of a brutal jihadi husband but by the end of the season her character is unmasked as the violent terrorist 
MAR3	The Trump/Cohen revelations are awful. So why am I yawning?	There is an old Arabic joke about corruption A thieving government minister is fired by the head of state and replaced but the people who have long suffered under the minister don t rejoice When they re asked why they re not celebrating one explains to the confused president Yes he was a thief but he stole until he d taken his fill The new guy will be hungry  Growing up under authoritarian regimes in the Arab world was great for the jokes It was always dark humour but that made it easier to accept the inevitabilities of living under a dictatorship than trying to fight them There were so many violations of rights on a daily basis that survival required adaptation It was exhausting and futile to be permanently scandalised And so we spared our energy and joked instead 
MAR3	Could Gina Miller’s next move compel the EU to delay Brexit?	In a crisis imagination is as important as commitment and Gina Miller has both As March hoves ominously into view the investment manager who successfully challenged the government s authority to invoke article without parliamentary approval is making another significant intervention in the Brexit process more subtle this time but no less worthy of political and legal attention  Having used the courts in to give parliament a say in the triggering of article Miller is now I gather seeking to reframe the way in which Westminster and Brussels contemplate the possibility of its extension Armed with a legal opinion written by Kieron Beal QC and three other senior lawyers the co founder of the pro remain campaign Lead Not Leave will argue that the EU council of ministers could itself unilaterally extend the article deadline 
MAR3	Corporate-branded ‘communities’ prove you can’t buy taste	I find reading about rich people very depressing Not because I am jealous they have so much money but because I am frustrated they have so little imagination Take a look at the recent New York Times piece that says a growing number of wealthy home buyers are choosing to live in corporate branded communities Not just any branded communities mind you but luxury ones from the likes of Porsche Armani and Bulgari  These expensive branded buildings have proliferated in the past few years a trend that seems to be driven by the having more money than they know what to do with Slapping a fancy brand name on a residential development can add a price premium of to according to the upmarket estate agency Savills A report on the sector by another agency Knight Frank notes that there is a direct correlation between wealth creation and demand for branded residences 
MAR3	Why did the BBC let Andrew Neil combust?	Last week supposedly unprecedented spring wildfires raged across dry bushy and exposed areas On Monday having dealt with serious incidents at Saddleworth Moor and Hundred Acre Wood teams of specialised firefighters also attended the small piece of Shredded Wheat that lives on top of Andrew Neil s head  Dozens of grateful weevils were saved from certain death in the breakfast bisc inferno by the firefighters and rehoused in temporary accommodation in the nearby clumps of Andrew Neil s ear hair while his nostrils became emergency treatment centres for scorched pests 
MAR3	Labour’s balance of terror has shifted. Now Corbynites have cause to be fearful	Until recently Tom Watson was a shrunken figure in every sense Labour s deputy leader had become more famous for his weight shedding diet than for the influence he wielded in his party He had earned the undying enmity of the Corbynites for attempting to persuade their hero to quit as leader and they schemed to replace him as deputy with someone more pliable Labour moderates had given up on him for failing to deliver on reassurances that he could fix the party Whenever he made public criticism of antisemitism or entryism by the far left a gang of Corbynites in the shadow cabinet would be organised to verbally batter him at the body s next meeting  At last autumn s conference in Liverpool the deputy leader was such a diminished figure that he was denied a speaking slot from the platform and all he could do was pretend to be happy about it 
MAR3	Kashmir is in a perilous state because of India’s pivot to nationalism	On Friday the four day long military flare up between Pakistan and India began winding down with Islamabad handing back an Indian air force pilot taken captive by the Pakistan army two days earlier He had been shot down in the first aerial fighter combat between the two South Asian enemies since a full scale war in  Yet forgotten in the Indian euphoria is the fact that Kashmir where the deaths of security men in a suicide bomb attack last month triggered this latest crisis continues to simmer Even as the pilot walked free four policemen died in an encounter with Kashmiri militants 
MAR3	Is the world ready for lab-grown meat?	Do people want to eat lab grown meat A new study for which I was a peer reviewer is the first to rigorously assess consumer interest in plant based and clean meat also known as lab grown or cultured meat in the US India and China The study found high levels of acceptance in all three countries and significantly higher acceptance in India and China where and respectively reported being at least somewhat likely to purchase clean meat  Chris Bryant the lead author on the study in the journal Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems told me Across the world s three most populous countries consumers want plant based and clean meat The opportunities for innovators to change the meat industry in these countries are there 
MAR3	Europe can only give us more time if we have a clear Brexit plan	President Macron is right Any extension of the article process should be for a reason It should be to eliminate the blind Brexit Theresa May proposes But first her deal must be defeated  The Brexiters will fall into line with her deal because they believe they can win the subsequent battle and impose a hard Brexit The soft Brexit supporters and those who want a fresh referendum should unite to insist Britain knows the direction of its future relationship with Europe before we leave We have learned a lot during this Brexit debacle It has been a masterclass in political risk We are now in a state of confusion in which even those whose day job is to study the details find it hard to explain 
MAR3	At last we are turning away from our mania for hiving off public services	The Tredegar Workmen s Medical Aid Society was a mini self help medical co operative established in the late th century on the principle that anyone in Tredegar should get free health as they needed It is always credited as giving Nye Bevan who worked there and sat on its board the inspiration for the NHS But it also inspired the author AJ Cronin who also worked there to write his bestseller The Citadel  It was this book more than any other that persuaded the English middle class that far from socialist a national health system based on the same co operative principles of mutuality was what everyone needed Health was a lottery and those unfortunate to suffer illness should receive free help from in effect a vastly upscaled version of what worked in Tredegar 
MAR3	As immigration from outside Europe rises, hucksters foment racial hatred	If you want to understand the future look at an experiment conducted at Manchester University on whether wealth should be redistributed from rich to poor A majority thought it should and showed robust support for the proposition that money should be spent on educational opportunities for working class children  This is real politics is it not Tax and spend and redistribution powered the debates of the th century The culture wars that fill the airwaves today seem an ephemeral American import in comparison America was the aberration of th century western politics Unlike European societies it never found the social solidarity to develop a mass social democratic party As a nation of immigrants poisoned by the original sin of slavery the US was concerned with race politics while we were concerned with class 
MAR4	Dear Europe, Brexit is a lesson for all of us: it’s time for renewal	Citizens of Europe if I am taking the liberty of addressing you directly it is not only in the name of the history and values that unite us but because time is of the essence A few weeks from now the European elections will be decisive for the future of our continent  Never since the second world war has Europe been so essential Yet never has Europe been in such danger Brexit stands as the symbol of that It symbolises the crisis of a Europe that has failed to respond to its peoples need for protection from the major shocks of the modern world It also symbolises the European trap The trap lies not in being part of the European Union the trap is in the lie and the irresponsibility that can destroy it Who told the British people the truth about their post Brexit future Who spoke to them about losing access to the EU market Who mentioned the risks to peace in Ireland of restoring the border Retreating into nationalism offers nothing it is rejection without an alternative And this is the trap that threatens the whole of Europe the anger mongers backed by fake news promise anything and everything 
MAR4	The anti-EU lies are back to exploit Britain’s weak spot again	 Just got through reading the Lisbon treaty OMG and Why is no one talking about the Lisbon treaty that comes into force in Suddenly it s viral If you see this everywhere online you may puzzle how the treaty s dense pages have become such hot reading across Facebook Twitter and Reddit Look for example at what one now deleted tweet claims of what staying in the EU means Just been reading some of the Lisbon treaty very worrying By we lose our veto control over fishing agriculture and more Also by all countries must adopt the euro How can Theresa May and our MPs want to keep us in such an appalling club  This new wave of fakery about the Lisbon treaty is a useful warning about what the remain cause faces
MAR4	Liz ‘the Truss’: truly a politician for our times	The rumour is that Liz Truss likes to call herself the Truss while speaking to colleagues a horrifying echo of when Sajid Javid started calling himself the Saj Since there is no surer way to discredit a politician indeed human being than to alert the public to their self aggrandisement it sounds almost too bad to be true It might have been invented by a hostile colleague trying to stain the Treasury secretary and also associate her with surgical dressings and muscle strain  But is that reading too much into it Could she simply be that bad Javid incidentally denies the third personning which considering all the other rhetorical behaviour he ll exhibit right out in the open illustrates just how damaging a slur it is Only one thing is certain the constant stream of malevolent tittle tattle designed to discredit everyone named and unnamed is the only element of government business still functioning 
MAR4	Enough is enough: Michael Jackson's music is dead to me now	Nothing should interfere with my personal listening pleasure Nothing at all Great art is often made by terrible people These truths I have held to be self evident Certainly as a woman you have to get over yourself a lot of the time because the canon of literature of cinema of art is the canon of lauded misogyny and in order to function critically you have to inhabit it  Hannah Gadsby s wonderful comedy show Nanette includes a takedown of Picasso but it doesn t work for me I like Picasso too much I can t not look at his paintings Just as I can t not wonder at the words of William Burroughs who killed his wife accidentally we are meant to believe 
MAR4	May’s Brexit bung to the north is pathetic. It changes nothing	Theresa May s bung is like Donald Trump s wall You give me my Northern Ireland border deal she says to Labour and I will give your people oodles of cash Except that May has blown it She has promised Labour MPs in the Midlands and north bn but they have not promised her the deal She is apparently relying on the kindness of their hearts How stupid is that She is even offering them a similar deal on workers rights again with no reciprocity She showered a billion on the DUP and now look how it treats her Will she not learn  The northern bung should be judged on two levels May desperately needs her deal and anything might be thought worth it that gets us through the current political chaos But it is also proof of the cancer that hard Brexit has brought to modern government The handout offers bn to deprived regions on a needs basis This appears to be a mild adjustment of the last austerity based formula of grants to councils May says it is because prosperity has been unfairly spread between north and south How was it fair when the formula was calculated last autumn yet not now As for the additional m it is not unconditional It will go to lucky towns that can bid for local partnership or city challenge projects 
MAR4	The world is in a bad way. Students need the skills to fix it	At a time when every week s weird weather seems to bring fresh news of how manmade climate change could destroy everything we know and love it seems almost trite to point out that the challenges we face as a society are vast and complex Clearly the next generation will need to be equipped to tackle them but assuming that tackling them means preventing them as opposed to say riding out the catastrophe with a mixture of improvised weaponry and martial arts skills it is unclear where if anywhere they might acquire the relevant skills  In the UK at least higher education is overly focused on narrow degree courses where institutional prestige often trumps the value of what students are taught This reflects an academic research community in which various perverse incentives have created a climate where the arts and humanities have become overspecialised often to the point of irrelevance and where the whole integrity of the social and life sciences is threatened by the replication crisis 
MAR4	The unanswered question: why do antisemites think Labour is the party for them?	I had a conversation last week with a Jewish woman from a family of Holocaust survivors and people murdered by the Nazis She has been a Labour party member for nearly years It feels like being in an abusive relationship she said A year ago she made an official complaint to the party about what she has experienced but aside from an acknowledgment she has heard nothing During debates in her constituency general committee about issues of antisemitism she has been jeered by as many as people for trying to point out the gravity of the issue At one party event about hate speech she was prevented from speaking Some of her supposed comrades have said that claims of antisemitism have been invented to undermine Jeremy Corbyn she knows of at least one suggestion that such accusations are the work of Israel  She told me that the people responsible seem to fall into two broad groups a belligerent and relentless hard core including a few people who seem to be attracted to conspiracy theories and an element who seem much less zealous but are swept up by a kind of tribalism A lot of my Jewish friends have left Labour she told me I feel that I have to stay and fight But I m on the brink 
MAR4	Lucía, 11, was raped. Then Argentina’s church conspired to deny her an abortion	Luc a is not called Luc a Her name is the only fiction in this spine chilling true story But we must call her Luc a to protect her identity  Luc a is years old Four years ago a court in Argentina placed Luc a in her grandmother s care after her mother s boyfriend reportedly abused her two older sisters However Luc a was not safe at her grandmother s home either she was raped by her grandmother s boyfriend and became pregnant 
MAR4	Instagram is stripping its devotees of their basic humanity	Walking around my city recently I ve been experiencing an odd and dislocated feeling of vertigo as though the world is veering on a precipice and without wanting to sound too dramatic we are approaching what pavement preachers refer to as the end times My husband says it s just a symptom of getting older but I m convinced my environment has something to do with it  Day by day aspects of the city have started to blend into one another the same chains popping up to replace local businesses the flimsy looking so called affordable housing the upscale student accommodation blocks with their own cinemas all becoming uncannily homogenous These act as a backdrop to the tents and mattresses of so many desperate homeless people Things just feel wrong 
MAR4	Mentally ill people pay higher bills – and banks are partly to blame	Money management is not easy at the best of times Choosing the right deal setting up standing orders checking you re not over or underpaying switching providers the whole thing can be overwhelming This is doubly true for those with mental health problems and a new report from Citizens Advice has exposed just how difficult it can be It found that when poor mental health reduces someone s ability to carry out daily activities it can end up costing them to a year  The reasons for this are manifold Choosing services can be problematic difficulty acting under pressure poor working memory and poor response inhibition can prevent people from getting the right deal Paying for services can be impacted by difficulties doing paperwork and dealing with problems can be hindered by avoidance or a reluctance to communicate This may not be the case for everyone mental illness can manifest in any variety of ways But inaccessible services and inadequate support are problems across the board no matter the exact nature of someone s illness 
MAR5	We’re divorcing the EU. So why do hard Brexiteers still feel jilted?	There is a jilted quality to the way some Tories talk about Brexit which is odd given that Britain is dumping the European Union The resentment would make more sense if it were the other way round if member states had expelled Britain from their club But after decades of treating everything European as a punishment inflicted on a nation against its will the habit is hard to break Even the act of leaving is configured by the Eurosceptic imagination as something done by them to us There is an illustration in the resignation letter sent by George Eustice an agriculture minister to Theresa May last week Eustice was appalled by the prospect of an article extension which would he fretted be the final humiliation of our country He said the European commission had not behaved honourably and had deliberately made progress slow and difficult Yes George it would all have been quick and easy without those meddling Brussels bureaucrats  It doesn t require a romantic attachment to the EU to find such Brexiter tantrums tedious All it takes is an ability to imagine what the process looks like from the other side of the negotiating table 
MAR5	Children are dying on our streets – May’s response is not good enough	Their faces are hauntingly impossible to ignore staring out from the front pages Some are in school uniform little more than children others all teenage bravado hovering on the difficult cusp of adulthood  But all teenagers were far too young to die like this stabbed to death on the streets of Britain in the past months This is the kind of national moment that demands a swift reassuring and comprehensive response from politicians And yet what it gets is Theresa May stiffly insisting that there is no direct correlation between the rising tide of knife crime and police numbers Nothing has changed or if it has then it definitely wasn t her fault It is a characteristically tone deaf response to a public mood characterised by alarm and sorrow why can t she see that dead children requires something more emotionally literate than this But the bigger problem is that what she s saying flies in the face of common sense 
MAR5	Macron’s overblown vision for Europe shows how much it needs Britain	Emmanuel Macron s open letter to Europe s citizens published in all EU member states is an ambitious attempt to stop the rot inside the EU and create a framework for progressive democratic renewal But in taking his best shot at saving Europe France s president has badly misfired or to use a duelling term adapted from the French deloped  Europe s future cohesion and coherence are of primary importance to Britain in or out Macron is right to warn that this is a pivotal moment The corrosive continent wide onslaught of rightwing populist nationalist and xenophobic forces is real and urgent It found its most recent expression in Estonia at the weekend where electoral support for the far right surged 
MAR5	Pupils shouldn’t be denied LGBT lessons – whatever their parents say	Parkfield community school in Birmingham has found itself in the headlines once again after protests against its No Outsiders lessons The protests by the school s largely Muslim parent body garnered a lot of coverage and raised a fundamental question how can inclusive education reach every child when many households of faith remain deeply opposed  No Outsiders is a teaching package designed for primary school children The lessons cover gender sexual orientation and the idea that discrimination is wrong Andrew Moffat the author of the package and assistant headteacher of Parkfield had been trialling the resource at the school when the controversy erupted 
MAR5	As foreign secretary I argued against an EU referendum. Now I back one	The Brexit debate is coming to a head at a moment when Britain s political parties seem to be coming apart Maybe that is not surprising The referendum usurped the role of parliament and MPs And both Labour and Conservative parties are being pulled by the far right and far left The mess of Brexit is the result Millions of voters are left feeling not only frustrated but homeless with unprecedented strain on the stability and legitimacy of the two party system  The defections from the main parties last month were not just about Brexit Labour s antisemitism crisis also reflects dangerous wider trends It is horrifying to see the Jewish roots of MPs turned into a weapon against their political views to see sectarianism so deep that reason is lost to see the anonymity of social media toxify political debate 
MAR5	Bohemian Rhapsody’s release in China is a victory, despite the cuts	 Gay and Chinese Two words that have more cultural friction than a pair of bearded drag queens going in for a hairy hello kiss China s LGBT history has been difficult and fraught Homosexuality only became legal in and same sex scenes are still banned from their television In fact it was only last year that the social media giant Weibo decided to stop censoring gay themed content after a huge online campaign which gave birth to catchy hashtags like iamgaynotapervert  So it s no surprise to discover that when the Oscar winning biopic Bohemian Rhapsody gets its release in China this month censors will cut as much as two minutes of the homosexual scenes and drug use It may not seem like a lot but in a film which spends the latter third recreating Freddie Mercury s enthralling Live Aid performance it s a decent chunk For some two minutes of gay intimacy constitutes an entire relationship with extra time for a post coital cigarette Censorship here is being used as a way to demonise drugs and gay kisses both equally bad in the eyes of the state 
MAR5	Rudd’s disability benefits move is nothing more than political gaslighting	Watching the government spin over anything from Brexit offers to money for deprived towns there is an analogy that keeps coming to mind a doctor amputates someone s leg for no discernible reason and then when she notices the wound is bleeding expects applause for offering a plaster This image came to mind again today with work and pensions boss Amber Rudd s announcement of reforms to the disability benefits system including freeing disabled pensioners from unnecessary benefit checks  Under the policy older people will not have personal independence payments Pip regularly reviewed and may be able to fill in a form rather than seeing an assessor in person In a speech on Tuesday to the disability charity Scope Rudd is also set to announce a small scale trial to test the feasibility of bringing together the Pip tests and work capability assessments into one the disaster strewn test that determines whether a disabled person is fit for work 
MAR5	I will survive: how Failing Grayling made himself unsackable	What does it take to get sacked by Theresa May these days That s a question being asked on the other side of the Atlantic after the bumbling transport secretary Chris Grayling went global and became the subject of an editorial in the New York Times Under the headline How does he survive The curious case of Failing Grayling the paper describes him as a byword for haplessness in a golden age of political blundering in Britain  While the NYT has developed a reputation of late for gloomy coverage of UK politics Grayling s political survival is also the subject of increasing astonishment in the UK The Labour party claims that as a government minister Grayling has cost the taxpayer a total of bn by way of political gaffes Meanwhile there are plenty of Conservative MPs who have grown impatient with their colleague over continuing train problems that have got their constituents seeing red Most recently Grayling made the news for a ferry fiasco when he awarded a no deal ferry contract to a company with no ferries and then had to pay out m to Eurotunnel over the decision 
MAR5	Virgin Atlantic’s sexism goes deeper than telling women what to wear	Obviously I didn t think they were all virgins just because they worked for a company with the V word in the title That would be ridiculous wouldn t it But then I never imagined it was compulsory for female cabin crew at Virgin Atlantic to wear makeup and tight skirts when they were serving meals dealing with sick children or in the worst possible scenario guiding terrified passengers through emergency exits on to inflatable slides  On Monday in a sudden lurch into the st century the company relaxed its strict dress rules announcing that female cabin crew would no longer be obliged to work wearing full slap It also decreed that trousers would be available as a standard item in the Virgin Atlantic uniform instead of female flight attendants having to make a special request I mean how modern is that 
MAR5	Dear Europe, Brexit is a lesson for all of us: it’s time for renewal	Citizens of Europe if I am taking the liberty of addressing you directly it is not only in the name of the history and values that unite us but because time is of the essence A few weeks from now the European elections will be decisive for the future of our continent  Never since the second world war has Europe been so essential Yet never has Europe been in such danger Brexit stands as the symbol of that It symbolises the crisis of a Europe that has failed to respond to its peoples need for protection from the major shocks of the modern world It also symbolises the European trap The trap lies not in being part of the European Union the trap is in the lie and the irresponsibility that can destroy it Who told the British people the truth about their post Brexit future Who spoke to them about losing access to the EU market Who mentioned the risks to peace in Ireland of restoring the border Retreating into nationalism offers nothing it is rejection without an alternative And this is the trap that threatens the whole of Europe the anger mongers backed by fake news promise anything and everything 
MAR6	Teenagers are being killed. But more policing is too simple an answer	While researching my book about all the young people and teens who were killed by guns on a random day in the United States I would call the journalist who wrote the original story of the shooting and ask if they had any leads With a handful of exceptions they didn t The victims were overwhelmingly working class black and Latino killed in poor black and Latino neighbourhoods The stories were often little more than rewrites of police reports People are desensitised to it said one journalist They figure that s where bad things happen Unfortunately homicides are not uncommon in that area said another Unless something unexpected happened it just wouldn t be the kind of story we d follow up on said a third  After a while it was difficult to escape the notion that there were places where the shooting of a child did not challenge the general understanding of how a city or a society works but confirmed it The death was not news in the conventional sense How could it be when it was expected And then there were places where children were not supposed to get shot schools suburbs malls cinemas and universities A fatal shooting of a child in one of those places would contradict how people thought a city or society should work This was news How could it not be when it had shocked so many people 
MAR6	Britain has cut itself adrift from Europe. I fear we may sink	In his novel The Stone Raft the Portuguese writer Jos Saramago imagines that the Iberian peninsula breaks away physically from the rest of the European continent at the Pyrenees The peninsula and its peoples detach from Europe and drift across the oceans seemingly in search of a new home and contentment which spoiler alert they never quite find  Saramago s book is a brilliantly playful examination of several aspects of the Portuguese national mentality not least the complex relationship with Spain But the essence of his fantastical idea is easily transferable to Britain As Brexit looms it is not difficult to see the British as another disparate group of rub along peoples caught aboard our own stone raft beginning to drift into the dark ocean of the future 
MAR6	The Tories are tough on Islamophobia? What a joke	Conservatives are doubtless congratulating themselves for acting swiftly and decisively following the suspension of party members for allegedly making Islamophobic comments online including calls to get rid of all mosques and to turf all Muslims out of public office Tories will similarly point to yesterday s resignation from the party of a local council candidate in Harlow as evidence that they are getting a grip Peter Lamb who in tweeted Islam is like alcoholism The first step to recovery is admit you have a problem was suspended over that and yet as picked once again to contest the local elections in May Now he is gone  The Conservative top brass will hope that voters will see these moves as proof that the Tories have zero tolerance for racism in their ranks drawing an implied contrast with Labour and its ongoing travails over antisemitism And yet the departure of these low level activists serves only to draw attention to the Islamophobia exhibited by much more senior Tory figures anti Muslim prejudice that has gone entirely unpunished 
MAR6	The fabulous, feral Derry Girls are the new emblems of Northern Ireland	I m a Derry girl We never grow out of it Waiting for the new series was like being pregnant with your second child What if you didn t love it as much as the first one We needn t have worried The girls and their cousin the wee English fella are more fabulous and feral than ever The head nun Sister Michael only has to roll her eyes and curl her lip to have us falling about the place  Nearly everyone from the north of Ireland who grew up at any stage of the Troubles was sent out on forced encounters across the religious divide just like the reconciliation weekend that provides the plot for the first episode of the new season Bridge building as it is known There was always a frisky interest in the talent on the other side It didn t always go well for us either but few can have been as disappointed as Clare played by Nicola Coughlan Determined to befriend a fully blown Protestant to outdo smarmy Jenny who already knows a half Protestant she ends up dangling over a cliff squealing that the boy holding the rope is a fenian hating madman 
MAR6	Set the children free – show them the joy of reading for reading’s sake	For many young people today books are only for school and exams the notion of reading for simple pleasure is greatly diminishing  This week a survey of children and young people carried out by the National Literacy Trust ahead of Thursday s World Book Day found only of eight to year olds read for pleasure And just a quarter of those will read daily dropping from figures It is a fact made worse by findings of Nielsen Book Research s annual survey on British children s reading habits which found that as few as of children under are read to daily by an adult for no other reason than the pure fun of it this is down from in with most parents stopping reading to their child by the age of eight 
MAR6	Stop talking about testosterone – there’s no such thing as a ‘true sex’	Debates are raging again over who should be allowed to compete in women s sport Take two recent examples that inflamed the internet First the Sunday Times reported that the International Association of Athletics Federations IAAF intended to classify women with higher natural testosterone as biological males just as m runner Caster Semenya was headed to court to challenge IAAF regulations that would exclude her and others from competing owing to higher than typical testosterone levels Then tennis great Martina Navratilova asserted that trans women biologically are still men and shouldn t be allowed to compete in women s events  The IAAF and Navratilova quickly backed away from these claims but the damage was done Many journalists intent on covering a mind bogglingly complicated subject with authority have asked me the same question recently Are women with high T testosterone biological males The answer is that there is no simple definition of what a biological male is 
MAR6	Renaming the Cook Islands would be a vital step towards true independence	Fifty four years after independence the Cook Islands is considering a name change Named after Captain Cook the Pacific islands located between New Zealand and Hawaii comprise Polynesian islands each with their own pre colonial names and histories and complicated dynamics in the present They are not the colonial fantasies of remote island adventures or tropical sexualities and more than tourist destinations  If you thought decolonisation in the Pacific was a mid th century moment that ended with political independence you would be wrong Decolonisation is a continuing undoing of the legacies of colonialism It involves re examining names and categories but it is not always about going back to the past to claim some authentic identity Hence Danny Mataroa chair of the Cook Islands name change committee has suggested a name that encompasses Christian faith which arrived after colonialism and M ori heritage which predates colonialism 
MAR6	Police spied on trade unionists for an illegal blacklist. We demand justice	Ten years ago today the Guardian broke the story of an illegal blacklist orchestrated by the country s largest building contractor The Consulting Association spied on construction workers who had the temerity to stand up for their rights or raise concerns about safety It directly carried on the work of the notorious Economic League an organisation that kept a list of alleged leftwing trouble makers who were often denied jobs When it was closed down in the Association s database held personal information on more than workers who were repeatedly denied work and endured long periods of unemployment and family hardship as a consequence  On this anniversary a new released police report proves that it was not just the building firms spying on us The UK s secret political police were also supplying information to the blacklist Operation Reuben was the internal police investigation into blacklisting launched after disclosures in the media and parliament The report by ex chief constable Mick Creedon on Operation Reuben s findings unequivocally states Police including Special Branches and the security services supplied information to the blacklist funded by the country s major construction firms The Consulting Association 
MAR6	In an era of brutal cuts, one ordinary place has the imagination to fight back	The story of local government today can be summed up in one word cuts Brutal life changing future cancelling cuts As many as children s centres have been closed by English councils since David Cameron took office in Almost libraries closed across Britain last year alone That s people with disabilities trapped in their homes grandparents denied adequate care and lifeline bus services scrapped  This is news that rarely makes the news It is announced through notices tied around lamp posts rather than in the national newspapers When Cameron and George Osborne designed their historic spending cuts to fall most heavily on local government this was the outcome they wanted private tragedies delivered through tens of thousands of brown envelopes plopping on to doormats across the land rather than one glaring public outrage Yet stack them all together and you can make two big bets about this country s future 
MAR6	We’re divorcing the EU. So why do hard Brexiteers still feel jilted?	There is a jilted quality to the way some Tories talk about Brexit which is odd given that Britain is dumping the European Union The resentment would make more sense if it were the other way round if member states had expelled Britain from their club But after decades of treating everything European as a punishment inflicted on a nation against its will the habit is hard to break Even the act of leaving is configured by the Eurosceptic imagination as something done by them to us There is an illustration in the resignation letter sent by George Eustice an agriculture minister to Theresa May last week Eustice was appalled by the prospect of an article extension which would he fretted be the final humiliation of our country He said the European commission had not behaved honourably and had deliberately made progress slow and difficult Yes George it would all have been quick and easy without those meddling Brussels bureaucrats  It doesn t require a romantic attachment to the EU to find such Brexiter tantrums tedious All it takes is an ability to imagine what the process looks like from the other side of the negotiating table 
MAR7	Cars are killing us. Within 10 years, we must phase them out	It s the last straw Parked outside the hospital doors is a minibus with its engine running The driver is playing on his mobile phone The fumes are blowing into the atrium I step up to his window and ask him to turn the engine off He does so grumpily Then I notice he s wearing a health service uniform I walk through the atrium down a corridor and into the cancer department not for cancer this time but to talk about reconstructive surgery I look around the huge waiting room and wonder how many of the people sitting here might be ill as a result of air pollution I think of people in other departments children with asthma attacks patients being treated for road injuries or suffering from a lifetime of inactivity as wheels replaced their feet And I m struck by the amazing variety of ways in which cars have ruined our lives  Let s abandon this disastrous experiment recognise that this th century technology is now doing more harm than good and plan our way out of it Let s set a target to cut the use of cars by over the next decade 
MAR7	Believe the victims of child sexual abuse? If only we did	Here are some things I don t really want to think about but have had to over the years Jimmy Savile s penchant for tracksuits as the bottoms can be pulled up and down so easily vulnerable year old girls in Rochdale ignored by local police seven year old boys sleeping in the bed of a pop star and being introduced to masturbation or the day long ago when I was teaching film studies and a film I showed Terence Davies Distant Voices Still Lives produced extreme distress for one of my mature students  Something in that film a shot of a sofa I think had caused a rush of terrible memories In those days there were groups for survivors of sexual abuse and I was able to find some kind of help for them Never for one moment did I disbelieve the distress I saw in front of me Nor did I find it strange that sometimes people did not clearly remember what happened to them as children and that they could not talk about it till many years later 
MAR7	Macron reached out to all Europeans, and what does he get? Scorn	Emmanuel Macron s letter to the citizens of Europe calling for a European renaissance was conveniently mocked or scorned by some who picked at its lofty language we need to politically and culturally reinvent the shape of our civilisation or its seemingly unrealistic to do list Yet the crux of his message was found not in the roadmap he attempted to lay out but in the audience he tried to address the million citizens of the EU s member states  This was the first time a European head of state or government had reached out not to fellow nationals or other governments nor to EU institutions but to the entirety of the bloc s citizens The only other leader who has ever attempted such a thing was Barack Obama in his speech in Hanover Address to the people of Europe That day Obama gave a pep talk to Europeans as the heirs to a struggle for freedom 
MAR7	Sick children being denied drugs are a grim foretaste of a post-Brexit NHS	Today in front of the health select committee in the Commons one of the bravest and best elements of the NHS has been giving evidence against Vertex a pantomime villain US drug company Caught in between are unfortunate patients also giving evidence today about their need for Vertex s cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi which Nice is so far refusing to approve  This is an everyday painful dilemma in the life of Nice the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence one of the Blair government s best creations With transparent criteria panels of expert and lay assessors examine the evidence to decide which new drugs offer enough new benefit at an acceptable price The Nice rule of thumb there are exceptions is a price of some for every good year of life gained by a patient a QALY a quality adjusted life year 
MAR7	Until they feel safe, young people will risk their lives by carrying knives	The senseless murders of two year olds Jodie Chesney and Yousef Makki have caused a national outrage Even though the killings were miles apart were not linked and do not appear to be gang related they have forced Sajid Javid the home secretary to finally call the growing number of knife attacks a national crisis  He d had countless opportunities to do so since taking up his post nine months ago there had been a number of black victims including year old Jaden Moodie who was viciously murdered in January yet he had refused This had led many people especially within the black community to suggest that his declaration of a crisis and the subsequent meeting with police chiefs happened only because the latest victims were white and from the suburbs 
MAR7	Another broken promise on Grenfell puts the lives of survivors on hold	In the weeks after the fire at Grenfell Tower that killed people the prime minister promised a swift inquiry urgent recommendations and a process that put the traumatised community at the heart of the process A promise was made justice would be done  Last night bereaved families and survivors heard that the police investigation into the fire would be delayed until the inquiry had presented its final report This means it could be at least the latter part of before detectives assess whether they have enough evidence to pass a file to the Crown Prosecution Service Then the CPS will need to decide whether to prosecute That will also take time We are looking at before key decisions are thought about let alone made That s five years after the fire before a prosecution is even considered 
MAR7	Labour‘s antisemitism problem is institutional. It needs investigation	When the Labour party set up the Equality and Human Rights Commission just over a decade ago it probably never dreamed it could itself be the subject of a statutory investigation  The crisis over antisemitism in the party has again reached an acute point with the resignations of MPs including heroic Luciana Berger the suspension of Chris Williamson for saying the party had been too apologetic over antisemitism and the ongoing revelations about the leadership interfering with disciplinary processes 
MAR7	A 'privacy-focused' Facebook would kill Zuckerberg's business model	Plenty of people look back on their early s and regret the things they said and did Few do it as publicly as Mark Zuckerberg  In a note posted to his social network on Wednesday the year old Facebook chief executive of spent words patiently explaining why the year old Facebook chief executive of was wrong to build a company predicated on the assumption that we would all want to live every second of our lives in the public sphere 
MAR7	It’s not the ‘white working class’. The real home of bigotry is elsewhere	New research this week has undermined the widely held view that to be prejudiced you must be poor It turns out that rather than the working class or the poorest it is middle income earners those in households with combined salaries of k k who are more likely to feel threatened by immigrants Muslims Gypsies and Travellers Tell me something I don t know  For years we have had a deeply divisive and incorrect conversation about the working class We constantly hear the working class is white rather than multi ethnic that it is the white working class who disproportionately voted for Brexit even though that is factually incorrect and that it is among the white working class that we find the majority of British racism 
MAR7	The Tories’ Islamophobia will not be stopped from within	The news that Conservative members were suspended this week alongside the reinstatement of Peter Lamb a Conservative council candidate in Harlow who then resigned on Tuesday demonstrates that the party has a significant amount of work to do to counter anti Muslim hate Lamb had previously tweeted Islam is like alcoholism The first step to recovery is to admit that you have a problem Yet he was reintroduced into the party to be a council candidate  Sadly as the founder and former director of the hate crime reporting project Tell Mama I know that views such as these have been picked up and circulated among groups that vehemently dislike Muslims There has been a steady drip of cases of anti Muslim bigotry in statements made by party members and councillors Serving Conservative councillors such as Hashim Bhatti have talked about a deeper problem within the party and the chair of the Conservative Muslim Forum Mohammed Amin said that the party has failed to take action against anti Muslim bigotry 
MAR8	Worried about Brexit? What, with these geniuses in charge?	In the depths of Building at Microsoft s Washington state headquarters there s a laboratory rated the quietest place on the planet This anechoic chamber is so silent that someone standing in it can hear not just their heart beating but the blood flowing in their veins People can t handle the experience for more than minutes Nasa has sent astronauts to a similar lab in Minnesota to prepare them for the terrifying silence of space Both of these facilities however are currently less silent than Michael Gove Remember him By way of a refresher course Michael was one of the architects of Brexit Or perhaps that s the wrong word given the mess Describing someone as an architect of Brexit is like describing the Luftwaffe as an architect of London Let s say Michael was one of the frontmen of the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union and is currently secretary of state for the environment  But you may recall him for his decision in the immediate wake of the referendum to knife leadership hopeful Boris Johnson This treachery backfired spectacularly with Michael s behaviour widely regarded as too distasteful even for the Conservative party Mindful that his personal brand was marginally more toxic than the Exxon Valdez then Michael has spent the past two and a half years cleaning up the fallout via apologetic interviews launching about six big idea consultations a week and being photographed going into cabinet carrying a refillable coffee cup The latter ruse was probably my favourite I only wish Brutus had waved something similar round the Capitol in late March BC It would have saved a lot of unpleasantness 
MAR8	An insane place where politics is done one day at a time – that’s Brexit Britain	So here we are The government seems to be headed towards a free vote on whether the country should leave Europe with no deal This is in case you are wondering an insane situation No deal would plunge the country into a state of emergency cause medicine and food shortages and the government is refusing to take a position on whether or not that should happen  Here s the timetable On the March MPs will vote whether or not to back Theresa May s deal If it is voted down on the March there will be a vote on whether or not to leave the EU with no deal a vote which it is reported the Tories will not whip which means Conservative MPs do not need to vote along the party s line If the outcome is not to leave the EU on the March MPs will decide whether to extend article a vote which will either end in no deal March s default outcome or in a lengthening of the current state of affairs which could still end in no deal Let s be clear no deal is a situation the head of the Confederation of British Industry called a threat to global stability on Friday and which medics have warned will cause thousands of British people to die 
MAR8	Michael Jackson’s trick was to groom an entire culture	It was hard this week watching R Kelly jump up and down on CBS while claiming his greatest problem was being big hearted and sitting through four hours of Michael Jackson revelations to hang on to the idea that the truth has implacable meaning In both cases the sense of outrage from the accused parties in Jackson s case his estate was palpable and brought to mind another example of male pattern entitlement that of Brett Kavanaugh during his supreme court confirmation hearing   They are trying to bring us down Jackson was reported as saying to one of his victims while asking him to lie in court The double think was part of the abuse The narrative was only ever these men s to control and one suspects that control was in large part what they got off on Guilt or innocence seemed secondary to the fury generated by the presumption of those who dared to doubt them 
MAR8	R Kelly and the art of the male meltdown	I m sure you ve seen the photo by now Gayle King sitting serenely and staring calmly ahead while R Kelly looms over her gesticulating violently The shot taken during King s interview with Kelly this week quickly went viral  It wasn t just the striking juxtaposition of King s professional calm and Kelly s frenzied rage that made the photo an instant classic It was the fact the juxtaposition was so familiar As many people noted the image was a flashback to Brett Kavanaugh s hearing before the Senate judiciary committee last year Dr Christine Blasey Ford was composed and measured while she gave her testimony She didn t raise her voice she didn t let her emotions get the better of her Kavanaugh in contrast ranted and raged He didn t care about being emotional because he knew he would never get called hysterical or irrational or shrill or crazy He knew that we treat angry men very differently than we do angry women 
MAR8	The terrifying case of a six-week embryo suing an abortion clinic	In Alabama a man is suing for what he believes is his right to allow any man to force a female partner to give birth against her will In a bizarre twist a judge has allowed a no longer in existence embryo to sue as well It s a case that highlights the fundamental divide between the pro choice movement and the anti abortion and often anti contraception one is the debate just about life Or is it about allowing men and the government to control women our lives our futures and the very skin organs and bones we live in  This case brings the stakes into sharp clarity 
MAR8	Neither oppressed nor trailblazing, Muslim women need to be heard	The politics of the Muslim woman remains wrapped up in debate The oppressed terrorist bride complex is rampant within our societal infrastructures and it s still deeply ingrained in the consciousness of the supposedly reasonable man on the Clapham omnibus Are we now though seeing any visible difference in the representation of Muslim women within mainstream media and politics I m inclined to think not  Her identity is still up for discussion by others if she is perceived to be oppressed then the secular white British media must highlight the oppressive nature of her religion and save her from it if she is on the terrorist bride Shamima Begum side of the scale she must be reminded that she is not an actual citizen of this country and resides here at the mercy of public and political opinion 
MAR8	To fix its problems now, Labour must face the racism in its past	It would come to be known as one of the UK s most racist pieces of legislation But when the then Labour home secretary James Callaghan rushed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act through parliament in the space of three days he was adamant it had nothing to do with race A series of cabinet papers released years later proved what everyone already knew at the time Callaghan wasn t telling the truth  Asian people were facing expulsion from Kenya and under the existing laws they would have been able to come safely and securely to the UK But the act rewrote the UK government s previous guarantees stripping them of their right to come here almost overnight The reason for these frantic changes was race The intentional aim was to stop coloured immigrants from entering this country 
MAR8	Anti-English sentiment in Ireland had healed. But Brexit has brought it all flooding back	Brexit has created many nightmares but a particularly unpleasant one is the rise of anti English sentiment in Ireland British Irish relations have not just cooled on a diplomatic and political level but among the Irish population The anti Englishness born of past oppression had we thought been confined to the past but has resurfaced And whose fault is that The emotional trauma of Ireland s treatment by Britain and England in particular is usually delicately contained but now it is spilling over  I grew up in Dublin far removed from the conflict north of the border but I went to an Irish speaking secondary school where boys wore balaclavas to school Gaelic football matches for a laugh and IRA was carved into desks with maths compasses As the painful peace process concluded and the Good Friday agreement came into force God Save the Queen was sung in Croke Park the hallowed ground of Gaelic sports and the Queen spoke in Irish at a state dinner in Dublin Castle It seemed as if anti British sentiment was at least covered over with a healing gauze if not completely healed But Brexit and the behaviour and rhetoric of British politicians the tone of the trightwing British press and the constant stream of ignorance about our island from across the Irish Sea has ripped that bandage off Everything is exposed now and it s a wound that has been and can be again mortal 
MAR8	Feminism without socialism will never cure our unequal society	The chair of the Institute of Directors Charlotte Valeur has used International Women s Day to criticise FTSE companies for not making enough effort to recruit and promote women and minority ethnic directors Scrolling through the list of FTSE companies one will find brands such as HSBC which was fined bn for helping drug cartels launder money in Mexico Sports Direct where workers have been exploited to the extent that one woman gave birth in the toilets and G S a company so mired in scandal that it has an entire Wikipedia page dedicated solely to the amount of controversies it has amassed If a company behaves terribly but its director is a woman is that still feminism  The reality of women s work across the world is not that we re duking it out to see who can make partner first it s exploitation low pay and precariousness Sexism is bad everywhere including in boardrooms but feminism must exist to improve the lives of the majority of women or it is worth nothing Valeur may get her wish for more female directors in the FTSE but it makes little difference to the world unless those women use their new power to fundamentally alter the relations between women and capital 
MAR8	No matter what happens with Brexit, this toxic environment must end	Tuesday should have been the annual MPs v press pancake race for charity Alas this year due to the daily hostilities traded on the green outside parliament where it s held it was cancelled The toxic Brexit induced climate around the Palace of Westminster made it too risky The speaker John Bercow expressed regret in the House While most right minded people abhor the extreme behaviour by some on the fringes putting MPs and journos back in their boxes is supported by the public Polling shows increasing faith in the military and royals but dwindling public trust in politics MPs and the traditional media And politics is polarised on a scale unseen before Brexit has meant that families political parties even the cabinet are split Three quarters of Britons surveyed say the UK is divided rising to among to year olds  Social media has had democratising effects Once if you wanted to contact an MP or sound off to the press you d have to go to the trouble of penning a letter finding a stamp and envelope then getting off your arse to post it Today a bit of typing on your mobile and the hazards of being ignored by your recipient or the filter of editorial control are removed Now everyone no matter how extreme has a platform 
MAR9	Only in Tory fantasy land does knife crime have nothing to do with austerity	A conservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality declared the American neo conservative Irving Kristol in as he predicted that experience would batter the idealistic into accepting the value of order and holding the guilty responsible for their crimes  In the st century it is conservatism s turn to become unreal and not only because Brexit has destroyed its claim to be the philosophy of the hard headed Brexit is a symptom of a wider Tory breakdown in which fantasies replace evidence and temporary convenience trumps the public interest Reality is mugging knifing and killing the British and all a Conservative prime minister safe behind her bodyguards can say is there is no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers 
MAR9	Playing politics with a child’s life shames us all, Mr Javid	Theresa May famously peddled a story about an illegal immigrant who had won his case because he had a cat and had used article of the Human Rights Act the right to a family life to stay in the country  It wasn t true but hey she didn t care she had a point to make about the Human Rights Act and she needed a headline grabbing story In the same speech the then home secretary said We must end the Human Rights Act As we now know she very unfortunately made it to the office of prime minister 
MAR9	Golf tycoons want to raid Scotland. It is our duty to defend its beauty	If there were an international beauty pageant for countries Scotland would win it most years In January it was voted the most beautiful country on the planet by the travel website Rough Guides  This follows similar awards by global travel specialists in three of the previous five years as well as ancillary awards for best island Lewis and Harris and quality of living Orkney Edinburgh Other countries have spectacular mountains and gorgeous lakes but nature seems to have chosen Scotland as the location for her best work 
MAR9	Carolee Schneemann, the artist you definitely didn’t hear about at school	The artist Carolee Schneemann has died at the age of Last summer she was one of the most intriguing interviewees in Rebel Women The Great Art Fightback a wonderful BBC documentary about the emergence of feminist performance art in the s and s That documentary is exactly my idea of a great night in and it was the first time I had seen many incredible revolutionary artists speaking from Suzanne Lacy to Judy Chicago  Although their work was all strikingly different the stories they told were pitifully similar They were derided and rubbished and it took decades for most of these pioneers to find even a modicum of recognition in the mainstream art world Talking about her Interior Scroll from which saw her pulling a long stream of paper out of her vagina and reading from it Schneemann said dryly that it probably cost her a lot of nice teaching jobs 
MAR9	For 2,000 years we’ve linked Jews to money. It’s why antisemitism is so ingrained	I m reluctant to add to the workload of the Equality and Human Rights Commission which this week announced the first step towards a statutory inquiry into Labour and antisemitism If it goes ahead it will be only the second time the commission has seen fit to investigate a British political party for racism the first related to the BNP and given the number of complaints that have been reported it ll have its work cut out Nevertheless I have a research trip to suggest  First though a word of context An oft heard defence of Labour is that a party of its now vastly increased size is bound to reflect the wider population since that population includes some antisemites then sadly but inevitably so will Labour But that swerves around a gloomier possibility that anti Jewish racism might exert a particular appeal to some on the left even paradoxically enough those who might otherwise proudly regard themselves as anti racists 
MAR9	This is not the week to push a people’s vote. May’s deal has to fail first	Here we go again Another big weekend of political speculation ahead of another big vote in parliament Cue the TV talking heads endlessly telling us this really is crunch time again  Amid the noise and the millions of words said and written about Brexit and the many interviews with ministers constantly telling us the prime minister has been very clear about this in truth very little is clear at all But this much is as clear as can be Theresa May lost the first meaningful vote on her withdrawal agreement and the accompanying political declaration by an enormous margin of defeat and the changes she said she would fight for in further negotiations in Brussels have not been forthcoming This time for once she would be right in saying nothing has changed 
MAR9	Would you like your Brexit vanilla or Marmite? It’s time to choose	This is it Next week sees the end of the beginning of Brexit and the beginning of the end Theresa May is determined to offer herself for ritual lynching by her mob of free trade anarchists having spent two years failing to face them down Parliament will then liberate itself from her torture and seek a new way forward The plan is for May s defeat on Tuesday to be followed by a vote against no deal and then by its only sane consequence a vote to delay article To make that delay acceptable to the EU there must be a plausible reason for it That means a plausible alternative Brexit agreed by the British parliament What is that alternative  The answer began to emerge last Wednesday from talks between the Nick Boles Oliver Letwin group of Tories and Labour s leader Jeremy Corbyn It is for the UK to leave the EU but remain a member of the European customs union It avoids the Northern Ireland border issue honours May s commitment to frictionless trade and meets a hundred other reasonable concerns of those involved in Britain s dealings with Europe There is no question that there would be a Commons majority for such a proposal as there is already in the House of Lords Only the glaring inadequacy of the two party leaders has prevented a multiparty agreement on remaining in the customs union being already reached 
MAR9	Worried about Brexit? What, with these geniuses in charge?

MAR9	The great betrayal: how Britain’s industrial towns died of neglect	Perhaps there have been trade union banners on anti Brexit marches but I have never seen any Faced with the greatest threat to jobs and prosperity the UK has faced since the Great Depression organised labour refuses to be excited The Trades Union Congress TUC has a position in order to maintain workers rights and preserve tariff free frictionless trade with the rest of Europe it wants the UK to stay in the single market and customs union But union members themselves are noticeably shy about endorsing that line even in industries such as car making that are otherwise heading for extinction  Some go against it completely Reports suggest that most shop floor workers at the Nissan plant in Sunderland want to leave the EU regardless of the consequences A worker at the Jaguar plant at Solihull told the Guardian that he hadn t bothered to vote but he would have voted leave Even at the risk to his job Yes because it s not about jobs It s about immigration 
MAR9	The EU’s plan to rein in Facebook and Google will do exactly the opposite	The growth of the internet and user generated content in the past years has been underpinned by speed and ease of use The foundations for this are commonly referred to as safe harbour provisions in copyright law This means that organisations that allow users to upload content to their websites Wikipedia YouTube Facebook et al are not liable for copyright infringement of their users but are required to speedily remove content after the fact if a copyright makes a complaint Now through article of its new copyright directive the EU is curtailing these safe harbour provisions and thereby challenging the very basis of a free and open internet  Imagine that you upload content to a video sharing website and then have to wait for days for it to appear after it is vetted That could be the future of the internet in the EU 
MAR10	Why are our MPs putting blatant self-interest ahead of the Brexit vote?	In the parliamentary drama of the coming week the term Namierite is one you are unlikely to hear often if at all But it matches perfectly this moment in the Brexit saga wretchedly so in fact Sir Lewis Namier one of the great historians of the th century argued on the basis of detailed forensic analysis that most political behaviour is not motivated by high idealism but the complex interaction of faction and connections the search for personal advantage and the force of self interest  In his masterpiece The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III he wrote Men no more dreamt of a seat in the House in order to benefit humanity than a child dreams of a birthday cake that others may eat it the seat in the House was not their ultimate goal but a means to ulterior aims 
MAR10	Sajid Javid makes me question the value of Muslim politicians	Growing up I rarely saw people who looked like me occupying important political positions Minorities were far more likely to be represented in sport or entertainment than in real positions of power But in there are more high profile politicians from such backgrounds than ever Sajid Javid Chuka Umunna Priti Patel Sadiq Khan to name just four So why to me doesn t this actually feel like progress  When Khan won the London mayoral election as the Labour candidate in Sajid Javid tweeted From one son of a Pakistani bus driver to another congratulations This seemed at the time like a touching message across party lines Yet today it feels different 
MAR10	This is like Iraq all over again – we must extend article 50	It s become clear that the prime minister s strategy has been to run down the clock on parliament and the EU to push through her Brexit deal And not for the first time in our recent history parliamentarians have been backed into a corner by government ministers with the immense power and control they have in our political system and forced to choose between two unpalatable foreign policy options with dire consequences for the country  The framing of the choice is similar to the one MPs were presented with in the run up to the Iraq war military action against Saddam Hussein or the risk of an attack on this country The prime minister s version is a similarly artificial choice her deal or a chaotic and disorderly exit from the EU that we know will have severe consequences for our communities MPs are effectively being asked to choose between the frying pan and the fire in the hope they will choose the former and that can somehow be declared a victory 
MAR10	Europe must abandon these foolish Brussels treaties	An alternative to what Europe could and should be exists to the one Emmanuel Macron described last week If there is a need for a rebirth then let it be of the sovereignty of the people of enlightenment against the obscurantism of money and religion  In Europe the time has come to speak the only truly international language capable of motivating peoples widely diverse in history languages and culture It is the language of common good of its defence and its extension of living together of rebuilding after years of ransacked rights and public services and free and undistorted competition It is a language for peace in the face of frenzied belligerent anti Russian warlike Nato provocations 
MAR10	Brexit is heading towards extra time. The question then is: to what purpose?	Election slogans are rarely amusing when they are served hot from the political kitchen It is the cooling breeze of time that flavours the braggery of yesterday with a certain black comedy  Recall how David Cameron framed the choice at the election as one between strong and stable government led by himself or a coalition of chaos under Ed Miliband We have no way of knowing how chaotic life might have been under a Miliband government but it is reasonable to guess that even at his most hapless he would have struggled to match the unblemished record of unleashing havoc achieved by the Tories in the four years since 
MAR10	Bezos v the Enquirer reminds us of the potential for abuse of media power	In exposing what he called an extortionate proposal from the US publication National Enquirer Jeff Bezos founder of Amazon concentrated minds in newsrooms last month when he wrote in a blogpost Be assured no real journalists ever propose anything like what is happening here  The Enquirer s proposal in emails Bezos disclosed was that if Bezos would state publicly that there was no basis for suggesting the Enquirer s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces the Enquirer would stop publishing intensely private communications between Bezos and a woman with whom he was in a relationship 
MAR10	When schools close early, we are surely back in an age of decline	To millennials s nostalgia consists largely of themed nights at nightclubs a disturbing revival of synth pop and the return of shoulder pads With house prices pushing home ownership beyond the reach of those without private wealth and students leaving university with average debts of more than no one in their right mind would call young people fortunate but they are blessed in having no other associations with the s Small comfort I know  For the generations who were around to experience it the s is a decade that comes with baggage In as car manufacturers announce layoffs or transfer investment overseas as waiting times go up and satisfaction in the NHS heads down and with the formation of a new centrist party the gang of the past few weeks have increasingly felt like a trip around a s theme park The brief but ghastly reappearance last month of Derek Hatton the ghost of recessions past felt as apt as it did sick making 
MAR10	Only in Tory fantasy land does knife crime have nothing to do with austerity	A conservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality declared the American neo conservative Irving Kristol in as he predicted that experience would batter the idealistic into accepting the value of order and holding the guilty responsible for their crimes  In the st century it is conservatism s turn to become unreal and not only because Brexit has destroyed its claim to be the philosophy of the hard headed Brexit is a symptom of a wider Tory breakdown in which fantasies replace evidence and temporary convenience trumps the public interest Reality is mugging knifing and killing the British and all a Conservative prime minister safe behind her bodyguards can say is there is no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers 
MAR10	How repressive does a country have to be before it becomes a guilt trip for tourists?	Go on visit Turkey For fun joy happiness and neverending journey Women are allowed to judge by the country s tourism website to laugh there now Will it be safe One hears these stories Be reassured says the useful tips section this is one of the safest countries in the world You ll find the police helpful and friendly Well the ones who are left since the president Recep Tayyip Erdo an dismissed a further officers in last year s purge  There s no section as yet dealing with the latest from the land of fun joy and happiness last week s warning by the minister of interior Suleyman Soylu to the effect that certain tourists could find themselves staying indefinitely Let them come and go to prison directly from the airport 
MAR10	Playing politics with the life of Shamima Begum's baby shames us all, Mr Javid	Theresa May famously peddled a story about an illegal immigrant who had won his case because he had a cat and had used article of the Human Rights Act the right to a family life to stay in the country  It wasn t true but hey she didn t care she had a point to make about the Human Rights Act and she needed a headline grabbing story In the same speech the then home secretary said We must end the Human Rights Act As we now know she very unfortunately made it to the office of prime minister 
MAR11	Even if Theresa May’s rotten deal scrapes through, Brexit will fester for a generation	Bring on the mayhem roll on the waves of chaos let Brexit and its conflicted Brexiters writhe over the impossible contradictions of their revolutionary cause The worse it gets the better for the country as the less likely we are to leave The prime minister s evening dash to Strasbourg may still deliver deadlock and a good thing too If we end the week with no deal a bar on no deal exit and a delay with length and purpose unknown the country inches closer to no Brexit If her rotten deal does scrape through this will not be the end it will fester on fought over for a generation unless the people have agreed it with a vote  Hardliners fight tooth and claw against delaying withdrawal as they see Brexit slip away Three long years since the referendum campaign makes that close result look more obsolete with each passing week so much has happened we know so much more The more furiously Brexiters assert that one vote is the only valid will of the people the more bogus their claim looks 
MAR11	Think the Commonwealth can save Brexit Britain? That’s utter delusion	I m struck as the British parliament moves towards the endgame on Brexit with the number of times Australia Canada New Zealand and India have been advanced by the Brexiteers in the public debate as magical alternatives to Britain s current trade and investment relationship with the European Union This is the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments that have emerged from the Land of Hope and Glory set now masquerading as the authentic standard bearers of British patriotism It s utter bollocks  If Britain proceeds with giving effect to what future historians will legitimately describe as the longest suicide note in history by leaving the union the cold hard reality is that the mathematics simply don t stack up in terms of credible economic alternatives to Europe Much as any Australian Canadian and New Zealand governments of whichever persuasion would do whatever they could to frame new free trade agreements with the UK the bottom line is that million of us do not come within a bull s roar of Britain s adjacent market of million Europeans 
MAR11	The guff spoken about Jess Phillips shows how uneasy people still are about class	I am not so much angry with the working class as deeply disappointed We are an embarrassment to our revolutionary leaders to the middle classes but mostly to ourselves We do a lot of stupid stuff We don t even identify as a class half the time And before you tell me I am not working class because I write in a newspaper and I like nice things can I just say you are right in one way wrong in others  The guff spoken about class after Jess Phillips gave an interview while wearing expensive clothes for a photoshoot showed just how uneasy and disingenuous about class some of the left remain She was deemed not working class enough I like Phillips She wants to sort out stuff and will get her hands dirty but she is not sufficiently loyal to the leader This is beyond tedious as well as vastly hypocritical The top of the Labour party is as close to the working class as I am to Prince Philip These are public schoolboys who appear never to have heard of equal ops Nepotism and privilege is rife so their anxiety about class is understandable 
MAR11	Low-paid work is no longer a route to better pay – it is a trap	One of the few domestic political issues that occasionally manages to make itself heard over the Brexit cacophony is the rollout of universal credit It is a huge and disruptive shake up of the welfare system which will end up taking more than a decade from legislation to implementation And it is no niche concern One in three working age households will be entitled to it once in place Spending will top bn a year roughly equivalent to what we spend on all primary and secondary education And from April most benefits will have been frozen for the fourth year in a row  We d normally expect the chancellor to be focusing on this issue at this time of year But the traditional spring budget has been moved to the autumn and the spring statement which Philip Hammond will give on Wednesday is not intended to be a major fiscal event so policy and spending announcements are unlikely 
MAR11	Social media polarises and radicalises – and MPs aren’t immune to its effects	Barely a week goes by without government ministers or MPs warning Facebook Twitter Google YouTube a subsidiary of Google Instagram or WhatsApp both owned by Facebook that they must do more to prevent radical or dangerous ideas being spread A crackdown is always just around the corner to protect users from harmful content  Oddly MPs never wonder whether they might be victims of the same effects of these tools that they too use all the time Why not though We keep hearing that it s a big problem for people to be repeatedly exposed to radical ideas and outspoken extremists It s just that for MPs those tend to be within their own parties rather than on obscure YouTube channels 
MAR11	We exclude the Labour left from British politics at our peril	Jeremy Corbyn s leadership is on borrowed time That assumption has hung over it throughout his three and a half years in charge It s there during every Labour crisis It s there before every perilous election such as the local polls this May And after every bad or even so so Labour result the end of Corbyn s leadership is there in the minds of his many enemies of many commentators of many anxious Corbynistas  When the party is doing better under him such as during and immediately after the election this sense that he is on perpetual probation recedes but never completely and never for long In June two days after Labour had won its largest general election vote since Tony Blair s landslide the then Labour MP Chris Leslie told BBC Radio s Today programme We shouldn t pretend that this is a famous victory It is good but it s not going to be good enough Twenty months later without waiting to see if his scepticism about Corbynism s electoral potential was justified he left the party to co found the Independent Group 
MAR11	Why are our MPs putting blatant self-interest ahead of the Brexit vote?	In the parliamentary drama of the coming week the term Namierite is one you are unlikely to hear often if at all But it matches perfectly this moment in the Brexit saga wretchedly so in fact Sir Lewis Namier one of the great historians of the th century argued on the basis of detailed forensic analysis that most political behaviour is not motivated by high idealism but the complex interaction of faction and connections the search for personal advantage and the force of self interest  In his masterpiece The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III he wrote Men no more dreamt of a seat in the House in order to benefit humanity than a child dreams of a birthday cake that others may eat it the seat in the House was not their ultimate goal but a means to ulterior aims 
MAR11	Northern Ireland policing is in crisis. It could threaten peace	Ten years ago the late Martin McGuinness then deputy first minister at the Northern Ireland assembly stood beside his unionist counterpart Peter Robinson the Democratic Unionist party first minister and called the dissident republicans who had murdered a police officer traitors to the island of Ireland Two weeks ago a senior Sinn F in figure on the Northern Ireland Policing Board said that among the Catholic community nationalist and republican confidence in the Police Service of Northern Ireland PSNI had hit rock bottom Now Karen Bradley the secretary of state has trampled into the middle of this crisis and made matters a great deal worse  Bradley who said last week that killings during the Troubles by members of the police and the British army were not crimes has the authority to select the person tasked with investigating police wrongdoing the police ombudsman when the current incumbent leaves in the summer This is absurd and untenable Bradley offered a belated apology claiming bizarrely that she did not mean what she said and that it was not her view However at a Northern Ireland affairs committee hearing several months ago she supported a call to change the law so that army veterans and former police officers do not face harassment in the courts 
MAR11	The European Spring holds the answer to the fragmenting EU’s plight	The European Union is fragmenting at a time when Europeans need it the most Emmanuel Macron is right to point this out But he is wrong to push another top down agenda that lacks credibility fails to speak to Europeans concerns and entrenches the democratic deficit at the heart of the EU By entrusting Europe s renewal to its unaccountable bureaucrats Macron s programme will only deepen the discontent that has given rise to the ultra right he claims to oppose  Over the past months we have worked with political parties activists and practitioners to develop a different kind of renewal programme one that offers immediate solutions to Europe s overlapping crises that gives control back to citizens in their communities and that sets out a long term vision for our democratic union It is called a New Deal for Europe and it will be put to voters across the continent in May s European parliament elections by our European Spring the transnational coalition of progressive forces brought together by Democracy in Europe Movement DiEM 
MAR11	There is a way to address the vile indignities heaped on homeless people	In Britain today homelessness is effectively a criminal offence A Guardian investigation shows at least councils up from last year have obtained the power to use public spaces protection orders PSPOs These orders criminalise people who put up tents seek charity or engage in other behaviour associated with rough sleeping They also give the council the power to hand out fines to rough sleepers which if left unpaid can result in conviction and a fine  More than people are homeless in Britain today Rough sleeping is up by since the Tories took power At least people died on our streets in 
MAR12	Theresa May’s Brexit lost to the ultimate adversary: reality	There might still be ways that Brexit can go badly unexplored dead ends and byways of failure But the road to success is now closed Parliament s second verdict on Theresa May s deal is slightly less crushing than the first one in January But a defeat by votes just weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU indicates not only the last evacuation of any authority from the prime minister but a profound crisis in the project that is the only purpose of her government She had one job and she cannot do it Vital questions about the future will now be settled in a state between despondency and panic There is no strategy no guiding intelligence A plan must be salvaged from the wreckage of a bad idea badly executed  There was a moment early today when May thought she saw a way through A path was briefly visible to the promised land of orderly Brexit The prime minister had brought legal clarifications from Strasbourg to embellish her deal But then the road was barred by Geoffrey Cox The attorney general judged that the UK might still find itself in the notorious backstop an EU customs union with no unilateral means of dissolving the arrangement Indefinite backstop is a deal breaker for hardliners 
MAR12	Punchbag May is humiliated again. But for MPs the real crisis starts now	Well that seemed interminable It was gone pm by the time the tellers appeared And the prime minister was hammered again would in normal times represent a total humiliation But we don t live in normal times Nowadays the second biggest defeat in the House of Commons since represents progress  The problem now confronting the prime minister is a relatively simple one The endless breathless speculation and rolling coverage of days such as today often feels more like football transfer deadline day than politics as usual But as any football fan knows deadline day depends on the existence of a fixed deadline that everyone accepts 
MAR12	Britain is trapped in the purposeless austerity that gave us Brexit	Slap bang in the middle of this week falls one parliamentary event likely to be greeted with near silence When Philip Hammond stands up tomorrow afternoon to deliver his spring statement on the health of Britain s finances he ll know in his bones that it will provoke no feverish excitement among lobby journalists nor command the front pages Given a major economic policy announcement newsreaders would previously devote their bulletins to his figures and forecasts this time they will probably give it a mere moment s notice And who can blame them  A prime minister potentially faces her last days in office her cabinet is in all out mutiny and the country teeters on the brink of its biggest foreign policy decision in almost half a century Herein lies a glorious chance to treat politics as Netflix to gossip about court intrigues among Boris and Amber and Jacob to refer in am dram tones to Cox s codpiece and the Malthouse compromise Presented with all that which puritan would plump instead for Spreadsheet Phil and his dry bread sums 
MAR12	My complaints of Tory Islamophobia were ignored, so I had to resign	In January I took the heart wrenching decision to resign as chair of South Shields Conservative Association It was a difficult moment My parents came to Britain from India in the s My father worked as a coalminer for years I was born here and we were a typical working class family My father has been a Labour supporter all his life like so many first generation immigrants so it was a surprise to both my parents when I joined the Conservative party  But they were so proud when I was elected chairman of my local association I have always been so grateful for the opportunities made available to me here and I often reflect on how my life might have turned out had my father not embarked his arduous journey to these shores 
MAR12	I’m not the mother who left her baby at the airport. But I could have been	I have left my baby on walls in public toilets up trees on trains rolled under beds and on one very memorable occasion in an envelope at the bottom of my handbag I had to fumble under keys books a spare jumper and some tissues to pull it out Not in real life you understand but in a thousand sweaty sleepless eye juddering neck clasping nightmares For one woman this week that nightmare became true  Like John Candy in his polka van seeking to bring solace to Kevin s mother in Home Alone I am not here to criticise the woman who left her baby in a Saudi airport as she boarded the plane to Kuala Lumpur I have no right or any authority to question any other parent s ability to cope under stress or navigate the unfamiliar I certainly have no interest in puffing up my own sense of smug accomplishment by revelling in comparison and mother bashing here s looking at you YouTube commenters I have left enough bags coats phones tickets and keys on enough benches buses and other people s bonnets while juggling and jiggling a helpless baby to know that sometimes you simply do not have the capacity to carry all the disparate parts of your life along without occasionally faltering About two months into motherhood I spent two hours in my own garden sitting on a plastic bag entertaining the baby with clothes pegs and singing the songs from Aladdin because I had forgotten not just my keys and wallet but also any snacks toys or phone 
MAR12	To my ERG colleagues, I urge you to hold your nose and support May’s deal	Theresa May s deal has many issues within it issues that are intended to be short term We don t want to take EU rules over which we have no say we don t want to answer to European courts and certainly not permanently We asked May to go and make sure these issues should only be temporary and she has achieved something It s not everything it s not perfect but it s something that shifts the balance of risk  As the attorney general Geoffrey Cox has said this is a political decision which is informed by the legal advice He is clear that the risk of our being tied in against our will is significantly reduced and we ve been clear about our intentions going forward The unilateral declaration sets out our understanding of the agreement and our intention to leave if obligations are not fulfilled It s not perfect it s a legal argument we would have to make at that time but it does have legal weight and has been accepted by the EU In conjunction with the joint statement making a commitment to acting immediately on finding alternative border arrangements and securing a better future relationship one that does not have to be based on the existing backstop plans the risks of foul play or entrapment by the EU are significantly reduced 
MAR12	Cox’s verdict on the backstop is the final nail in the coffin for May’s deal	 The legal risk remains that the United Kingdom would have at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same no internationally lawful means of exiting the backstop And with that verdict from attorney general Geoffrey Cox on the modified withdrawal agreement the chances of Theresa May s deal getting through the Commons this evening have receded to almost nothing  The chances were always slim But if Cox had declared that the concessions May had obtained in the form of an addendum to the original withdrawal agreement were transformative in terms of the backstop the prime minister had hoped to be able to rally enough MPs behind her deal to at least minimise the scale of her defeat to less than votes This would have left the door open to her to bring back her deal for a third meaningful vote next week 
MAR12	Is ‘Future Britain’ the lifeline disenchanted Labourites need?	What on earth is Tom Watson up to now  People have been asking that question almost as long as Labour s deputy leader has been in the Labour party in fairness All that has changed since the arch fixer s days of plotting to oust Tony Blair for Gordon Brown is the nature of who s asking But it s always a question worth taking seriously which is why this week s inaugural meeting of Future Britain a new grouping to uphold Labour s social democratic and democratic socialist tradition which Watson promised to create in the traumatic aftermath of nine MPs leaving the party was packed to the rafters 
MAR12	I've been drafted into 'operation no deal'. And things here feel desperate	The real countdown has truly started In Whitehall today the clocks are striking the number of days left before we are due to leave the European Union Tempers are running high So too is the nation s imagination in the few weeks since my first article the Brexit commentariat has created such a torrent of snarky metaphor including many references to how terrified yet also strangely bored of Brexit we all are that it feels like we re being hit by a tsunami of tepid tapioca  Yet we can t seem to get enough Politico and other websites have even started collecting the best Brexaphors There s Mad Max Hotel California cake the Titanic a chocolate orange a Mexican standoff a blue furry monster actually the Dutch came up with that one but it s too cute to leave out And it s not too late to get your Brexit advent calendar 
MAR12	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is right – it's time for radical change, not more ‘meh’ politics	Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is an equal opportunity irritant The newly elected congresswoman doesn t just drive Republicans to distraction she routinely riles establishment Democrats with her refusal to meekly toe the party line Ocasio Cortez to the chagrin of many of her colleagues has no interest in diluting her views and occupying a safe middle ground If that wasn t obvious enough already AOC made her derision for political moderates extremely clear in a speech at South by Southwest on Saturday   Moderate is not a stance It s just an attitude towards life of like meh Ocasio Cortez told a packed room at the tech centric festival in Austin Texas We ve become so cynical that we view cynicism as an intellectually superior attitude and we view ambition as youthful naivety when the greatest things we have ever accomplished as a society have been ambitious acts of vision The meh is worshipped now For what 
MAR13	MPs have voted against no deal. Now here’s how to make that decision stick	MPs have just voted against a no deal Brexit But this vote doesn t achieve much by itself because it s just an indicative vote No deal can t be taken off the table it is the table You ll hear this clever soundbite in the Twitter feeds of MPs and commentators on both sides of the Brexit divide but it suffers from the serious defect of being wrong  When we talk about no deal being the table what we really mean is that it is the present default position It is absolutely true that unless we agree a deal we will leave the EU without one be that on the th of this month if no extension is granted or if an extension is granted when that extension expires No deal is as things stand the ultimate default position 
MAR13	Theresa May is truly on the ropes. But there may yet be life in her deal	And so the Brexit options facing Theresa May tighten again remorselessly and painfully and with more pain to come A day after a second decisive defeat for her withdrawal deal with the EU and amid threats and chaos in the Westminster lobbies MPs narrowly wrested control from May by four votes over the possibility of no deal Then in a second vote they drove the message home again this time by an unambiguous majority of  We are witnessing a watershed in the Brexit process as power passes from May s government to shifting coalitions of MPs on individual issues in front of our eyes But the passing from one chapter of the story to another is unmistakable in spite of the confusion in the lobbies last night The government that had first promised a free vote to Conservative MPs ended the evening by vainly trying to whip its MPs against the toughened no deal motion and still lost lost badly 
MAR13	The middle ground is our only route out of this Brexit abyss	Brexit is a conundrum in search of a compromise The referendum after all delivered a narrow majority for leave the political convulsions ever since have torn at Britain s democratic and social fabric and no one credible believes a hard break from the EU can be achieved without significant economic pain A rational approach therefore would focus on a compromise seeking to unite the country as much as possible minimise economic damage and allow the conversation to shift on to what Theresa May diagnosed and proceeded to fuel as the burning injustices disfiguring British society But the middle ground underpinning such a compromise has been deliberately shredded torched carpet bombed from both directions  The British right and their media allies have played the decisive role Tory media outlets and the Tory hierarchy David Cameron included spent years demonising migrants scapegoating them for social problems like stagnating wages or the housing crisis that are actually caused by those with power George Osborne s ideologically driven austerity project failed 
MAR13	Did no one tell Philip Hammond that austerity is raging outside?	Listen to Philip Hammond and it s easy to get lulled into a false sense that he is an adult making sober cautious decisions Not blessed with the ahem charisma of a Boris Johnson he is happily less given to spouting headline grabbing rubbish While his colleagues have spent the past two and a half years promising voters the moon on a stick the chancellor has kept his cool The spring statement was classic Hammond Sandwiched between Tuesday s humiliation for Theresa May and the no deal vote Wednesday night he was never going to command any front pages Watching you could mistake him for the bank manager your branch doesn t have sensible dull unremarkable  In which case you d have misjudged both him and his policies Because Hammond has just taken two big risks One of those was right and could damage him the other a huge blunder and will hurt the rest of us 
MAR13	Silicon Valley is erecting a monument to itself. Will it be a giant robo-phallus?	Every city has a landmark that celebrates what its people love France has the Eiffel Tower which is both astonishingly beautiful and admittedly a bit penisy New York has the Empire State Building which is the same but bigger Rome has the Colosseum to celebrate an oiled up Russell Crowe  Now Silicon Valley power brokers want to honour the thing they truly love by building their own massive monument to themselves The San Jose Light Tower Corporation has raised m to create a statue that honours Silicon Valley itself They hope to raise up to m for a great idea according to the New York Times 
MAR13	With Theresa’s ‘turd’ deal flushed away, pray for an EU invasion	 It sends a message to the whole world croaked Theresa May to the Commons on Tuesday night about the sort of country the United Kingdom will be in the years and decades ahead  Fairly sure the world has got the message by now They are up to speed and across the detail of the sort of country the UK is The question of whether Brexit represented a midlife crisis or the descent into senility appears to have been answered The land that likes to picture itself as a David Niven world war two movie is in fact a look away episode of The Jeremy Kyle Show On close inspection the beacon of democracy turns out to be a bin fire 
MAR13	May and Corbyn will never back a second referendum – but MPs must	It s become the norm in these most extraordinary of political times the prime minister suffers another humiliating defeat after two years of negotiations on the most important decision in decades and no one in the House of Commons shouts Resign  Although there is little if any sympathy for Theresa May the consensus being that she is the author of her own misfortune no leader of any party stands up and demands she steps down Even though it s widely recognised that the prime minister is largely the problem it s accepted that the Conservative party is unlikely to find anyone much better to replace her 
MAR13	Parliament is betraying voters, but a clean Brexit is the best option	Parliament is failing to respect the wishes of the majority in the referendum Labour and Conservative MPs promised to implement the leave vote to get elected in The Conservative manifesto said no deal was better than a bad deal and confirmed we would be leaving the customs union and the single market at the same time The Labour manifesto set out a detailed and interesting new trade policy for the UK that would be incompatible with staying in the customs union and EU market arrangements  The leave voting public is in despair about this parliament s failure to agree a common line to leave Some blame the government for negotiating badly Others blame the opposition for undermining the UK negotiation by implying no deal is not an option and for having separate lines of communication with very different messages to the EU All feel democracy is letting them down It is not just the lack of enthusiasm to implement the referendum vote but also the way many MPs have torn up their pro Brexit election statements 
MAR13	Here’s our plan for an orderly no-deal Brexit, and delivered on time	From the moment that Geoffrey Cox the attorney general published his advice that despite the prime minister s efforts to secure an amendment to the backstop the legal risk remains unchanged the fate of the withdrawal agreement was sealed To some that may be taken as a signal of a deeply divided Conservative party Yet in its commitment to honour its manifesto promise to deliver Brexit by leaving the single market the customs union and the remit of the European court of justice the party is anything but  My own local association voted unanimously last month that Brexit as defined in the manifesto must be delivered on time and in full The National Conservative Convention the senior body in the voluntary party passed a similar motion by a ratio of to and also stated that Another referendum a delay beyond the European elections taking no deal off the table or not leaving at all would betray the people s vote and damage democracy and our party for a generation 
MAR13	These gaffes expose British politics’ real issue with race	Among the unremarkable racial experiences in my life I have been chased off a train as a teenager by men twice my age and size shouting nigger pursued down a main street in Edinburgh by two men with baseball bats shouting the same word had racist graffiti scrawled on my house and had countless people shout at me in the street Unremarkable not because they weren t terrifying or upsetting at the time but because such stories are relatively common among black people of my age who grew up in Britain  So when I hear that someone has failed at racial etiquette I generally roll my eyes whether or not they are a politician I have seen heard and felt worse The pattern is now painfully familiar In an unscripted moment a public figure uses a term that is either outdated coloured offensive nigger or just plain odd funny tinge Indignation caffeinated by social media erupts The person then doubles down or apologises or as often as not doubles down and then apologises I get a phone call from a radio or television outlet asking if I want to come on and talk about it I don t 
MAR14	With Brexit now on hold, there’s only one option left: compromise	The Brexit chasm has seemed unbridgeable No path has appeared through the impasse Tonight a glimmer of a route came into view Parliament decided to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day and extend the negotiating phase probably for three months It did so shamelessly because it could not agree on what on earth to do next  The EU reasonably asks why If the UK could not decide on Brexit in two and a half years what difference will three months make The answer is that Theresa May is refusing to give up on her red lines and her frantic efforts to appease the rightwing of her party Yet her deal has not so far pleased them and it has now gone down to defeat twice by huge margins Astonishingly she wants to try one more time next Tuesday 
MAR14	Theresa May has finally got the Brexiters where she wants them	MPs had the chance to take back control of Brexit wresting this tortured process from a weak flailing and moribund government and they ducked it Sure it was by the narrowest of margins losing by just two votes to but MPs passed up the opportunity to take charge and say at long last what kind of Brexit they want They preferred instead to grant Theresa May yet another lifeline for her own deal which incredibly will come back for a third meaningful vote on Tuesday  The lever that was offered to MPs by which they might have finally got a grip on the Brexit crisis was a proposal from Hilary Benn that would have seen a series of votes allowing MPs to indicate their preferred Brexit plan whether that be Norway plus or a second referendum or every shade in between No longer would May retain the initiative with the power to confine MPs to a single binary choice my way or the highway 
MAR14	The problem is not so much Theresa May – it’s that Britain is now ungovernable	Dramas need characters politics requires politicians and a storm must have an eye Which is why at the dead centre of Brexit the biggest and most multifaceted crisis to face this country in more than years there is just one person She stands at a Commons dispatch box in an elegant outfit day after day knowing that the evening will cover her in yet another dung heap of humiliation that will be daubed all over the next morning s front pages All along her frontbench are colleagues just waiting for her to go so they can take her job and move into her Downing Street home On her backbenches are MPs who shamelessly boast to journalists their fantasies about putting her in a noose and knifing her in the front She is derided she is hated she is the target for some of the most outrageous abuse ever to be heaped on a year old woman from Eastbourne  In a democracy intent on beating itself up Theresa May has become the nation s punchbag On radio phone ins the callers pour bile upon her On TV sofas pundits speculate about how many days she has left at No When she isn t attracting derision she attracts something arguably worse for a politician pity Her voice has gone and the theory goes soon she will follow 
MAR14	If children don’t join the climate strike, their schools are underachieving	There will be another large scale school climate strike tomorrow following a controversial walkout by pupils last month I say controversial the reaction in much of the grownup media was perhaps better described as a reluctant obligation to be adult about the whole thing while secretly cheering them on  Even prominent Conservatives struggled to feign disapproval of this wanton act of civic engagement by the next generation Energy minister Claire Perry wistfully told the BBC she would have joined the walkouts in her younger years She may take a different line if the kids keep it up it is after all her department they are protesting against 
MAR14	I know the panic of ‘maths anxiety’. But hope may be the best solution	I m bad at maths I want you to know that this is not a boast though to say that you are bad at maths has somehow become a badge of honour in a way that publicly saying I m barely literate never can be even Donald Trump doesn t admit that A few years ago the charity National Numeracy even criticised celebrities who boast about their poor maths skills as contributing to the national scourge of poor numeracy  Why do people do it Is it to make themselves appear quirky and creative or do we just not consider it a vital life skill Either way it isn t helping and now new research from the University of Cambridge has found that studying maths is causing some primary school pupils to feel rage and despair as a result of maths anxiety with some reduced to tears and others struggling to breathe 
MAR14	A general election is now possible. To win it, Labour must back Europe	The good the mad the dishonest and the cowardly that s roughly how the House of Commons split last night and probably will again tonight The honours go to those Tory MPs and ministers especially the four cabinet ministers who sought to ensure that whatever else happens they will not lead the country to destruction They can hardly be sacked since they were promised a free vote until only minutes before the division when the prime minister tried to swerve her troops into the wrong lobby  The no deal horses of the apocalypse were well described by the chancellor the introduction of appalling tariffs that would slaughter industry swamped with cheap goods while killing exporters whose goods get too expensive as smuggled EU loot undercuts everyone via the Irish border He couldn t have said it plainer but then what He jumped on to one of those horses and galloped into the lobby to vote to allow that to happen List him among the dishonourable 
MAR14	Marketing medication as his and hers? This is ‘anxiety economy’ at its worst	If you have ever spent more than five minutes on Instagram you ll probably be familiar with the sleek pink packages that indicate someone has bought something from Glossier The company an American cosmetics brand founded in has become famous not only for its products but also for its aesthetic cutesy minimalist pastel packaging expertly targeted at the perfect millennial customer As with many brands what you are actually getting doesn t always seem to matter photographing it being seen to have it is what you are paying for  Legions of brands have followed Glossier s example at first other cosmetic companies then homeware lifestyle and more Now it seems the Glossierification of everyday life is finally complete as the telemedicine brands Hims and Hers neatly show 
MAR14	A flawed second referendum could break our democracy	We ve been locked in a tug of war for years that has effectively shut down government and produced drift anxiety and anger Today a group of MPs will push for a second referendum to break the deadlock In Westminster their voices have dominated the Brexit debate and at times made a second vote seem inevitable But when I go home to Wigan for the most part it seems absurd  I ve never been a fan of binary choices I dislike the divisive nature of our first past the post electoral system and argued against a simple remain leave referendum on the EU which forced people to take sides on an issue that for most inspires mixed feelings I am even less convinced by the case for a second referendum in the terms proposed 
MAR14	Austerity created this mental-health crisis. Brexit has sent it into overdrive	There was something about the events in Westminster this week that made me think of the news that sales of self help books in Britain are at a record high As we encounter an ever more stressful and unsteady climate we are turning to those who offer answers an issue not least for those who can t afford the price of a book Some of this anxiety must come down to more global patterns climate change say or the fragility of democratic norms but much can come down to the more prosaic matters of life ability to pay the bills job prospects or simply the sense that we have a grasp on the future  Just look at Brexit More than four in people say that Brexit has impacted on their mental health in the past two years hardly surprising considering of respondents to the YouGov survey believed EU withdrawal will worsen their lives Some EU nationals living in the UK have even reported feeling suicidal as uncertainty about their future steps up 
MAR14	Wake up, Philip Hammond. The climate crisis needs action, not lip service	For once Philip Hammond s spring statement acknowledged the climate crisis and the collapse of wildlife and insect populations around the world  But has the chancellor been swept up by the rising tide of climate activism Has he been inspired by the courage and passion of the young people joining school strikes to defend their futures Sadly not 
MAR15	After Christchurch, Muslims need more than just your thoughts and prayers	There is a certain profundity about waking up one morning when your only plans for the day are to go to Friday prayers with your family to discover that on the other side of the world people just like you doing exactly the same thing with their Friday as you intend to do with yours have been slaughtered  My first response upon reading of the massacre in Christchurch was I admit stunned blankness I could read the words and I understood them but for a few moments there was no obvious emotional reaction Not because I didn t care about what had happened but because the enormity of it meant it was simply too difficult to immediately process 
MAR15	Brexit – the niche production that truly brought the house down	We focus so much on what divides parliament s warring Brexit factions when almost all of them are united by the guiding principle of brinkmanship Eventually someone will stop acting like a shit but it certainly won t be me The past few days have been like watching the Cuban missile crisis re enacted by the Teletubbies  A recap then Hopes that Tinky Winky would grow into the role of Bobby Kennedy were dashed this week in a series of votes in the House of Commons We are days out from the date the UK will leave the European Union without a deal unless something else is agreed upon With the threat of that something being a long extension if granted by the EU Theresa May is hoping MPs will look again at her withdrawal agreement next week in Meaningful Vote Sure they saw it lurching around the bar earlier and thought there was no way in a million years they were going home with it But this close to tipping out time are they drunk enough to panic buy If the answer turns out to be yes the prime minister s various earlier losses this week will be hailed momentarily as tactically astute Think of it as a sort of Crap Negotiations World Cup Theresa May doesn t want to finish top of the group or her Brexit will face the Treaty of Versailles in the semis 
MAR15	The climate strikers should inspire us all to act at the next UN summit	Tens of thousands of young people took to the streets on Friday with a clear message to world leaders act now to save our planet and our future from the climate emergency  These schoolchildren have grasped something that seems to elude many of their elders we are in a race for our lives and we are losing The window of opportunity is closing we no longer have the luxury of time and climate delay is almost as dangerous as climate denial 
MAR15	Four ways you can support the YouthStrike4Climate movement	Since we made headlines in February with the UK s first school strike we ve seen an outpouring of support from our peers parents carers politicians and other people from all walks of life It seems that most people know we re in a mess but they just didn t know what we can to do to get out of it  This is where the UK Student Climate Network UKSCN stepped in not necessarily out of choice but necessity There s no time left for the adults in the room to solve the climate crisis The politicians and powerful actors have failed us Youth is rising up all around the world and here in the UK we re emerging as one of the most powerful forces demanding urgent and radical change 
MAR15	Do UK politicians support the climate strike? Party leaders respond	By taking to the streets today to make their voices heard young people are educating us about how important tackling climate change is to their generation They are right to be worried about what kind of planet they will inherit and right to demand far reaching action Governments cannot sit back leaving major decisions to market forces It hasn t worked and it never will Polluting corporations will never do anything serious to solve the crisis  Climate change presents terrible risks But because it demands such massive change and government action it s also an opportunity to transform our economy making it cleaner healthier and fairer Labour already has among the most ambitions carbon reduction targets in Europe and radical plans to create a zero carbon emission economy by We plan to achieve that by ushering in a green industrial revolution 
MAR15	Bloody Sunday was a very British atrocity – the top brass got away with it	There may be only one thing that the Bloody Sunday families and the defenders of the Parachute Regiment are agreed on following the announcement that a former lance corporal is to be charged with two murders and four attempted murders that it is perverse and unfair that one low ranking soldier should be made to carry the can for what happened in Derry years ago  Once again Kipling s poor bloody infantry are to take the blame 
MAR15	The UK says it’s a climate leader. But it’s complicit in climate atrocities	It wasn t long ago that Theresa May stated boldly that she wanted the Britain of the future to be a truly global Britain which is a force for good in the world Steadfast in upholding our values not least our fierce commitment to protecting the natural environment  Not everyone was fooled least of all the thousands of young people striking from school today to call on world leaders to finally take the climate crisis seriously 
MAR15	Think we should be at school? Today’s climate strike is the biggest lesson of all	It started in front of the Swedish parliament on August a regular school day Greta Thunberg sat with her painted sign and some homemade flyers This was the first school climate strike Fridays wouldn t be regular schooldays any longer The rest of us and many more alongside us picked it up in Australia Germany Belgium Switzerland New Zealand Uganda Today the climate strike will take place all around the world  This movement had to happen we didn t have a choice We knew there was a climate crisis Not just because forests in Sweden or in the US had been on fire because of alternating floods and drought in Germany and Australia because of the collapse of alpine faces due to melting permafrost and other climate changes We knew because everything we read and watched screamed out to us that something was very wrong 
MAR15	Young climate activists around the world: why I’m striking today	We strike for the Earth to protect and save it from what the human race has done As indigenous youths we have a close connection to the Earth We know that without it we have nothing we are nothing Our community is directly affected by the Cold Lake oil sands which is a large deposit of tar sands Some of the tar sands can be extracted through drilling which is incredibly dangerous to land animals and people and affects the water and air quality in negative ways We must think of the future generations what we do today tomorrow and the next day will impact the next seven generations We must change our ways from burning natural resources from releasing so much carbon from poisoning what we need to live We cannot survive by drinking oil  I am from the Central Taiwan Plains Indigenous People As the indigenous people of Taiwan we have a particular vulnerability to climate change Our traditional culture is deeply rooted in the harmony we have with the spirit of nature We face heartbreaking loss due to increasingly extreme weather events We urge the Taiwanese government to implement mitigation measures and face up to the vulnerability of indigenous people halt construction projects in the indigenous traditional realm and recognise the legal status of Plains Indigenous People in order to implement environmental protection as a bottom up approach 
MAR15	The decision to prosecute only one soldier over Bloody Sunday is unbelievable	The dignity and determination with which the Bloody Sunday families have conducted their struggle for truth and justice over the past years has been a source of inspiration And there is no doubt that their hopes were high of another major breakthrough on Thursday morning as we walked through the same Bogside streets where the massacre happened all those years ago  For the vast majority of the families those hopes were to be dashed shortly after they arrived in the City hotel to be told by the Public Prosecution Service PPS that only one former soldier would face murder charges over the deaths of James Wray and William McKinney and attempted murder charges relating to Joseph Friel Michael Quinn Joe Mahon and Patrick O Donnell 
MAR16	To ignore Nigel Farage and the populist right is complacent	Conventional wisdom has a remarkable capacity to recover from the many batterings it receives and carry on as if nothing has happened Like Doctor Who it doesn t die but regenerates  Last week it was anticipating the defeat of the populist right that combination of opportunism utopianism victimhood wilful ignorance conspiracism and racism for which we do not yet have a satisfactory label Even though Theresa May s government is collapsing as if it has been hit by a wrecking ball even though her withdrawal agreement has been defeated by the two of the largest majorities ever conventional wisdom assures us that the Brexit ultras must support it on her third attempt 
MAR16	Americans really pay a bribe for a good education? In Britain, we’ve got far subtler ways	 Dude dude what do you think I m a moron Thus one of the parents accused of involvement in the US college bribery racket He d been warned by a wiretapped conspirator not to reveal that he paid for his daughter s fraudulent test results part of a system the fixer calls the side door  Appropriately soothed I m not saying you re a moron the accused father is recorded by the FBI assuring the scam s organiser that he ll deliver if required the agreed fiction I m going to say that I ve been inspired how you re helping underprivileged kids get into college Totally got it 
MAR16	Hungry, unwashed children fill our schools – how has it come to this?	According to a survey from the headteachers union the Association of School and College Leaders schools have become an unofficial fourth emergency service for the families worst affected by austerity across England and Wales  A majority of the school leaders surveyed said schools were increasingly forced to help pupils despite less help from councils and have had to cut budgets Schools are helping with food parcels equipment shoes and hygiene nine out of give out clothes while nearly half do laundry for them Some are running impromptu food banks or sourcing beds 
MAR16	Luke and Sophie Perry: where’s the shame in grieving your own way?	Of all the difficulties to navigate when caught up in the sickening grip of grief to be told you are not grieving correctly by strangers must be the one of the most bizarre The actor Luke Perry s year old daughter Sophie was driven to write an Instagram post in which she defended herself against criticism she had faced since her father died suddenly of a stroke aged She wrote that she had received a lot of attention online since he died She said she had not asked for this focus to be upon her and that among the kind messages she had also been shamed for her grieving process which it seems has been seen by some as not being sad enough   I m not going to sit in my room and cry day in and day out until the internet has deemed it appropriate for me to do otherwise she said with more dignity than anyone who caused her to write that really deserved 
MAR16	Excluded children can still have hope: here’s the proof	This summer when she leaves school Leah wants to become an art therapist Her classmate Holly wants to do something with psychology and for Sam it s an apprenticeship with the police None of this would be unusual except that Sam not his real name a chatty and engaging year old used to spend his days at school in isolation and his evenings getting into trouble around town with his mates He thought he had irrevocably screwed up his life and was resigned to having blown it Fortunately for Sam he found somewhere prepared to give him not just a second chance but a third and a fourth and a fifth Whatever happened yesterday tomorrow is always a new day  All three teenagers attend Restormel academy in the Cornish town of St Austell It s one of a group of alternative provision schools belonging to the Wave multi academy trust catering for children permanently excluded from mainstream secondary schools plus others who haven t been expelled but may be on the verge who come in for specialist interventions The young people I meet are friendly articulate and sick of a national debate raging over their heads that draws sometimes crude connections between exclusion knife crime and feral behaviour 
MAR16	My father was killed on Bloody Sunday. Britain must confront its colonial legacy	The decision by the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland to bring murder and attempted murder charges only against Soldier F for his alleged actions on Bloody Sunday astonished families as they gathered to hear the news It has also drawn more poison from the military establishment adding to its growing belief that its loyal foot soldiers have in recent times become the scapegoats of colonial history  The facts around the Bloody Sunday deaths and around stories affecting many hundreds of families who lost loved ones including my father who was killed that day due to the actions of state forces in the years following are that very few were actually investigated as crimes Evidence was not collected Inquests were rushed and often held without family involvement or legal awareness of rights limited as they were Only four criminal trials were held for members of the security forces during almost years of conflict No investigating policeman ever darkened the door of our house in the Brandywell area of Derry to find out about Paddy Doherty deceased In the s I served an IRA related prison sentence for a much lesser offence 
MAR16	After Christchurch, Muslims need more than just your thoughts and prayers	There is a certain profundity about waking up one morning when your only plans for the day are to go to Friday prayers with your family to discover that on the other side of the world people just like you doing exactly the same thing with their Friday as you intend to do with yours have been slaughtered  My first response upon reading of the massacre in Christchurch was I admit stunned blankness I could read the words and I understood them but for a few moments there was no obvious emotional reaction Not because I didn t care about what had happened but because the enormity of it meant it was simply too difficult to immediately process

MAR17	A long delay is now the only way out of this Brexit quagmire	 We are getting close to resolving this now So Philip Hammond told the BBC s Andrew Marr today delivering this fabulously silly Brexit forecast without a flicker of visible irony Who says the chancellor doesn t have a sense of humour As it happens he went on to break character pretty quickly by admitting that there may not even be a third meaningful vote on Theresa May s deal this week  If the government s managers do not think they have a chance of winning or at least of significantly reducing the margin of defeat they will not subject the prime minister to yet another humiliation on Tuesday The case for trying is the remarkable speed with which a number of previously hardline Brexiteers are discovering the merits of pragmatism and reconciliation It is amazing how quickly non negotiable objections can melt away as the clock ticks reality bites and careerism trumps principle 
MAR17	Only our compromise can break the Brexit impasse	When we go back to our constituencies it s sometimes hard to explain to people what happens in Westminster because in all honesty it doesn t always make sense  Try telling someone how Steven Barclay the Brexit secretary could speak in favour of a motion on Thursday night only to vote against it a few minutes later Or how MPs like us can vote to stop a no deal Brexit last week only to be told at the end of it that such a prospect was more likely than ever Or how a prime minister can suffer two of the biggest defeats in the history of parliament on the most important issue facing the country but then with a completely straight face say that she plans to bring it back a third or maybe even fourth time 
MAR17	Whatever Nancy Pelosi says, youthful zest is moving US politics to the left	A generational battle is taking place in US politics that could have profound consequences not just for the global left but also for the future of the planet Ever since the freshman class of Democrats entered Congress in January many of them young women of colour and supported by a young activist base they have met resistance from more established members of the party When the newly elected representative Rashida Tlaib from Detroit called Donald Trump a motherfucker hours after being sworn in she was the subject of finger wagging from politicians and pundits I don t really like that kind of language house judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler said CNN s Chris Cillizza wrote that Tlaib s choice of words was a gift to the president  When year old Alexandria Ocasio Cortez surprised everyone by seeing off an established Democratic rival and going on to win a seat in Congress her triumph after a shock primary victory in New York over the longstanding incumbent Joe Crowley who was the third most powerful House Democrat was played down by the House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi who chose to emphasise that voters had merely made a choice in one district Since then Ocasio Cortez who has become an internationally recognised figure has faced a backlash from an array of party insiders some of whom seem to resent her public profile and Twitter star status for her refusal to play by the normal rules of Washington politics 
MAR17	Technology is terrorism’s most effective ally. It delivers a global audience	Terrorism is effective because it always seems near It always seems new And it always seems personal Ever since the first wave of terrorist violence broke across the newly industrialised cities of the west in the late th century this has been true  It feels personal because although statistics may show we are many times more likely to die in a banal domestic accident we instinctively conclude from an attack on the other side of the street the city or in the case of New Zealand the other side of the world we might be next 
MAR17	My kids are genuises. Honestly. Who do I pay the bribe to?	I lie to my kids all the time without thinking in large ways and in small Yes I tell them I will organise a play date with Sammy I won t No your sister didn t mean that she did Yes everyone dies but children don t die before mummies and mummies only die when they re really really old so there s no point in worrying about it now And yes of course a million times yes that picture of a beetle is the best beetle drawn since a cave child first drew a beetle  That last lie is only a half lie to the extent that even when I am checking myself for overweening parental pride it is hard for me to judge my children s output realistically My daughter s ability to hold on to the term solar system and observe that the mouth and nose are connected is evidence of Einstein like acuity That wobbly name written with the front four letters taking up half of the page and the back four crammed into a tiny space that also careens downwards is penmanship unparalleled 
MAR17	Islamophobia is not confined to online groups. It leaks across public life	On Friday morning as the news from Christchurch was still rolling across radio bulletins Sir Mark Rowley the former head of counter terrorism at the Met was commenting on the horror on BBC Radio s Today programme Fifty Muslims had been brutally murdered and seriously injured For horrifying minutes a white supremacist terrorist unloaded round after round of bullets into men women and children  Islamophobia was undoubtedly real and on the rise and being propagated online said Rowley But he went on to quibble Islamophobia wasn t racism To conflate the two was he claimed clumsy thinking 
MAR17	Iran’s threats to BBC Persian staff must be confronted	Tyrannical regimes seek to control what their populations read see and hear lest the people obtain information that might encourage them to question the power that subjugates them Some go to extraordinary lengths reaching far outside their borders to prevent that happening  One obvious example was the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia s consulate in Turkey last October A single bloody act it made headlines around the world As it should have 
MAR17	Well done, Brexit ultras – the EU has never had more power over Britain	The rich history of these islands includes a Blessed Parliament a Good Parliament and a Loyal Parliament Also a Merciless Parliament a Rump Parliament and a Barebone s Parliament The current one could go down as the Addled Parliament or the Useless Parliament if those nicknames had not already been awarded in earlier times So let us call this the Broken Parliament  It has been bust by Brexit During the referendum three long and painful years ago it was the Leavers boast that they would restore parliamentary sovereignty to all the powers and glories they claimed had been lost to Brussels What they have instead done is to turn Britain s legislature into a theatre of anarchy that daily demonstrates that it cannot agree on anything A country once widely admired for the functioning of its democracy and the robustness of its institutions has been turned into a global joke 
MAR17	We scoffed at Grayling’s ‘ferries’ but his way is now a public service norm	Oh how we laughed Failing Grayling the transport secretary Chris Grayling the Mr Bean of contemporary politics had awarded a cross Channel ferry contract to Seaborne a company that had no ferries and had never run a ferry service Six weeks later the contract was torn up  The trouble is the laugh s on us too For it s not just Grayling who s failing The Seaborne style of awarding contracts never mind the competence just get the signature has long been the public sector norm for outsourced work The result has been scandalous services and collapsing companies 
MAR17	Where now for Mark Zuckerberg after his – and our – loss of innocence?	The Cambridge Analytica revelations the most damning of which were published by the Observer and the New York Times a year ago quickly morphed from a scandal about a British political consultancy into one about Facebook the social media behemoth  It was not the first or last of Facebook s many crises but has been the most consequential for the company and for the future of data privacy The expos which revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal information of around million Facebook users and used it for political purposes triggered congressional and parliamentary hearings multiple regulatory investigations and a fundamental rethink of Facebook s future 
MAR18	John Bercow’s ruling has breathed new life into the people’s vote	Brexit fatigue and Brexit bullying are Theresa May s instruments of torture to grind recalcitrant MPs into passing her destructive deal No more says the Speaker this war of attrition must stop Her deal must change and if she brings one back it must be fundamentally different How different He can t say until he sees what plan if any she will present  Rightly John Bercow complains of time wasted of running down the clock as she tries to crush MPs against the concrete wall she herself constructed No was not forewarned of the Speaker s ruling Oddly the Brexiteers were sounding pleased presuming her deal as it stands can t pass They hope that no deal beckons still the legal certainty unless parliament passes something else But the champion of the house will guarantee that MPs get the chance to stop no deal dead 
MAR18	The Speaker has seized his Brexit moment – and now all bets are off	It has been clear for some time now that John Bercow sees himself as a leading protagonist in our political drama not some bystander Even before Theresa May s deal was bogged down in parliamentary trench warfare the Commons Speaker had styled himself as a warrior on behalf of the legislature defending it against arrogant incursions by government But kicking May s withdrawal agreement out of the chamber altogether yesterday was a ferocious escalation  The premise is procedural and venerable Erskine May the vast tome in which are accumulated the various rules and conventions governing parliamentary business decrees that the same motion cannot be debated twice in one parliamentary session And since May s Brexit deal was rejected last week Bercow believes that the prime minister cannot simply come back as had been planned and ask MPs to reconsider What was billed as a third meaningful vote would need some substantial revision of content to qualify as truly meaningful in the Speaker s eyes 
MAR18	Farage's Brexit march: the theatre of the absurd meets storm-hit Minion	How was your weekend I am hoping that you had a good one But if you didn t console yourself that it cannot have been as grim as the leave voters who were walking from Sunderland in the driving rain the churning wind and the sea spitting in their cliffside faces To wit  That is the official photograph sent to me in a press release That is the best representation the campaign could muster 
MAR18	Why was I asked to condemn Islamist violence days after Christchurch?	Less than two days after the horror of the massacre of Muslims in two mosques in New Zealand I was asked in an interview on the BBC news channel whether or not I think Muslim communities in the UK do enough to condemn Islamist extremism   There s a straightforward problem here isn t there one of the reasons that some of this language has become common is bluntly because of the Islamist violence and the Islamist extremism that has happened one of the criticisms we hear in this country has been that there isn t enough criticism of those people by the mainstream Islamic community what do you say to that 
MAR18	For Northern Irish farmers, no-deal Brexit would be a calamity	As president of the Ulster Farmers Union UFU my last three years have been dominated by Brexit and what it means for farming families More than months on from the referendum all we have are unanswered questions and uncertainty  The threat of a no deal is still there Parliament s vote to reject a no deal Brexit and to seek an extension to article are positive steps but the legislation is clear If the UK does not agree an exit deal with the EU we leave with no deal This is a terrifying prospect for Northern Ireland farming families and their businesses 
MAR18	Ending climate change requires the end of capitalism. Have we got the stomach for it?	Climate change activism is increasingly the domain of the young such as year old Greta Thunberg the unlikely face of the school strike for climate movement which has seen many thousands of children walk out of school to demand that their parents generation takes responsibility for leaving them a planet to live on In comparison the existing political establishment looks more and more like an impediment to change The consequences of global warming have moved from the merely theoretical and predicted to observable reality over the past few years but this has not been matched by an uptick in urgency The need to keep the wheels of capitalism well oiled takes precedence even against a backdrop of fires floods and hurricanes  Today s children as they become more politically aware will be much more radical than their parents simply because there will be no other choice for them This emergent radicalism is already taking people by surprise The Green New Deal GND a term presently most associated with year old US representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has provoked a wildly unhinged backlash from the pro free market wing who argue that it s a Trojan horse nothing more than an attempt to piggyback Marxism onto the back of climate legislation 
MAR18	For all our sakes: Theresa May’s Brexit deal must be voted down	Theresa May must fail Her first two attempts to get her Brexit deal through the Commons deserved support They forestalled crashing out of the EU with no deal next month and they took the referendum process forward  She failed twice to persuade the Commons of this As a result last week her least worst Brexit strategy lost legitimacy When the Commons voted to debate other options she voted it down She insisted she put her deal to a third vote 
MAR18	Until Christchurch I thought it was worth debating with Islamophobes. Not any more	If you have been paying attention you will know that there is now a genre of response protocol that is followed after attacks on Muslims It blows dog whistles even as carnage is unfolding A ghoulish routine has become established It usually goes like this Condemn the attack in the strongest terms and then water down that condemnation We mustn t get carried away you see and forget about the context Attacks against Muslims must not stop us from continuing to criticise Islam and Muslims when it is warranted The unvoiced subtext is that maybe these particular Muslim victims didn t have it coming but such atrocities don t come out of nowhere But you know thoughts and prayers at this difficult time  Following the Christchurch massacre there is an article I could write today to explain the danger of this forked tongue response An article that exposes the fallacy of thinking that extremist hate crimes can be separated and quarantined from the fact that western societies have become radicalised against Muslims An article that tries again to show the link between mainstream fashionable Muslim bashing and its violent manifestations on the right An article that fillets the semantic tricks played to stop Muslims ever being complete victims the line that Islam is not a race the use of women s and LBGT rights as a rhetorical stick to beat Muslims with the cant about freedom of speech political correctness and the danger of identity politics the whataboutery and the strawmanning 
MAR18	Jacinda Ardern is showing the world what real leadership is: sympathy, love and integrity	Out of the horror inflicted by those who cannot accept the world as it is comes a vision of a better world It comes from above and it comes from below It comes from ordinary people Supermarkets in Wellington suburbs have sold out of flowers tough old football coaches are talking about love and most powerful of all there are the stories of the Christchurch shooting survivors themselves Those who risked and lost their lives to save their fellow worshippers or astonishingly found it in their hearts to forgive the gunman  Then there is this year old woman the prime minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern We have watched as she shows the world what real leadership is Jacinda mania had died down since when she became the country s youngest prime minister She gave birth in office taking her baby to the United Nations general assembly meeting She became something of a celebrity appearing on US chatshows But was there any substance to her That question is asked of all women leaders What is underneath Where is the steel 
MAR18	The taboos around disability and sex put limits on everyone, disabled or not	There remains a heavy taboo around sex and disability in our culture Research by the charity Scope found that only of non disabled people have dated a disabled person while disabled young people are let down when it comes to sex education often receiving none at all or nothing appropriate to their needs  The writer and activist Penny Pepper who writes extensively about disability and sex including in her erotica collection Desires Reborn told me If disabled people aren t having sex they would like to And the reasons they re not are overwhelmingly to do with the barriers in society I ve known quite a few disabled people who because of this have resigned themselves to never having sex 
MAR19	Next, the Speaker should force MPs to vote this weekend	Ever since David Cameron took it on himself to prise open Pandora s box and call the EU referendum the only thing that s been predictable has been the utter unpredictability of what has followed The prospect of Theresa May now taking on Erskine May whose work lays down the procedural rules of the House of Commons is but the latest twist in this epic Whitehall farce His book was first published in and there is a simple reason that it s still the principal point of reference when it comes to our constitution it has passed the toughest test of all time  I had hoped it would be the start of a collegiate approach but the whole process has been executed back to front
MAR19	We’re edging away from Brexit – but both sides are set to lose	If shambolic government turned leavers into remainers Britain would have decided long ago not to bother with Brexit But that isn t how it works The sight of Theresa May failing to organise a departure from the EU proves that she is unequal to the task not necessarily that the task should be abandoned For many Eurosceptics it has the opposite effect They see the fact that Brexit has broken a stolid prime minister as confirmation that gung ho leadership is the missing ingredient  The same applies with deadlock and procedural mayhem in parliament Pro Europeans cheer when a majority of MPs vote that the country should not be yanked out of the EU without a deal They salute the Speaker of the House John Bercow when he uses ancient protocol as a bat thwacking May s twice rejected withdrawal agreement out of the Commons chamber without another vote In the eyes of a remainer this is the legislature defying of bad government democracy in action The leaver sees rogue lawmakers obstructing the popular will democracy betrayed Few minds are being changed 
MAR19	Rod Liddle vilifies disabled people. I’m tired of the hate. We all should be	You would be forgiven if weighed down by the row over the Islamophobia embedded in the British press you had missed Rod Liddle s piece in the Sunday Times about disabled people specifically those with myalgic encephalomyelitis or ME  The headline Always fatigued yet they never tire of claiming their malady really is a virus gives a fair hint at the level of bile the piece contains but to summarise Liddle uses the resignation of a researcher into ME Michael Sharpe to peddle the well worn trope that the condition is all in the mind or as he puts it that their complaints about a virus have no basis in fact It has understandably distressed many people with ME with the piece going viral on social media 
MAR19	Wake up, Italians – our country is in a state of democratic emergency	This month marks a year since the last general election in Italy Three months afterwards Matteo Salvini s League and Luigi di Maio s Five Star Movement M S took power It s time to take stock even though to tell the truth we can t stop stock taking such is the desperate situation the country finds itself in First and foremost we are in a democratic emergency Some feel there s no need for alarm after all nobody seized power by force and the government enjoys a high level of popular support an approval rating of approximately according to polls But clearly just because a government enjoys support we should not stop being clear eyed about what it is doing A liberal democracy does not become authoritarian within a few months but there are signs however slight and seemingly unconnected that seem to chart this depressing journey  A few weeks ago the Italian media greeted with alarm a report the secret services had submitted to parliament The picture it painted was hugely serious especially in two areas the growth of racist incidents as we approach the European elections in May and the inability given the propaganda and focus on closing ports to migrants from Libya to curb secret landings using small fast boats which could be bringing passengers linked to terrorist groups 
MAR19	Ardern is right not to name the Christchurch suspect. What about everyone else?	DON T say his name  Don t share the livestreamed video of the killings don t read that rambling adolescent nonsense of a manifesto don t fill newspaper front pages with stories about his childhood Ever since news broke of the terror attack on two Christchurch mosques there have been calls to deny the suspect attention in favour of focusing on victims and survivors and now New Zealand s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has put her moral authority behind them 
MAR19	The death of my mate Mike Thalassitis shows that reality TV is costing lives	Those of us who are grieving the loss of our mate Mike Thalassitis who died on Saturday remain shocked at his death However even now you won t need to look very far on social media to identify attacks and trolling that are the norm for people who have been on reality TV shows One thing s for sure when the producers of Love Island sold us the dream they never warned us about the reality we could face   They know what they re getting into people say If only that were true how differently things might have turned out I m trying to get to grips with what s just happened A year old guy My friend He couldn t go on This isn t a show This is the real thing 
MAR19	Social media addiction is not natural or normal – but is it really a disease?	Is social media addictive The issue is complex and probably generational  It s obvious that what social media does to us especially those of us who are heavy users is not natural or normal It s not normal to submit opinions for approval every day to an online crowd nor is it normal to consume the opinions of strangers in bulk It s not normal to live under the surveillance of software companies which tailor their advertising with such eerie precision that it seems impossible that they are not listening in on our conversations It s definitely not normal to wake in the night to use social media or to spend roughly hours a week on it returning again and again even though it can make us feel depressed and alone None of these behaviours were normal a few decades ago nor are they especially useful to us today but they re practised by billions of people across the world 
MAR19	Universal basic income only goes so far – free public services are essential too	Almost years ago to the day during the fiery aftermath of an early Margaret Thatcher budget the prime minister was allegedly challenged to name just two economists who endorsed her agenda of cutting public spending in the midst of recession a prescription that was otherwise sending waves through orthodox academic thinking Alan Walters and Professor Patrick Minford she is said to have replied before later remarking thank goodness they didn t ask for three  The importance of those s budgets feels a far cry from the subdued status of last week s spring statement But make no mistake just as it was in the early s significant and structural economic reform is once again discernible on the UK s political breeze albeit currently blowing harder outside government than within 
MAR19	US Republicans must follow Ardern’s lead and stand up to the gun lobby	Hours after worshippers were killed at two mosques in Christchurch New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was already promising to tighten up the country s gun laws It s a stark contrast to Donald Trump s reaction to mass shootings a written by numbers offer of thoughts and prayers then a twiddle of his thumbs until the next atrocity New Zealand s response seems to have more in common with Scotland where the massacre at Dunblane primary school in led to a ban on all handguns  There are some pronounced differences between the two countries New Zealand s gun laws are lax the UK s gun laws had already been tightened and semi automatic centrefire rifles banned in the wake of the Hungerford massacre in But what Scotland and New Zealand share is little previous experience of spree shootings a visceral shock at the scale of their country s loss and a determination to prevent it happening again 
MAR19	Smear testing on a shoestring budget: so much for Theresa May’s empathy	Yes it feels almost impossible but Theresa May was actually praised for her behaviour and leadership in the House of Commons a few months ago In January prompted by Conservative MP Rachel Maclean during prime minister s questions May encouraged women to attend cervical smear screening stating that Public Health England was to launch a campaign to boost uptake I know what it s like it is not comfortable sometimes it will be embarrassing sometimes it s painful but those few minutes can save lives  The incoming samples have increased fivefold yet the number of labs testing the results is shrinking from to nine
MAR20	Britain is in a hole – Europe, we need you to dig us out	When European leaders discuss Brexit on Thursday they should have in mind a fundamental question is the EU just a union of governments or is it also a Europe of citizens peoples democracy and destiny If it s just the former they should continue the current mainstream Brussels line of trying to help Theresa May to get her deal over the line and the UK out of the European Union as soon as possible If Europe is also the latter as French president Emmanuel Macron has eloquently argued then they must recognise that May s government is the problem not the solution and give time for the citizens peoples and democracy of Britain to work their way to a better place  More than million British citizens voted for Britain to remain in the EU in Were European citizenship personal and direct rather than contingent upon being a citizen of a member state the EU would have a clear responsibility towards us the British Europeans If we were a country we would be the ninth largest in the EU after the Netherlands and before Belgium We are joined by some million citizens of other EU countries who live in Britain That makes million 
MAR20	UK politicians ignore mass public protests at their peril	It is still just about possible with a sustained deployment of the imagination to conceive of a set of circumstances in which Theresa May might still be able to regard her Brexit policy as a success If for instance she agrees in Brussels on Thursday on the conditional short extension offered by Donald Tusk on Wednesday if she gets her third meaningful vote motion past the Speaker next week if her MPs take Tusk s offer seriously if she proves better at persuading enough of them to back her deal than in the past then just possibly it may all seem to have been worthwhile Or at least it may do so for about hours until the leadership challenge begins and the policy conflicts of the next and longer phase of Brexit negotiations with the EU start to split her party yet again  That imagined moment though has now become such a vanishingly small possibility that the final verdict on May s Brexit policy must now be of its conclusive and overwhelming failure Her Brexit policy was always to get Britain out by March with a deal that postponed all the major policy implications on the basis of Tory support buttressed only by the Democratic Unionist party and Labour s handful of anti Europeans It was always going to be a close run thing But it is not going to happen now 
MAR20	May’s latest screeching U-turn makes her utterly unfit to lead	No matter how bad you think Theresa May is she always manages to get worse Her record of insisting on one thing only to U turn weeks days or even hours later is almost impressive in its scope There would be no snap election she vowed and then there was one Her Brexit deal would be subject to a meaningful vote in December and then the vote was pulled punted into the new year Brexit would happen on March and now it won t  This latest example is the Russian doll of reversals with several other reversals contained within it For just last week May s de facto deputy David Lidington was adamant that any delay to Brexit would have to be lengthy since a short one off extension would be both pointless leaving too little time to do anything and downright reckless as well as being completely at odds with the position MPs had taken the previous evening May had told the Commons that if MPs voted down her agreement with the EU which they did she would be seeking a long extension She delivered the same message to the cabinet only yesterday 
MAR20	Lives are ruined by shame and stigma. LGBT lessons in schools are vital	One of the most dangerous and destructive things in the world is shame Shame can burrow into you so deep that it shrinks the brain and constricts the heart  Right now a row although it is not a row which makes it sound harmless is continuing between the teachers and parents of certain primary schools in parts of Birmingham and Manchester The issue is that sex and relationship education is now part of the curriculum with primary school children taught about healthy adult relationships and sex education compulsory in secondary schools including LGBT relationships Some parents mainly from Muslim backgrounds have objected to this WhatsApp groups have been set up Loudspeakers have been bought 
MAR20	Why MPs will ultimately have to back Theresa May’s deal	Britain faces a constitutional crisis according to many including at least one cabinet minister But is it a crisis simply because the rules regulating parliament make life difficult for the government  A conflict between government and parliament is almost inevitable when as with Brexit the government cannot command a majority of votes in the Commons But there is a deeper crisis within parliament itself MPs have put the European Union Withdrawal Act on the statute book which entails us leaving the EU on March in just eight days time 
MAR20	HS2 gives the game away: the plan for northern towns is managed decline	Yesterday on the day a report from the New Economics Foundation comprehensively exposed the HS project as a London boosting white elephant I found myself writing this sitting in a station Wetherspoons because my train from Liverpool to Huddersfield had been cancelled Last Saturday I missed a talk for which I had tickets because my train to Manchester again from Liverpool was cancelled On Monday I was an hour late dropping my daughter at her grandma s because our train a Northern Pacer due for the knacker s yard broke down at the terminus  NEF s report which can be read as much as an utter indictment of a directionless actively neglectful government as a cool headed analysis of a single bad idea exposes the fact that high speed rail is unnecessary for everyone except London based frequent travellers who dislike leaving the capital unless they can be there and back in half a day The report demands a better service for northern commuters the electrification of rail lines stuck in the mid th century and the reopening of old branch lines to places lost to the car 
MAR20	May’s way, the highway or … a Brexit delay? The view from Europe	One thousand days since the referendum and nine to the UK s formal departure date and the EU does not yet know how when or even if the UK will leave the union The mood in Brussels and national capitals remains focused but there is growing impatience with Theresa May and her government Even those member states that are traditionally friendly towards the UK have toughened their stance The overwhelming view is that the ball remains firmly in London s court and that it has to find a way through the turmoil  Today the union will be asked for an extension of article by London Seen against the backdrop of political and constitutional chaos in the UK the request poses enormous dilemmas for Brussels There is widespread concern that the Brexit virus will spread to infect the normal day to day business of the union something that has been avoided up to now 
MAR20	The Paris of the rich is ablaze – and that image will define Macron	It s become a kind of ritual every Saturday evening there are new images of thousands of gilets jaunes yellow vests in the streets of Paris and other French cities Every week protesters are injured by the police Every week commentators claim the movement is fading And yet the following weekend the yellow wave washes over France again The attendance numbers may fluctuate but the anger remains  The March protest was the most violent in weeks Around protesters marched in Paris Shops on the Champs Elys es were looted their windows broken ATMs were smashed Several newspaper kiosks were set ablaze destroying the livelihood of their owners an act as shocking as it is cruel and stupid especially for a movement that stands for better living and working conditions 
MAR20	Come on, UK weather forecasters – tell it like it is on climate change	They have a national reach that most climate campaigners would die for They are familiar and respected experts on the science of meteorology And they have prime time slots at the end of almost every TV news bulletin morning noon and night But the weather forecasters who guide everything from our clothing choices to our weekend plans seldom if ever mention the issue that is increasingly shaping our beloved British weather climate change  This week former BBC weatherman Bill Giles broke cover and called for the BBC and other major broadcasters to overhaul their approach to forecasts and add in information about the crucial context of climate change to their predictions about the daily weather 
MAR20	Online hate threatens us all. Platforms can and must do more to eradicate it	Like so many I was shocked to the core by the recent killing of Muslim worshippers in New Zealand As I absorbed the news my thoughts for reasons I will shortly explain turned to the technology that is so closely linked to the atrocity And let me say this clearly major platforms such as YouTube and Facebook are a primary and active component in the radicalisation of mostly young men  These organisations counter that they aim to take down content that violates their rules swiftly and are increasing resources for efforts to identify and remove dangerous material before it causes harm But clearly this isn t enough And by not doing enough to police their platforms they risk being complicit in innocent lives being violently cut short It is within their power to remove extremist content and users from their platforms and they re failing to do so in any meaningful way Crucially this is not caused by insurmountable technical problems 
MAR21	Brexit is not the cause of Britain’s political breakdown. It’s a symptom	The French EU minister Nathalie Loiseau has called her new cat Brexit He wakes me up every morning meowing to death because he wants to go out she says And then when I open the door he stays put undecided and then glares at me when I put him out The Dutch prime minister has compared Theresa May to the knight in Monty Python who has all his limbs lopped off and insists It s just a flesh wound and calls it a draw She s incredible says Mark Rutte She goes on and on At the same time I do not blame her but British politics Italian friends tell me Brexit now comes on at the end of the news in that wacky slot just before the sport and weather  Everybody is laughing at us Why wouldn t they We look ridiculous If we weren t so busy feeling betrayed bored enraged or bewildered we d be laughing at ourselves Brexit according to many of its advocates would give us the chance to stand tall and independent again to fulfil the potential as May put it two years ago to become a great global trading nation that is respected around the world and strong confident and united at home Instead we look like a cross between a beggar and basket case Yesterday May pleaded for more time and the EU said only if you can get parliament to agree to your deal May displaying all the skills of brinkmanship and diplomacy that has got us to this point then went and insulted parliamentarians making them more hostile and fearful for themselves than ever 
MAR21	Apocalypse it is, then. Not now, but probably next week	Forced to summarise Theresa May s Downing Street address to the nation last night I d go with Prime Minister Kurtz she mad They told me you had gone totally insane Martin Sheen says to Marlon Brando s rogue colonel in Apocalypse Now that your methods were unsound Are my methods unsound pants Colonel Kurtz A pause I don t see any method at all sir  Or as one minister put it of May No fucking plan nothing One day there will be a public inquiry another member of the government observed and she will be judged to have been unfit for office Meanwhile in the most ambitious crossover event since Avengers Infinity War the CBI and the TUC have put out a joint plea to Theresa May to return to at least the same postcode as her senses 
MAR21	Cyclone Idai shows the deadly reality of climate change in Africa	As Africa climate week unfurls in Ghana the countries of Mozambique Malawi and Zimbabwe count the costs of Cyclone Idai which ripped through villages and towns taking hundreds of lives and leaving a trail of destruction  For a continent already racked by the effects of the climate crisis Idai is another chilling reminder of the destructive power of the kind of storms that will become more common as the world warms up 
MAR21	Being a gay Christian can be hurtful and gruelling. But I refuse to lose faith	I was at a comedy show in Soho recently when my slightly too loud cackle attracted attention from the comedian One thing led to another and I ended up being teased affably about my love life as the audience laughed on  Once my excitement about having spoken to one of my favourite comedians Mae Martin if you re curious had died down I realised something pretty significant had happened I had said I have a girlfriend in front of a room full of people without even thinking about it 
MAR21	Labour’s been mocked for calling for an election. Now it’s the only way out	We are being trolled by a prime minister who is prepared to drive a nation into the abyss to preserve the cohesion of the Conservative party Like a partner who perennially hints at a romantic three course meal and a possible popping of the question only to give you beans on toast Theresa May served up another anticlimax with her national address She provided no exit routes out of a building she has set alight merely attacking a parliament she forced the electorate to vote for less than two years previously  It is the most basic statement of political reality to say that Britain s national crisis has been manufactured by the Conservatives but it s one that needs repeating in a media environment rigged in favour of the right A generation long Tory power struggle and the disastrous attempts to navigate it by David Cameron and his successor have brought Britain to its knees The narrative over the coming days will be that the onus is on Labour to accept May s deal a deal both remainers and leavers are united in judging to be terrible or condemn Britain to no deal 
MAR21	Islamophobic attacks in the UK leave Muslims feeling increasingly anxious	Friday marks one week since the terrorist atrocity in New Zealand in which a year old Australian man published an online white supremacist manifesto and then went into two mosques in Christchurch with multiple firearms opening fire and killing Muslims as they prayed Nobody was spared from his Islamophobic massacre not even children One of the youngest casualties was three year old Mucad Ibrahim who was at the mosque with his family  One week on the implications of those terrorist crimes in New Zealand are having a profound and deep impact on Muslim communities across the world including here in the UK Many of us are traumatised Many of us feel horrified We are devastated We are broken and we are terrified 
MAR21	Too many rape and abuse victims are being let down by the police	The domestic abuse bill currently going through parliament is set to add new powers to deal with perpetrators of domestic abuse but there are already a wide range of powers available to police that are simply not being used  In fact the level of protection has declined dramatically over the past two years since changes to the pre charge bail regime in April These introduced onerous requirements on the police when bail is granted and it seems that officers are avoiding these by releasing suspects without bail and using voluntary interviews instead of arrest 
MAR21	We’re working like it’s 1975, but the UK jobs boom isn’t all it seems. Here’s why	Britain s recent jobs record has been remarkable The economy is chugging along but the last time the unemployment rate was as low as it is today was in the winter of Harold Wilson was prime minister Derby County were on course to win the old first division David Bowie was about to release Young Americans  Back then things were about to take a turn for the worse Prices were rising fast and later in inflation would hit a postwar peak of more than Unemployment also rose leading to the coining of a new term stagflation In there was the mother and father of a sterling crisis that ended with spending cuts being imposed by the International Monetary Fund 
MAR21	The depressing truth about female creativity and the pram in the hallway	There are times in every parent s life when however much they try to avoid it the professional and the domestic messily collide It happened to me a few years ago when during a teachers training day I took my seven year old with me to interview Joan Collins over lunch Collins was delighted at her presence and ordered her a giant bowl of ice cream However halfway through the conversation she suddenly looked startled fumbled under the table for a bit and then pulled out a sticky pink spattered Chanel shoe I do believe dear Lily has dropped ice cream in my shoe she announced looking a little pained  For the singer Sophie Ellis Bextor this clash of the personal and professional has become a regular ritual as she fields questions about the practicalities of child rearing and how she makes it work It was with palpable exasperation that she tweeted this week I love making music I love promoting a new record I do not love talking over and over about how I sort my childcare I am a singer I am a mum I will sort the childcare 
MAR21	Nine days from ‘Brexit day’, does anyone have a clue what’s happening?	Ask any country what are you doing in nine days time and it would go something like this  Sweden Same old same old 
MAR22	Think no-deal Brexit has been taken off the table? Think again	The cliff edge has moved a tiny bit further away but it s still there Britain will not crash out of the European Union next Friday thanks to a last act of clemency by the nations we re about to leave behind But crashing out remains a possibility even a likelihood It might not be a deliberate choice made by the people of these islands but rather an accident the product of a series of decisions that were taken and more often not taken Just as the imperial powers stumbled into a war no one wanted in so the risk remains that we will not jump off the cliff that looms ahead of us but stumble over it  Of course it s still possible that Theresa May will bring back her deal perhaps as soon as Monday that MPs will vote for it and the UK will leave in a stable and orderly fashion on May But it hardly seems likely There was a time in the middle of this week when you could imagine that happening MPs were clearly spooked by the imminence of a no deal crash out in a matter of days a prospect so terrifying that the leaders of the TUC and the CBI broke from all precedent to issue a joint warning of a national emergency predicting that if there was no deal the shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come Previously hostile MPs talked of swallowing their objections and voting for May s withdrawal agreement But two things happened to halt that shift just as it was beginning 
MAR22	For Theresa May, ‘I’m a tin-eared lunatic’ seems to be the hardest word	Arriving at the EU summit this week Theresa May had that purposeful air of a school superintendent walking up the drive to the Addams family mansion determined that Wednesday and Pugsley should be enrolled in a conventional educational establishment without delay Some long hours later May staggered back down the drive much as that school superintendent might short of having no shoes and an actual bat in her electrocuted hair  And so to the latest scenes in the Brexit farce The formula for successful farce writing as laid down in the th century is to get your character up a tree in the first act throw stones at them in the second then get them down in the third As far as Brexit goes the UK went up the tree voluntarily and has now been throwing human waste at itself for two and a half years Does anyone want to come and get us down Sorry it s quite disgusting up here now 
MAR22	How the media let malicious idiots take over	If our politics is becoming less rational crueller and more divisive this rule of public life is partly to blame the more disgracefully you behave the bigger the platform the media will give you If you are caught lying cheating boasting or behaving like an idiot you ll be flooded with invitations to appear on current affairs programmes If you play straight don t expect the phone to ring  In an age of hour news declining ratings and intense competition the commodity in greatest demand is noise Never mind the content never mind the facts all that now counts is impact A loudmouthed buffoon already the object of public outrage is a far more bankable asset than someone who knows what they re talking about So the biggest platforms are populated by blusterers and braggarts The media is the mirror in which we see ourselves With every glance our self image subtly changes 
MAR22	It’s time for my Conservative party to root out Islamophobia for good	For better or worse it s in our nature to avoid difficult conversations And no wonder a tough conversation poorly held can hurt more than it heals  But avoidance only takes you so far From my time as a youth worker I know that difficult conversations don t become easier the longer you put them off That s why I know it s time for Conservatives to have a proper conversation about Islamophobia There is simply too much hate floating around online these days and too much of it is appearing intentionally or not under our banner We must root it out now 
MAR22	Parents are exploiting their children on YouTube for fame and easy money	When my twins were babies I caught a short episode of them on video in which one leaned over and snatched the pacifier from the other one s mouth and for a second I dreamed of putting it on YouTube and scoring one of those baby does hilarious thing hits in which the ad revenue rolls in while you sleep and you are rewarded simply for being alive  I didn t upload the video in the end for the same reason I didn t do anything much in that period beyond running round my apartment in concentric circles picking things up and then putting them down again But the memory of that temptation the gold rush sense that there was easy money to be made if one could only capture a moment of spontaneous fun involving one s children remained and like most gold rushes its pull is a vortex 
MAR22	Mary Warnock embodied the best of Britain’s ruling class before Thatcher	In many ways Mary Warnock whose death was announced on Thursday represented the best of Britain s ruling class as it was between the war and the rise of Margaret Thatcher  The kind of tough minded realistic and self confident liberalism that she embodied was once a quality that foreigners admired in Britain It was elitist and not particularly democratic she and her husband rose to the very top of the Oxbridge system he as vice chancellor of Oxford University she as the head of colleges in both universities When I went to see her in her semi retirement in a village on the edge of Savernake Forest Wiltshire she was unashamed about collecting her attendance allowance from the House of Lords She needed the money she said and she earned it she did the work 
MAR22	It’s not too late to stop Brexit. Saturday’s march will force politicians to hear us	Last weekend Tim Shipman the political editor of the Sunday Times tweeted The urge to march for things and against things is one I have never understood Why not write a letter instead  He may have been referring to the start of the March to Leave Nigel Farage s much derided venture that saw a handful of bedraggled Brexit supporters trudging through the rainswept and muddy countryside But Shipman may also have been thinking about this Saturday s Put it to the People March which promises to be somewhat larger as hundreds of thousands take to the streets of London to demand the final say on any Brexit deal 
MAR22	As someone with cystic fibrosis I’m not sure I want to see Five Feet Apart – but you should	The film Five Feet Apart was released in the UK today but even as it reaches audiences it is dividing the cystic fibrosis community  The film is based on the fictional story of two teenagers with the illness Because of the huge dangers of cross infection between cystic fibrosis patients they are supposed to follow medical advice and stay six feet apart at all times However love gets in the way and they decide to take back control of their lives their relationship and just one foot 
MAR22	Teaching assistants are invaluable to learning – so why are we being axed?	Next month I could lose my job My years as a teaching assistant could be coming to an end due to government cuts in education  Across the London borough of Hackney where I work schools have had government cuts to per pupil funding since Headteachers have been left with the unenviable task of cutting back on subjects and staff to balance the books Often teaching assistants are the first to go Our role is to support pupils in the classroom through assisting teachers in the delivery of the national curriculum to all children For some of us this could involve working as a full classroom assistant while for many it is the one to one or small group interventions that are considered of greatest need 
MAR22	Are we not all Lorraine Kelly, playing versions of ourselves?	These are testing times in the theatre of the self A war is being fought over our identities The most powerful technology in the world is modelling and predicting our behaviours so that they might more effectively be monetised Some elemental human questions are suddenly in play again am I what I say I am or am I what others say I am Is there such a thing as free will Are friends electric But we contemplate them in arenas designed for profit we scream our frustration in emojis a language designed by committee  But cometh the hour cometh the daytime TV presenter Her name is Lorraine Kelly Her name is also Lorraine Kelly In Wednesday s tribunal judgment Lorraine Kelly set a worrying precedent for the future of celebrity taxation but quite an interesting precedent in the meta narrative of the human self She has reserved the right to what John Updike termed Maskenfreiheit mask freedom You see the Lorraine Kelly you see on ITV isn t Lorraine Kelly but Lorraine Kelly a fictional character who may resemble Lorraine Kelly in manner appearance and infectious Glaswegian chuckle but who isn t the real Lorraine Kelly Owing to a few peculiarities of tax law that distinction might just have saved her m 
MAR23	One thing now unites Britons – a sense of national humiliation	The hundreds of thousands marching were patriots Not patriots of the flag waving chest beating type but patriots determined to stop their fellow citizens suffering and a humiliated Britain being torn apart   Traitors saboteurs citizens of nowhere Remoaners The right has deployed the language of civil war for three years The insults carried with them the threat that dissenters would be treated as enemies within but also the promise and the hope that left to its own devices Brexit would restore Britain s greatness 
MAR23	How will British museums survive if they subject every donor to an ethical audit?	Consumers of culture will have been aware of the name Sackler above the frame of rooms and galleries in artistic institutions around the world I remember once briefly wondering when ducking under such an arch how they had made the money that permitted such extensive philanthropy  Now everyone knows The photographer Nan Goldin has advertised demonstrations outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York and threatened to withdraw a planned exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London in protest at the institutions receiving donations from the Sacklers 
MAR23	Ricky Gervais offers proof, if needed, that there is life after The Office	I kept walking in on my partner last week quietly crying over the laptop Not as might be reasonable to expect because she is stuck in an infinite current affairs loop never knowing when she might be freed from the horrors but because she has been watching Ricky Gervais s new sitcom After Life on Netflix You re not allowed to watch it with me she said pointedly closing the lid I m enjoying it and you ll ruin it Go somewhere else  Rude I thought and then said something about how the reviews hadn t been very good anyway which only proved her point The reviews I read have not been particularly kind it s true but already After Life seems to have reached Bohemian Rhapsody levels of division between what critics have made of it and what real life viewers think On a recent episode of Gogglebox the families who do not usually agree on what they re watching all collapsed into paroxysms of laughter at a gag about Gervais s character Tony being called a paedo 
MAR23	Let’s stop pretending exercise is fun. Like work, you’ve just got to do it	Here s a harsh truth about fitness that you don t often hear exercise sucks For some of us anyway I envy those people I see posting online about their completed half marathons with messianic zeal I feel so alive For people like myself there s no redemptive endorphin rush Exercising is just a repetitive bore to be dreaded and endured If a Slendertone thingy machine actually did the same job with electronic pads as I sprawled on the sofa watching Lindsay Lohan s Beach Club I d sell my children s kidneys to buy it Worst of all tedious though it is for most exercise is beyond beneficial it s vital health wellbeing weight the lot so we slackers just have to park our bad attitudes and crack on  There s a giant con at the heart of exercise that is a lot of effort goes into hard selling it as FUN when for many people it frankly isn t Right now there s a backlash against enterTRAINment see what they did there where people are enticed into boutique gyms to do classes that are new trendy fusion themed high intensity hula hooping or whatever One argument is that in this climate anything that gets people into gyms is great but others think that people would be better off with low key targeted workouts All very interesting but maybe it s fundamentally counterproductive to keep pushing this idea that exercise per se is supposed to be fun Why not just tell people the truth it s a relentless boring nightmare and you re going to have to do it anyway 
MAR23	Theresa May has failed to offer sound leadership in this toxic Brexit phase	How has it come to this Theresa May and her husband Philip have long been friends of mine and I have in the past admired her sense of duty and commitment to her party and her country So it grieves me that her stubborn choices have left both in peril  At a time when our politics needs statesmanship not brinkmanship when our divided people need time to heal and come back together and when our country needs honest leadership rooted in reality not ideology Mrs May has embraced division Rather than providing the calm compassionate and unifying leadership we so desperately needed after a divisive EU referendum campaign she rushed to own Brexit She has clung to power in the process but she is letting us all down 
MAR23	Why I am marching against Brexit today	The tide is turning and today is the day that we the people reclaim our democracy On the streets of London hundreds of thousands of us will be marching on parliament in support of parliament We reject the prime minister s assertion that she is the tribune of the people uniquely able to divine our interests divinely entitled to rule We reject her deal which leaves us poorer and more isolated We reject her government which has humiliated us on the international stage and enfeebled us at home Instead we say to MPs that now is the time to assert themselves to reject her threats and her jibes and to give back to the people the final say on Brexit  Remember why we are where we are When I resigned from the National Infrastructure Commission to campaign against Brexit and for a referendum just short of months ago it felt as though Brexit was a done deal Everywhere I went I met people who however they had voted in were dismayed by the reality of Brexit but convinced there was no alternative It was soft Brexit versus hard Brexit not no Brexit which is in truth the only alternative 
MAR23	Think no-deal Brexit has been taken off the table? Think again	The cliff edge has moved a tiny bit further away but it s still there Britain will not crash out of the European Union next Friday thanks to a last act of clemency by the nations we re about to leave behind But crashing out remains a possibility even a likelihood It might not be a deliberate choice made by the people of these islands but rather an accident the product of a series of decisions that were taken and more often not taken Just as the imperial powers stumbled into a war no one wanted in so the risk remains that we will not jump off the cliff that looms ahead of us but stumble over it  Of course it s still possible that Theresa May will bring back her deal perhaps as soon as Monday that MPs will vote for it and the UK will leave in a stable and orderly fashion on May But it hardly seems likely There was a time in the middle of this week when you could imagine that happening MPs were clearly spooked by the imminence of a no deal crash out in a matter of days a prospect so terrifying that the leaders of the TUC and the CBI broke from all precedent to issue a joint warning of a national emergency predicting that if there was no deal the shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come Previously hostile MPs talked of swallowing their objections and voting for May s withdrawal agreement But two things happened to halt that shift just as it was beginning 
MAR23	Tottenham Hotspur station? Some hate it, but branding the railways is nothing new	Names that were once freely chosen so freely that you hardly gave them a thought now come with sums of money attached Market principles operate In north London for example Tottenham Hotspur FC has reportedly gone to considerable trouble and expense to persuade Transport for London to rename the local railway station after the club The station White Hart Lane has been there since Spurs moved next door into a ground of the same name much later in A pub the White Hart had been there long before either  For all this time and more the names of public places such as stations and sports grounds arrived as the gifts of geography or history No longer In Tottenham a new stadium has recently been completed adjacent to the old one and tomorrow the first proper game of football will be played on its turf Crowd capacity has increased from to at a cost estimated between m and m according to how much non building work you include What the club needs and so far hasn t found is a business that will defray some of this expense by buying the naming rights At present the new ground goes by the name of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium but this is temporary The club needs to fit another word in there somehow Diageo Aviva Nike Sony Topshop that kind of thing 
MAR23	For Theresa May, ‘I’m a tin-eared lunatic’ seems to be the hardest word	Arriving at the EU summit this week Theresa May had that purposeful air of a school superintendent walking up the drive to the Addams family mansion determined that Wednesday and Pugsley should be enrolled in a conventional educational establishment without delay Some long hours later May staggered back down the drive much as that school superintendent might short of having no shoes and an actual bat in her electrocuted hair  And so to the latest scenes in the Brexit farce The formula for successful farce writing as laid down in the th century is to get your character up a tree in the first act throw stones at them in the second then get them down in the third As far as Brexit goes the UK went up the tree voluntarily and has now been throwing human waste at itself for two and a half years Does anyone want to come and get us down Sorry it s quite disgusting up here now 
MAR23	How the media let malicious idiots take over	If our politics is becoming less rational crueller and more divisive this rule of public life is partly to blame the more disgracefully you behave the bigger the platform the media will give you If you are caught lying cheating boasting or behaving like an idiot you ll be flooded with invitations to appear on current affairs programmes If you play straight don t expect the phone to ring  In an age of hour news declining ratings and intense competition the commodity in greatest demand is noise Never mind the content never mind the facts all that now counts is impact A loudmouthed buffoon already the object of public outrage is a far more bankable asset than someone who knows what they re talking about So the biggest platforms are populated by blusterers and braggarts The media is the mirror in which we see ourselves With every glance our self image subtly changes 
MAR24	May’s time is up. She must make way for a caretaker prime minister	There is an unforgettable moment in Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip that comes unexpectedly to mind in these strange and desperate times for our country In it the comedian recalls an encounter with his close friend the legendary NFL running back Jim Brown  Pryor is in a wretched mess confined to his room freebasing cocaine with a pipe that he imagines is whispering to him Brown is unimpressed He simply asks What you gonna do Again And again And again In March the UK is Pryor strung out in this case on Brexit and the rest of the world is Jim Brown Everyone can see that this is a country on the edge of nervous collapse 
MAR24	Can we all chill out about cannabis? Not quite yet	Occasionally during my love affair with marijuana I would experience perceptual disruptions profound enough to freak me out One time I was driving along a crowded road when my car seemed a little wobbly and then listed towards the centre an alarming thud thud emanating from the back end In the middle of a densely populated spot without a hard shoulder I crept slowly across a few lanes of traffic and pulled to a stop Concentrating very hard I got out of the car to assess and hopefully change the flat tyre I rarely got paranoid from smoking weed neither did it typically make me sleepy Instead I was among the lucky ones as the drug made everyday activities such as gardening waiting on tables and talking to my family bearable if not interesting So I was shocked and embarrassed to find after a few minutes of close inspection amid the honking horns that there was nothing wrong with the car  At the time I took hallucinations as evidence of a good score Now as an ex smoker and neuroscientist whose focus is addictive drugs I know that my resilient response to this stressful experience was contingent on having a neurotypical brain Neural pathways are forged by finely orchestrated signals for synapse growth and pruning disruptions can result in atypical neural connections that increase the risk of psychosis The liability may be unmasked by environmental conditions that can essentially be reduced to an ambiguous but well recognised bogeyman stress 
MAR24	One thing now unites Britons – a sense of national humiliation	The hundreds of thousands marching were patriots Not patriots of the flag waving chest beating type but patriots determined to stop their fellow citizens suffering and a humiliated Britain being torn apart   Traitors saboteurs citizens of nowhere Remoaners The right has deployed the language of civil war for three years The insults carried with them the threat that dissenters would be treated as enemies within but also the promise and the hope that left to its own devices Brexit would restore Britain s greatness 
MAR24	How to report terrorism: name, but don’t amplify	In one of several impressive acts of leadership New Zealand s parliament opened last Tuesday with the Speaker inviting an imam to lead prayers first in Arabic then English In Hansard the last of these verses of patience reads Oh Lord we ask you to protect New Zealand and the whole world from such calamities Amen  Would we be better protected if journalists followed the urging of New Zealand s prime minister Jacinda Ardern and did not name the perpetrators of acts of terrorism We can acknowledge her skilful and empathetic response to the shooting of scores of people at two Christchurch mosques on March We can recognise that Ardern s purpose as prime minister was rightly to turn the focus on those lost and mourned But is she correct in implying that acts of terror will be deterred if no one speaks the names of perpetrators Can should notoriety as distinct from glorification or anti hero status be denied 
MAR24	MPs must seize control of the Brexit calamity. Mrs May has already lost it	A symbolic casualty of Britain s rolling roiling Brexit debacle is the commemorative p coin bearing the date March which the government had planned to release It was one of their more idiotic ideas to put such an item in the nation s pockets and purses when the country is so divided and its destiny is swirled with such a dense fog of uncertainty The coin is now as redundant as the prime minister who signed off on it Britain won t be leaving the EU to the deadline that Theresa May has held so sacred that she swore she would not be deflected from it on more than occasions  Her inability to meet her own date is one illustration of the failure of her broken Brexit strategy Another is the heel stamping manner in which she responded to this latest episode in her thick volume of humiliations Shortly before she went to Brussels to seek a postponement to Britain s withdrawal from the EU the prime minister had a temper tantrum that was no prettier for being dressed up as a televised address to the nation The inflammatory speech from Number in which she sought to rouse voters against parliament by displacing the blame on to MPs was thought appalling by her own chief whip Other cabinet colleagues condemned it in much riper language 
MAR24	Christchurch attacks: the media's rush to be first causes its own kind of harm	Rookie journalists struggling with their copy are often told by news editors Just tell the story An esteemed colleague once told me his first editor told him to imagine shouting the intro to an aged relative moving away at speed on a bus  Boiling an event down to who what why where and when is the basis of all news coverage for a reason it tells the story But what happens when being fast and crafting a simple narrative becomes misleading or causes its own kind of harm 
MAR24	Public intellectuals have never been more vital. Let Mary Warnock be a guide	A couple of years ago the death of a public intellectual such as the philosopher Mary Warnock who died on Thursday would be marked by reflections on whether we have seen the death of the public intellectual as a phenomenon  In when an academic psychologist can do sell out lecture tours off the back of YouTube success there s less reason to believe that the public is repulsed by big ideas unfussily presented Unfortunately that psychologist is Jordan Peterson and his big ideas are a mush of homily and conservatism making it tempting to wish that public intellectuals really weren t a thing any more 
MAR24	How will British museums survive if they subject every donor to an ethical audit?	Consumers of culture will have been aware of the name Sackler above the frame of rooms and galleries in artistic institutions around the world I remember once briefly wondering when ducking under such an arch how they had made the money that permitted such extensive philanthropy  Now everyone knows The photographer Nan Goldin has advertised demonstrations outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York and threatened to withdraw a planned exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London in protest at the institutions receiving donations from the Sacklers 
MAR24	Does Britain really want an isolated future, buffeted by forces beyond our control?	Leave our shores and Brexit appears even more hopelessly strange and the people perpetrating it even more peculiar than they do when you are at home In Asia where I have spent the past week figures such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees Mogg are seen as curiosities with views that are openly risible Of course it s stupid to leave the world s biggest trading bloc and make your now lonely future dependent upon the kindness of unforgiving strangers Can t they see that  No country has ever done what Britain is attempting because it is so obviously crazed Trade agreements are a carefully balanced mutual opening of partners markets with a hard to work through calculus of gains and losses that takes years even decades to negotiate Brexiters promised that Britain would be different and that unravelling a year old web of deep relationships would be quick and effortless with Britain holding all the cards All palpably false 
MAR24	Silencing Islamophobes is as futile a response as banning the Qur’an	What drove Brenton Tarrant the Christchurch gunman to commit his heinous acts It s a question that has understandably occupied much media space A key debate has been over the role of anti Muslim hatred and its entrenchment in mainstream society  In an open letter Britain s counter terror chief Neil Basu called out the mainstream media for the messaging that fuels far right terrorists It s a theme echoed by many on the left 
MAR25	The Tories are no longer a party, and Theresa May must know that	Just another day in Brexit deadlock as the prime minister rose to address the parliament she had so brutishly insulted with her demagogic I am on your side attempt to speak to the people over MPs heads No apology but she came to admit that her deal was in the quicksands sinking fast and she dared not bring it back for another trouncing She is where she put herself disgracefully in hock to the bigots and bullies of the Democratic Unionist party who act against the will of remain majority Northern Irish voters Jeremy Corbyn was polite to call this a national embarrassment this is far far worse than a few blushes  For parliament to seize control would May wrongly claimed set a dangerous precedent
MAR25	With millions on the streets or signed up, remainers cannot be ignored	The anti Brexit rally on Saturday was probably the first central London demonstration in living memory that Jeremy Corbyn hasn t attended except for the last People s Vote march of course Instead he was on a campaign visit to Morecambe There was deliberation to all this in a childishly provocative tweet the Labour party chirpily asked last Friday Big weekend plans Find an event near you In bitter spirits I put in my postcode Vauxhall central London and was invited to rebuildbritain by attending a meeting in Swanley miles away in Kent on the day of the largest demonstration since Iraq  Corbyn s motivation in this steadfast abstinence from a swell of protest at which he should naturally be at the crest is always put down to his Euroscepticism which has morphed among commentators from he s not too keen on Europe to he hates Europe This is overstatement and a diversion what s really happened is that a strategy devised for has failed to update 
MAR25	Theresa May is effectively gone. She is a leader in name only	Brexit is the biggest peacetime crisis we have faced and a no deal Brexit could provoke a national emergency The depth and scale of the divisions and the narrowness of the majority in favour of leaving the EU mean that the most sensible step would be to put the issue on hold complete the negotiations and then hold a referendum Sadly that option is not available  But it is in the next phase of negotiations that the details of the UK s future relationship with the EU will be fleshed out Depending on what happens in those negotiations either we will see virtually no change to our current status in which case what is the point of leaving Or as is much more likely the Brexiteers will demand significant changes to reflect their own views views that will appal and frighten much of the electorate when they realise the enormity of what is being done In essence Brexiteers want to dismantle much of what we regard as the underpinning of civilised life in the modern world 
MAR25	Thank EU for the music – not the grasping tech giants	Shakespeare writes about a man who sold his goodly manor for a song The way I read it the Bard implies that a song would be worth very little if not to himself at least to the people in his audience A song is such a weightless elusive phenomenon How can anyone put a value on that  Ever since Shakespeare s day for a song has been an idiom that represents something you get very cheaply The YouTubes of this world know this and they d like to keep it that way They say thank you for the music and make millions off songs we all love and cherish while the writer gets a pittance 
MAR25	Women’s lib freed us from domestic drudgery – so what’s with today’s competitive cleaning?	The world is a mess Pollution and all that eco jazz Your body is also a mess full of toxins that need cleansing Your skin is ungodly and needs a good hot cloth treatment and expensive cream And your house Well it s an absolute tip  Foxes have eaten my recycling so rubbish is strewn all over the road A card was popped through my door offering to steam my carpets a treatment that seemed more expensive than buying some new carpets The last man who cleaned my windows disappeared after a complicated divorce and quite frankly I can t be bothered any more 
MAR25	Jacob, Boris and the so-called coup – what really happened at Chequers?	On Sunday in a sit down meal probably a shade more horrific but less cerebral than that scene in Hannibal when a corrupt official is served a slice of his own brain to eat Theresa May invited some of her cabinet to Chequers for Sunday lunch  The guest list I m sorry was just a roll call of those now familiar basic white boy names David Davis David Lidington Damian Green Dominic Raab Steve Baker Steve Barclay Michael Gove Alistair Burt and Boris Johnson were also invited as were those excess syllabic numpties Jacob Rees Mogg and Iain Duncan Smith so awful they named them both three times I am not sure if there was a specific dress code but you were not allowed to come if you were not an older white man collectively known as a blizzard 
MAR25	Brexit: what’s the least worst outcome of this week? Our panel responds	Stalemate impasse roadblock was the ineluctable result of a crude in out referendum dangling a dozen Brexit rainbows No one true Brexit was ever put to voters The closest to a healing compromise now is the well constructed Kyle Wilson amendment let parliament agree a Brexit but only if voters confirm their support Put it to the people as pressed by the million marchers not a second referendum but a new proposition on an actual Brexit seen in the cold light of day is this what you meant  This week a series of indicative votes may find a parliamentary majority for something else customs union Norway or indeed the prime minister s miserable offering Polls show that people have changed their mind quite radically an percentage point lead for remain Perversely Theresa May insists scores of MPs should make a U turn but refuses voters any right to a change of heart 
MAR25	No collusion, plenty of corruption: Trump is not in the clear	Suspend your disbelief for a second  Assume that the Trump administration which lies so easily and so often on matters big and small can tell the truth about the Mueller investigation Forget the cover up about separating families at the border and jailing children Pretend it has fully embraced the death toll of more than Americans in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria Imagine Trump s inauguration crowds really were exceptionally large 
MAR25	The global battle for the internet is just starting	If only for a moment set aside the comparatively parochial drama of Brexit think about the giant swath of humanity that now uses the internet and consider one of the most basic facets of how billion of us live our lives This is a st century story but it will ring bells with people old enough to remember the cold war how people understand their own experience and events in the wider world is increasingly decided by the version of the internet they use  On one side sits the system used in China which produces vast amounts of personal data and blurs into a huge apparatus of state surveillance and censorship This model is centred on two online behemoths whose dominance partly comes down to the fact that Chinese consumerism is all about paying via your smartphone rather than an old fashioned plastic card There s the e commerce conglomerate Alibaba and Tencent which owns WeChat the platform used by more than billion people every day It does so many things payments social networking messaging travel booking gaming that participating in society without it seems all but impossible 
MAR25	May’s time is up. She must make way for a caretaker prime minister	There is an unforgettable moment in Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip that comes unexpectedly to mind in these strange and desperate times for our country In it the comedian recalls an encounter with his close friend the legendary NFL running back Jim Brown  Pryor is in a wretched mess confined to his room freebasing cocaine with a pipe that he imagines is whispering to him Brown is unimpressed He simply asks What you gonna do Again And again And again In March the UK is Pryor strung out in this case on Brexit and the rest of the world is Jim Brown Everyone can see that this is a country on the edge of nervous collapse 
MAR26	Get set for Brexit: Indicative Day – the one where the Grand Wizards turn on each other	Draw near true believers for these are dark days for the ERG Brexit ultras The Fellowship of the Ringpieces finds itself divided on their next move and may yet be bitterly sundered as they ponder the big question could they honestly have played it worse  Before we help them answer it a quick update on which bit of Blunderland we ve tumbled into now Late on Monday night the House of Commons voted to take control of the parliamentary agenda and attempt to break the Brexit deadlock via a series of indicative votes masterminded by former Tory minister Oliver Letwin A clue a clue Our kingdom for a clue Like all initiatives handled by Oliver Letwin since the s it promises to go spectacularly wrong in ways we haven t even thought of yet but let s pretend otherwise before the shitstorm gets properly under way on Wednesday 
MAR26	Playgrounds only for the rich kids? What grotesque social apartheid	One playground for the children of the rich another for the poor  It s hard to think of an idea more crassly offensive than a supposedly mixed housing development where even toddlers are deliberately segregated by their parents salaries where small children have to be told they can t play with their friends on the swings their flats actually overlook because that s not for the likes of them But that is what appears to have happened at the Baylis Old School development in south London where an impenetrable hedge separates the owner occupiers children s playground from the social and affordable rented housing in the same block 
MAR26	Jamie Dimon, spare us your crocodile tears about inequality	If I may be so bold as to try to lure your attention away from Trump and Mueller for a moment consider Jamie Dimon s lament delivered a few days before Mueller delivered his report  Dimon is the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase and wrongdoing by him and the CEOs of other big corporations is more responsible for Trump s election than anything Russia dreamed of as I ll explain 
MAR26	Don’t knock the humble vox pop. It’s a vital tool of journalism	A lot of people it seems are sick of vox pops With British politics becoming ever more bitterly dysfunctional debate becoming more polarised and the media less trusted the humble vox pop has become a symbol of what has gone wrong with the way we talk politics  The comedian David Baddiel complains that those chosen to give their views are always from a leave constituency Because that s where people will be crossest His fellow comedian and broadcaster Danny Baker agrees suggesting that the media crews always go to cliched haunts where they think they can find real people The political scientist Rob Ford says the people and places are picked according to the stereotypes and usually just confirm the biases of said narratives 
MAR26	You can give all your money away, but it won’t solve poverty	Globally income inequality is rising Poverty remains a very real and very visible ill in most of the world It is humbling then to hear of Peter Tabichi a science teacher from rural Kenya who has won the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher prize for donating of his annual salary to charitable causes primarily in supporting the poorest pupils at his school to buy necessities such as uniforms and books  It s undoubtedly a generous act and almost certainly one born of noble ideals Whether you re religious or not Tabichi is a good example of the ideology espoused by Franciscan orders There is a strong tradition in Franciscan thought of social entrepreneurship and of taking steps to alleviate poverty collectively It s a rare thing to see in practice though and there are many religious people of all faiths who don t feel such an imperative to support philanthropic causes 
MAR26	Don't say Trump is exonerated. It's too soon for that	To listen to the Trump administration right now you would think that Robert Mueller has exonerated the president found Hillary Clinton and the liberal media guilty of treason and definitively proven once and for all that Donald Trump s inauguration crowd really was the largest in world history  Indeed the initial rollout of Mueller s conclusions has been a public relations triumph for the president mainly because it was in the hands of Trump s hand picked attorney general William Barr In the four page letter which Barr delivered to Congress less than words are quoted directly from Mueller s report But while these words certainly tell us something they hide much more than they reveal And Barr s decision to exonerate Trump on the charge of obstruction of justice something Mueller himself declined to do likewise raises a suite of questions about his reasoning and motives 
MAR26	Michael Jackson’s life showed us the journey from abused to abuser	Jimmy Savile Harvey Weinstein R Kelly Kevin Spacey We are not exactly short these days of celebrities accused of exploiting their fame to mask predatory behaviour Yet the Michael Jackson case is different And that s not just because he is still so passionately defended by some including most recently Barbra Streisand and Diana Ross while he also simultaneously did so little to mask his predatoriness  In his lifetime he talked happily about sharing his bed with little boys and was rarely photographed more than six feet away from one even after he was publicly accused four times of child sexual abuse by Jordy Chandler Gavin Arvizo and two boys who accused him of molestation during the Arvizo trial both of whom received financial payouts But with every other high profile story of child abuse the adult predator is presented solely as just that an adult predator a fully formed inexplicable monster 
MAR26	Is it too soon, too unsettling, for pro-IRA chants to be trivialised?	When does Up the RA not mean Up the RA When the England footballer Declan Rice who played for the Republic of Ireland before switching allegiance apologised for using the pro IRA slogan on a recently unearthed social media post he made as a year old it added to a strange momentum the aesthetics of Irish republicanism are gaining as they are repurposed by a new generation  The website Vice recently published an article headlined How militant Irish republican slogans went viral and they are on to something The appropriating of slogans and imagery that were once dangerous is happening and it is happening among a generation that lacks a memory of the peak of the Troubles simply because they hadn t been born In Up the RA is layered and esoteric For some it s mindlessly chanted without any context bar a sense of misplaced patriotism and ignorance For others it s subversive and transgressive playing with a taboo with the safe benefit of distance For yet others it is the trivialising of the slogan to the point of undermining the perceived power of the IRA itself its authority is so depleted that it s now a joke and only the slogan remains as punctuation Or it s just a dumb meme 
MAR26	After Mueller, the need for oversight of Trump is as urgent as ever	The Mueller report is finished and Donald Trump was found not to have colluded with Russians during the presidential election in And Trump based on his attorney general s four page summary was quick to declare victory Complete and total EXONERATION he boasted  Once again Trump misled America 
MAR26	Wales is right to ban smacking. But it’s not the whole solution	When you ve been awake since dawn you haven t spoken to another adult for six hours you re having your first period in two years and your baby is refusing to go to sleep despite having been awake since am there is a very fine line between playfully flicking bits of sheepskin out of your child s hand before they eat it and just hitting your child  I know because a few months ago I found myself alone in a park bathed in golden springtime sunshine genuinely worried that I was about to hit my son This was not some theoretical musing about the nature of reasonable force but the frayed nerve feeling of a parent reaching the very end of their ability to cope Had I grown up in an environment where smacking had been part of my family s emotional language if I d been smacked as a child and lived to tell the tale if slapping smacking pinching or hitting children had been considered normal during my childhood then I might very well have smacked my own child that day Luckily very luckily I was able to walk into a nearby children s centre plonk him by a miniature sandpit full of plastic dinosaurs watch him wave cheerfully to the play worker laying out a rainbow of jumbo felt tip pens walk into the corner out of sight and let out all the fury and fatigue that had been welling up inside me all day in one huge sigh 
MAR27	Farewell to the worst prime minister bar none – until the next one	Theresa May will leave office in an orderly handover whenever an EU withdrawal deal is done No one is weeping The oddity is we may yet come to miss her though she has been the worst prime minister of our political lifetimes bar none Yet there was one great good purpose in her premiership by occupying the space however vacuously she kept out the barbarian hordes of Brexiteers barging one another out of the way to seize her throne  Now she has surrendered that one useful role leaving the country to the untender mercies of those competing in Europhobia for the votes of some dwindling Tory party members To use her deathless phrase nothing will be changed by her departure Parliament will be as gridlocked as ever the combat deadlier with an avowed Brextremist at the helm 
MAR27	To kiss or not to kiss the pope’s ring? He needs to make it clear	There are some very odd videos of the Pope online see this one in which he responds with anger when some overexcited Mexican pilgrims pull him into the crowd  But his latest weird gone viral video shows Francis pulling his hand away as a long line of Italian worshippers try to kiss his ring after a religious service earlier this week in the town of Loreto Apparently he doesn t want to lord it over his flock in a way reminiscent of emperors and absolute monarchs of yore but in that case why hasn t he simply made an announcement to the effect that ring kissers aren t welcome and that he doesn t want that kind of no holds barred adulation which seems to belong to another century and like so much of what s outdated at the Vatican not even the last one He has after all been pope for six years now long enough one might have thought to lay down some guidelines about how he expects to be treated 
MAR27	Stop and search in schools would be a terrible indictment of society	Conservative MP Robert Halfon s suggestion that stop and search procedures are used in schools raises questions not only about the statutory responsibilities of schools and colleges and their limits but also about the role of education in a much broader context The chair of the education select committee s remarks follows hot on the heels of a recent Ofsted report researching knife crime in education  It has been widely acknowledged that the roots of youth violence are complex and varied and the solutions must be equally far reaching and multilayered Education does have a role to play in addressing some causal factors that lead young people into harmful behaviours and in preventing those already at risk from further harm either to themselves or others One element of this is indeed to build relationships with the police and to work collaboratively to ensure that when stop and search procedures are necessary in public spaces they are conducted in ways that are safe and non confrontational 
MAR27	I worked for Waterstones for 11 years – low pay has long been an issue	When I saw the staff petition for Waterstones to become a living wage employer earlier this week along with the open letter supporting it signed by numerous authors of note my first thought was why hasn t anyone done this before I worked for Waterstones for more than a decade and the issue of low pay for shopfloor staff is by no means a new one within the company Managing director James Daunt s dismissive response in the Guardian on Tuesday is one that will be familiar to every Waterstones bookseller both current and former full of distant promises and regretful rationalisations  I started with Waterstones as a bookseller in and over the next years worked in seven different branches taking on a range of positions I was a supervisor trainer healthy and safety auditor and by the time I left in I was running goods in operations at one of the company s largest stores In his response to the living wage petition Daunt made mention of rewarding employees with a stimulating job and while I can certainly say that the variety of roles kept my work interesting there was always one constant low pay When I finally left the company in after a lengthy period of service I was doing a job that left me utterly exhausted at the end of every work day and earning roughly p an hour more than the minimum wage 
MAR27	Amoral and venal: Britain’s governing class has lost all sense of duty	Even as doodlebugs smashed into the surrounding streets George Orwell consoled himself with this thought One thing that has always shown that the English ruling class are morally fairly sound is that in time of war they are ready enough to get themselves killed Present those who governed us with an existential crisis he argued in his essay England Your England and they would do what they believed to be right for the country  Almost eight decades later the UK stands on the verge of a calamity as great as any since the war Whatever the protestations in parliament we could within days crash land into a world of medicine shortages and food riots And where are our political classes According to the lobby correspondents Monday s cabinet meeting was spent war gaming general election strategies and thinking how to timetable voting so as to scare Labour Wherever the national interest actually featured it was buried under a thick dollop of party interest 
MAR27	Hats off to Nan Goldin for calling out UK arts institutions on the Sacklers	Opioid addicts die in horrific pain Their breathing slows their lungs fill with fluid They die vomiting You won t see that on a plaque in the V A  What you will see is the Sackler Centre It is a name visible in rooms courtyards and even escalators at our most esteemed art institutions But last week the National Portrait Gallery bowed to pressure and said that it will not accept a m grant from the Sackler family a billionaire branch of which owns the pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma the producers of OxyContin a painkiller that has been implicated in the opioid crisis The Tate Group followed suit several days later Then on Monday the Sackler Trust announced that it would be halting all new donations as the controversy was proving a distraction for institutions they say they vigorously deny allegations of having helped fuel the crisis 
MAR27	The answer to climate breakdown and austerity? A green new deal	Faced with unprecedented challenges politicians appear more divided than ever that s why Labour s Clive Lewis and I are doing something bold We are jointly tabling a bill in parliament designed to address two of the greatest threats we face climate breakdown and spiralling inequality Our bill would introduce a green new deal an unprecedented mobilisation of resources invested to prevent climate breakdown reverse inequality and heal our communities It demands major structural changes in our approach to the ecosystem coupled with a radical transformation of the finance sector and the economy to deliver both social justice and a livable planet  It s an idea congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has recently reinvigorated in the US And it could scarcely be more urgent The UN s top scientists have warned we have just years to halve global emissions and avoid climate catastrophe Global wildlife populations have collapsed by nearly in our lifetimes This has led million young people to join the inspiring global school strikes movement to demand change The response from ministers To continue to force fracking on local communities and to hand millions in tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry Last week unbelievably a new coal mine was given a green light on their watch 
MAR27	European football bosses can no longer turn a blind eye to racism	The shameful racist abuse of Raheem Sterling Danny Rose and Callum Hudson Odoi during England s Euro qualifying match against Montenegro on Monday understandably triggered outrage in British football Sadly however it is not the first time that black England players have been targeted during games in the Balkans The scenes in the Montenegrin capital Podgorica were grimly similar to those in when again Rose was subjected to monkey chants during an England U game against Serbia in Kru evac and to Zagreb in when Emile Heskey suffered the same ordeal playing against Croatia England s black players are not alone A banana was thrown at the Italian international Mario Balotelli by Croatian fans at Euro Partizan Belgrade s Brazilian midfielder Everton Luiz was abused by FK Rad fans in the Serbian SuperLiga a couple of years back the list is depressingly long  Racism in Balkan football is not new and other forms of discrimination including homophobia antisemitism or anti Romany sentiment are widespread in the game and beyond On top of that frequent expressions of ethnic hatred towards teams or players from neighbouring countries remain at the core of Balkan football fan culture The lack of diversity and social debate about racism in the region leads many to trivialise the severity of racist behaviour and reduce it to a form of acceptable football related banter It is widely acceptable as a form of psychological terror against an opposing team and more importantly particular players The fans doing the monkey chants on Monday were sitting in the main stand They were most likely not fanatical hooligans but ordinary supporters for whom this sort of behaviour is regarded as normal 
MAR27	Trump's Golan Heights proclamation is a cynical, dangerous move	No country in the world recognizes Israel s rule over the Golan Heights occupied by Israel in and unilaterally annexed in no country that is until now  Donald Trump signed a presidential proclamation on Monday formally recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights still considered Syrian territory under international law Standing by President Trump s side during an address by the two heads of state in Washington DC the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly called Trump s decision historic justice and gifted the president a box of wine from the occupied territory As they embraced Israeli forces began an aerial bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip after rockets launched from Gaza hit a house in a community north of Tel Aviv earlier that day 
MAR27	Playgrounds only for the rich kids? What grotesque social apartheid	One playground for the children of the rich another for the poor  It s hard to think of an idea more crassly offensive than a supposedly mixed housing development where even toddlers are deliberately segregated by their parents salaries where small children have to be told they can t play with their friends on the swings their flats actually overlook because that s not for the likes of them But that is what appears to have happened at the Baylis Old School development in south London where an impenetrable hedge separates the owner occupiers children s playground from the social and affordable rented housing in the same block 
MAR28	We’re led by a party not fit for power in a system not fit for purpose	A few days before the general election the prime minister David Cameron tweeted Britain faces an inescapable choice strong and stable government with me or chaos with Ed Miliband Cameron won the first general election the Tories have won outright since followed through on his pledge to hold a referendum on staying in the European Union promised not to resign if he lost lost and then resigned as chaos ensued  Theresa May took over after all other challengers either fell on their swords stabbed each other in the back or put their foot in their mouths It is as good a time as any to recall that of all the jokers and hucksters standing for the Conservative party leadership she was probably the best candidate It really could have been worse It could have been Andrea Leadsom 
MAR28	What the withdrawal agreement ‘separation’ actually means for Brexit	So we now know that the third attempt at the meaningful vote will not take place this week In its place the government will instead hold a vote on the divorce deal only the withdrawal agreement setting aside the future partnership for now  This is a desperate attempt to meet the European council s conditions for offering an extension to May If the withdrawal agreement does not pass this week the UK will almost certainly be required to participate in European parliament elections as a condition of an extension beyond April Passing the withdrawal agreement without the political declaration would meet the conditions of the European council for the extension but would not satisfy the domestic ratification requirements which would require a further act of parliament 
MAR28	Spartans don’t hug it out. Except for Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker	Since it s rather difficult to know where to start on what happened on Wednesday let s begin in the future I want to assure you that when the apocalypse has come and you re living in the bombed out remnants of civilisation clad in rags and distilling drinking water from your own urine the one crackling radio in your resistance bunker will still be bringing news of Conservative party leadership contests Even as your crew crawl over ghost cities scavenging electronic equipment that some androgynous teenage savant is going to solder together to see if you can discover if there are Others Like You you ll be doing it to a soundtrack of the last radio announcer going Aaannnnd Liam Fox has indicated he will not put his name forward for the next round of balloting He will instead transfer his votes so that whichever self interested timebomb wins will make him minister of food spores  Still back to the present day where it s arguably not all good news On Wednesday evening Theresa May offered Tory MPs her pending resignation if her deal was passed but the DUP trophy brides she spent a billion quid on have still declined to back it Thus the prime minister crosses into the realm of philosophical paradox she is too weak to resign May has now surpassed C Montgomery Burns as Earth s puniest big hitter Meanwhile the Tories launch another competition to see who will be the next one of them to have their prime ministerial career curtailed by the issue of Europe 
MAR28	Why do councils encourage profiteering from homelessness?	Early last year I was working for the homelessness department of a London council when a woman approached me for assistance The excited chatter of her two young children was at odds with the confusion and worry etched across her face She told me how her landlord had issued her an eviction notice but bewilderingly he didn t actually want to evict her Instead he d told her to go to the council get them to pay me the incentive and you can stay  Landlord incentives are essentially a bribe councils pay private landlords to persuade them to house homeless families or individuals They are used to either keep tenants at risk of being homeless in their current property or help ease the process of finding a new place to live This practice is widely known of within the housing sector yet is almost unheard of elsewhere So I sent freedom of information requests to every local council in London to find out how prevalent the practice was The results as reported in the Guardian are staggering Between them London councils spent more than m of public money on landlord incentives in paying incentives on more than separate occasions I would regularly hear of stories of one council offering a landlord a incentive only for them to solicit a better offer from another borough playing the two authorities off against each other until they pocketed a incentive to rent out a damp mouldy studio flat in Harrow 
MAR28	Have the Boeing crashes shaken our faith in flying?	Transport bosses need little prodding in public to utter the words safety is our number one priority a mantra so widespread that as with an English person inquiring How do you do the inherent insincerity is barely noted  Clearly the main objective of rail companies airlines or carmakers is moving people or things for profit with all the risk that entails What those industries have excelled at is vastly reducing that risk In Britain more than years have elapsed since a passenger was killed in a train crash Fatality rates in car accidents are declining particularly for drivers yesterday the European commission announced that extra safety features including automatic speed limiters would soon be mandatory 
MAR28	Brexit has ganged up with Alzheimer’s against my mother	It s tempting to think that the sudden deterioration of my mother s mental health could be linked to Brexit and our country s collective nervous breakdown I know it s just a coincidence But I believe that she and many others with Alzheimer s disease are Brexit victims because the government s focus on leaving the EU has created a policy vacuum that has cut adrift the most vulnerable people  A few months after my mother went into a care home with dementia my brother and I are once again navigating the care system on our own after she was told that the home could no longer cope with her challenging behaviour Mum a retired cookery and needlework teacher now aged seemed to have settled until about three weeks ago when she became paranoid and delusional The staff told us of aggressive behaviour requiring more specialised dementia care which they cannot provide 
MAR28	France is addressing black people’s invisibility in art. When will the UK?	An exhibition taking place at the Mus e d Orsay in Paris is breaking new ground on race and representation in the arts Black Models From G ricault to Matisse displays masterpieces by some of France s most important artists but renamed in honour of the black subjects who are in the pictures yet absent from their narratives  The exhibition is a welcome reminder that black people have been indispensable to nations such as France for centuries even if we have been overlooked One of the most toxic myths so central in shaping society is that Europe was once white and pure until the invasion of the dangerous and dark foreigners who have polluted the ideal society By renaming the pictures the curators are rightly staking a claim to a society that predates mass migration from the colonies to the mother country 
MAR28	Denying our man in New York a £16m penthouse? That would be churlish	Diplomacy is about communication Diplomats particularly senior ones often have to deal with the rich and powerful They cannot of course match the lifestyle of kings presidents feudal lords business tycoons press barons and so on But all governments except the most impoverished and some of them as well find it wise to have them deal with such people on something like equal terms That requires a base with a bit of style which can be expensive  A million penthouse fit for a UK civil servant is never going to be popular But the role of such homes provided at the taxpayers expense is perhaps misunderstood As well as allowing diplomats to do their jobs they also have to provide a decent normal family home That may not always be achieved I m thinking of my own time in South Arabia now Yemen but it is vital The Ferrero Rocher image of diplomacy is by no means the whole story but if Mr Big keeps inviting you to his mansion and all you can do in return is take him out to a restaurant he will soon mark you down as a cheapskate and that is not a good beginning Diplomats are not unique in this you don t see many big business representatives living in shoeboxes 
MAR28	Why we need to talk about the media’s role in far-right radicalisation	When it comes to the threat of Islamist terrorism no one doubts the role of radicalisation The internet hate preachers such as Anjem Choudary and Abu Hamza and the western armed extremism exporting state of Saudi Arabia all play their part in radicalising the impressionable When it comes to the far right however this consensus is absent The reason for this is as obvious as it is chilling the hate preachers recruiting sergeants and useful idiots of rightwing extremism are located in the heart of the British European and American establishments They are members of the political and media elite  Less than two weeks ago dozens of Muslims were murdered in Christchurch Before the lethal rampage the shooter is said to have inscribed For Rotherham on one of his gun magazines in reference to the English town s grooming scandal In Britain far right terrorist attackers have ranged from David Copeland who detonated a nail bomb in a Soho gay pub in after decades of media hatemongering against LGBT people to the murderer of Jo Cox whose despicable act was cheered by people online to Darren Osborne who ploughed his van into worshippers outside a mosque As one radicalisation expert Abdul Azim Ahmed of the Centre for the Study of Islam in the UK at Cardiff University told ITV news Osborne s extremism also came from the mainstream media It came from mainstream politicians both here and abroad 
MAR28	The destruction of the Earth is a crime. It should be prosecuted	Why do we wait until someone has passed away before we honour them I believe we should overcome our embarrassment and say it while they are with us In this spirit I want to tell you about the world changing work of Polly Higgins  She is a barrister who has devoted her life to creating an international crime of ecocide This means serious damage to or destruction of the natural world and the Earth s systems It would make the people who commission it such as chief executives and government ministers criminally liable for the harm they do to others while creating a legal duty of care for life on Earth 
MAR29	This defeat is the end of the Brexit PM. Bring on the general election	Force feed them back their words Theresa May s deal was even worse than staying in the EU declared Dominic Raab the Brexit secretary who resigned to oppose a deal he helped negotiate This is a man who once publicly confessed he didn t understand Britain s reliance on the Dover Calais crossing  The deal would turn Britain into a vassal state declared Boris Johnson a man who had penned a column backing remain days before endorsing leave it was about as bad as it could possibly be 
MAR29	The Tory leadership contest: your handy idiots guide	There s a photo from Pompeii that s been doing the internet rounds a while showing the plaster cast of a naked man He appears to have died masturbating even as he must have known the Vesuvian ash cloud was approaching Did he Science says it s a bit more complicated than that but science isn t important right now because in every psychological aspect that guy is the Conservative party No matter what holy terror was raining down upon our land no matter what the peril the Conservative party would always decide to crack out a leadership contest  And so inevitably to the situation in which we find ourselves at this moment of national crisis with Theresa May having agreed to depart The mad bastards of the Tory party are at it again in a competition you should think of as Mastershit The Professionals I collect the full range of Franklin Mint commemorative crockery for every Tory leadership battle So if you need a vignette to remind you how the last one unfolded there was one day when Andrea Leadsom went so fully Handmaid s Tale on May in an interview for the Times that the paper was only able to give a side column to fellow contender Stephen Crabb being a sex case 
MAR29	Pinch of Nom suddenly makes Delia and Heston look a little stale	Pinch of Nom isn t a phenomenon A phenomenon has a beginning and an end but this thing at first a Facebook group then a food website now a record breaking cookbook is as vast as unstoppable as the universe expanding Authored by duo Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson Pinch of Nom was published in the UK on Thursday last week and in just three days it sold more than copies To put this into perspective in Ella Mills became the fastest selling debut cookbook author of all time selling copies in one week  There s no doubt that Pinch of Nom has benefitted from the path forged by food blogger cum author stars such as Mills or Joe Wicks who wrote Lean in But the success of Featherstone and Allinson who in years have gone from running a Wirral restaurant together to topping the book charts outstrips anything we ve seen before How did a simple diet book come to break the world of cookbooks as we know it 
MAR29	Chris Grayling's worst failure? Not transport: the probation services	Chris Grayling s decision to part privatise the probation service is arguably his worst failure On Thursday it was thoroughly blasted by the chief inspector of probation Dame Glenys Stacey She described the current system as irredeemably flawed and said we would all be safer if supervision of offenders in England and Wales was back in public ownership  More than a quarter of a million people are living under probation supervision that s three times as many people as are locked up in prison Probation staff struggle to cope while our communities are hit with more crime because of a misplaced ideology of privatisation Probation just like other vital public services such as the NHS social care and schools doesn t belong in private hands Privatisation leads to inefficiency fragmentation and the wrong incentives 
MAR29	Those gunning to be caretaker PM should take notes from Solskjær	Meet the new boss not quite the same as the old boss Ole Gunnar Solskj r the year old caretaker manager of Manchester United football club has seen his temporary appointment become a permanent one  Having arrived in December after the departure of Jose Mourinho the Norwegian former Man Utd striker was only supposed to be in charge until the end of the season 
MAR29	The funeral industry is preying on grieving people. This must stop	Price increases at double the rate of inflation for years certain unscrupulous funeral directors targeting bereaved customers vulnerability people left unable to afford to bury loved ones due to vicious benefits cuts No wonder the Competition and Markets Authority has announced it will launch an in depth market investigation into the funerals sector Frankly it s dystopian  At Down to Earth the only UK wide advice service for people in financial need arranging a funeral I get a unique insight into the effect I ve called around five funeral directors in the area and none of them want to know as soon as I tell them I have no money a caller told me recently I can t sleep I don t know what to do I can t stand the thought of him lying in that morgue for months Lorraine not her real name had been advised that without at least a deposit of the funeral wouldn t go ahead Where am I supposed to get that she said 
MAR29	Replacing May is not just a game for the entitled. We must all have a say	Jacob Rees Mogg is famously not short of nannies  So whatever persuaded him to bring his year old son with him to last weekend s council of war at Chequers it probably wasn t a childcare emergency Apparently Mogg the Younger sat outside and read a book about cricket before joining the grownups for coffee 
MAR29	Why I have organised a march against UK-wide school funding cuts	Fund our schools I hate foolish funding cuts This is what my daughter has written on a homemade banner she has made for the April Fools Day march in Cambridge when she and I and hundreds of other parents teachers and children will march into the city to protest against school funding cuts  Why Because schools in Cambridge like many across the country are facing a financial crisis My daughter Flora is seven and attends St Matthew s primary school an inner city Cambridge school Her school budget will be reduced by next year but other schools face far worse cuts 
MAR29	War has broken Yemen. A new route to peace is needed, now	Yemen has long faced structural economic social and security challenges The war that started in has only exacerbated Yemen s many previous woes The conflict gradually escalating from a political impasse into full scale hostilities is quickly becoming intractable  The war which entered its fifth year this week with an exceedingly complex political and military situation is being worsened by an overwhelming humanitarian crisis that keeps growing in scale where almost of the population is in need of aid The peace process is currently at a deadlock while the war is deepening grievances ripping the social fabric and shattering an already fragile state 
MAR29	Toxins in the air, toxins in the soil – still ministers won’t act on Grenfell	It is news that no one wants to hear Independent research from Prof Anna Stec at the University of Central Lancashire released on Thursday shows heightened levels of cancer causing chemicals in the area around Grenfell Tower Phosphorous flame retardants toxic to the nervous system were found in soil samples metres from the tower Dust and oily deposits were wiped from the blinds of homes close to the tower months later Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found at times the level of reference samples m from Grenfell along with chemicals that can cause asthma with a single exposure These are not at naturally occurring levels in most urban environments  This is truly shocking From the beginning residents have asked the local authority and Public Health England about contamination The problem was obvious For days after the fire black smoke hung in the air and contaminated homes clothing and furniture For months charred black ash rained down on people s balconies gardens clothes lines and bins 
MAR30	It’s far easier to be hoodwinked if you really think they’re out to get you	Do they think I m a fool Do they take me for a total bloody idiot They fix the game They take the piss They laugh at me behind my back despise me ignore me and then try to order me around  Who s telling me that Everyone is telling me that Jeremy Corbyn says The people who run Britain have been taking our country for a ride They ve stitched up our political system to protect the powerful they ve rigged the rules to suit themselves And they expect me to do what obey them Accept their rigged fixed stitched up system and be grateful 
MAR30	Labour’s plan for a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal can heal the country	Like someone who works with heavy machinery or lives next to a railway line it s possible to get so accustomed to the ugly noise that blasts out of our political system that you don t always hear it  But whenever I step back I can tell the sound of our politics has become shriller and angrier particularly since the referendum of that split our country in half 
MAR30	Me and the woman in the pink coat (by the woman in the yellow coat)	I hoped that if anything I ever did went viral it would be because I d uttered some profound insight too good not to share Last week put paid to that dream A BBC Breakfast video clip of myself and Sherelle Jacobs assistant comment editor at the Telegraph from Thursday had garnered more than m online views by Saturday afternoon As much as I d like to think it was due to my incisive Brexit analysis I have to concede it was as a result of me being well and truly upstaged  After a call from a BBC producer on Wednesday night off I trundled bleary eyed at next morning to the green outside parliament where all the television channels have gazebos set up I argued that Wednesday s indicative votes showed there was still hope of a referendum on any Brexit deal Sherelle as eloquent as ever said she thought we d see a Theresa May resignation before too long 
MAR30	What Apple could teach mom Gwyneth Paltrow about technology	Gwyneth Paltrow is many things an A list actress an entrepreneur a woman who has built a business empire on charging eye watering amounts for self care products that sound as if they were invented during a free association session at the local poetry night but she is not known for being relatable Yet on Instagram as she was told off by her teenage daughter Apple with a statement one door slam away from You re sooooo embarrassing something human began to manifest Paltrow had posted a picture of herself with Apple wearing ski goggles Mom we have discussed this You may not post anything without my consent the year old wrote underneath it as crisp as the snow behind them  Paltrow s audience of m was torn the comments turning into a battleground of pro privacy advocates surely ironic to argue that via Instagram where one click on a single pair of leggings means never being able to escape from leggings ads for the rest of your mortal days and people who think Paltrow is perfectly entitled to post pictures of her progeny 
MAR30	Sure, he might say he’s on the pill, but would you really trust him?	Once again there are reports of the male contraceptive pill being tantalisingly imminent And once again a mental image occurs of a man and woman looking at each other arms folded as if to say Sorry I don t trust you a bit  A University of Washington study involving men showed that sperm production could be disrupted with minimal side effects and everything returning to normal once men stop taking the pill Which all sounds intriguing though it wouldn t resolve the other major issue the intrinsic lack of contraceptive trust between the sexes which seems impossible to resolve leastways to the point where the chemical baton could pass from women to men 
MAR30	The UK needs a year-long extension on Brexit – to really take back control	After a week that ended in an atmosphere of chaos confusion acrimony hostility and mistrust MPs are once again trying to construct a Brexit majority for something or anything Having lived for years now away from the Westminster bubble I am clear that even if parliament struggles to an th hour compromise on Monday there will be little buy in from the public And even if for a moment there are sighs of relief the country will still be as divided as ever  Opinion poll after opinion poll has rejected not just Theresa May s deal and the no deal option but the Canada Norway Switzerland and Efta options the last three of which would leave Britain as a rule taker rather than a rule maker And while MPs deserve credit for trying there is unlikely to be a majority in the country for a deal cobbled together over a weekend on the basis of MPs third or fourth choices that could decide the next years of our history 
MAR30	Amid the overalls and the flat caps, I found my voice in Cambuslang	At a certain point in the last few miles of the train journey from London to Glasgow I sometimes catch a glimpse of the building that was my workplace for most of The sight of it comes and goes in a moment single storey and backing on to the railway cutting no building could be plainer or less conspicuous The touching thing is that it survives when far grander sights in the district have disappeared  Clydebridge ironworks gone the Hoover factory gone Ravenscraig rolling mills gone Stewarts and Lloyds steel tubes gone smoke is no longer general all over Lanarkshire But there still standing in Tabernacle Lane Cambuslang is the former office of the Cambuslang Advertiser and the East Kilbride News 
MAR30	Brexit has nearly broken British politics. Here’s how to fix it	For those who live in the shadow of one of the most remarkable states to emerge in world history the image of the UK now floundering in prolonged indecision over Brexit is shocking  Decisive rejection of the UK EU withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons for a third time following hot on the heels of the House s rejection of eight alternative approaches raises uncomfortable questions about the quality of the UK s decision making process 
MAR30	Barclays funds climate breakdown. We are determined to make it stop	From Cyclone Idai which has killed hundreds in south east Africa to flooding in Bangladesh where my family is from for decades climate change has been devastating communities in the global south More recently these effects have begun to be felt by people in the UK too just last month wildfires raged on Saddleworth Moor while where I live in Brixton the air is so polluted I suffer from breathing problems  We all know that the impact of climate change is felt unequally depending on where you live how wealthy you are and how easily you can shield yourself from its effects Less widely known however is that responsibility for the crisis is unequal too In recent years we have been sold a lie that ordinary people are to blame for the climate crisis It s our spending and our consumption habits that have created the mess we re in we are told not the bankers oil companies and a rich elite 
MAR30	Beware the great betrayal myth. This debacle is the work of hard Brexiters	There is no deader horse in the kingdom than the deal brokered by Theresa May Flogged and flogged again it expired for a third time at pm today on the floor of the House of Commons Something else lay dead alongside it the illusion that the objection of MPs was not to the precise terms of Britain s proposed exit from the European Union contained in the withdrawal agreement but rather to the sketched vision of our future relationship with the EU the so called political declaration That fond thought was also bludgeoned to death for MPs had the chance to vote on the withdrawal agreement alone and they rejected it by votes to  Now we face a new cliff edge with pm on April the new day of destiny At that hour Britain will crash out of the EU with no deal in a scenario those charged with stewarding our economy our industry and our safety warn will be catastrophic The only way to avoid that fate is for MPs to agree on something else fast and once they have to impose their will on a reluctant prime minister That is harder than it sounds 
MAR31	Don’t rely on Mueller and Russia: there is no magic wand to rid us of Trump – or Brexit	Almost a year ago the US public radio network NPR interviewed Robert Mueller s biographer Garrett Graff The book was a classic American hagiography The wealthy Mueller went to Princeton University where he played lacrosse then followed his teammate David Hackett to Vietnam after Hackett had been killed trying to rescue an ambushed platoon  His biographer was keen to mention early on that Mueller had in fact not been eligible to serve in the military An injured knee had ruled him out but he took a year off then doggedly re enlisted In Vietnam he covered himself in glory and earned a Bronze Star with valour for rescuing two wounded marines 
MAR31	Give the people a final say: the case for a referendum is far stronger than in 2016	It is astonishing to reflect that the prime minister s announcement on Wednesday of her resignation plans was by no means the most important political story of the week Far from it in fact In normal circumstances of which you may have a dim recollection Theresa May s declaration that she won t stand in the way of a new leadership once her Brexit deal was approved would have driven all other news to the margins rocked the markets gripped the world But in these extraordinary times such a story is just another day at the office  And rightly so As significant as the identity of the next Conservative leader undoubtedly is not least because that person will probably be the next prime minister it is small potatoes compared with the redefinition of Britain s relationship with the European Union and the scandalously amateurish process by which that matter is being decided 
MAR31	If you can’t embrace regional dialect, you can kiss my chuddies	In a rare piece of happy news to distract us momentarily from all the chaos those lovely linguists at the Oxford English Dictionary have announced an abundance of new words all taken from regional dialects  The new entries include the Indian English phrase kiss my chuddies the delicious word jibbons which is what spring onions are called in Wales and the Scottish words sitooterie which is obviously a place to sit out and bidie in a person who lives with his or her partner in a non marital relationship which surely should have been in the dictionary ages ago since the author Val McDermid a fine connoisseur of the English language uses it in her Twitter bio 
MAR31	I’m trans and I love swimming. Why must going to the pool be an ordeal?	Swimming was one of my favourite things to do when I was younger I grew up in rural north Iceland but once a year my parents travelled to the capital Reykjavik to attend the annual agricultural senate of Iceland Above all this meant to me that we would be able to visit all of the local swimming pools I have warm memories of racing up the cold and icy stairs to the outside slide before throwing myself down the slide again and again with contentment until my parents had to physically drag me out of the pool  In Iceland there is a pool for every inhabitants Swimming is one of the nation s favourite pastimes It s so ingrained into our culture that we have what we call pottamenning which describes a cultural phenomenon of having public discussions about politics in the hot tub Journalists go to public pools and interview local swimmers to get their take on recent events 
MAR31	While newsrooms have shrunk, investigative journalism is thriving	One of the enduring myths espoused by veteran reporters is that investigative journalism is dead I think I heard it first in when I joined the Sunday Times the newspaper generally considered to have pioneered agenda setting investigations Several of my new colleagues were convinced despite ample evidence to the contrary that the paper was no longer committed to providing the necessary resources for lengthy probes into institutional bad behaviour They held fast to the myth even as the paper went on publishing investigations  Later I discovered that the same mistaken belief existed across the industry and has persisted over the course of years It gained ground once the digital revolution took hold and I admit to sharing concerns about the negative effects of the resulting cuts to editorial staffs But digital tools have turned out to be a wonderful addition to the reporting armoury and it is possible to argue that investigative journalism today is in a healthier state than ever before Computer terminals have proven more effective in discovering secrets than shoe leather 
MAR31	Archaic, authoritarian, unequal to the challenge – parliament is broken	After every shattering bungle some PR creep says Lessons have been learned and appropriate changes put in place Well and British Brexit What lessons and what hope for changes  There s one obvious lesson which Westminster despite centuries of dire experience still fails to learn Do not kick Irish cans down the road Some contain Semtex All have a way of rolling back and tripping you up There s an English habit of not thinking about Ireland lest it spoil a nice afternoon If David Cameron had thought of the British border in Ireland he would have called his referendum off But he kicked Arlene Foster and two Irish taoiseachs down the road Now British politics lies sprawling on that same hard tarmac 
MAR31	I’ll never see Mum again. But I’ve learned to live with Mother’s Day	I can t remember the last Mother s Day I spent with my mum It would have been in since in August of that year she died but the day itself is lost in the memories of all those that came before it Those past Mother s Days were a mad rush to buy a card and a bunch of flowers lilies always the haphazard breakfasts in bed made with my brother when I was a child and one year even writing a poem the flowers must have all sold out  In the six years since my mum has died though each Mother s Day is now a looming presence one that cannot be passed over and forgotten Rather than fret over the day as a commercial inconvenience as I did when she was alive now it is something I grit my teeth through a different kind of endurance test 
MAR31	Theresa May was dealt the worst of hands and has played it spectacularly badly	It nearly always ends in tears whether they are shed publicly or just inside but few premierships have drawn to a close with such wretchedness as that visited on Theresa May She s not quite out of the door yet and other Tories are already describing her as the worst prime minister in a hundred years That is a savage verdict when the competition for this dismal accolade includes Neville Chamberlain Ramsay MacDonald Anthony Eden and David Cameron  I think we can safely say she will not be remembered as one of the more strong and stable occupants of Number Hilarious as it may seem today she seized the keys in the summer of because colleagues thought her a safe pair of hands She commended herself to Tory MPs and was pretty popular with a lot of voters as she seemed to promise a premiership of common sense and calm after the anarchic orgy of backstabbing unleashed by the Cameronian Johnsonian and Goveite cliques In that largely forgotten period when she appeared to be monarch of all she surveyed and the cabinet was terrified of her she was variously compared to Boudicca and Elizabeth I To some of us the early cult of Theresa was ridiculous even at the time It is now so risible that thinking about it for too long risks permanent injury to your abdomen 
MAR31	Drug trips, not broken hips: let later life be the age of irresponsibility	Contemplating getting old and thinking about what it would be like living out your last years institutionalised in a care home is enough to make anyone feel depressed Sure there are some excellent care homes out there but there are also plenty that are steeped in loneliness and misery And the prospect of losing your physical or even worse your mental faculties is deeply scary  That gut reaction an inherent fear of decline is a very strong one difficult to overcome It infuses our attitudes towards ageing and helps bake ageism into society Ageing is culturally all about managing decline rather than living the good life until the very end That in turn affects how older people are looked after by their families and the care system 
MAR31	Dividing rich and poor is inevitable when developers run open spaces	There s no good way of looking at this Sometimes when waves of outrage break a contrarian voice might ask if it s as bad as all that if there isn t another side to the story In the case of the Baylis Old School development in south London where children from affordable housing have been excluded from a playground used by the children of private owner occupiers there is no excuse  This segregated playground is plain mean spirited It goes against a strength of London and other British cities which is that people of different backgrounds both live close together and share spaces It contradicts the planning application made by the project s developers which says that play areas will be designed to maximise their inclusivity and that open spaces will emphasise the sense of community within the scheme stressing that the common areas are there for the use of all the residents 
APR1	This is no time for a compromise with Brexiters: there is no middle way	 Believe in Britain say leavers posters outside parliament What sort of belief as things fall apart While Brexit voting consumed Westminster last Friday another austerity tragedy slipped by unnoticed In Hastings the doors shut for the last time on a day centre that was life support comfort and company for old people I met Rose Mary and Sal who had sat together for years and were now to be separated Some of those ejected from the Isabel Blackman Centre will stay home alone Some will soon go to expensive residential care in the absence of the centre s daily respite for their partners Expect many to be in A E more often along with others of the million older people denied care Some older people died waiting for a care package last year according to Age UK In East Sussex seven local care centres have shut The council is near bankrupt due to cuts As the Isabel Blackman Centre shut the new minister for loneliness Tracey Crouch was not there to say goodbye to Rose Mary and Sal  I left to catch the train back for the next episode of the Westminster psycho drama to see the MPs consumed by the furies ambitions and panics of another Brexit vote These things are linked Believe in Britain The real patriotic cause is to save us all from Brexit from the damage any variety of Brexit will do as the grip of austerity inevitably tightens following departure Closing day centres wasn t on the side of that notorious leave bus of course 
APR1	Jeremy Corbyn needs to get behind the people’s vote to fight the far right	For many in the Labour movement the socialist diverse left bloc of last week s Put it to the People march may have felt more of a political home than say the main continuity remain element and that also highlights the big Jeremy Corbyn shaped hole both at the event and in the wider campaign For it actually to be more Corbyn left the campaign would need the leadership s buy in and the grassroots organising that would flow from that Instead it was down to the left bloc of Love Socialism Hate Brexit MPs and campaigners to present the radical left anti racist arguments for a second referendum They did a great job even though their message did not necessarily chime with everyone one organiser told me they overhead someone at the main demo ask why the left bloc kept going on about socialism at an anti Brexit march  This statement encapsulates the problem with a people s vote campaign led by the centrist status quo that much of the leave vote was a protest against Meanwhile the anti racist component of arguments over Brexit is too often ignored as we pore over the parliamentary politics of who might vote for which Brexit option and what happens next Here we are with only bad choices mounting chaos reckless rhetoric a terrible democratic failure and a febrile political climate all of which is firing up a hate and anger filled far right already emboldened by Brexit Whatever happens next none of that is going away quickly 
APR1	Tory MPs’ no-deal fetish is making a cross-party Brexit solution impossible	The number of Conservative MPs who are prepared to take Britain out of the EU with no deal is now greater than the total number of Conservatives elected to parliament in That is not the only way that British politics has changed since then Parties have a lot of different positions over years but the capture of the Tories by no dealism has happened within months  When Tony Blair s landslide victory reduced the Tory MPs to a rump of Euroscepticism meant something different It was all about obstructing Britain s entry into the single currency resisting new treaties and grumbling about old ones Only on the outermost political fringe would anyone advocate shredding the treaties kicking away the legal and diplomatic foundations of Britain s partnership with the continent and seeing what happened Even three years ago no one in the official leave campaign thought that was a good idea Now Tory MPs more than half of the party s parliamentary cohort are signed up That number which includes many cabinet ministers is reported to have endorsed a letter urging the prime minister to deliver the UK out of the EU promptly and regardless of the terms 
APR1	A customs union would not solve the Brexit conundrum	Parliament has a little over one week to prove that it can do what Theresa May should have allowed it to do after her failure in the election and come up with a plan that saves us from the Brexit cliff edge The question is whether it can without the constraints of Mrs May s self imposed red lines agree a deal based on the creation of a permanent customs union and perhaps also continuing membership of the single market  Only a minority of the Conservative party which now looks increasingly like the leave campaign would buy into this as most now want to leave the EU with as clean a break as possible however painful But we may find in the coming days that there is a cross party majority of MPs including possibly the DUP who are willing to back a softer form of Brexit Negotiations to see whether a compromise is possible are the only alternative to what the former Brexit minister Lord Bridges has described as the British public being asked to walk a gangplank into thin air 
APR1	Remainers, take note: much of Europe just wants to excise the British cancer	The mood in Brussels is pessimistic Most of those closely involved in the Brexit talks think the likeliest outcome is for the UK to leave without a deal There is also tremendous frustration with what EU officials see as the incompetence ignorance and irresponsibility of swaths of the British political class Over the past three years much of the goodwill that people held towards the UK has evaporated  The EU expects no deal because it does not trust British politicians not to screw up There is not much faith that indicative votes among MPs will produce a coherent way forward We don t see the transmission mechanism that forces the executive to bend to parliament s will said one EU official We cannot negotiate with a parliament 
APR1	Government can’t regulate Facebook – it’s up to all of us	I didn t see this coming but I agree with Mark Zuckerberg The Facebook chief executive has called for more government regulation of the internet And what he has said is pretty sensible if a little light on detail The four areas Zuckerberg wants governments to regulate more are harmful content election integrity privacy and data portability I know what you re thinking isn t Zuck just passing the buck Hasn t his company very publicly failed to tackle all of the issues he s saying it s up to governments to fix You re not wrong The four areas he s concerned about do happen to overlap with recent Facebook scandals But that doesn t mean his announcement isn t good news  Big companies hardly ever call for more regulation It sometimes feels as if people in Silicon Valley view laws and indeed nation states as some quaint th century tech that will disappear in a few years like CDs or fax machines Businesses such as Uber and Facebook pride themselves on being disruptors arguing the existing rules are too outdated to apply to them at all And until now they haven t been keen on any new rules to replace the old ones The change of heart should be welcomed 
APR1	Dear Robert Smith – spare a thought for us poor interviewers	My how we laughed at Robert Smith s reaction when the Cure were inducted into the Rock Roll Hall of Fame Deadpan he responds to giddy over eager interviewer Carrie Keagan who bubbling with gleeful enthusiasm asks him Are you are as excited as I am Glumly he replies By the sounds of it no  When I wrote about music my life was frequently complicated by interviewees who could or would not cooperate The interview process is seldom sparkling but we do what we can with occasionally fatigued overwhelmed intoxicated arrogant tedious musicians some are lovely admittedly A friend attempted to liven up his days on the interview circuit treadmill by posing questions cut from random magazines including gardening publications to the initial bewilderment then eventual amusement of his subjects I still have fond memories of interviewing Edsel Auctioneer for the NME a Leeds band with the nous to tell benign lies in order to enliven the process who offered a welcome slightly ribald fib about song lyrics and a Jacuzzi 
APR1	Turns out posh boys are better bullshitters. That explains a lot	If you ve ever wondered why the most overconfident embarrassments in the headlines and in your life are so frequently young posh and male wonder no more It s a thing Bullshit can be packaged in so many ways but it frequently comes in a certain form According to a new study from University College London young men who come from advantaged backgrounds are more likely to be bullshitters That is they believe they re smarter stronger and all round better than they actually are  He could sniff out insecurity like a truffle hunting pig and play with it until hard working colleagues cried
APR1	Petitions and jokes will not halt this march into Brexit calamity	It could conceivably have happened on any day over the past couple of years but my own peak of anger about Brexit and its absurdities arrived last Wednesday Jacob Rees Mogg was in the Commons chamber making quips about the fact that another Conservative MP had been to Winchester rather than Eton My honourable friend makes a characteristically Wykehamist point highly intelligent but fundamentally wrong how we all laughed  My mind s eye was still switching back to the spectacle of Iain Duncan Smith arriving at Chequers in an open topped vintage sports car Meanwhile there were reports of Theresa May s address to Conservative MPs being made all the more dramatic by the sound of her voice cracking something conspicuously absent when she has talked about everything from the Grenfell Tower disaster to her role in the Windrush tragedy but there we are 
APR1	To understand the far right, look to their bookshelves	I used to live in Tucson teaching at the University of Arizona The post US just half an hour away from the Mexican border was a strange place to be Armed vigilantes patrolled the desert hunting for illegal immigrants Every day the local radio spewed paranoia and xenophobia They talked about true Americans in small towns with pure values as opposed to the corrupt liberal elite in the cities A radical right rhetoric was beginning to form but it was still on the margins  Poll after poll showed that trust in basic democratic institutions was diminishing It was against this background that the rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh claimed there were four corners of deceit media academia science and government Conspiracy theories mushroomed about how liberal lobbies had usurped the system Populist demagogues began to advise building alternative rightwing institutions A parallel universe Information wars Culture and knowledge which have for centuries bound us together as human beings were now regarded as a battleground 
APR2	May’s desperate pitch for cross-party unity is a leap into the dark	One way to identify Britain s next Brexit panic is to look for a problem that was foreseen in Brussels ages ago For example the European commission seeing that Theresa May s deal was failing decided in January that Britain would need to have European parliamentary elections if Brexit ended up being delayed into the summer Three months later it is the prospect of holding that ballot that has provoked May into a desperate pitch for collaboration with Labour in pursuit of some version of Brexit that stands a chance of Commons ratification  This has been the pattern from the start The EU anticipates problems makes choices and waits for British politics to catch up Even before the referendum there were warnings about the impossibility of frictionless borders outside the single market The specific challenge that posed for Northern Ireland was identified and baked into the commission s negotiating mandate in May But in February Dominic Raab a man who briefly led Brexit negotiations and fancies himself as a potential prime minister admitted he had not read the Good Friday agreement It is only pages long 
APR2	May’s bombshell means the Little English nationalist revolution is over	The carefully crafted illusions the May administration were founded on have crumbled into dust After three years of civil service expertise wasted billions of pounds of growth lost and two years worth of legislative time squandered Theresa May stopped trying to get Brexit through with Tory votes and turned to Jeremy Corbyn  Corbyn will be asked to co author a new version of the political declaration acceptable to Labour or failing that to help engineer a majority in the Commons either for a Norway style deal or a customs union 
APR2	May’s can-kicking changes nothing – MPs must stop a no-deal Brexit	Theresa May has proved herself once again to be an expert at kicking the can down the road  Her pitiful appeal for still more time to fix Brexit changes nothing The Irish border will remain an intractable problem and the DUP for all the money it has pocketed will continue to withhold its support 
APR2	The macho drama queens of Brexit are about to be knocked out by reality	The closer the Brexit doomsday clock ticks to midnight the more of a certain type of machismo we get I find it extremely encouraging It suggests that if and when all else fails the Brexit ultras can either fight or fuck their way out of this  Happily not one of them feels miscast in this hypersexualised action hero role How are you feeling tonight Sky News inquired of Steve Baker who last week was wishing he could tear down parliament and bulldoze it into the Thames Well everyone knows I m Brexit hardman Steve Baker came the reply from the man everyone knows needed a cuddle off Jacob Rees Mogg after the aforementioned dozer speech 
APR2	A comedian could be Ukraine’s next president. How did that happen?	A politically inexperienced comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy is in the lead after the first round of presidential elections in Ukraine and by a huge margin He is almost percentage points ahead of the incumbent president Petro Poroshenko Zelenskiy s unconventional campaign relying primarily on Instagram and a TV show in which he plays a fictional Ukrainian president proved to be far more successful than Poroshenko s attempt to impose a choice of me or Putin  Poroshenko s main messages of army language and faith as well as his recent nationalist initiatives would easily see him branded as far right in any other European country Yulia Tymoshenko a veteran of Ukrainian politics who led the polls until January failed to present a clear alternative to Poroshenko s aggressive nationalism and ended up in third place in Sunday s first round vote The candidates appealing to Russian speaking voters in Ukraine s south eastern regions failed to unite The most popular among them Yuriy Boiko came fourth 
APR2	May’s failure to tackle Tory Islamophobia sends a dangerous message	Theresa May and the Conservative party are refusing to take the action needed to tackle the growing problem of Islamophobia and anti Muslim sentiment among Tory members and politicians and in our wider society At a time when hate crime against all minority communities is rising and when far right extremism is a growing problem they simply must not be allowed to get away with it  Just over two weeks ago people around the world were left heartbroken and scared when innocent people were murdered in a terrorist attack in Christchurch New Zealand for no reason other than their faith 
APR2	Jacinda Ardern’s grief should not eclipse that of Muslims	Since the Christchurch terror attack much of the focus has been not on the mourning of New Zealand s Muslim community but on white people This has been repeated across the west and in parts of the Middle East Jacinda Ardern s face was projected on to the outside of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai days after the attack  The prime minister s response to the shooting has indeed been exemplary but the reaction to it has left little space for the victims or the wider Muslim community in New Zealand or around the world While many of us are still coming to terms with the events that happened in Christchurch I have seen more pictures of Ardern s grief and mourning than of the Muslim community in New Zealand the victims or those who acted bravely on the day to save lives and fight against the terrorist 
APR2	Rees-Mogg and the AfD’s Alice Weidel have a lot in common – all of it nasty	My first reaction on hearing that Jacob Rees Mogg had retweeted a video by the populist German Alternative f r Deutschland AfD was Well that figures And not just because the AfD is the nasty party in German politics and because Rees Mogg represents the faction that wants the Conservatives to remain the nasty party in Britain One of the driving forces behind the AfD is a very German inferiority complex regarding the second world war Rees Mogg with his foppish retro look and accent embodies the Britain that German nationalists think they lost the war to A Britain they despise envy and admire in almost equal measure  What binds Alice Weidel to a party of older white males is her almost pathological hatred of foreigners
APR2	Government can’t regulate Facebook – it’s up to all of us	I didn t see this coming but I agree with Mark Zuckerberg The Facebook chief executive has called for more government regulation of the internet And what he has said is pretty sensible if a little light on detail The four areas Zuckerberg wants governments to regulate more are harmful content election integrity privacy and data portability I know what you re thinking isn t Zuck just passing the buck Hasn t his company very publicly failed to tackle all of the issues he s saying it s up to governments to fix You re not wrong The four areas he s concerned about do happen to overlap with recent Facebook scandals But that doesn t mean his announcement isn t good news  Big companies hardly ever call for more regulation It sometimes feels as if people in Silicon Valley view laws and indeed nation states as some quaint th century tech that will disappear in a few years like CDs or fax machines Businesses such as Uber and Facebook pride themselves on being disruptors arguing the existing rules are too outdated to apply to them at all And until now they haven t been keen on any new rules to replace the old ones The change of heart should be welcomed 
APR2	How Gary Lineker and Luciana Berger helped me take the fight to the trolls	I remember the day I joined Twitter On the set of The Infidel in May I d been telling Omid Djalili and the Davids Baddiel and Schneider that I didn t have a Facebook account and all social media was a pointless waste of time On the spot they signed me up to this newish site saying You ll love this it s fun And to be fair it was With just characters you had to be pithy and bright Here was a site that had all the enjoyment of being invited to the best party in town full of the funniest most well informed people on the planet from all walks of life All this without having to leave the house It was addictive  I barely received a single negative tweet If anything unsavoury did come my way abuse or dick pics I just pressed the block button 
APR3	Muslims and Jews face a common threat from white supremacists. We must fight it together	The two of us have been having the exact same conversation for the past decade About antisemitism and Islamophobia One of us a Muslim the other a Jew we have conducted it in public and in private on Twitter and on TV We ve agreed we ve argued we ve even wandered off topic to trade tips on how to get through a fast Now we ve come together because of the urgent and common threat that we face Both of our communities are under violent attack from far right white supremacists  In Christchurch New Zealand last month a white supremacist gunned down Muslims at prayer In Pittsburgh Pennsylvania last October a white supremacist gunned down Jews at prayer Both killers were clear in their loathing of both Jews and Muslims Both subscribed to the great replacement theory which casts Muslims and other minorities as invaders of western societies and a threat to white Christian majorities In this narrative the supposed invasion is a wicked plot orchestrated by the same hidden hand behind all malign events through world history the Jews The point was put concisely in an online remark reposted by the Pittsburgh murderer It s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country 
APR3	Britain needs a Brexit compromise. Forging one could be the making of Corbyn’s Labour	The national tragedy of Brexit sweeps on In the end Theresa May s opening to Jeremy Corbyn to help solve it may prove to have been just another brief episode in its awful unfolding But even the greatest tragedies occasionally have space for epic moments of boldness and inspiration when a moment can be seized and an outcome reshaped This could perhaps be one of them  The appeal to Labour may soon prove to be little more than another of the tactical feints that May sometimes attempts in search of a Brexit solution Through thick and thin the prime minister has doggedly tried to get her deal through with Conservative and DUP votes Occasionally though she has tacked a little towards the centre When she does her main motive seems to be to frighten her rebel rightwingers back into her hard Brexit pen rather than to reveal any lurking centrist convictions or because she accepts she has no alternative 
APR3	Could Macron knock Britain out of the EU next week?	Brexit has been blocked by the most head banging of Brexiteers Leavers are now hoping for a sweet paradox of their own They are looking to President Emmanuel Macron a remainer super hero to boot Britain out of the European Union next week  Recent remarks made by the French president suggested that he might summon the spirit of Charles de Gaulle vintage and and veto come what May extended British membership of the EU at the Brussels summit on April 
APR3	So Brits have a lot of sex on drugs – why?	The news that Brits are the greatest practitioners of sex on drugs in the western world may have come as a surprise to you but only if you ve never paid attention to the amorous preamble which takes place in our pubs clubs and private dinner parties on a Friday night  In an extensive Guardian survey five years ago of those surveyed admitted to taking drugs to improve their sex life Now people have voluntarily informed the Global Drug Survey of their occasional to habitual predilections for combining alcohol cocaine MDMA and a raft of other substances with sexual activity 
APR3	Joe Biden's policies are as troubling as his inappropriate touching	As the Democratic primary heats up Joe Biden who hasn t even formally declared yet is the latest candidate in the hot seat At issue his handsiness which is generally notorious and specifically detailed by Nevada politician Lucy Flores his moderate policies which seem painfully out of touch in today s Democratic party and the promise that his supporters make which is that he s the only candidate who can defeat Donald Trump  One thing is clear Joe Biden is the wrong candidate for 
APR3	If only bums on glass was the oddest thing to happen in parliament this week	People pressed their semi naked bums on the gallery glass in the House of Commons and had to be peeled off by police and it still wasn t the stupidest thing that happened in parliament this week  On Monday the night that parliament was supposed to take back control protest group Extinction Rebellion got into the gallery took their kit off and tried to stick a variety of body parts to the glass turning the House of Commons into some kind of X rated human zoo 
APR3	James Corden is right: chubby bodies like mine should not be confined to radio	James Corden has reminded us this week that chubby actors rarely get cast as romantic leads I can confirm that this has most definitely been the case with me the offers have been very thin on the ground indeed I have only had one film role playing myself as the host of a sex party in the in my view unfairly maligned film Sex Lives of the Potato Men The sight of me clad only in an ungenerous towel was enough to convince this viewer for one that naked chubby men have no place in any form of mainstream entertainment  So since I couldn t bear the sight of myself how can I agree with James But I do it s just mad The Channel programme Naked Attraction has been widely excoriated as brainless smut But it does have the merit of being just about the only place on film or television you can see ordinary human forms in a state of undress 
APR3	I helped stop a far-right terror plot. Are UK police ready for the next one?	Robbie Mullen joined the neo Nazi group National Action in He d been impressed by what he had seen of it in the media He was angry at the world And he was in search of friends But he contacted the organisation I work for Hope not Hate in April when he realised that National Action was turning to terrorism He came to us because unlike the authorities we d never stopped going after the group after it was banned by the home secretary in December  Robbie s story of how he came to be a member of National Action how he foiled Jack Renshaw s plot to murder an MP and how he has been treated by the authorities can tell us so much about the threat posed by the far right today 
APR3	Don’t celebrate more domestic flights, Chris Grayling. Think of the planet	It s not hard to see why Chris Grayling jumped at the opportunity to visit Heathrow airport early on Tuesday to welcome passengers landing on a dreary morning at Terminal He was marking the launch of an air service from Flybe which will now be operating four return flights from Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall to London seven days a week  This is a transport secretary made famous for his inability to actually transport things whether that be people by train or goods over water he s even managed to stop cyclists making it safely from A to B and so for Grayling a plane on a new flightpath taking off and landing on time is a much needed chance to claim an easy win and arrange a photo op 
APR3	Look past the May-Corbyn Brexit talks. There’s another solution	The objections to Theresa May s th hour offer to work with Labour on Brexit are obvious It goes without saying that this is not how the process should have ended but how it should have begun the day after the referendum or at the very least the day after the June election wiped out May s Commons majority Instead Brexit has been like one of those high end artworks where the narrative runs backwards Think of it as Brexit in the style of Harold Pinter s Betrayal to pick a play whose title the hard Brexiters might find bleakly resonant in which first comes the triggering of article and two years of negotiations with Brussels followed by cross party talks to find a parliamentary consensus when it clearly should have been the other way around  Equally obvious is that if Brexiters are looking for someone to blame for this development they need to look in the mirror May is only compelled to seek Labour s help in taking Britain out of the European Union because the Tory votes in the Commons were not there Brexit was on offer but the Brexiters repeatedly refused to vote for it because it wasn t Brexity enough for their tastes They re now crying betrayal accusing May of making Jeremy Corbyn the de facto prime minister but this situation is entirely on them It s their fault 
APR4	How Labour can resolve the Brexit crisis – and tear down the Tories too	Consider this scenario The Brexit national crisis is resolved on terms that protect the economy and hard won workers rights The national conversation moves on to the NHS remember that child poverty and housing Another referendum more poisonous and bitter than the last and one that could easily be won by leave all over again polling currently shows more people would prefer to leave without a deal than to stay in the EU outside of London and Scotland is avoided A transformative government comes to power which rips up a four decade old market fundamentalist experiment that has been an endless generator of insecurity and social turmoil The Conservative party which for entirely partisan ends has brought chaos and humiliation to Britain is torn asunder ejected from office for a generation  This could be the prize if Labour agreed a deal with the Tories that forced Theresa May to reject her party s red lines There are the obvious pitfalls to be navigated May using the talks to run down the clock or to displace responsibility for a national calamity of the Conservatives own making to Labour or to provide a pretext for a long extension that torments the Brexiteers Every promise would have to be written in legislation and passed by the House of Commons or be simply tossed on a bonfire by May s hard right successor Labour agreeing to any deal with May will cause a paroxysm of fury from those remainers who understandably anguished by this wretched mess will be satisfied by no less than another referendum 
APR4	Joe Biden’s inappropriate touching is the embodiment of male privilege	We tell our children to let us know if a grownup touches them in a way that they don t like or makes them feel uncomfortable don t we Although we also then plonk them on the laps of strange men in fake beards and suggest they tell them their secrets The whole Santa Claus thing has always been extremely weird and you often see little ones far from enchanted and actually scared by this tradition  But do we afford grown women the same privilege of being able to express unease at the way some men touch us and make us feel uncomfortable Not really We don t want to make a fuss Nothing that bad happened thank you for not sexually assaulting us is so much the internalised female default that many women tolerate a range of creepiness from men who plead ignorance about what they are doing 
APR4	Europe is a dysfunctional family, but divorce is not the answer	For years Axel Scheffler the German born illustrator of The Gruffalo has made his home and his career in Britain His contribution to the lives of millions of our children has been simply immense If we leave Europe his hitherto guaranteed right to call the UK his home is under threat Can we imagine how this affects his life how it makes him feel And how do we feel that such a circumstance might yet come to pass in our country This man is a treasured friend to us and to our children We have to think again and think hard  The European Union as we know it now was created after the second world war by France and Germany to ensure peace and prosperity There was a determination that war should be no more They had good enough reason In the preceding years there had been many wars between these two countries the last two catastrophic not just to them but to us in the UK and to people all over the world There has been peace in Europe since mostly And democracy mostly And for many people though not enough there has also been great prosperity Peace and prosperity and democracy these are fine aims for us and our children 
APR4	It’s gender pay gap reporting day. Treat claims of progress with a pinch of salt	Wouldn t it be neat if we could put a number on gender inequality If we could quantitatively measure the challenge women face every day to be treated on a par with their male counterparts financially socially and culturally Then we could track precise progress numerically and hold ourselves accountable undeniably because statistics are great like that They don t lie and they don t tell half truths  Except unfortunately when they do 
APR4	Ddu-du you know? English is losing its grip as the language of pop	A band has attained a certain stature when its world tour consists of an imperial sweep through four continents with just half a dozen concerts in each The South Korea based girl group Blackpink are currently midway through just such a jaunt next month they arrive in Europe to play six dates London and Manchester included  Remarkably this high visibility procession is the first time the K pop quartet have toured outside Korea or Japan more remarkable still they ve released just one album and a scant handful of tracks and while they ve made English language videos most of their material is in Korean or Japanese Nonetheless they re adored by a worldwide fanbase for whom language is no barrier Recent industry figures underline the strength of the global music market with some suggesting the place of the English language at the forefront of pop is diminishing 
APR4	Chernobyl’s disastrous cover-up is a warning for the next nuclear age	In the Soviet minister of hydrometeorology Yuri Izrael had a regrettable decision to make It was his job to track radioactivity blowing from the smoking Chernobyl reactor in the hours after the April explosion and deal with it Forty eight hours after the accident an assistant handed him a roughly drawn map On it an arrow shot north east from the nuclear power plant and broadened to become a river of air miles wide that was surging across Belarus toward Russia If the slow moving mass of radioactive clouds reached Moscow where a spring storm front was piling up millions could be harmed Izrael s decision was easy Make it rain  So that day in a Moscow airport technicians loaded artillery shells with silver iodide Soviet air force pilots climbed into the cockpits of TU bombers and made the easy one hour flight to Chernobyl where the reactor burned The pilots circled following the weather They flew km chasing the inky black billows of radioactive waste When they caught up with a cloud they shot jets of silver iodide into it to emancipate the rain 
APR4	How should Britain commemorate a world war? Include the uncomfortable parts too	Vera Brittain in her moving autobiography Testament of Youth recalled that when the sounds of victory burst over London on November men and women alike did not proclaim victory but simply said with relief The war is over And yet in so many ways and for so many people it would never be over For the bereaved like Brittain herself pain would continue for the rest of their lives while for the survivors of the battlefields there would be constant reminders physically and mentally of their terrible experiences  Nor did conflict and war end for everyone in November This was after all not a war to end all war as was so easily proclaimed in Nor did the peace settlement solve very much in the longer run The collapse of empires in central and eastern Europe paved the way for a much more unstable political world with the advent of national and independence struggles and revolution while the isolationism of the United States undermined the broader ambitions for a new international world order 
APR4	This US supreme court ruling on how a man must die is a study in cruelty	When does the execution of a prisoner cross a line and become cruel and unusual In the strange world of the US death penalty that is an all important legal question The US constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishments but condemned prisoners seeking relief have to prove their executions meet this definition as opposed to just being painful  This week the US supreme court handed down a ruling that sought to clarify what manner of execution would meet constitutional standards of cruelty and unusualness The court s answer Disembowelling 
APR4	Muslims and Jews face a common threat from white supremacists. We must fight it together	The two of us have been having the exact same conversation for the past decade About antisemitism and Islamophobia One of us a Muslim the other a Jew we have conducted it in public and in private on Twitter and on TV We ve agreed we ve argued we ve even wandered off topic to trade tips on how to get through a fast Now we ve come together because of the urgent and common threat that we face Both of our communities are under violent attack from far right white supremacists  In Christchurch New Zealand last month a white supremacist gunned down Muslims at prayer In Pittsburgh Pennsylvania last October a white supremacist gunned down Jews at prayer Both killers were clear in their loathing of both Jews and Muslims Both subscribed to the great replacement theory which casts Muslims and other minorities as invaders of western societies and a threat to white Christian majorities In this narrative the supposed invasion is a wicked plot orchestrated by the same hidden hand behind all malign events through world history the Jews The point was put concisely in an online remark reposted by the Pittsburgh murderer It s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country 
APR4	Why did Trump say his dad was German? He lies so much he doesn’t know the truth	The world can be a confusing place for Donald Trump  There are so many countries some of them of the shithole variety some less so It can be fiendishly hard to keep track of all the comings and goings of all the people who just show up at the door of your golf club or your border claiming to have a good reason to enter 
APR5	The lesson of this Brexit ordeal? The EU is a club worth belonging to	Consider it preparation for a self sufficient future after Brexit now our politics generates its own satire with metaphors included On Thursday the proceedings of the House of Commons came to a halt because the roof was leaking  The New York Times ran a story headlined Parliament really is broken The Commons press office put out a statement clarifying that this was not a sewage leak 
APR5	The People’s Vote campaign is about Brexit, not patching up broken parties	The People s Vote campaign has always been strictly non partisan and the cause is bigger than any allegiance to any political party This is its biggest strength Now more than ever it is vital that this remains the case  On Monday in a series of indicate votes in parliament a People s Vote damn nearly fell off the list of options when Labour MPs voted for a customs union Members of the Independent Group like me voted against it primarily because it will not deliver the frictionless trade British business demands being one step up from a ruinous hard Brexit The Liberal Democrats split on the matter but the SNP and Green MP saw the trap that had been laid and joined us in the no lobby Had we not the customs union option would have won a majority and the campaign would have fallen by the wayside In the event a motion for a confirmatory public vote was defeated but it gained the most votes of all the options put forward on Monday and a second referendum remains the only way out of the Brexit crisis 
APR5	Fleabag has gloriously affirmed every woman’s right to screw up in style	It isn t just because of the hot priest Although to be honest the hot priest does have quite a lot to do with it But the other reason almost every woman I know is gripped by the bittersweet BBC comedy Fleabag is that there s something so exhilarating about its attitude to women getting things wrong Its heroine leads an intensely interesting life but a faintly disappointing one at least in the eyes of her well to do family she is the classic underachieving younger sister the screw up the damaged one always on the verge of doing or saying something inappropriate Compared with older sister Claire she of the hysterically uptight manner creepy husband and tediously successful corporate career she s a mess  Yet nobody watching this really wants to be Claire Fleabag s habit of needily seeking sex from all the wrong people looks significantly more fun than her sister s miserable compromise of a marriage and even her financially precarious cafe business beats sitting in Claire s enormous office fretting about keeping the clients happy 
APR5	May is seeking a short extension to Brexit. How utterly contemptuous	There are only so many times you can or should give someone the benefit of the doubt In asking Donald Tusk and the European council for a ludicrous pointless extension just until June Theresa May has surrendered any right to be seen as a prime minister acting in good faith  The truth is that the last five months have been by far the worst in modern British politics Because of May From the moment that she pulled the vote on her withdrawal agreement because she knew that our democratic institutions would not consent to it she has consistently placed her own narrow interests above those of this country She has ignored and misled parliament She has acted as a demagogue giving licence to those who threaten and harass MPs She has burned bridges with our European partners and has treated the British people with contempt 
APR5	Go on, EU, ban the ‘veggie burger’ – it will be a blessing for vegans	Famously Jacob Rees Mogg has never cooked in his life But do not be surprised if this summer you see him on the news ordering a brace of carrots from a confused greengrocer before spatchcocking an aubergine and provocatively mincing an onion to snub the European parliament which has announced plans to ban meat free products from using any terminology commonly associated with meat No more bean burgers no more cauliflower steaks no more seitan ribs  MEPs will vote on the agricultural committee s recommendations in May urged on by the French socialist MEP ric Andrieu who insists People need to know what they are eating Similar laws exist in France and Missouri and at first glance seem reasonable enough 
APR5	Holidays and arms deals with Brunei don’t trump gay people’s right to exist	Gay lives either matter or they don t Declaring that you support LGBTQ rights is cost free so is wrapping yourself in the rainbow flag smiling at a same sex couple publicly holding hands with that Good for you look in your eyes or waving on a Pride parade with your kids But what happens when a dictatorship allied to Britain and linked to the British establishment announces that it will stone gay people to death and torture lesbians  A protest outside the Dorchester on Saturday should be well attended it will shame and embarrass this grubby regime
APR5	The joys (and pains) of living alone	 Hell is other people wrote Jean Paul Sartre in a quote whose meaning has been the subject of hot debate ever since Some say it should be taken literally some clever dicks say it s more about the loss of identity we suffer via the company of others But are we absolutely sure he wasn t referring to his chambre mate who ate the last of his Cathedral City Because that is seriously annoying  We may never know what prompted his existential zinger but what we do know is that the number of people living alone is rising fast at least in the UK According to the Office for National Statistics the figure went up by as much as between and and will hit million people by That s a lot of unanswered honey I m home s But as someone who lives alone I can attest to the joys of such an arrangement And so with apologies to the genuinely brilliant housemates I had for many years who could reasonably see this as a needlessly passive aggressive revenge article and with apologies to my temporary cohabitee Dan who is clean considerate and coherent the three Cs here are six reasons why living solo is easily the best thing I ve ever done bar none 
APR5	Either way, it’s just not Brexit: pro-leave MPs like me must reject May’s false choice	To a leave voter it is a false choice to say we either sign the withdrawal agreement or we delay our exit from the EU Neither of these is Brexit  The prime minister seems to think if she keeps making that the choice pro Brexit MPs will eventually cave in and vote for her withdrawal agreement As Keir Starmer tellingly said the agreement stays the same but the threats used day to day and person to person are different The government has both told Labour they need to vote for it to avoid a no deal exit and told Conservatives they need to vote for it to avoid a delay or no Brexit at all 
APR5	Failing healthcare in jails is killing female prisoners	Those in prison and other places of detention are entitled to a standard of healthcare equivalent to that offered in the community as established in both national and international guidelines Yet the inquest into the death of Annabella Landsberg concluded on Thursday that her death was contributed to by serious failures at HMP Peterborough including the absence of diabetic care that is readily available in local health services  The work of Inquest the charity I m a director of shows that prisons consistently fail to provide care and support for physical and mental ill health But these state failures begin far beyond prison walls 
APR5	A room of one’s own? Today’s writers can’t afford such a luxury	A room of one s own Endless biscuits Coffee democracy a cleaner an osteopath reliable wifi and an ergonomic chair with lumbar support These are some of the things that contemporary authors say they need in order to write  These requirements have been shared in response to a new survey from the Royal Society of Literature which will be published to mark the th anniversary of Virginia Woolf s A Room of One s Own Woolf said that a woman needed a year and a lock on the door in order to stand a chance as a writer of fiction and not much seems to have changed since then 
APR6	If identity politics is a force for good, how does white nationalism fit in?	 You turned the issue on its head someone said to me after I gave a talk on identity politics in Melbourne last week I ve never thought of it that way round It always was on its head I said to her It s just that we ve never noticed  I ve been in Australia over the past week talking among other things about the politics of identity The issue has in the wake of the Christchurch mosque massacres acquired new resonance The gunman who has been charged in a New Zealand court with counts of murder was Australian It has led to much soul searching about white nationalism and its roots and about the role of mainstream media and politics in fuelling hatred 
APR6	For me, fear about drug supplies is real. I could go blind	Matt Hancock has his fridges They ll see us through won t they They have to The alternatives don t bear thinking about A year ago in a busy neuro ophthalmology clinic I steeled myself to ask what would happen to me after Brexit Let s hope it doesn t come to that the neurologist said stuffing my paperwork years of terror and hope back into my NHS file It wasn t a particularly useful answer but it was the best I was going to get  I am registered blind I have crion chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuritis an autoimmune disorder affecting the optic nerve and I have lost all sight in one eye Limited vision in the other is maintained with daily steroids and infusions of IVIg intravenous immunoglobulin which I receive every weeks 
APR6	Oh do look at the tin-pot Brexiters, having their moment in the spotlight	Sick of Brexit Yeah me too Partly because it becomes clearer with each chaotic day that for some of the second tier Brexit ultras no one much cares about Mark Francois Steve Baker Andrew Bridgen Bernard Jenkin et al this is the most attention they ve ever had and are ever likely to get in their sad blustering self important lives While it s Remainers who are supposed to be the soppy drama queens just look at this bunch flapping about the media mouth breathing through their camera time sparkly eyed with their own significance Brexit as a debilitating national crisis Hardly They ve never felt so alive  It s increasingly difficult to ignore the fact that some very unimpressive politicos appear to be having a good Brexit achieving a prominence that until now not so mysteriously eluded them When the likes of Boris Johnson scuttled off to perfect leadership bids a vacuum appeared and into it swooped who s that characters to variously spray sub military spittle flecked drivel into television cameras Francois rant about bulldozing Westminster Baker brag about refusing to compromise Bridgen and wail about no deal all of the above Politically they re hardened Brexiters having their moment but a dark psychological subtext also hints at near nonentities lapping up the attention they ve long craved 
APR6	Britney Spears and a civilised response to her mental health	When Britney Spears shaved her head and took an umbrella to a paparazzo s car in the events of a night turned into a circus like spectacle gobbled up by a bloodthirsty audience When a few months later she was taken into psychiatric care photographers jostled and pushed around the ambulance trying to snatch an image of the singer in obvious distress adding the flashes of their cameras to the flashing lights of the emergency vehicle An episode of South Park that was broadcast in Britney s New Look offered a surprisingly furious satirical riposte famous young women become sacrifices for a baying crowd who nitpick at every flaw literally hounding their target to death  What a difference a decade can make Last week Spears posted a quote on her Instagram page Fall in love with taking care of yourself mind body spirit along with a caption that read We all need to take time for a little me time followed by a smiley face It was timed to coincide with reports that she had checked herself into a mental health facility for days This news has been unaccompanied by frenzy or hysteria Instead though widely reported and unpicked it has been treated with something approaching respect and certainly a wider understanding of the situation The messages of love and support posted by fans seem supportive and empathetic the tabloid reports relatively muted and factual 
APR6	The sex revolution of my youth wasn’t so great. Maybe today’s celibacy is a sign of progress	In in the so called summer of love hippies drug dealers and the homeless young filled San Francisco s Haight Ashbury saturated with the scent of incense and dope Flower power love and peace were visibly fraying into psychedelic seediness I was a British student on a full grant travelling by Greyhound bus I had stopped off in California to see what the revolution was all about  While I dressed the part mini skirt and silver boots the s for me until then had been identical to that experienced by the poet Michelene Wandor full of people I didn t sleep with joints I didn t smoke plays I wasn t in On this particular afternoon a heavily bearded male not much interested in personal hygiene and festooned in beads stopped me in the street Wanna ball he asked speculatively So much for free love I politely declined 
APR6	James Corden as Mr Darcy is more likely than a fat British politician taking high office	James Corden the celebrity wit and actor complains with justice of discrimination against chubby artists like himself  They are never cast straightforwardly in romantic roles A visiting alien could he says easily get the impression supposing it relied on films for information that if you are chubby or fat or big you never really fall in love you never have sex He s right You d need a heart of stone not to mourn the loss assuming that more conventionally handsome actors can t be made to step aside of say James Corden s Vronsky James Corden s Heathcliff and or Mr Darcy James Corden reminding us in a remake of Brokeback Mountain just how long audiences have had to tolerate the unconscionable tyranny on screen of the beautiful and muscular 
APR6	Another young life failed by what now passes for justice in Scotland	Successive Holyrood administrations have provided a dizzying array of legislative bells and whistles to make Scots feel all warm and pure They are all well meaning of course but some were tinged by a degree of sanctimonious self indulgence such as the named person proposals and sank accordingly A similar fate lay in store for the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act which was badly drafted and ridiculed out of court by judges who grew weary of clumsy attempts by police to criminalise innocent young men guilty of nothing more than singing dodgy songs and waving political flags  Occasionally cracks become apparent in this carefully constructed liberal facade and through them we are granted a glimpse of something more sinister Curiously these appear in the realm of crime and punishment a jurisdiction in which Conservatives are usually to be found fulfilling their fantasies 
APR6	We can cry for Alan Kurdi, but living migrants get no pity	The Alan Kurdi picked up migrants last Wednesday Neither Italy nor Malta will allow the ship to dock It s the latest standoff between national authorities and migrant rescue boats in the Med  The policy of zero tolerance towards undocumented migrants is borrowed from Australia The current centre right coalition in Canberra came to power in promising to stop the boats of asylum seekers A military operation Operation Sovereign Borders was set up to intercept migrant boats Posters boasted No Way You Will Not Make Australia Home 
APR6	May I have a word about… hubs, upticks and spikes	How insidiously certain words inveigle themselves into everyday discourse Take hub which in my day meant the centre of a wheel No longer Just consider these from recent press reports   Cromer tennis club member slams toffs of north Norfolk over m sports hub plans Shiseido opens m research hub in Japan to spur creativity and collaboration Scandalous waste Council spent m on business hub worth m Anger over claims that new bus hub that threatens local businesses is for greater good Jack Sargeant AM gathers cross party support for Heathrow Logistics Hub bid 
APR6	Luton’s cabbies are giving Brexit Britain a lesson in political courage	For a lesson in how politics should be done don t look at Westminster as politicians um and ah and slump into their umpteenth mutinous Brexit stalemate Instead head miles north to Luton airport where a bunch of minicab drivers are getting on with the real business of politics battling to improve their and others lives And in a few weeks they will make history for the right reasons  The fight of these odd drivers for Addison Lee looks nothing like the zombie politics of parliament These aren t English public schoolboys waging decades old grudge matches but working class cabbies almost all of Asian origin They don t lunch with top journalists but worry about how they re going to afford the family s groceries And their politicking is done not inside a Gothic debating chamber but over post shift Happy Meals 
APR7	Brexit may destroy parties. So what? It’s the country that matters	There is a much disputed legend that when the conquistador Francisco Pizarro first approached the shores of South America the indigenous peoples were so psychologically overwhelmed by the scale and alien nature of his ships that they saw only inexplicable ripples in the ocean  Accurate or not the tale has unhappy resonance in Westminster this week Far from rising to a historic challenge the political class seems paralysed by the terrifying proximity of Brexit taking refuge in the comparative trivia of party and factional politics instead of addressing with clarity and courage the greatest prospective change since the second world war in our institutional economic and social arrangements 
APR7	Bulldozing mosques: the latest tactic in China’s war against Uighur culture	Ten years ago I started researching Islam among the Uighurs I spent my summers travelling around the Xinjiang region in western China I took long bus journeys through the desert to Kashgar Yarkand and Kucha slept on brick beds in family homes in remote villages stopped off at Sufi shrines and visited many many mosques My husband was working with me and we dragged our kids along for the ride The kids were quite small and not at all interested in our boring interviews with imams and I bribed them with treats I have a lot of photos of them sitting in the dust outside mosques faces smeared with ice cream playing on their iPads  It was an incredible time for mosque building in Xinjiang After the Cultural Revolution Uighur and Kazakh Muslims began to reconnect with their faith They resumed the traditional practices of pilgrimage and festivals at the shrines that lie deep in the Taklamakan desert They began to learn about Islam in the wider world people who could afford it travelled to Mecca for the hajj and they began to rebuild their mosques As local communities grew richer they invested in bigger and more beautiful mosques people crowded into them for Friday prayers and they served as living symbols of community identity and pride 
APR7	Netanyahu’s fearmongering is working. Israelis have forgotten how to hope	I work in the Israeli industry of melancholy and I didn t even know it Luckily over a year ago the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu boldly exposed this enterprise and helped me and my coworkers realise that we are part of it In several scoffing speeches and a memorable photograph in which he was beaming like only truly happy people do his left arm resting on a can of pickles which in Hebrew denotes sourpusses Bibi saw through us and showed us for the whiners that we are Now with elections looming even a taxi ride reflects his insight Look at the traffic to the airport at the bustling cafes my driver told me Life is good Bibi is great what are you leftists complaining about all the time My response could only betray that I am indeed a kvetch  Discarding such relics as a political platform under Netanyahu the Likud s party line is party time while centre left contenders try to fathom how to urge voters to opt for real change without saying things are really bad And in a way they are Even without Israel s year occupation and retreating democracy security concerns social rifts struggling health and transportation systems and the high cost of living make Netanyahu s plea for glee look incongruous 
APR7	In May’s home county, Tory problems run much deeper than Brexit	 It s a shithole she said It s supposed to be Theresa May s area and I m not being funny but would you want to live here  I ve seen worse places I said 
APR7	Facebook is asking to be regulated but wants to choose how	A year on from the Cambridge Analytica scandal two and a half years on from the advent of fake news and the presidential elections and many years on from academics and occasional journalists raising their hands in concern about the emerging issues of our information environment are we any closer to fixing the problem  Like climate change and the financial system the answer to this question is both yes and no Yes in that we now at least have a shared understanding of just how great the problems are we have a totally unregulated media environment run by a handful of giant US corporations that built their companies so fast it is now clear they had no idea what they were doing Or indeed how to effectively stop some of the unwanted consequences such as genocide live streamed terror attacks and stolen elections And no in that our capacity to agree on what fixing might look like is extremely limited 
APR7	‘Creepy Joe’ Biden made women uneasy. Sorry shouldn’t be the hardest word	Joe Biden doesn t do apologies The former US vice president and leading but still not formally announced candidate for president sympathises and empathises He understands and reaches out He shares But he doesn t say he s sorry  This has never been a big deal given his famous agreeableness his easygoing manner and his much touted common touch For a guy who sometimes comes across more like an overgrown puppy than a potential commander in chief it might even have seemed an asset to stand his ground and show a little spine But over the last week after eight women have accused Biden of inappropriate touching aka handsiness his no apology stance has turned into a very big deal 
APR7	Theresa May, I’d gladly never see your boat race again	In the quest to understand Theresa May which capricious fate has imposed on us all the key is to think of James Cracknell At time of writing Thursday the year old is expected to take part in Sunday s Boat Race and the year old is expected to be Sunday s prime minister The former expectation seems marginally more solid than the latter but both are likelier than not  Before then of course Theresa May may announce or should that be might Theresa Might may announce no May may announce her intention to step down Then again she s announced her intention to step down a couple of times already But May may have announced her intention to step down again Possibly more than once 
APR7	The Boeing scandal is an indictment of Trump’s corporate America	America First nationalism indulgent free market economics Republican libertarianism and a political system in hock to corporate lobbying has just contributed to killing innocent people The more we know about the crashes of Boeing Max planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia after anti stalling devices locked both aircraft into unrecoverable nose dives the more shocking the story becomes  It is not just Boeing a once magnificent company that is being condemned it is the US s wider economic political and regulatory structures What is not required is a short term software fix on the faulty MCAS system that automatically adjusts the plane s flight trajectory along with an improved safety manual and training for pilots which is Boeing s response so far What is needed is a root and branch overhaul of the intersection between capitalism and democracy in the US The current set up and the accompanying libertarian anti state anti regulation philosophy literally kills people 
APR7	If identity politics is a force for good, how does white nationalism fit in?

APR7	Should democracies leave voters to their handheld devices?	It feels urgent with elections approaching in several democracies to focus on lessons from when the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election were both marred in ways still coming to light Among several valuable reports a recent study for the European parliament s Panel for the Future of Science and Technology usefully encapsulates the challenges without unremitting alarmism and pessimism It is clear eyed about both the benefits and dangers to democracies of technologies that are in the handheld devices of most voters  Against a backdrop of increasing polarisation new digital technologies have taken centre stage in political processes both as a source of information and a campaigning platform says the study Polarisation and the use of technology in political campaigns and communication Such new and relatively unregulated platforms create new opportunities for nefarious actors to deliberately push false content and distort information flows for political gain But artificial intelligence will also offer new opportunities for better accountability and transparency 
APR8	Should Labour support a second Brexit referendum?	I didn t come easily to the position of supporting another vote on leaving the EU I resisted for more than a year for a number of reasons The main reason was that my constituency was a leave majority but also I found some of the arguments and rhetoric of the campaign for a People s Vote arrogant It was some way distant from my experience of leave voters The people where I live are not stupid they are not racist they are more than capable of looking at the facts presented at any given time and deciding with either their heads hearts or in most cases both what is best for them and their families  The facts of course have changed We now know much more about what is on offer The political class has been forced to remember that Northern Ireland exists and has come face to face with the reality of leaving an institution we have become completely integrated with 
APR8	Britain is in a grimmer state than I can ever remember	The mood has turned nastier since I first visited the Big Help Project food bank in Knowsley Merseyside two years ago Back then the Brexit poison hadn t seeped so deep But now when the call goes out for food donations to feed its clients things have changed says Peter Mitchell the project leader I get people asking Is this food for British people I never used to hear that never It s hideous it makes my blood boil  How does he reply I say this food is for hungry people He sighs heavily Brexit did this It gives permission to copy Farage and Trump to say things they never used to say He points to the rising racism in football with a coconut thrown at a black player over the weekend It makes you despair Brexit is doing this to us 
APR8	Don't dread the European elections – they could fix our broken politics	After months and months of picking over the minutiae of negotiations in parliament and beyond the UK is tired of Brexit I know I am you take one day off from following the ins and outs and even though nothing has changed for weeks you re somehow behind You know it s important but watching politicians and commentators trade macho insults is incredibly tedious And now there could be European elections on the cards  A European election might seem like a distraction when it can t deliver what the country desperately needs a general election and with it a new government that will fund our schools so they aren t at the point of collapse and design an economy where the norm is not plummeting living standards and rising homelessness 
APR8	The Windrush compensation scheme adds serious insult to serious injury	Sajid Javid the home secretary promised to make things right by the victims of the so called Windrush scandal He now has his chance to live up to the promise but the much needed and welcome compensation scheme announced on Wednesday has some potentially serious flaws  Guidance which runs to pages details all the documents that the people affected will have to present to apply for compensation for the hardships they have endured over many years loss of jobs and income debt homelessness stress physical and mental health problems detention and even deportation 
APR8	Three cheers for Holly Willoughby's refusal to talk about her diet	 It s not up to me to give you a blow by blow account of what I ve eaten that day It s not helpful and it s not what s important Holly Willoughby told the Sunday Times presumably to the cheers of women everywhere  The This Morning presenter s weight loss last year was predictably picked over by the tabloids And Willoughby is used to attention for how she looks she shares her wardrobe with her million Instagram followers daily But she explained that the silence over the issue of her smaller frame has been intentional 
APR8	In May’s home county, Tory problems run much deeper than Brexit	 It s a shithole she said It s supposed to be Theresa May s area and I m not being funny but would you want to live here  I ve seen worse places I said 
APR8	Barack Obama is stuck in the past. He represents the old Democratic party	Barack Obama is worried about the Democratic party This weekend he told a crowd at an Obama Foundation event in Berlin that the party is becoming a circular firing squad targeting those straying from purity on certain issues  Leading figures around the party have indeed moved to the left since he left office two years ago Thanks in no small part to the Bernie Sanders campaign and the rise of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Medicare for All free public higher education a minimum wage and action on climate change have become mainstream positions 
APR8	The secret of Netanyahu’s success? A simple tale of good versus evil	Israel is a land of storytellers Authors such as Amos Oz and David Grossman are acclaimed worldwide and the political thriller Fauda has the nation well and truly addicted But the best storyteller in our country is Benjamin Netanyahu The prime minister s talent allows him to construct a narrative so realistic one could actually believe in it Above all it is his great skill in manipulating characters that makes him transcend mere politics In fact I would hazard a guess that Netanyahu is the best storyteller in the world  The word storyteller might sound disrespectful In the streets where I grew up in the heart of Tel Aviv it was usually used as an insult Jewish mamas want their sons to be doctors not storytellers But storytelling is a very serious business In the case of Netanyahu you could say it s deadly serious 
APR8	Were all your teachers white? I’ve often been the only one who looks like my students	These are banner times for the education system across Australia and North America  The New York Times has revealed that out of almost students admitted into the top selective public school in New York City only seven were black 
APR8	Bulldozing mosques: the latest tactic in China’s war against Uighur culture	Ten years ago I started researching Islam among the Uighurs I spent my summers travelling around the Xinjiang region in western China I took long bus journeys through the desert to Kashgar Yarkand and Kucha slept on brick beds in family homes in remote villages stopped off at Sufi shrines and visited many many mosques My husband was working with me and we dragged our kids along for the ride The kids were quite small and not at all interested in our boring interviews with imams and I bribed them with treats I have a lot of photos of them sitting in the dust outside mosques faces smeared with ice cream playing on their iPads  It was an incredible time for mosque building in Xinjiang After the Cultural Revolution Uighur and Kazakh Muslims began to reconnect with their faith They resumed the traditional practices of pilgrimage and festivals at the shrines that lie deep in the Taklamakan desert They began to learn about Islam in the wider world people who could afford it travelled to Mecca for the hajj and they began to rebuild their mosques As local communities grew richer they invested in bigger and more beautiful mosques people crowded into them for Friday prayers and they served as living symbols of community identity and pride 
APR9	At last, Brexit explained in two words: Basil Fawlty	In a crumbling edifice a farce plays out The hapless central character fawns on an aristocrat who turns out to be a conman He then fails to disguise his unease when confronted with his European neighbours doesn t bother to mask a thorough contempt for the Irish and enters a love hate relationship with ostentatiously wealthy Americans Meanwhile there are questions over food safety and supply specifically kippers duck and veal cutlets as workers scurry around trying to pretend that nothing out of the ordinary is happening Always disaster hovers at the edge of vision  Forty years after the finale of Fawlty Towers which has just been named the UK s best ever situation comedy its eerie prescience seems even more important than the cringing laughter it gifted us For Fawlty Towers was above all an ensemble piece about isolation It was a portrait of rage and frustration an exploration of the impotence that results when the world as we wish it to be is so agonisingly at odds with the world as it is It was the Brexit mindset incubating in the shabby surroundings of a down at heel hotel that had seen far better days 
APR9	Is Brexit still worth it? Only the public can answer that question	Britain is still a member of the EU thanks to people who wished it wasn t Brexit has already been delayed once because MPs who think it should happen voted against the deal that would have made it happen Now Theresa May is going to Brussels to postpone it further Such self thwarting is a feat of slapstick political gymnastics like falling up a flight of stairs  Eurosceptic hardliners don t see it that way of course They believe that May s deal does not qualify as a proper Brexit and would rather leave with no deal at all They also think parliament is stuffed with Europhiles who are obstructing our departure Even then the logical thing for the ultras to do is vote for May s deal then resume agitating for harder severance terms The no deal scenario is a fantasy anyway a utopia of pristine liberation As such it can be revived within days or indeed hours of a deal being ratified Some of the more tactically astute Brexiters have understood that and their cynical pragmatism is causing a split within the Tory European Research Group the cold blooded fanatics are falling out with the hot tempered maniacs 
APR9	It won’t undermine marriage to make divorce easier. It’s simple humanity	He was one husband for the first eight years of their marriage and someone quite different for the next eight  Or so the former Olympic rower James Cracknell whose separation from his partner Beverley Turner was recently announced apparently put it Like most elite athletes he had always been formidably driven obsessive even in pursuit of extreme sporting challenges But a head injury sustained during one of them caused changes to his personality that were clearly hard for everyone in the family including him to live with Arguing about whose fault the breakdown of their marriage was in these circumstances seems ridiculous and petty and yet that s what the law would currently require them to do 
APR9	My young son was 'approached' online. Does that make me a bad parent?	 No one in the world has done this before Jeremy Wright secretary of state for digital culture media and sport said of the government s newly launched internet regulations And it s important that we get it right Perhaps because Wright has kept a low profile in the recent psychedelic months of government it sounded like the first mature and reasonable thing I had heard from a minister in a long time  Sajid Javid meanwhile gave this pugilistic description of the same white paper I m giving tech companies a message that they cannot ignore I warned you and you didn t do enough It s not controversial it s not authoritarian right now we re failing Children leave behind their protection and supervision when they go online to a place that is a hunting ground for monsters

I didn t come easily to the position of supporting another vote on leaving the EU I resisted for more than a year for a number of reasons The main reason was that my constituency was a leave majority but also I found some of the arguments and rhetoric of the campaign for a People s Vote arrogant It was some way distant from my experience of leave voters The people where I live are not stupid they are not racist they are more than capable of looking at the facts presented at any given time and deciding with either their heads hearts or in most cases both what is best for them and their families  The facts of course have changed We now know much more about what is on offer The political class has been forced to remember that Northern Ireland exists and has come face to face with the reality of leaving an institution we have become completely integrated with 
APR9	Britain is in a grimmer state than I can ever remember	The mood has turned nastier since I first visited the Big Help Project food bank in Knowsley Merseyside two years ago Back then the Brexit poison hadn t seeped so deep But now when the call goes out for food donations to feed its clients things have changed says Peter Mitchell the project leader I get people asking Is this food for British people I never used to hear that never It s hideous it makes my blood boil  How does he reply I say this food is for hungry people He sighs heavily Brexit did this It gives permission to copy Farage and Trump to say things they never used to say He points to the rising racism in football with a coconut thrown at a black player over the weekend It makes you despair Brexit is doing this to us 
APR9	A Brexit compromise is in view. A customs union is the only solution	The gates are sliding shut The options are closing The extremists are refusing to budge and the centre cannot agree The only god is time and she is ticking ever louder  Within the next two days Theresa May must manoeuvre herself a Commons majority behind a deal that will win another Brexit extension from the EU on Wednesday That majority deal is now in full view it would mean the UK leaving the EU with a customs union in place as agreed with Labour This would honour the frankly vague wish of the referendum and it would provide continuity in trade with Europe It is a palpable compromise but for either extreme to present it as a national humiliation or catastrophe is absurd We have been in that customs union without obvious harm for years 
APR9	My brother was fatally stabbed. Don’t let knives become normal	My younger brother Colin was fatally stabbed when he was just in a case of mistaken identity To this day the impact of my brother s death is something that my family and friends still struggle with Sadly since Colin s death in knife crime has continued to rise at an alarming rate  It seems like barely a day goes by without a headline or a piece on the evening news about the tragic loss of young life due to knife crime The coverage is relentless Even at a good secondary academy like the one at which I am a deputy headteacher where knife crime simply isn t an issue I worry about the impact that this continuous stream of reports is having on our young people As teachers we re not doing our jobs properly if we shy away from it our students are hearing about these crimes so their opinions must be heard 
APR9	Mental health problems don't end with age. Older people need help too	After years languishing in the dark mental illness is finally getting its moment in the spotlight Frustrating political football it may be but one thing can t be denied it s making headlines more than ever Focus largely has been on young people crises in child and adolescent mental healthcare and in student populations have been both persistent and significant But mental illness doesn t end with reaching adulthood often in fact it doesn t end at all  New research from the British Journal of Psychiatry into self harm in older people puts this into stark perspective A meta analysis of studies found that yearly self harm rates were about per people with risk of repetition and of suicide also higher than average Self harm is still seen as a problem among younger demographics and while that remains true this data proves that the issue is even more complex and diffuse than we thought 
APR9	Moise Kean’s story shows the far right haunts Italy’s football stadiums	On Saturday Moise Kean a year old footballer born in Italy to Ivorian parents scored his fifth goal in five games playing for the country s biggest team Juventus and its national team The most exciting player to burst on to the Italian football scene for years Kean should have enjoyed an uncomplicated moment of adulation Instead he was put in his place  In a previous goal celebration at Cagliari the week before Kean had responded to racist abuse from fans by standing stock still arms spread wide and palms upwards His face wasn t vengeful he appeared peaceful through the sweat But afterwards Leonardo Bonucci Kean s captain in the national side and his Juventus teammate said Kean was half to blame for the racism because of his reaction to his goal 
APR10	I can feel it: the Tory Brexiteers are starting to crack	As a remainer who has grown up among traditional Conservatives where anti Europe instincts run deep I was deeply affected by reading Peter Oborne s heartfelt piece this week in which he suggested that Brexit may need rethinking altogether Was this finally a pivotal moment Reading it repeatedly on Sunday night I even sacrificed Line of Duty  Oborne is the former political editor of the Daily Telegraph a prominent and respected Brexiter and a lifelong Conservative And here he was with quiet intelligence talking directly to his fellow Eurosceptics persuading them to take a breath swallow their pride and consider again We will never be forgiven if and when Brexit goes wrong Future generations will look back at what we did and damn us He and his wife have five children so for him this is not metaphorical 
APR10	Sorry, guys, you can’t be an actor and moan about body image	I should as someone who repeatedly complains about the objectification of women have some sympathy for a young male actor who complains that they feel bad for actively participating in the whole objectification process Richard Madden who had the lead role in the BBC drama Bodyguard says he has been told to lose weight has to go to the gym twice a day and do the no carbs thing when he is preparing for nude scenes  His actor mates face a similar plight We re just feeding this same shit that we re against Madden said This shit is what he calls a very unrealistic body image So the terrible thing that has been happening to women for ever is now happening to men as well That s feminism for you making men feel equally inadequate the world over Seriously I am aware that many young men feel in despair about their bodies and that eating disorders are on the increase But no one has to present an unrealistic body image do they Madden said he has started asking if a plotline requires nudity Again another question that women actors have never not had to deal with Yet Chris Hemsworth felt the pressure to get in shape for his Avengers role Then there is Aidan Turner the Poldark guy and Jude Law pictured in his tighty whities filming The New Pope 
APR10	Neoliberalism promised freedom – instead it delivers stifling control	My life was saved last year by the Churchill Hospital in Oxford through a skilful procedure to remove a cancer from my body Now I will need another operation to remove my jaw from the floor I ve just learned what was happening at the hospital while I was being treated On the surface it ran smoothly Underneath unknown to me was fury and tumult Many of the staff had objected to a decision by the National Health Service to privatise the hospital s cancer scanning They complained that the scanners the private company was offering were less sensitive than the hospital s own machines Privatisation they said would put patients at risk In response as the Guardian revealed last week NHS England threatened to sue the hospital for libel if its staff continued to criticise the decision  The dominant system of political thought in this country which produced both the creeping privatisation of public health services and this astonishing attempt to stifle free speech promised to save us from dehumanising bureaucracy By rolling back the state neoliberalism was supposed to have allowed autonomy and creativity to flourish Instead it has delivered a semi privatised authoritarianism more oppressive than the system it replaced 
APR10	Schools, put down your begging bowls. Unite and protest instead	Given the billion shortfall in funding that schools across England have suffered in the last three years it s little wonder that school fundraising efforts to plug these gaps have had to become increasingly creative  In the school I taught in last year the school building was hired out in the evening to raise extra cash so it wasn t unusual to finish my marking to the lively sounds of the local Ghanaian church service in the canteen next to my classroom At the end of last term my current school hosted a conference for teachers from across the country for a lively day of collaborative discussion on classroom pedagogy with tickets costing visiting teachers a head 
APR10	My cousin has been killed in Sudan’s protests. His death must not be in vain	On Sunday morning the day after renewed protests in Sudan calling for the resignation of President Omar al Bashir a message came through on the family WhatsApp group Ma ab has been shot in the heart  My heart skipped a beat and I couldn t breathe Ma ab Hanafi My cousin The funny photographer The tall skinny one who was shier than his brother but who always had a kind word to spare 
APR10	Netanyahu’s victory means life is about to get worse for Palestinians	Think of it as Israel s groundhog night It begins with exit polls that delight Benjamin Netanyahu s opponents and send a shudder through Likud headquarters and ends several hours later with a crowd of supporters cheering Bibi king of Israel It happened that way in when Netanyahu won his first term as prime minister it happened again in and it happened once more last night The initial projection which saw Netanyahu lagging behind Benny Gantz a former chief of staff of the military melted away as the night wore on until both men had an even number of seats but with Netanyahu the obvious winner thanks to the overall strength of the bloc of rightist and religious parties that he calls his natural partners in coalition Not all the votes have been counted but barring an arithmetical miracle he will soon embark on his fifth term in power  How did he do it Credit belongs in part to his own mastery of politics dark arts At Likud HQ his supporters hailed him as a magician and it is true that there is no more able sorcerer when it comes to playing on the prejudices and fears of his base Donald Trump is a novice by comparison I was in Israel for the last few days of his campaign watching as Netanyahu pressed the panic button in a bid to bring rightwing voters back home to Likud rather than opting for any of the smaller even more ultra nationalist parties He went on the radio warning that he was losing the election persuading his base that the only way to keep out Gantz whom he repeatedly branded as left and weak was to give Likud the status of largest single party 
APR10	I’ve got the best job in British politics: being an MEP	Arriving in Brussels was like the first day of school There were hundreds of us all coming from the four corners of the continent to be inducted as MEPs Exactly as I would have done at school I made a beeline for the only people I recognised my Labour colleagues  As we chatted nervously we were guided through various stations of induction photograph badge finances logistics office accommodation and finally IT I handed over my phone to be enabled and within a few seconds I had an inbox full of hundreds of unread emails I told the technician these couldn t possibly be my emails I had walked through the door only that day Welcome to the European parliament was his dry reply 
APR10	My son is dead, but how can you grieve when you can’t afford a funeral?	I was at work My boss came down and said to me The police are coming to see you I was like what have I done Half an hour later I was serving a customer when the police came up to me and said We need to speak to you It s very serious you need to sit down They said We re not here to arrest you It s to do with Rahim   What has he done now I asked 
APR10	Glaciers and Arctic ice are vanishing. Time to get radical before it's too late	Forget early warning signs and canaries in coalmines we re now well into the middle of the climate change era with its epic reshaping of our home planet Monday s news from two separate studies made it clear that the frozen portions of the Earth are now in violent and dramatic flux  The first led by the veteran Greenland glaciologist Jason Box looked across the Arctic at everything from increased tundra biomass to deepening thaw of the permafrost layer Their conclusion the Arctic biophysical system is now clearly trending away from its th century state and into an unprecedented state with implications not only within but beyond the Arctic To invent a word the north is rapidly slushifying with more rainfall and fewer days of hard freeze the latest data shows that after a month of record temperatures in the Bering Sea ocean ice in the Arctic is at an all time record low for the date crushing the record set last April 
APR10	Ireland's attempts to secularise its schools have turned to farce	In Ireland of primary schools are Catholic This religious domination of public education is anomalous in a developed nation It does not meet the needs of Ireland s increasingly diverse population or of the many citizens religious or otherwise who would rather that Catholicism was not afforded a privileged place in public life  In a government report recognised the need for change and recommended that some schools divest their religious patronage Progress has been slow Though the church agrees that some divestment is necessary at local level it is reluctant to cede power 
APR11	Whatever happens next, the nationalist right has lost the battle for Brexit	MPs reflex reaction to the new six month Brexit delay was a very human one They decided to take a break They have awarded themselves an Easter chill out starting tomorrow following the most punishing peacetime session of parliament in modern times They need it We all need it Theresa May certainly needs it  But they and we also need to use the Brexit break to relearn the art of thinking straight and seizing the moment The delay imposed by the EU on Wednesday night was not simply another familiar can kicking exercise Instead it may mark a pro European turning point in the battle of Brexit It is a moment not of enduring impasse but of real opportunity 
APR11	Julian Assange’s cyber-sins seem quaint in comparison to those of big tech	The eviction of Julian Assange from London s Ecuadorian embassy is a strange irony He saw himself as a warrior for truth across the boundless paradise of the web where people could make their own rules Now he finds himself badly in need of a secure border a friendly judge and legal protections  Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in He was fleeing not a furious US government seeking revenge for his placing a million of its secret cables on the internet but a Swedish arrest warrant for something as un digital as a suspected rape which he has always denied Two years ago the Swedes dropped the warrant and suspended its investigation while a change of regime in Ecuador led to negotiations for his eviction 
APR11	Omar al-Bashir is gone. It was Sudan’s 30 years of anger that ousted him	As the Sudanese army announced the overthrow of president Omar al Bashir after almost years in power it could look to the untrained eye as if his fall has only been weeks or months in the making The most recent protests began last December as economic conditions worsened culminating in an almost week long sit in outside the army headquarters But resistance to his regime dates back to the very day he seized power in a military coup in Since then successive waves of dissent have all been brutally quashed by him and his coterie of Islamists and mercenaries  First they came for the civil servants liquidating labour unions and throwing dissenters in jail without trial to be tortured and broken The pogrom of middle class professionals unaligned with the government was so intense in those early days that for a brief period it became a regular occurrence that entire families fled the country at short notice Every few weeks I would go to school and another face in the class was gone their desk empty without warning or a goodbye 
APR11	Brexit is delayed, so what needs to happen now? Our panel responds	Suddenly the wind dies The ship is becalmed Will the crew return to squabbling The second postponement of Brexit seems likely to bring out the worst in parliament Theresa May will be under resumed pressure to resign which will solve nothing Remainers and no dealers will return to their tribes It is hard to disagree with France s president Emmanuel Macron that a six month delay beyond June will merely encourage them  The one thing that matters now is votes in the House of Commons The prime minister has lost her party If she wants to be true custodian of Brexit the only requisite votes are sitting opposite her in her talks with Labour s Jeremy Corbyn They depend on the UK negotiating to remain in some form of European customs union and or single market It might not be ideal but it is the only deal in sight 
APR11	Merkel dresses to deflect attention – May could learn from that	Theresa May and Angela Merkel are more alike than is often thought and now we have the pictures to prove it Their twinning wardrobes of royal blue jackets and a shared joke about it over an iPad warmed the permafrost that often pertains between two leaders one of whom is trying to hand in delayed Brexit homework the other feeling that as the head prefect in the rowdy EU school she is stuck with a particularly awkward pupil  The two looked like clones at that meeting on Wednesday in matching blue But the running commentary on May s clothes is linked to the narrative of her political decline That expensive pale blue jacket of despair is starting to look like the unluckiest outerwear in the spring collections Clothes and power are interlinked from Queen Elizabeth I s competition in ruffs with Mary Queen of Scots to Margaret Thatcher s neat collars signalling prim authority and control 
APR11	More women like Shana Grice will die unless police sexism ends	Shana Grice one of the many women killed by a violent ex partner would probably be alive today were it not for widescale failures of police to act properly on incidents of stalking and domestic abuse The complacency about male violence towards women across our criminal justice system is a major symptom of endemic institutionalised misogyny within the police service  When Grice called police on Michael Lane after he chased her down the street snatched her phone and pulled her hair it was Grice not her abuser who felt the long arm of the law In the proud tradition of blaming women abused by men they once said yes to the police decided Grice was lying because Lane showed a number of text messages from Grice that indicated they had been in a relationship Lane had been reported to police in by a woman accusing him of harassment but no action was taken Following Grice s death in more women came forward to accuse Lane of stalking and harassment 
APR11	Virgin Trains is a Bransonian dystopia – good riddance to it	I ll believe it when I see it but the news that Virgin Trains could disappear from the rail network within a year has given me as much succour as the prospect of Theresa May disappearing from power With home family work and friends arranged at various points along the west coast mainline I have been to all intents and purposes a captive of Virgin s malodorous Pendolino service for my entire adult life  The best thing that can be said about them is that they get you there As a regular rail traveller however it s what they do to your soul along the way that really matters For the duration of a Virgin trip you are trapped in a red plastic Bransonian dystopia 
APR11	The EU’s new October extension finishes off May and her deal	Britain will remain in the EU until the end of October this year but diminished in power and status with a review of its conduct set for the end of June It is the marital equivalent of being sent to sleep in the spare bedroom if not quite the garden shed  Wednesday night s humiliation when other nations decided our fate a taster of Norway plus or common market where decisions are made about the UK without our presence exposes the lies of the Brexiters and the impossibility of a strong and stable position outside the EU History will recall that Britons did not value their power in Europe until they lost it Theresa May too was humiliated once again but it does not cut deeply since she appears to feels no shame She remains convinced she was and is right that blame is to be found with her detractors and not with her deal or leadership 
APR11	The Trump-Netanyahu relationship is sowing disaster for both countries	In the run up to the Israeli elections Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu took a series of irresponsible steps to help the Israeli prime minister s electoral prospects Trump announced support for Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights Netanyahu said he would annex parts of the West Bank and claimed he had US support and Trump designated Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization a move for which Netanyahu immediately took credit  Though Netanyahu may be the apparent winner of the Israeli election Trump and Netanyahu should be careful what they wish for While pleasing their rightwing supporters the two leaders are doing severe damage to the interests of both countries 
APR11	Why the black hole is a ray of light in these dark times	 The gates of hell the end of space and time That was how black holes were described at the press conference in Brussels where the first ever photograph of one was revealed to an excited audience And this black hole a super massive object at the centre of the galaxy Messier M really is a monster Everything unfortunate enough to get too close to it falls in and never emerges again including light itself It s the point at which every physical law of the known universe collapses Perhaps it is the closest thing there is to hell it is an abyss a moment of oblivion  And yet I saw the photograph as a ray of light On our own turquoise speck in the cosmos we re living through ecological breakdown the rise of authoritarianism and the appallingly unequal distribution of resources We re devoting a lot of time and energy to destroying our home and to hurting one another It can be hard not to feel like the human race has become trapped in its own event horizon and we re inevitably and inexorably being pulled towards the darkness The grainy image those scientists released on Wednesday reminds us of something different 
APR12	Trump and his imitators are out to nobble the world’s referees	A plea to those of you who are not fans of sport There might be a little bit of football and to my own surprise even some basketball in what follows But I promise it s not the whole story My concern here is with something that goes far beyond sport that points to a trend spreading into every aspect of our lives and across much of the globe But I confess it begins at the Emirates stadium watching Arsenal  I came late to the beautiful game drawn to it by the enthusiasm of my young sons One thing that happened in the stands came as a surprise to me Of course I knew emotions would run high with fury expressed in a stream of four letter abuse But the target was unexpected To this day the greatest rage of those who sit around me is never directed at Arsenal s opponents Sure there s anger at Arsenal s manager for his decisions or the players for their mistakes But the most frequent object of my neighbours ire is the referee or his fellow officials They are slammed for being either blind a fatboy or driven by what s assumed to be an unbending loathing of Arsenal Football Club 
APR12	Nigel Farage’s Brexit party? Sorry but I’ll be washing my hair	Can there really be just spellbinding days to go until the Brexit deadline The answer is maybe Having played to extra time without a result the UK is now subject to the controversial golden own goal rule a form of sudden death meaning this electrifying war of attrition could end the minute any EU exit deal is got over the line However scrappily What we can say for sure is that Betamax prime minister Theresa May has been made to accept a flextension by the EU So instead of screaming NO really urgently as we have been in recent weeks we will instead be screaming Noooooooooooooooooooo in slow motion till the end of October We hold all the cards and the sunlit uplands are within our grasp  Naturally not everyone is happy Nigel Farage is so angry that this morning he came out of retirement to launch his new party in Coventry with a rally in Birmingham promised tomorrow Yes Maverick is re engaging sir The small man s back in town Like me you probably missed Farage s latest retirement which involved him being on the airwaves more than even Holly Willoughby who people actually like He is now the frontman for something called the Brexit party which in the usual way of these things was led until last month by a Catherine Blaiklock before she was forced to resign after some unfortunate social media posts were unearthed 
APR12	Whatever you think of Julian Assange, his extradition to the US must be opposed	States that commit crimes in foreign lands depend on at least passive acquiescence This is achieved in a number of ways One is the othering of the victims the stripping away of their humanity because if you imagined them to be people like your own children or your neighbours their suffering and deaths would be intolerable Another approach is to portray opponents of foreign aggression as traitors or in league with hostile powers And another strategy is to cover up the consequences of foreign wars to ensure that the populace is kept intentionally unaware of the acts committed in their name  This is what the attempted extradition of Julian Assange to the US is about Back in the then US soldier Chelsea Manning downloaded hundreds of thousands of classified documents relating to US led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan US state department cables and inmates imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay Assange s alleged role consists of helping Manning crack an encrypted password to gain access to the US defense department computer network 
APR12	The culture war over ‘LGBT lessons’ is based on distortion. Here are the facts	If you are the parent of a school aged child you ve probably heard that primary sex ed will be mandatory from September Even if you aren t a parent you ve likely heard of No Outsiders the LGBT curriculum that has sparked protests by a number of Muslim parents at Parkfield community school in Birmingham resulting in hundreds of children being withdrawn  No Outsiders has been suspended but the protests have spread throughout Birmingham and to Manchester with hundreds more parents threatening to withdraw their children from schools Two weeks ago BBC Question Time brought this conflict to the nation at large by asking Is it morally right that five year old children learn about LGBTQ issues in school 
APR12	Amritsar, 100 years on, remains an atrocity Britain cannot be allowed to forget	Tomorrow marks the centenary of a British general gunning down unarmed Indians who had gathered peacefully in a park in Amritsar In India you only have to mention the name of the park Jallianwala Bagh for everyone to know what you are talking about Yet hardly anybody in the UK has heard about Jallianwala Bagh let alone knows why the event was one of the worst atrocities of British rule in India Nor do they appreciate why its legacy still lingers and colours relations between the UK and India to this day  The Amritsar massacre fundamentally changed how the Indians saw the Raj the era of British rule which ran from to It led Mahatma Gandhi who during the first world war had forsaken his pacifism to help recruit soldiers to preserve the empire to see British rule as satanic 
APR12	Medical cannabis isn’t reaching NHS patients. And I’m in too much pain to wait	I was delighted when the home secretary Sajid Javid announced that medical cannabis would be made available on prescription from November including the two main active ingredients cannabidiol CBD and the psychoactive component of the plant tetrahydrocannabinol THC Having used the drug for years to alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis MS I and thousands of others would benefit from the change or so I thought  I d hoped that acquiring cannabis oil legally would be a formality by now but the door still remains firmly closed Having recently moved house I registered with a new doctor and enquired about getting the oil for my pain management The request for oil containing THC was met with incredulity and a lecture on the dangers it could have on my mental health I had to bite my tongue as I was offered ibuprofen or OxyContin instead the former can rot your guts and the latter can leave you addicted to opiates To say the least it was a disappointing appointment 
APR12	I can afford to buy supplies for my kids’ schools. What about those who can’t?	When my kids started pre kindergarten in New York last year the school issued parents with a long list of items to buy and bring in This was not as in state school in Britain a list of uniform and PE kit requirements but rather necessities including paper towels glue sticks a year s supply of paper plates and plastic cutlery cups napkins board markers crayons and packing tape Classroom supplies in other words  These donations were discretionary no one was going to yell at you if you didn t bring them in And in the sheer volume of stuff being asked of each parent for two kids in separate classes it was way too much to be carried in on a single trip the tacit understanding was that those who could afford it were providing for those who could not

European elections take place on May almost certainly For this great chance to summon the pro EU pro referendum vote give thanks from the bottom of our hearts to the unbelievably useful idiots of the European Research Group hard core Special thanks to Mark Francois idiot in chief to Peter Bone Steve Baker and all the other refuseniks including our friends the doughty DUP  Were it not for them we would by now have left the EU on time on March We would be on our way out of all EU political institutions out of the common agriculture and fisheries policies no freedom of movement but free to trade with the Faroe Islands Ahead would lie a hard Brexit prime minister forging the hardest trade policies Reasonable Brexit voters will look back in anger at what these fruitcakes have rejected in pursuit of an impossible no deal crash out Idiocy is just a polite word But let s give thanks for their pig headed obstinacy Long may it last 
APR15	David Lammy was right to name and shame the ERG	They really don t like it up em do they The horrific mutation of Eton ego and the European Research Group ERG that produces the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees Mogg must not be called nasty names Oh no It has been suggested that the Labour MP David Lammy went too far on The Andrew Marr Show when he said that comparing the ERG a group of Tory MPs that supports a hard Brexit to Nazis was not strong enough Marr challenged Lammy on his language pointing out that the MPs he was referring to were elected representatives Lammy responded I don t care how elected they were so was the far right in Germany  Lammy s rhetoric has been criticised but let s join the dots Johnson says he is pro immigration and says he has only met Steve Bannon twice I haven t got all day to rehearse the racist remarks Johnson has made over the years 
APR15	Niall Ferguson isn’t upset about free speech. He’s upset about being challenged	I would pause for at least a few seconds if I found myself arguing that my freedom of speech was in a state of extreme jeopardy in this my column in a national newspaper The historian Niall Ferguson it seems did not pause when making such an argument in his column in the Sunday Times this week For Ferguson speaking to the masses online and in print the ability for him and his fellow travellers to freely speak their mind is in such dire jeopardy that the only answer is to set up a defence treaty a form of Nato for academics who experience backlash when they express their views  The people it would protect he argued include Roger Scruton the academic sacked from an unpaid government post for expressing views he d previously expressed in an interview with the New Statesman Jordan Peterson the bestselling author who had the offer of a Cambridge visiting fellowship revoked after posing with a fan wearing a T shirt bearing the slogan I am a proud Islamophobe and Roland Fryer a Harvard economist under investigation for sexual harassment which he denies That Fryer has not received a wave of support from academic colleagues Ferguson blames on political correctness 
APR15	Sajid Javid, the answer to youth knife crime lies in hospitals – and it’s been proven	In Sajid Javid s first major speech on crime today marking one year since the launch of the serious violence strategy the home secretary said the government will look at using data from multiple sectors to improve understanding of the causes of serious youth violence  This year so far young people have been killed by knife assaults and thousands of knife crime victims were treated in our hospitals in But with only half of all NHS trusts currently recording data for weapon assaults on to year olds we can t fully diagnose the size and shape of the problem we seek to prevent 
APR15	All hail Michelle Obama: like Beyoncé, she has fully upstaged her husband	Michelle Obama returned to the UK for her book tour at London s O Arena last weekend On her last visit in December over people tried to get tickets some queueing from am to get to the box office in person The last time I recall this level of excitement over an event Britain was basking in the brilliance of another black woman Beyonc during her Formation tour  The parallels between the two women are obvious they are both pop cultural juggernauts great unifiers across class race and gender divides As they have grown in their influence and ubiquity they have only become more unapologetic about their blackness And they both are partnered with initially more famous but now undeniably less universally beloved husbands 
APR15	Good news for UK renters at last – now here’s what else we can fight for	Monday marks a huge victory for private renters Theresa May and the communities secretary James Brokenshire have announced that the government will abolish section a little known law that means landlords can evict tenants without good reason Right now section is used every day to send renters packing Your landlord might decide they want to hike the rent up sell the house or just that they don t want to make the repairs that need doing It doesn t matter whether you ve been a good tenant or not whether you ve paid your rent on time The landlord is in control not the tenant I should know because it happened to me  Last year my partner Simon and I were living in Walthamstow north east London when we noticed a huge patch of damp on our ceiling We did the usual and contacted our landlord asking for them to take a look But as is the case in many disrepair stories of private renters for the next nine months nothing happened despite regular calls texts and emails So we escalated and reported the issue to our council which said the damp now developing on our ceiling wasn t severe enough for it to take action It was just days later as we were sat thinking through what to do next when a section notice came through the post asking us to leave the property in just two months time We felt we were being evicted for reporting the leak 
APR15	Extinction Rebellion protesters who want to be arrested: be careful what you wish for	When I was arrested I did not hear most of the words of the police caution I was being led from the front wheel of a deportation charter flight that I d helped blockade at Stansted airport in March There were of us in total four around the wheel and around a tripod behind the left wing One of our number had been arrested before locking on As an officer put handcuffs on me and walked me to the waiting bus he started to arrest me I am arresting you on suspicion of aggravated trespass You do not have to say anything When I rounded the corner glimpsing the collection of my fellow activists who I d not seen since we d cut through the fence many hours before we all cheered obscuring the words Once I was arrested though and sat alone in a police cell for hours on end those cheers rang hollow When we were released and eventually charged with a terrorism related offence one carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment that jubilance was replaced by endless worry stress and pain  We must be wary of glorifying arrests and incarceration as the only valid way of engaging with a movement
APR15	Twitter’s ‘PC brigade’ aren’t killing comedy – they’re shining a light on bigotry	Great leaps forward in comedy happen by asking the big questions What if you created a show that unapologetically showed the horror of war You get M A S H What if you created a sitcom about nothing You get Seinfeld What if you filmed a dog falling into an indoor swimming pool while a disembodied Harry Hill makes snide comments about the wood panelling You get You ve Been Framed from onwards And so we witnessed another great moment in comedy this week when the BBC s head of comedy asked the question we didn t realise needed to be asked is comedy dying because the internet is turning people into Victorians  Last week at the launch of the well meaning British Comedy Foundation Shane Allen railed against the way social media has imposed a Victorian moral code on comedians which damages the medium s ability to test boundaries and challenge orthodoxies 
APR15	I’m a scientist studying laughter – and it’s funnier than you might think	The American writer EB White famously said Analysing humour is like dissecting a frog Few people are interested and the frog dies of it But is the same true of analysing laughter  I am a brain scientist who studies laughter and I find it quite interesting not least because scientific analyses tell us that pretty much everything we humans think we know about laughter is wrong We think laughter is primarily something we do when we find something funny but in fact most laughter is produced for social reasons we are times more likely to laugh if there is someone else with us than when we are on our own We all laugh much more often than we think we do studies find an average of seven laughs per minutes of conversation between strangers and an average of all of a conversation between friends We think we are the only animals that laugh but laughter has been described in other apes parrots and even rats 
APR15	Only rebellion will prevent an ecological apocalypse	Had we put as much effort into preventing environmental catastrophe as we ve spent on making excuses for inaction we would have solved it by now Everywhere I look I see people engaged in furious attempts to fend off the moral challenge it presents  The commonest current excuse is this I bet those protesters have phones go on holiday wear leather shoes In other words we won t listen to anyone who is not living naked in a barrel subsisting only on murky water Of course if you are living naked in a barrel we will dismiss you too because you re a hippie weirdo Every messenger and every message they bear is disqualified on the grounds of either impurity or purity 
APR16	France is a divided nation – but Notre Dame has brought us together	Emmanuel Macron is apparently agnostic But if he believed in God he might have wondered if the Lord was sending him a message on Monday evening At around pm just as the French president prepared to record a highly anticipated address to the nation to be broadcast on TV later flames were overwhelming Notre Dame Cathedral Macron s team first thought of postponing the broadcast which was scheduled for pm before it became clear that the disaster was so grave it would have to be cancelled altogether Instead the president went from the Elys e to Notre Dame and stood among the crowds looking as flabbergasted as the rest of us stunned by the violence of the flames and the extent of the devastation It was exactly pm when the spire of the world s most famous cathedral snapped in two and collapsed into the furnace  Macron s address was to have been a key political event after months of unrest unleashed by the gilets jaunes uprising which first prompted and then threatened to derail Macron s great national debate on the future of the divided country Earlier on Monday the big question was how was Macron going to respond politically to a politically unclassifiable movement a movement without parallel in recent French history disparate leaderless legitimate in its initial demands but containing elements that are violent racist populist undemocratic with no other aim than taking over the Elys e the National Assembly and the institutions of the Republic How was he going to respond to a people who claim they are undivided while expressing multiple and contradictory aspirations lower taxes but more public services more democracy and more referendums demanding to be listened to but rejecting the notion of being represented 
APR16	Why I went viral on Twitter after talking about being evicted on Sky News	On Tuesday I had the weird experience of going viral on Twitter after an altercation with a Sky News journalist Following the government s announced plans to scrap section eviction notices I was invited on to Sky News to talk about the time I was served such a notice in February I made a complaint about the serious disrepair in the flat I have been renting with a friend since August We now have to get out by the end of the this month  As it stands section gives landlords huge power over our lives and discourages renters from making complaints or requesting repairs for fear of section revenge evictions Since around other tenants have been victims of revenge evictions making section the leading cause of homelessness in England displacing huge numbers of working people and migrants from their communities each year 
APR16	I have no time for the ERG, but David Lammy was wrong to compare them to Nazis	I am a big fan of David Lammy I think he has spoken out courageously in the past on the issue of absent fathers and I applaud his opposition to Brexit I even backed him to be the Labour mayoral candidate in  In contrast I have no time whatsoever for Jacob Rees Mogg and the rightwing ideologues of the European Research Group ERG whom even the Conservative chancellor Philip Hammond has referred to as extremists for their intransigence over Brexit 
APR16	Flexible working for parents is great. But child-free people need it, too	Fresh rallying calls for greater equality and support for mothers in the workplace are made in two recent books Heading Home Motherhood Work and the Failed Promise of Equality and Making Motherhood Work How Women Manage Careers and Caregiving  In the latter the sociologist Caitlyn Collins casts her net wide to explore how work and family tensions are exacerbated by both a long hours culture and what she sees as society s dismissive attitudes towards care giving Stressed exhausted and unappreciated mothers in Italy and the US share anecdotes that contrast markedly with those of their Swedish counterparts In Sweden more progressive social policies mean that fathers take days of paternity leave and play a bigger role in childcare bringing the nirvana of work life balance closer to reality This approach Collins argues should be more widely embraced 
APR16	How football is reframing the way we think about race	I ll always remember the first time I was called a nigger on a football pitch in Germany I was it was my first ever time outside the country without my parents on an otherwise pleasant school trip to the leafy German city of Bonn on the banks of the Rhine We d struck up a friendship with a group of local kids and after our snore fest trips into town to look at the monuments that bore little relation to our working class lives back in the multicultural hinterlands of Sheffield we would escape to play football with them near our youth hostel at around four o clock every afternoon  As sometimes happens with teenagers after one particularly competitive match things got a bit nasty and it ended with a slew of insults between players on opposing sides I had nothing to do with the altercations but one of the German players singled me out shouting At least we don t have a nigger on our team 
APR16	Who is really responsible for Brexit? The Queen	Activate the Queen She is the only person who can sort out this chaos Politicians can t and the people certainly can t because the will of the people is a floating buffet at which all stuff their faces but still yearn for a proper dinner So for instance a people s vote will either undermine democracy by ignoring the first people s vote or underscore democracy by having more of it  Theresa May can t sort it out I feel about her as my friend used to feel about her husband He has been dead for years it s just that no one has told him 
APR16	Those left behind by the contaminated blood scandal shouldn’t have to fight for support	My husband Steve Dymond was a mild haemophiliac and a victim of the contaminated blood scandal He was a funny clever gentle man for whom tributes have not ceased since he finally died in late December aged In the s he was infected with hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products on the NHS British haemophiliacs were infected with the product at the time and many have subsequently died  When I kissed his cheek for the last time and then stepped out into that lonely night I had no idea what was awaiting me 
APR16	Want a larger penis? Then your problems may be upstairs, not downstairs	A massive penis please That s most guys answer to a question many of us have at least thought about before what part of your body would you like to surgically improve and how  I remember when there was a rumour went round that Peter Andre had undergone plastic surgery on his abs to make them as pristinely popping as they were in the Mysterious Girl video and I remember even then as an eight year old boy barely aware of anything except strawberry laces and Arsenal goalkeeper kits thinking Why did he do that when he could ve got a massive penis instead 
APR16	Good on Meghan and Harry for letting the curtain fall on the royal birth media circus	News if you could call it that that Meghan Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry will not reveal the location of or plans surrounding the birth of their first child This will no doubt frustrate the swarms of paparazzi accustomed to camping out outside the Lindo wing of St Mary s hospital in anticipation of the now familiar sight of Kate Duchess of Cambridge groomed trussed up and probably still bleeding in a pair of high heels performing the whole Simba routine to the nation The strangeness of the sight has never been lost on women last year when Prince Louis was born women took to social media to share snaps of how they looked after giving birth ecstatic yes but also exhausted dazed clammy reeling Trauma aside these postnatal photos end up resembling a kind of freedom when put side by side with the stage managed spectacle of the duchess  Some of the press coverage of Meghan s pregnancy has been appalling tinged with sexism and racism
APR16	Don’t bet against the Brexit party winning the EU elections	In Nigel Farage shocked Westminster by leading Ukip to victory in the last European parliament elections the first time the Conservatives or Labour hadn t topped the ballot in a nationwide election since Since then Farage has left the party and officially launched the new Brexit party to fight this round of somewhat unexpected EU elections At the launch Farage put his money where his mouth is announcing he had placed a bet on his newly formed party topping the ballot in next month s vote  At the weekend YouGov released the first YouGov Times poll of the EU election campaign Farage s party currently finds itself in third place on within the margin of error of the Conservatives on but currently a way behind Labour who are on However there are many reasons to believe they will make up that ground over the coming weeks and Farage s gamble looks like a fairly smart bet 
APR17	Notre Dame has always been a work in progress – let’s embrace its restoration	The flames leaping above the towers of Notre Dame Cathedral as crowds of dazed onlookers sung hymns in the twilight looked apocalyptic a sight from the end of days or at least the climactic scene of a Dan Brown novel The destruction of a building so iconic so symbolic of a nation is deeply unsettling And so it should be for this irreplaceable loss of year old heritage is tragic But setting the calamity in historical context shows us how unusual our age is in investing so greatly in the veneration of ancient buildings and how accustomed we have become to thinking they can be frozen in time  Happily Notre Dame seems to have emerged less ravaged than was initially feared The main fabric of the church has survived and the relics and other holy items inside were largely rescued It was easy to forget as smoke and flame belched heavenwards that the roof made from a forest s worth of medieval timber was separated from the interior by the high arching stone vaults Some of those have collapsed but most seem still in place The glorious stained glass rose windows dating from the th century when the cathedral was completed have been mercifully spared too 
APR17	Let's join the Tories and sabotage them, like they sabotaged Britain	The thought of another unelected Tory prime minister and this time in all likelihood a rightwing fanatic is almost too much to bear If a general election isn t called before the date set by the Fixed Term Parliaments Act then we face the prospect of our next prime minister being one of the following a serial liar out only for himself a man who gambled the life of a newborn baby to appease populist zeal a guy who managed to piss off almost the entirety of our NHS workforce a woman whose rise remains unfathomable but who is definitely unmistakably a mother and Michael Gove being his stubborn best It s like being offered a Revel but only the coffee ones are left  It is no wonder that much national opinion oscillates between disbelieving despair and incredulous laughter at our current political class Perhaps then we the sensible on the left or centre or centre left should hold our noses and do something spectacular join the Conservative party I understand this is about as enjoyable a prospect as taking a dip in a sewer but shall we sabotage from the inside We could hold fringe meetings in ironic burgundy trousers Who s in 
APR17	More women over 40 are getting pregnant. But is that really about their choices?	The trend for later motherhood is continuing apace This week the Office for National Statistics released new data on conception rates for women in England and Wales showing that teenage pregnancy rates continued to decline in and that for the first time more women are getting pregnant in their s than in their s But perhaps the most striking trend concerns fortysomethings the only age group for the second year running whose conception rates are on the increase This reflects a dramatic long term shift they have more than doubled since  These are important trends but the figures give us little information about the broader social relational and even reproductive contexts within which women over are becoming pregnant and how their experiences of pregnancy might compare with those of younger women This is something we are looking to examine with a new interview based research project at the Institute for Women s Health at University College London exploring the life stories feelings and opinions of women who are pregnant in their s While the project is still in its infancy it has already provided some key insights as to why increasing numbers of women are having children after and how they feel about later motherhood 
APR17	What unites naked protesters and Mark Carney? Climate change	This morning two very different kinds of harbingers brought us a message of climate doom One was a colourful crowd of climate activists called Extinction Rebellion who have been blocking traffic in London for the last two days and who are today planning further economic disruption aimed directly at the city s jugular the tube and rail networks  The other was less expected Mark Carney the governor of the Bank of England along with the governor of France s central bank Villeroy de Galhau has written an article for the Guardian warning banks and insurers that climate change threatens them too In the wallet Insurance claims from droughts and floods are bad for business Then there s the fact that governments are now taking carbon emissions seriously which means companies that don t adjust will likely be adjusted out of existence And at a certain point when climate catastrophe deepens there will be a Minsky moment a sudden collapse in asset prices true economic disruption 
APR17	The misogynist trolls attacking Katie Bouman are the tip of the trashpile	The researcher Katie Bouman played a leading role in taking the first photograph of a black hole A photo of the year old Bouman taken the moment the photo was processed shows her with her hands clasped in front of her mouth looking at the camera with a mix of shock and excitement It went viral both a testament to the groundbreaking work itself and a moment of victory for women in the sciences whose contributions have long been ignored downplayed and erased  The giddiness didn t last long 
APR17	Progressive Muslims, Jews and Christians must stand together for LGBT rights	Struggling to come to terms with being gay as a child is by no means an experience unique to those who grow up religious For as long as being straight remains the dominant sexuality and despite the best efforts of the homosexual agenda it looks like that ll forever be the case being gay lesbian bisexual trans or queer still means working out what it means to be something other something different a journey of self acceptance we all embark on if we can  If you happen to be born into one of the Abrahamic religions however you are presented with a unique obstacle on that path You re not just dealing with friends family and a society that continues to be far from accepting but have the added complication of God who hasn t traditionally been understood to be the greatest of queer allies to contend with too 
APR17	Theresa May’s successor will be a crucial choice. Are the Tories capable of making it?	Last time the Tories had a leadership problem they settled on Theresa May as the solution That isn t a mistake the party will make again although other mistakes are available Half of the cabinet and just as many backbenchers are parading themselves in speeches and newspaper articles The competition to be the Conservative party s next problem is under way before the current problem has stood down  The usual practice when picking a new leader is to overcompensate for faults in the old one May s methodical chilliness appealed as the antidote to David Cameron s careless charm The same trait expressed as lack of agility and diplomacy made her a poor choice to negotiate Brexit But it is easy to say what May got wrong The more interesting question is what she almost got right 
APR17	If you believe in human rights, Madonna, don’t play Tel Aviv	Madonna s acceptance of an invitation to perform in Tel Aviv at the Eurovision song contest finals in May raises yet again fundamentally important ethical and political questions for each and every one of us to contemplate  In Paris in the then fledgling United Nations drafted and subsequently adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights which enshrined in international law that all our brothers and sisters all over the world irrespective of their ethnicity or nationality or religion have certain basic human rights including but not limited to the right to life liberty and self determination 
APR17	Macron vowed to change the EU – but his chance may have gone	Last week s European Union summit on Brexit may have looked like a unique case of Emmanuel Macron finding himself extremely isolated in Europe Rather it was the latest proof that the French president s European strategy needs a profound rethink Two years ago Macron took France and Europe by storm For the first time he had been elected on a staunchly pro EU platform This opened the door to potentially momentous changes in the EU  Britain s vote to leave the aftermath of the transatlantic financial crisis and the failed French and Dutch referendums on the EU constitution project had already made clear that institutional reforms were needed In sweeping speeches Macron set out a bold vision But now that ambition has waned and many hopes have evaporated His European strategy contained important flaws and he made mistakes in trying to deliver it 
APR17	The financial sector must be at the heart of tackling climate change	The catastrophic effects of climate change are already visible around the world From blistering heatwaves in North America to typhoons in south east Asia and droughts in Africa and Australia no country or community is immune These events damage infrastructure and private property negatively affect health decrease productivity and destroy wealth And they are extremely costly insured losses have risen five fold in the past three decades The enormous human and financial costs of climate change are having a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing  The impact of climate change has compelled governments to act Catalysed by the Paris agreement governments around the world are putting policies in place to limit the global rise in temperatures to C and preferably as close to C as possible The actions undertaken by individual countries will deliver a collective transition to a low carbon economy But this transition brings its own risks Carbon emissions have to decline by from levels over the next decade in order to reach net zero by This requires a massive reallocation of capital If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world they will fail to exist 
APR18	Memo to Tory MPs: denigrating the membership is a really bad idea	In the wake of the Brexit referendum one Labour MP rationalised the effort to unseat Jeremy Corbyn who had been elected party leader less than a year earlier with one of the greatest mandates in the party s history as an act of mercy There are always going to be people in the country who are off the page nuts The problem we ve got is that they have all joined the Labour party because of Jeremy Corbyn he told Tim Shipman in All Out War It slowly dawned on us that the man s insane and the people around him are too To think you can run a political party with of your colleagues having no confidence in you is insane  A few months later Labour members returned Corbyn with an even greater majority less than a year after that he led the party to an increase of seats and in vote share at a general election It turned out that thinking you can run a party while ignoring what of it wanted was the truly ridiculous idea Who knew 
APR18	The Home Office is cruel and incompetent – it is time it was abolished	The Home Office is a remorseless engine of cruelty incompetence and Kafkaesque bureaucracy It cannot be reformed but should be scrapped Consider the case of an year old British citizen taken up by Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill who has Alzheimer s He has lived and paid taxes and national insurance in Britain for half a century most of his extended family as well as grandchildren and great grandchildren are British citizens The Home Office is currently attempting to deport him to India Or take year old Alfred Jahn who told me that he was woken up two years ago by armed police officers looking for an Albanian they d got the wrong address He says only after prolonged chasing was a lacklustre explanation forthcoming Or year old Paige from Enfield north London who was saved from jumping from a bridge and sectioned after her Albanian fiance s visa application was refused in December She had submitted all the documents proving she met the necessary income threshold but the Home Office ripped the two apart for more than weeks Her fiance was hospitalised at least times because of the stress Paige lost her job It turned out that the Home Office had mislaid a payslip  Deport as many as you can with any excuse by any means that is the underlying ethos of this morally bankrupt regime
APR18	The billionaires’ donations will turn Notre Dame into a monument to hypocrisy	In a welter of stories appeared in the international press pointing out the brokenness of Paris s Notre Dame Cathedral officials showed journalists how patches of limestone would crumble at a finger s touch Gargoyles that had lost their heads were patched up with plastic pipes while fallen balustrades were replaced with wooden planks All this decay was caused by pollution acid rain and eight centuries of use but also official neglect was to blame Keepers of the building had begged for more money but neither the belt tightening French government nor the wealthy grumbling about higher taxes gave enough  Then came Holy Week and the inferno by the Seine and all of a sudden nobody can give too much After years of preaching the shrinking of the public sector the French president Emmanuel Macron now wants to mobilise the full resources of the state to get the roofless cathedral rebuilt within just five years And money from France s billionaire class keeps raining down In three days the cathedral has been pledged m m from Francois Henri Pinault the ultimate owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent m m from the Arnault family of Louis Vuitton fame another m from L Oreal owners the Bettencourt Meyers family and m from French oil giant Total 
APR18	#Change UK – really? If you don’t get the internet, you shouldn’t be in politics	If you want to vote in the European elections next month your ballot paper will have a helpful logo next to the candidate s name to show which party they re running for that is unless you want to vote for Change UK The Independent Group Despite their logo being the most boring thing in existence they still managed to have it rejected by the Electoral Commission in part because it contained the hashtag change  It s just more of the same for TIG CUK who at this stage are basically the party political wing of the sad trombone waah waah waaahh sound In all likelihood the commission has done them a favour The thing about hashtags is that anyone can use them for anything There s absolutely nothing to stop people to take one incredibly obvious example taking to Twitter to post I m voting for change I m voting Labour And as the Boaty McBoatface episode should have conclusively demonstrated if you give the internet a chance to royally stitch you up thousands of people will gladly do so and not even out of malice just for a bit of a laugh 
APR18	The Extinction Rebellion protest is inspired. But what comes next?	Day four of Extinction Rebellion which has been a phenomenal success as climate protesters occupy four pressure points in Britain s congested capital Everything has conspired to maximise attention for their climate cause with the news unnaturally quiet in this pause in Brexit hostilities  Compared to Brexit rage and fury climate protesters are the soul of peace and goodwill their pink boat welcoming Oxford Street shoppers who mainly stop to talk The surprisingly few police are friendly with the arrests curiously voluntary people well warned in advance so those who can t be arrested step back Is it true the police cuts have left too little capacity to arrest everyone Two officers laugh You might say that we couldn t possibly comment 
APR18	The big four auditors are failing – and the watchdog’s report won’t change that	What do BHS Carillion Conviviality Quindell Aero Inventory the Co op Bank and London and Capital Finance have in common They were all audited by the big four accountancy firms PwC KPMG EY and Deloitte which audit of FTSE companies and collect of audit fees In each case these firms collected huge fees and delivered little of any public value Their failure to spot the fragility of those businesses resulted in the loss of jobs savings pensions and tax revenues  Yet the victims of these failures have no legal recourse to seek compensation because auditors owe a duty of care only to the company that hires their services not to any individual stakeholder or creditor 
APR18	Mark Carney’s warning on climate change is timely, but it’s only a start	Mark Carney got right to the heart of the matter in his message to the City about the risks of climate change take global warming seriously or you will lose money This is the sort of language foreign exchange dealers and derivatives traders understand For the most part they don t tend to be eco warriors even though their sons and daughters might be What they care about is profit and loss the good old bottom line  So that s how the Bank of England s governor approached his subject Companies that don t adjust to the reality of global warming will simply cease to exist You don t get much blunter than that 
APR18	My team lost, but Man City v Spurs was better theatre than Shakespeare	Football killed my favourite uncle Theo was a Manchester United fan He knew he shouldn t watch the FA Cup final in because he had a dicky heart So he waited till it was all over to turn on the telly Only it wasn t the teams were deadlocked at and the match had gone into extra time Norman Whiteside scored the winner for United Theo had a heart attack and died It was shocking to lose such a lovely man But what a way to go  Like all great matches this one swung like a demented pendulum
APR18	Britain will have its second referendum – at the EU elections on 23 May	In just five weeks time Britain will have a referendum on Brexit This will take the form of elections to the European parliament but in reality this will be a pre referendum or if you like your neologisms ugly a preferendum So there is now one simple task to maximise the vote for parties that support a confirmatory referendum on Brexit giving the British people a democratic choice between accepting the negotiated Brexit deal and remaining in the EU  If Labour s manifesto clearly commits to that confirmatory referendum then Labour is among those parties If Labour is not clear enough then turn to the Liberal Democrats Change UK the Green party the Scottish National party or Plaid Cymru At the end of the day what will matter more than the precise allocation of seats is that we can say X million people voted for pro European pro referendum parties while only Y million voted for unambiguously pro Brexit parties such as Ukip Nigel Farage s new Brexit party and the Conservatives In this vital bottom line reckoning there is no such thing as a wasted vote Every single voice will count 
APR18	UK universities must break their silence around harassment and bullying	The revelation that UK universities have spent around m on payoffs to staff that come with gagging orders in the past two years has again highlighted concerns that such secretive clauses are being used to conceal the extent of harassment and bullying at higher education institutions  Dozens of academics told BBC News they were harassed out of their jobs and forced to sign non disclosure agreements NDAs by their university after making complaints Although the BBC admits it does not know how many of these gagging clauses relate to sexual misconduct or other kinds of harassment or bullying the findings highlight a wider lack of transparency in the way universities handle all kinds of misconduct and discrimination 
APR19	Lyra McKee: a letter to my 14-year-old self	Kid  It s going to be OK 
APR19	Climate campaigners may sound naive. But they’re asking the right questions	Spring has sprung and overnight the high street is awash with miraculously cheap summer dresses  Flick through the racks of floaty swishy nothings in any H M store right now however and it s clear something has changed in the last few summers Swinging from all that throwaway polyester are tags bragging about how much of it is sustainably made from recycled plastic bottles not oil Their tights and knickers use a man made fibre made from recycled fishing nets and by the till is a bin of reusable shopping bags 
APR19	Only remainers could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory like this	Having endured the past few months in Brexit how are you feeling about the prospect of the European elections campaign Please rate your satisfaction on a scale of one to the survivors of the USS Indianapolis These sailors got through the worst naval disaster in American history when their ship was torpedoed by the Japanese in and were then left bobbing in the Pacific Ocean Subsequently and over several days they were subjected to the worst recorded shark attack in history  The lesson of Brexit is that no matter how stomach voidingly ghastly it feels it can always always get much worse
APR19	The Mueller report shows that bad guys who play dirty, like Trump, always win	Those who had long hoped that Robert Mueller the mostly silent sheriff riding into town to ensure good triumphed over evil would be the saviour to deliver America and the world from Donald Trump are naturally disappointed Mueller s report released on Thursday did not quite deliver the smoking gun Trump s enemies had dreamed of Instead it handed the American public and their elected representatives a fully loaded revolver with a note attached Now it s up to you  The page Mueller report even in its redacted form pockmarked with blacked out names and passages serves up enough ammunition to destroy this president whether through impeachment proceedings this year or by denying him re election in Its pages confirm one scandal after another supplying the detailed hard facts to vindicate the very claims that Trump breezily dismissed at the time as fake news That Mueller did not take the final step accusing the US president of both collusion with the Russians and obstruction of justice tells its own story which we ll come to But it was hardly for lack of evidence 
APR19	France’s shame at the Notre Dame fire shows the west still believes in society	It s easy to understand the grief that the French people are feeling in the wake of the devastation of Notre Dame More puzzling is the sense of shame that the Guardian s Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis highlighted in her report On our watch we let it burn she quotes an older woman in tears saying  This sentiment was echoed in Jonathan Miller s Spectator blog in which he wrote There is also a shame to this How could this have happened Isn t France better than this Both Chrisafis and Miller have lived in France for years and are reporting from the ground The shame they have identified seems real 
APR19	Arms cannot end Libya's agony – whatever its would-be strongman claims	With heavy fighting on the outskirts of the capital threatening more uncertainty for thousands of migrants and refugees Libya lurches deeper into crisis The assault on Tripoli was launched earlier this month by the self styled Libyan National Army LNA commanded by General Khalifa Haftar as the answer to years of instability and entrenched divisions between the UN backed government in the west and the LNA aligned government in the east But in trying to force a military solution Haftar s partisan campaign to unify the country portends further fragmentation and chaos  The LNA has begun to compel civilians in Benghazi to report for military duty according to sources within its eastern stronghold This is a worrying indication that Haftar s supposed lightning offensive has a lot longer to run 
APR19	Do millennials opt for a ‘fur baby’ because they’re broke – or scared of responsibility?	About three months after I d given birth I was invited to a recently befriended mum s house for a gathering of new parents and babies As my bleary brain tried desperately to remember each adult s name and at least the gender of their corresponding tot I suddenly realised we were one cooing spewing infant short of a full set How odd  Later as I happened on the lady I d identified as childless refilling her mug in the kitchen I inquired about the little one wholly prepared to praise her willingness to leave him or her with someone else at such a young age The tiny dote she explained was indeed with a neighbour I gave her an encouraging smile Then she got out her phone and proudly showed me a snapshot of her bundle of joy on Instagram of course Blinking into the sun from the comfort of his very own swaddle Buster was the smuggest schnauzer I d ever seen 
APR19	Hundreds of Bahrainis like me are being made stateless – and the UK is complicit	This week a court in my home country Bahrain reached a verdict in one of the largest mass trials in the nation s history Jail terms were handed to people including life sentences ostensibly for terrorism related offences All but one were stripped of their citizenship  In a huge number of Bahrain s citizens took to the streets to demand democratic change from the al Khalifa family who have ruled the country for some years Since then it has ramped up repression outlawing opposition groups closing the only independent newspaper and restricting freedom of assembly The United Nations has condemned the widespread use of torture in Bahraini prisons and has expressed concern about the latest convictions Anti terror legislation has been expanded and is used extensively to harass journalists human rights defenders and anyone who dares contest the legitimacy of the government 
APR19	Why does the EU need a €13bn defence fund? It should be waging peace	It is often said that the European Union is the most successful peace project in the world Those arguing the case will point to the centuries of war that preceded its founding and the relative peace that has followed There are many times when that claim has been severely tested with European governments playing a central role in fuelling global conflict while pursuing repressive anti refugee policies that have punished people escaping war  This week the EU s reputation for peace building has come under further question with the European parliament overwhelmingly voting to finalise the funding for a European Defence Fund The fund commits billion over a seven year period to the collective research and development of cutting edge weapons and military technology The concept of the fund was announced by the European commission president Jean Claude Juncker in and backed by the European council later that year A handful of pilot projects were launched in with a total of million committed for funding The scale of the projects and spending will be totally eclipsed by this week s increase 
APR19	The Extinction Rebels have got their tactics badly wrong. Here’s why	Over the past few days I have watched members of the Extinction Rebellion movement block bridges disrupt public transport and lock themselves to lorries I have been moved by their bravery and inspired by their message but puzzled by their strategy On the face of it the rebels have been effective They have disrupted major cities gained publicity and built bonds of solidarity But are they achieving their aim of building a more sustainable world  According to Stanford University s Doug McAdam the climate change movement has historically been a failure when compared with other movements Climate activists have struggled to engage politicians been unable to build influential organisations and failed to connect with the wider public The Extinction Rebellion may mark a turning point The rebels have injected a sense of urgency and emotion back into the issue of climate change but creating meaningful and long lasting change requires more A movement must reach out beyond true believers and connect with a wider base of potential supporters wherever they might be found on the political spectrum 
APR20	This paralysing lack of leadership leaves Remainers with nowhere to go	Once political parties were meant to solve the voters problems Now it s the other way round Voters must be experts in the most arcane details of the d Hondt system of proportional representation and make predictions that are next to impossible while receiving no help from the politicians who claim to lead them  The chaos Brexit has brought has stopped Britain dealing with every real issue from street crime to climate change According to the polls a clear majority of the population now realises Brexit merely worsens old problems then adds some new ones just for fun 
APR20	Daphne du Maurier’s hidden treasure gives hoarders hope	I suspect that those of us of a mildly hoarder ish persuasion all secretly believe that we re going to have an Antiques Roadshow moment when something we ve held on to that isn t one of several hundred branded tote bags turns out to have been truly worth keeping Bookish types have had a bumper week of evidence that this discovery fantasy may one day come true  A handful of poems written by Daphne du Maurier two previously unknown have been found in an archive of letters and the unknown ones hidden behind a photograph of the author in a swimming costume It is believed they have lain untouched for years 
APR20	Labour can’t defeat Nigel Farage by sitting on the fence	One of the many strange things about Nigel Farage is that for a politician who has made a career out of attacking the European Union his status in public life and his lucrative media career have been largely based on him being a member of the European parliament for the past years  He s never been elected to anything else but to give him credit he has become a specialist at inventing or reinventing positions that have hoovered up publicity generated endless controversy and harvested enough votes to win four successive terms as an MEP Now he is back again with his new Brexit party and leading the early polls for elections being held in the midst of a huge political crisis over our relationship with Europe 
APR20	Why are airlines so keen on the fantasy of the Mile-High Barbie?	How did it come to this women required to produce a sick note because they ve been struck down by unsexiness It seems that Norwegian Air requires female flight attendants to wear heels or have a note from the doctor other rules cover everything from makeup to false eyelashes  How mortifying for Norway in the country was rated second for equality after Iceland in the Global Gender Gap report Norwegian politician Anette Trettebergstuen said rang and it wants its rulebook back Norwegian Air responded that flat shoes are worn in the cabin there are also dress guidelines for male stewards and other airlines have similar rules but it must be aware that last month Virgin ditched requirements for heels and makeup with others following suit 
APR20	Lyra McKee: a letter to my 14-year-old self	Kid  It s going to be OK 
APR20	One church, two popes: why Catholicism is in crisis this Easter	In his pre Easter address to pilgrims gathering in Rome Pope Francis highlighted Jesus s words as he died on the cross on the first Good Friday Forgive them Father for they know not what they do We all the Argentinian pontiff stressed need to find the courage to forgive those who have wronged us  Those remarks sparked speculation about who exactly Francis was struggling to forgive Top of most lists in Rome this Easter is his predecessor Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI who decided in to break with years of work unto death papal tradition and retire This opened Catholicism s door to the breath of fresh air that is Francis And for the past six years as the winds of change have blown through the church Benedict has by and large kept a respectful silence ignoring the ever louder pleas of traditionalist Catholics who want the year old to join them in opposing Francis s reform agenda 
APR20	Climate campaigners may sound naive. But they’re asking the right questions	Spring has sprung and overnight the high street is awash with miraculously cheap summer dresses  Flick through the racks of floaty swishy nothings in any H M store right now however and it s clear something has changed in the last few summers Swinging from all that throwaway polyester are tags bragging about how much of it is sustainably made from recycled plastic bottles not oil Their tights and knickers use a man made fibre made from recycled fishing nets and by the till is a bin of reusable shopping bags 
APR20	What makes a great place to live? Answer: it’s not a shopping plaza	The best place to live in Britain today is Salisbury So says the Sunday Times The Office for National Statistics disagrees It says the best place is Farnborough No says the Royal Mail it is Winchester The Provident says it is Worcester The Halifax says it is Stornaway And so it goes This is listicle season and not a magazine is without some daft survey of topographical superlatives Each year groups of travel editors get together over a good lunch with a road atlas and contented sponsor to hand  Salisbury s award appears to be in compensation for last year s novichok nightmare To be free of novichok is clearly a marketing asset but it is hardly a standout virtue Other criteria include a low crime rate good schools transport links air quality nice buildings and friendly neighbours The one thing these lists have in common is that nobody agrees Apparently if you ask most people the best place to live they say their home Good for them There is nowhere like home But dig deeper and the trends in modern liveability are intriguing

APR21	Sri Lanka’s Christians were left unprotected for far too long	My first reaction was panic As I woke up to the horrific scenes from churches and hotels in Sri Lanka to news of the dead dying and injured on a day of Christian celebration I desperately rang loved ones checked on cousins uncles aunts and friends As further explosions occurred and more deaths were reported my heart pounded Finally I learned that my relatives were all OK and I began to reflect on an atrocity that must not be allowed to divide Sri Lankans and take us back to the darkest days of the recent past  I was born in Britain to Sri Lankan parents and have a Sri Lankan husband As a Muslim I know too well the feeling of shock and fear when someone has tried to harm you in a place of worship I felt today as I felt when I woke to news of the attack on worshippers in Christchurch New Zealand which left people killed and dozens injured Those Muslims had gone to Friday prayers on Jummah a holy day 
APR21	As the Sri Lanka attacks show, Christians worldwide face serious persecution	I was up before dawn this morning preparing for our first service of Easter This meant that around the same time as bombs were going off in churches in Sri Lanka I was reading a passage to my congregation taken from the book of Ezekiel The passage tells of dead bones coming back together of bodies being re clothed in flesh and of life being breathed back into them Over in Sri Lanka bones were being blown apart and flesh stripped from skin These people woke up this morning full of hope excited in anticipation of the story of Jesus s resurrection They put on their best clothes and polished their shoes Now their blood is being mopped from the sanctuary floor  I was talking the other day to the classicist Mary Beard about Christian persecution in Roman times all that stuff about lions and the Coliseum She was of the opinion that it might not have been quite as big a deal as later Christians made it out to be And no doubt there is nothing quite like a few overegged stories of gory martyrdom to deepen a sense of group solidarity among a struggling religious community Well I bow to Mary s greater knowledge of classical Rome But while it may have been true that too much was made of Roman persecution the very opposite is true now We are living though one of the most serious phases of Christian persecution in history and most people refuse to acknowledge it 
APR21	The Australian court ban on reporting George Pell’s trial was bound to fail	It may be apocryphal but there is enduring value in the story of the headline in a small antipodean newspaper that in the th century became agitated by events in Crimea We warn the Tsar The story came to mind late last year when the judicial system in the state of Victoria Australia attempted to suppress news that a senior Vatican figure Cardinal George Pell had been convicted of sexual offences against choirboys in Melbourne s Saint Patrick s cathedral between and  Although it had been known that Pell was being prosecuted the precise charges had not been disclosed and the trial had not been permitted to be reported while it was taking place The reason for suppression had been concern that potential jurors for an expected second Pell trial on separate abuse charges might be prejudiced by public reports of the first As it happened not long after the first trial ended the second was abandoned due to evidentiary issues 
APR21	This paralysing lack of leadership leaves remainers with nowhere to go	Once political parties were meant to solve the voters problems Now it s the other way round Voters must be experts in the most arcane details of the d Hondt system of proportional representation and make predictions that are next to impossible while receiving no help from the politicians who claim to lead them  The chaos Brexit has brought has stopped Britain dealing with every real issue from street crime to climate change According to the polls a clear majority of the population now realises Brexit merely worsens old problems then adds some new ones just for fun 
APR21	Raise a can to Diane Abbott, a politician who can mix (mojitos) with the people	In the good old days of course you wouldn t dream of venturing on to the North London line a trundly old thing connecting Stratford in the east to Richmond in the south west without being at least mildly flutered Journeys could be long the atmosphere anywhere between carnival and Beckett bleak and you had to hold your nerve if you were travelling as many of us did without a ticket not for nothing was the largely barrier free and inspectorless route known as the Free Line But they liked to surprise you I believe I once saw the comedian Arnold Brown being taken to task but am happy to correct if it was mistaken identity With all that going on a drink or two was a bare necessity  Anyway that was then and now the whole shebang has had a rebrand subsumed into the labyrinthine London Overground on which you can zip about between Fritz Lang stations from Dalston to Penge West But you must do so without an accompanying slug of Teacher s for which we must thank none other than former mayor Boris Johnson who deemed a decade ago that Transport for London must become a dry zone 
APR21	One thing unites snobs of all persuasions: contempt for the middle class	As painful as it is to admit Jacob Rees Mogg did once have his uses Or one at least It emerged during one of his earlier Question Time appearances when the BBC could still just about pretend ignorance of the then embryo demagogue s tendresse for racists Responding to a question about Heathrow Rees Mogg volunteered that he hadn t minded the planes when he lived in Slough Eton chaffed the host David Dimbleby I was at school with your son said Rees Mogg  Anyway thanks to this contribution along with other BBC presenter on BBC presenter squabbles about who is or is not posh it can be demonstrated that Sky News Adam Boulton is not the only mature white male TV presenter to suffer from pot kettle syndrome to the possibly debilitating extent of wanting although not for the purposes of satire to belittle others for enjoying the same social capital and privileges as himself 
APR21	Carlsberg’s honest new ad campaign leaves a funny aftertaste	What went through Orson Welles s mind I wonder when he first growled the line Probably the best lager in the world into a microphone He may have been pondering his fee He may have reflected on how well suited his distinctive gravelly voice was to the slogan s understated confidence It may have made him fancy a drink It probably didn t make him think that Carlsberg was probably the best lager in the world because it probably isn t And last week its manufacturers admitted it  In fact they launched a new slogan Probably not the best beer in the world So we ve changed it This marketing admission raises a few questions the first of which is How likely is it to be the best this time I mean they ve been calling their previous version probably the best for years It doesn t feel like they re adherents to a rigorously self doubting approach to product development 
APR21	Mueller’s account of Trump’s world acts as a cautionary tale for UK politics	Trump was right His presidency was fucked the moment the investigation into Russian involvement in the US presidential election led by special counsel Robert Mueller was announced  It s tantamount to treasonous to work so closely with the Russian secret services during the campaign with the Russians plainly hoping a Trump presidency would turn a blind eye to the partition of Ukraine in return It was tawdry deploying the promise of pardons to instruct his aides to stay strong in giving their account of what took place The whole affair stinks as does the Trump presidency 
APR21	As Brexit absorbs all political energy and guile, the country’s problems mount	We can all list our favourite reasons why the Brexit promised in the pale dawn sunlight of June has not turned out to be a walk in the park or even a final date with EU destiny But whatever we now think of the outcome of the referendum we are all trapped in the old Indian saying about the banyan tree under its shade little new can grow Sometimes I miss my role writing about politics of the kind that was not just about meaningful ish votes all or nothing dates leading to the next cliff edge scoldings from EU leaders and whether Theresa May is on her way out only to be there the next week and off on another walking holiday  One day political archaeologists will dig into the frozen tundra and find the remains of government activity preserved under the permafrost It might well start with HS which was once a glorious project slashing commuting times to Birmingham with vague promises of what it might achieve for the North Westminster has a terminology as inexact as Narnia for areas outside the south east Now unnoticed by all but high speed train spotters the project s completion cost date capacity speed and even where it should terminate in London are in question Sir Terry Morgan the outgone chairman has described the price tag as a guesstimate New sums suggest the cost might rise from bn to nearly twice that amount before we add on trains and power costs 
APR21	The tragic killing of Lyra McKee in Derry shows how hard it is for wars to end	The killing of Lyra McKee is a devastating loss for Northern Ireland and for all those who value integrity and thought I knew her through her work which was exceptional everything I ve read about her since the shooting has made me wish we had met  I am shaken by her killing but I am not surprised that such a horrific thing happened Northern Ireland overall is a much better place than it was years ago when the Good Friday agreement was signed However for some it is not that there may be a return to the Troubles but that the Troubles have never ended Others forget the concept of the peace process in favour of simplistic narratives which insist that Northern Ireland is either at peace or at war when the reality is more nuanced 
APR22	Sri Lanka needs exemplary leadership during this national catastrophe	The bombings in Sri Lanka targeting Christians as they prayed on Easter Sunday and tourists in hotels have struck the country like a hammer blow a decade after its agonising civil war came to a close The news of nearly lives lost will have sent a shiver down the spine of all peace loving Sri Lankans bringing back memories of a violent past when terror attacks dominated the national agenda  For nearly three decades we were known as the place that gave birth to a ruthless guerrilla organisation the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE Its use of suicide bombings as a tactic was chillingly replicated by the perpetrators of Sunday s atrocities But while it is no stranger to terrorism Sri Lanka has never witnessed violence on this scale and with this level of coordination on a single day Our return to normalcy nurtured through years of relative peace has been effectively shattered 
APR22	This man had to fight for benefits just before he died – when do we start to care?	You may not remember the name Stephen Smith but his body is hard to forget a photo taken by the Liverpool Echo emerged in February that showed a skeletal Smith sitting in a hospital gown his spine protruding from his six stone frame He had just had his disability benefits stopped  It quickly became one of the most notorious images illustrating the cruelty and unreliability of the disability benefits assessment system Smith had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease osteoarthritis and an enlarged prostate that left him barely able to walk and in pain but regardless he was found fit for work and told to look for a job 
APR22	Zelenskiy’s victory in Ukraine was extraordinary. But now he faces a real test	On Sunday night Volodymyr Zelenskiy jumped up and down on stage as exit poll results flashed on a giant screen behind him He now knew he would be Ukraine s next president Zelenskiy kissed his wife high fived his team and turned around to send his first message via hundreds of reporters and TV cameras that crammed his election headquarters It was meant for the post Soviet countries Look at us anything is possible  Zelenskiy s own story is proof of that and nothing short of extraordinary A year ago he was a comic a character from a TV series portraying a simple man who becomes president by chance after a video recording of his rant about corruption goes viral On Sunday the hologram became reality as Zelenskiy s victory smashed national political records 
APR22	Only Labour can stop Nigel Farage and his Thatcherite revival	In the European elections in just days time Britain faces a stark choice Will we back Nigel Farage or stop him To stop Farage Labour must come out on top This isn t just a mathematical and presentational reality no other opposition party is likely to outpoll him it is also a political imperative For to defeat Farage it is essential that we not only outvote him but also overwhelm his hard right Thatcherite ideology  Only Labour pro European and committed to social and economic transformation can defeat Farage and Faragism with the credibility of an alternative government That is why I am standing to become a Labour MEP with a mission to remain and reform big time 
APR22	Greta Thunberg’s visit to Britain is a huge moment for the climate movement	This afternoon an international sensation is taking to the stage in central London She s young admired around the world and her name is Greta Thunberg She s a year old climate hero and I couldn t be more proud to be co hosting her visit  Greta s rise to fame has been vertiginous Last year she skipped school and sat in front of the Swedish parliament in protest against inaction on climate change and now she is one of the figureheads of a school climate strike movement that has swept the globe which more than a million young people taking to the streets last month to demand that world leaders step up to this monumental challenge 
APR22	Victor Hugo gave Notre Dame life as the vibrant heart of France. It can be reborn	Victor Hugo was not enamoured with the title of Frederic Shoberl s English translation of his novel Notre Dame de Paris For the future great man of French literature the book s main attraction was the gothic cathedral itself not its hunchbacked bell ringer Hugo thought that Notre Dame s sublime features could take us to new heights both physical and spiritual from which we could sense a fervent connection to our world and to one another Nearly two centuries later his words still compel us to consider the cathedral with awe  This is not to discount the Hunchback of Notre Dame s importance Proving that a monster can still be a man Quasimodo s awakening humanity is integral to the novel s pathos and to its many adaptations on stage and screen from th century theatre and opera to the Disney animated film and the hit French musical Moving performances from actors such as Charles Laughton and Anthony Hopkins have helped to solidify Quasimodo s place at the story s centre even if they were more than twice as old as a character who s barely in his s and no less than three different versions using the Hunchback title have been announced by Netflix Disney and ITV over the past year alone 
APR22	Extinction Rebellion is leading a new, youthful politics that will change Britain	I am a fan of generation gaps Though academics and the media love to identify new demographic cohorts Generation X Generation Z Net Gen Gen Wii such distinctions often confuse mere fashion with decisive transformations in behaviour social priority and worldview But we need such transformations the inter generational arguments that they spawn and the changes that sooner or later they compel upon us all  The last authentic generation gap a period in which the old order was categorically at odds with the new ended with punk in the late s The next such period of deep change has taken its time to arrive 
APR22	Smaller parties have a surprisingly big impact on British politics	Technology sometimes reminds you that the unpredictable is actually all too predictable At its last extraordinary general meeting the national executive for the Women s Equality party finalised a snap general election strategy Now I was emailing for the fifth time in as many months to request yet another EGM the word extraordinary was beginning to lose all meaning I began typing apprehensively I m afraid it looks as though we are headed for only for Gmail s autocomplete function to suggest without pause or irony another election  Don t get me wrong the WE desperately wants to fight the European elections And we will The resurgence of far right politics across Europe threatens women and minorities in ways the political establishment cannot begin to understand The two largest political parties are tying themselves in knots in their attempts to take back control of their own backbenches Both the government and opposition will be asking voters to send their candidates to Europe in order to ensure that we leave 
APR22	Our schools are beyond breaking point – where is the outrage?	Last summer as the politics of Britain s exit from the EU staggered on and England s World Cup run offered some kind of respite I spent an afternoon in Brownhills near the West Midlands town of Walsall I was there to try to get beyond the deafening inanities of Brexit and report on the mounting financial crisis facing England s education system At Millfield primary school everything once again became clear  Millfield serves a deprived catchment area and is the kind of place whose everyday magic becomes obvious as soon as you walk in It has an imaginative approach to education and a track record of helping children in difficult circumstances Despite its location among tarmac and trunk roads it specialises in outdoor activities such as canoeing and hiking But the day I was there all the talk was of which bits of its provision would have to go Its headteacher Michelle Sheehy was blunt We re heading for a deficit So we need to cut 
APR22	On the first Stephen Lawrence Day, let’s admit our communities are still unequal	The nd of April is the first National Stephen Lawrence Day a day commemorating the life of my son Stephen Lawrence who was killed in an unprovoked racist attack  Stephen s story is both tragic and inspirational But I wish for Stephen s name not to be identified just with his murder but with the impact he has left on this country and the hope and inspiration he continues to give many young people 
APR23	Our Brexit limbo has given us two new parties, but the same old politics	Imagine that for some reason you want to lose an election You need a vote repellent campaign something really unsupportable You would probably form the Establishment party passionately in favour of the system cheering for the status quo Your candidates would boast of their credentials as career politicians Their slogan would be business as usual  This imaginary party is the perfect adversary the most beatable thing in British politics which is why real life parties all want to run against it Everyone claims to be the new politics and pins the despicable badge of oldness on their rivals 
APR23	Integrate, migrants are told. But can they ever be good enough for the likes of Blair?	Rarely do I associate Tony Blair with my mother After all they have little in common One was prime minister and marched the UK into five wars in six years the other taught for decades in east London primary schools to which she drove in a cheery red Nissan Micra But seeking respite from the oven of this weekend I began reading Blair s latest remarks on migrants and found myself thinking instead of a beaming lady in a classroom  Like so many of us the former Labour leader is worried about far right bigotry However he has a solution It is simple It is confident It comes in his trademark declarative sentences And it says that to beat racist thugs their targets must try harder to blend in They should be forced to do so by the government acting as an enforcer of the duty to integrate You see failures around integration have led to attacks on diversity and are partly responsible for a reaction against migration 
APR23	The government’s olive branch to Christians is tinged with hypocrisy	Even before news of the horrendous Sri Lanka bombings which killed Christian worshippers tourists and locals from many faiths Theresa May had already focused this year s Easter message on the global persecution of Christians The foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt sent letters to faith leaders saying he was appalled that million Christians worldwide faced discrimination  It is appalling And so is the hypocrisy of a government that has itself poured scorn on Christians in recent years People seeking asylum a tradition well known from the Bible have been denied by Home Office officials for reasons including that if an applicant really believed in Jesus they would not have needed asylum in the UK in the first place You affirmed that Jesus is your saviour but then claimed that He would not be able to save you from the Iranian regime the Home Office told an Iranian woman in a particularly nightmarish example of circular reasoning Your belief in Jesus is halfhearted 
APR23	Innovate? Big tech would rather throw us a broken Samsung Galaxy Fold	If you ever wondered whether the tech business is thrashing around in search of something anything to make people Buy More Unneeded Stuff Samsung s Galaxy Fold is all the proof you need Heralded as the first phone that unfolds to become a tablet or possibly the first tablet that folds up into a phone its worldwide launch has now been delayed because the units sent to some reviewers broke  In some cases they peeled off a protective layer over the folding screen thinking it was just a protective layer but it turned out that it was actually Very Important and Not To Be Removed Others found their screen gave up or seemed to be cracking which worried Samsung so much that it demanded the units back Now the company is taking a few weeks while it figures out whether to go ahead and demand for a phone that might break in a few days 
APR23	There is a thread running through Sri Lanka's cycles of violence	As mass burials for some of the Christian worshippers killed in the Easter Sunday bombings take place today claims that the attackers were local Islamic extremists have left Sri Lanka s Muslims who make up of the population devastated Although details are scant and doubts exist about the official government account a senior minister announced on Monday that the attackers belonged to a new fringe jihadist group the National Thowheeth Jama ath that military intelligence had been aware of but had not acted against Even amid news that Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attacks it is still unknown whether the bombers were homegrown or connected to international terror groups  Yet again Sri Lanka especially its Christian minority has paid a severe price for government failures Muslims already the target of hate campaigns will no doubt face repercussions Part of the tragedy is that since independence Muslims have stayed away from violence both during Sri Lanka s civil war and more recently when they have been the target of religiously motivated attacks 
APR23	Children’s prisons inflict unspeakable damage on inmates. Close them now	The th anniversary of Gareth Myett s death in a children s prison is being commemorated by a campaign to end child imprisonment in the UK It is hugely appropriate because in the intervening years those responsible for running children s prisons have repeatedly shown that they are incapable of nurturing and rehabilitating the children in their care Time and again we have seen children leave these institutions abused and irreparably damaged That is if they are lucky enough to come out at all Gareth Myatt wasn t  In April Myatt died while being restrained by three custody officers at Rainsbrook secure training centre in Northamptonshire operated then and now by G S The restraint followed his refusal to clean a sandwich toaster Gareth was under ft tall and weighed six and a half stone One of the restraining officers was ft tall and weighed stone During the restraint Myatt said he could not breathe He was told If you can talk you can breathe He died from positional asphyxia choking on his own vomit He was years old and had been in custody for three days 
APR23	Greta Thunberg teaches us about autism as much as climate change	Greta Thunberg is an impressive individual Just years old she has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize after sparking environmental protests around the planet There is a glorious simplicity to her arguments that makes them hard to refute What she asked was the point of pupils like her learning anything if politicians ignored the glaring facts on climate change So she sat down outside the Swedish parliament with a hand painted banner declaring a school strike and eight months later is a global icon who has helped to fire up a resurgent green movement  Thunberg s parents say their daughter once painfully introverted was always a bit different to other children Four years ago she was diagnosed with Asperger s on the autism spectrum which helps explain her remorseless focus on the core issue of climate change after overcoming depression Being different is a gift she told Nick Robinson when interviewed on Radio s Today programme It makes me see things from outside the box I don t easily fall for lies I can see through things If I would ve been like everyone else I wouldn t have started this school strike for instance 
APR23	It's time for nations to unite around an International Green New Deal	In times of crisis and catastrophe children are often forced to grow up quickly We are now witnessing this premature call to action on a planetary scale As the adults in government accelerate their consumption of fossil fuels children are leading the campaign against our species looming extinction Our survival now depends on the prospects for a global movement to follow their lead and demand an International Green New Deal  Several countries have proposed their own versions of a Green New Deal Here in Europe DiEM and our European Spring coalition are campaigning under the banner of a detailed Green New Deal agenda In the UK a new campaign is pushing similar legislation with MPs such as Caroline Lucas and Clive Lewis And in the US dogged activists in the Sunrise Movement are working with representatives such as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez to push their proposal to the front of the political agenda 
APR23	Is Netflix killing sex, stopping us having babies – or neither?	It s hard to keep up with the whole sex thing One minute we are being told that dating apps have unleashed an epidemic of casual sex and millennials are hooking up willy nilly The next minute we are being told that technology has propelled us into a global sex recession none of us can turn our screens off so no one is getting it on There seems to be a new article about the decline of sex every few days the latest was courtesy of the Wall Street Journal which recently argued that we are too busy binge watching Netflix to bother bonking  This isn t just kinky conjecture the Journal has the stats to prove it According to a poll commissioned by the paper one in four adults in relationships have turned down sex with their partner in favour of streaming TV Younger generations are more likely to eschew intimacy for entertainment of to year olds said they had chosen streaming services over sex compared with of people over Netflix and chill it seems has gone from being a spicy euphemism to a mundane descriptor 
APR23	To stop global catastrophe, we must believe in humans again	Because I am concerned about inequality and about the environment I am usually classed as a progressive a liberal But it seems to me that what I care most about is preserving a world that bears some resemblance to the past a world with some ice at the top and bottom and the odd coral reef in between a world where people are connected to the past and future and to one another instead of turned into obsolete software  And those seem to me profoundly conservative positions Meanwhile oil companies and tech barons strike me as deeply radical willing to alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere eager to confer immortality 
APR24	She’s an icon of Sudan’s revolution. But the woman in white obscures vital truths	It was the image that finally drew the eyes of the world to Sudan s revolution a young woman swaddled in white standing on top of a car with her hand aloft and a finger raised in rebuke as she addressed protesters gathered around her A sea of mobile phone cameras beneath her lights up the dusk The Sudanese had been protesting against the now former president Omar al Bashir for months demanding the fall of his government but with little global media attention Until that image It cut through Within hours the picture had been circulated at dizzying speed Media outlets rushed to determine who the woman was What did her outfit signify Sudanese people on social media provided explanations She was dressed in homage to a generation of Nubian warrior queens her white toab a Sudanese cloth wrapped round the body and looped over the head was a nod to the uniform of the average Sudanese working woman The actor Halle Berry posted a picture The US congresswoman Ilhan Omar tweeted it The New York Times s fashion director wrote a feature on the girl wrapped in white She became an icon of the protest movement and of womanhood on the frontline  The woman in white is now at the sharp end of a misogynist harassment campaign from change averse parts of society
APR24	Integrate, migrants are told. But can they ever be good enough for the likes of Blair?	Rarely do I associate Tony Blair with my mother After all they have little in common One was prime minister and marched the UK into five wars in six years the other taught for decades in east London primary schools to which she drove in a cheery red Nissan Micra But seeking respite from the oven of this weekend I began reading Blair s latest remarks on migrants and found myself thinking instead of a beaming lady in a classroom  Like so many of us the former Labour leader is worried about far right bigotry However he has a solution It is simple It is confident It comes in his trademark declarative sentences And it says that to beat racist thugs their targets must try harder to blend in They should be forced to do so by the government acting as an enforcer of the duty to integrate You see failures around integration have led to attacks on diversity and are partly responsible for a reaction against migration 
APR24	Our Brexit limbo has given us two new parties, but the same old politics	Imagine that for some reason you want to lose an election You need a vote repellent campaign something really unsupportable You would probably form the Establishment party passionately in favour of the system cheering for the status quo Your candidates would boast of their credentials as career politicians Their slogan would be business as usual  This imaginary party is the perfect adversary the most beatable thing in British politics which is why real life parties all want to run against it Everyone claims to be the new politics and pins the despicable badge of oldness on their rivals 
APR24	Greta Thunberg is right – only a general strike will force action on climate change	Climate change is hurling humanity towards disaster There is no more room to question the science when nearly every climate scientist is in agreement that the implications of a global rise in average temperature will spell drastic changes for human civilisation In the face of such a rapidly encroaching threat political niceties and traditional incrementalism and compromise cannot come close to the level of change and upheaval required to solve or even mitigate the problem of global climate change  Climate scientists continue to stress the importance of lowering carbon emissions significantly yet they are currently increasing at an accelerating rate A UN study found that unless promised emission reductions under the Paris agreement were tripled they would cause the global temperature increase to reach C by and continue to rise after that Meanwhile some of the most influential people in the world continue to deny the very existence of climate change Even as the relatively tame IPCC report states that we must cut our emissions in half within the next decade people are feeling that their elected leaders and mainstream political avenues as a whole cannot measure up to this task 
APR24	As Europe builds its 5G network, security – not cost – must come first	On March the European commission published a recommendation designed to ensure the security of Europe s G networks You could be forgiven for having missed it given that it was announced in what could hardly have been described as a quiet EU news period  However the proposals are far reaching and reflect the urgent need for coordinated action as we fast approach a technological tipping point of potentially profound significance G licence auctions are ongoing and the scale of investment required and the complexity of the kit involved means that any decisions made will have long term implications so the need for action is now EU member states have already made legal commitments that require them to prioritise security in electronic communication data privacy and critical infrastructure By bringing these together and throwing a spotlight on their strategic importance our aim is to ensure that they are applied fully in practice 
APR24	The EU won’t change course on Brexit – look at the Greek debt crisis	The UK s Brexit debate has restarted after a day break just as before only with a new end date of October Brexiteers continue to press for the Irish backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements while the government and the Labour front bench seem to be making little progress in finding a consensus position  But once again scant attention is being paid to the other side of the negotiating table If we look more closely there we find hardening attitudes across the EU to anything other than the UK leaving on the basis of the withdrawal agreement regardless of the flaws that have seen this rejected three times by parliament Just as with the Greek debt crisis the EU now wants to see proposals adopted direction set and to deal with the problems later 
APR24	Sajid Javid must act now to right the wrongs of the latest immigration scandal	It s only been a year since the Windrush scandal broke but a very similar tale is issuing from the very same place the Home Office during Theresa May s time there Again a hostile environment towards illegal immigrants leaked into the rights of those who are entitled to stay here Thousands have been unfairly deported or blocked from getting visas Many have then been left in limbo for far too long their appeals for justice ignored  This time the scandal involves students and an English language test The test of English for international communication Toeic was introduced as a compulsory part of a visa application programme In Panorama found clear evidence that candidates were cheating at at least two test centres In one an invigilator was filmed reading out the answers to candidates In another paid proxies turned up to take the test for them 
APR24	Greta Thunberg teaches us about autism as much as climate change	Greta Thunberg is an impressive individual Just years old she has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize after sparking environmental protests around the planet There is a glorious simplicity to her arguments that makes them hard to refute What she asked was the point of pupils like her learning anything if politicians ignored the glaring facts on climate change So she sat down outside the Swedish parliament with a hand painted banner declaring a school strike and eight months later is a global icon who has helped to fire up a resurgent green movement  Thunberg s parents say their daughter once painfully introverted was always a bit different to other children Four years ago she was diagnosed with Asperger s on the autism spectrum which helps explain her remorseless focus on the core issue of climate change after overcoming depression Being different is a gift she told Nick Robinson when interviewed on Radio s Today programme It makes me see things from outside the box I don t easily fall for lies I can see through things If I would ve been like everyone else I wouldn t have started this school strike for instance 
APR24	The government’s olive branch to Christians is tinged with hypocrisy	Even before news of the horrendous Sri Lanka bombings which killed Christian worshippers tourists and locals from many faiths Theresa May had already focused this year s Easter message on the global persecution of Christians The foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt sent letters to faith leaders saying he was appalled that million Christians worldwide faced discrimination  It is appalling And so is the hypocrisy of a government that has itself poured scorn on Christians in recent years People seeking asylum a tradition well known from the Bible have been denied by Home Office officials for reasons including that if an applicant really believed in Jesus they would not have needed asylum in the UK in the first place You affirmed that Jesus is your saviour but then claimed that He would not be able to save you from the Iranian regime the Home Office told an Iranian woman in a particularly nightmarish example of circular reasoning Your belief in Jesus is halfhearted 
APR24	Elizabeth Warren was once conservative – now she’s heading to the left of Bernie Sanders	 If a person is not a liberal when he is he has no heart if he is not a conservative when he is he has no head No one is sure who said that it s sometimes erroneously attributed to Churchill like everything else but everyone is familiar with the sentiment we are supposed to get more conservative as we age  Elizabeth Warren didn t get that memo The year old Democrat and US presidential hopeful was a free market loving Republican when she was younger described by old friends as a diehard conservative Now Warren isn t only a Democrat she is one of the most progressive voices in US politics with a similar ideological stance to Bernie Sanders Indeed Warren may be heading even further to the left than Sanders On Monday she proposed a plan to forgive of student loans for people earning less than a year with the money coming from a new wealth tax Warren also proposed an ambitious plan for free higher education which she described as bigger than Sanders free college bill 
APR25	From Christchurch to Colombo, Islamists and the far right are playing a deadly duet	How should we make sense of the Easter Sunday church and hotel bombings in Sri Lanka that killed more than people and wounded Now that Islamic State appears to have claimed responsibility for the attacks the question arises is this merely the latest symptom of an epidemic of Islamist violence motivated by a belief in offensive jihad holy war  The answer is complex and not necessarily in line with public perceptions Islamist terrorism has been decreasing globally and particularly in the west since its peak in when Isis established its caliphate In recent years however far right supremacist terrorism has risen sharply to more than one third of terror attacks globally even accounting for every extremist killing in the US in Yet it was more likely to be overlooked or tolerated by western polities because of cultural history familiarity and legal protections extended to domestic groups such as US constitutional safeguards for freedom of speech and the right to bear arms Thus attacks by Muslims between and received times more coverage in US media than other terrorist attacks controlling for target type fatalities arrests 
APR25	How to stop climate change? Nationalise the oil companies	If only the Daily Express was right That is not a sentence I ever expected to type Extinction Rebellion protests have WORKED as MPs succumb to calls for change bellowed the rightwing rag Alas the government has not capitulated to demands to declare a climate emergency let alone to decarbonise the British economy by But Extinction Rebellion has retaught a lesson every generation must learn that civil disobedience works Amid the spluttering of obnoxious news presenters it has forced the existential threat of climate change on to the airwaves and into newsprint  But as this phase of protest winds down the demands must radicalise With capitalism itself rightly being challenged the focus must shift to the fossil fuel companies and the banks As long as they remain under private ownership on a global scale humanity s future will be threatened 
APR25	Like Greta Thunberg, I am on the autism spectrum. She gives me hope	Rarely have I identified with anything so strongly as when I listened to Greta Thunberg the year old Nobel peace prize nominee talking to Nick Robinson on BBC Radio s Today programme Like her I have been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum and it is rare that women like me appear in the media  Yet Thunberg s rise to prominence has been accompanied by a kind of thoughtlessness and intolerance that you might have expected society to have moved beyond Some reactions expose how much ignorance and malice remains towards autistic and neurodivergent people especially among those who don t share their political views Spiked s editor Brendan O Neill seized upon autistic traits Thunberg exhibits such as her monotone voice and forthright manner to liken her to a cult member in an attempt to delegitimise her message 
APR25	Northern Ireland’s abortion laws are an abomination. Westminster must step in	They were all there Northern Ireland s DUP and Sinn F in leaders side by side with the Good Friday agreement s guarantors the British and Irish prime ministers All were gathered at the funeral of the journalist Lyra McKee Why in God s name asked Fr Martin Magill had it taken her death to bring them together But his exasperated tone implied he didn t expect a political miracle  Visit this deadlocked region the UK s poorest and it feels transformed from the dark days of the troubles But its political paralysis is partly a product of Westminster s longstanding neglect of the region at least until the DUP unexpectedly came to play a pivotal role in the Brexit psychodrama The red hand of Ulster holds in its palm the fate of May s Brexit deal though the DUP doesn t represent the far more progressive and forward looking remain voting country The party may yet become Boris Johnson s kingmakers through its refusal to back Theresa May s deal 
APR25	Zelenskiy’s election proves Ukraine is a healthy democracy. Putin hates that	On the night of Ukraine s presidential election last weekend Vladimir Putin did not pick up his phone to congratulate the winner Nor has he since Putin is in waiting mode Perhaps that s because what Ukraine has achieved a free and fair genuinely pluralistic election and the prospect of a democratic transfer of power is something the Russian president has trouble getting to grips with in his own country  But surely nothing will have struck Putin more than the words Ukraine s new president elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy uttered on the night of his victory To all countries of the post Soviet Union look at us Anything is possible That particular call for change and for an overhaul of old power structures even beyond Ukraine will not have gone down well in the Kremlin 
APR25	There will be no soft Brexit now. It’s no deal or another vote	Ever since the Brexit vote in June many of us pro Europeans have had to live with a dilemma On the one hand we regarded the vote to leave the European Union as a disaster for our country On the other we accepted the galling reality that it was the democratically expressed view of the majority Three years on I still think we were right about Brexit But we still lost the vote  At times in the past five months a pragmatic compromise has seemed tantalisingly viable
APR25	While Britain forces its disabled people to food banks, it is unfit for the 21st century	It is and the UK is one of the wealthiest countries in the world But today s figures released by the Trussell Trust show that more than million emergency food parcels were given to people going hungry across the UK last year  This country is home to billionaires yet food banks for the poorest are becoming the norm Today s Britain is far from fit for the st century It is marked by soaring child poverty poor housing and rising homelessness 
APR25	Father Magill is right: Lyra McKee’s shocking death must not be in vain	Like the life that preceded it Lyra McKee s funeral was completely unique and utterly unforgettable  Thousands of mourners from every community in Northern Ireland lined the streets of Belfast to pay our respects to the extraordinary young journalist and to tell the world that we are not defined by our worst citizens but by our best 
APR25	Dare to declare capitalism dead – before it takes us all down with it	For most of my adult life I ve railed against corporate capitalism consumer capitalism and crony capitalism It took me a long time to see that the problem is not the adjective but the noun While some people have rejected capitalism gladly and swiftly I ve done so slowly and reluctantly Part of the reason was that I could see no clear alternative unlike some anti capitalists I have never been an enthusiast for state communism I was also inhibited by its religious status To say capitalism is failing in the st century is like saying God is dead in the th it is secular blasphemy It requires a degree of self confidence I did not possess  But as I ve grown older I ve come to recognise two things First that it is the system rather than any variant of the system that drives us inexorably towards disaster Second that you do not have to produce a definitive alternative to say that capitalism is failing The statement stands in its own right But it also demands another and different effort to develop a new system 
APR25	As a teacher, I know parents are right to march against unfair tests for under-fives	When I imagine the perfect way for a four year old to spend an afternoon it chiefly involves making mud pies eating raisins finger painting with friends all topped off by a much needed afternoon nap What it does not include is marching to Downing Street to protest against government education policy Nor does it involve being subjected to a high stakes assessment in the first six weeks of beginning school  Yet the government s plans to reintroduce compulsory baseline assessments for four year olds next year means that parents and their young children have been left with little choice but to protest The baseline tests will supposedly assess the maths and literacy ability of children when they start school Schools can then be held accountable for the progress students make from reception to year six But the March of the Four Year Olds will descend on Downing Street on Thursday to deliver a petition signed by people demanding that the government listens to the growing evidence that these tests are both damaging and unnecessary 
APR26	Brady, Batten and the bloody backstop (again): it’s still dark in the sunlit uplands	As the local and European parliament elections hove enticingly into view you will likely find yourself moved by the Conservative party s attempt to expand its electoral appeal beyond recent head trauma victims The Tories are keen to move past the notion that a vote for them is a vote in favour of a government with no pending legislation at all bar the one piece it can t pass  Fire up your thousand yard stares then as Graham Brady chairman of the backbench Committee has apparently got a plan to fix that In general I try not to pay too much attention to Graham who deliberately cultivates the air of a man who d tell someone politely but firmly to move their car at a point to point then nix their planning permission application if they didn t But how can we ignore his reported suggestion that Theresa May should bring the withdrawal agreement bill before the House except with the backstop either stripped out or time limited That Graham and others reckon could command the elusive majority 
APR26	Roger Scruton is not the victim of a leftwing witch-hunt. Here’s why	The battle over the treatment of Roger Scruton the author and philosopher following an interview with George Eaton that was published in the New Statesman magazine rages on To recap for those who do not read the New Statesman Eaton quoted Scruton on three subjects immigration in Hungary George Soros and China and amid the fallout from the perceived racism of Scruton s views as presented he was sacked from his unpaid job as chair of the Building More Building Beautiful government commission  He is part of an intellectual culture giving respectability to views at the edges of race generalisation on the right
APR26	Our school climate strikes have been a success and we’re only getting started	April has been quite the month for climate action The organisation I co founded the UK Student Climate Network held its third Youth Strike Climate demonstrations just two weeks ago which for the third month in succession saw tens of thousands take to the streets across the UK demanding climate justice and a Green New Deal Extinction Rebellion also kicked off a huge act of extended nonviolent civil disobedience by reclaiming public spaces in London and causing widespread disruption to protest climate breakdown Many hope this could be a crucial turning point in Britain s political approach to addressing the climate crisis  Thousands of people taking positive climate action for the very first time are feeling empowered by bringing their rage and frustration at climate inaction to the streets visibly demonstrating their discontent Looking at those taking part in all of these actions shows the potential of an emerging group to drive necessary legislative change At the youth strikes I look around and see today s brave and courageous climate activists and tomorrow s voters Meanwhile lots of current voters have been frequenting Marble Arch Parliament Square and other sites previously occupied by Extinction Rebellion All of these people alongside those engaged by TV shows such as Our Planet and Climate Change The Facts are becoming a new voting demographic the climate vote bloc 
APR26	To rage against Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK is simply childish	What is the matter with us A US president has been invited to Britain on a state visit and is coming in June It is a state courtesy between one democracy and another on the occasion of a wartime anniversary No conceivable purpose is served by people coming to London to shout insults at him  I cannot think what possessed Theresa May to invite Donald Trump in the first place but she did State visits are like that The Queen entertained Romania s Ceau escu Zimbabwe s Mugabe and Zaire s Mobutu Alongside them Trump might seem an angel Britain has the deepest of bonds with the US with ties of history commerce culture and education Washington s present leadership may embarrass even outrage people on both sides of the Atlantic That is no reason for childish protests against a guest invited in Britain s name 
APR26	Avengers: Endgame may well be brilliant – but the pressure to say so isn’t	In search of the new No l Coward You should probably give a wide berth to the Twitter mentions of critics sceptical about Avengers Endgame Eat dirt and die trash is typical feedback Likewise I hope Stan Lee haunts you slut and Fuck you bro fuck you Fanboy ire is not new But its power both in the moment and over the longer term is on the rise Not that Avengers Endgame is necessarily the best example of course The final instalment in a film cycle has earned almost universal five star reviews including in this paper  Tony Stark s climactic battle with Thanos and his Infinity Stones may well be up there with the best of Kubrick Hitchcock and Kurosawa If a professional believes this to be the case it is their job to tell us The certainty of being slagged off on social media as being bitter angry moronic whiny bitchy brain damaged drug addled outstandingly incompetent and unloved by your mother should you suggest otherwise would not sway most of those critics I have come across 
APR26	I’d like to ban screens. But sometimes domestic harmony depends on Peppa Pig	It is the Easter holidays and on the streets of New York the happy sounds of the coming of spring children s laughter birdsong and the thin repetitive jingles turned out by animation factories in the far east and uploaded on to kids YouTube to be consumed like crack A few days into the holiday and you can t stand in line in a supermarket without the strains of a smartphone issuing from the depths of a stroller  I have never banned screens in my house partly through laziness and partly through some vague notion that banning things only adds to their appeal This has had mixed results in line with most of my efforts to do psychology on my kids I let them choose not to do homework with the result that after four months of not doing homework they now rush in to do homework as if it s the most thrilling thing 
APR26	With his money-grubbing speeches, Boris Johnson cheapens our politics	What does a person say in two speeches that is worth Do they vomit gold This is the amount that Boris Johnson made last month He made a speech for the India Today conference and he got Accommodation and transport provided of course On the day Theresa May lost the second Brexit vote in the House of Commons he gave a speech for to Citigroup Global Markets Ltd Johnson is certainly taking advantage of the more liberal rules about income and interests now that he is no longer a minister  Taking advantage is after all his modus operandi These huge sums of money are staggering It takes a special kind of cognitive dissonance to read the news lately Are we to accept that politics is simply the hobby of rich men and the rest of the world can go to hell because we are a rich country and thus it is fine 
APR26	Forget Andrew Adonis’s U-turn on Brexit. It’s Labour that should really make one	On Wednesday Andrew Adonis a leading anti Brexit champion appeared to put the strangest statement on his Facebook page I am deeply sorry for off the cuff comments I made during a live LBC radio phone in last September he wrote I encourage all voters whatever their position on Brexit to vote Labour in the upcoming European parliament elections He then began a very uncharacteristic officious policy sermon including the statement Labour has put forward a sensible alternative plan that would ensure a close economic relationship with the EU after Brexit  The first part is easy to explain In September Adonis had been asked who Labour voters should vote for if they wanted to see Brexit happen He said they shouldn t vote Labour It was awkward Given that Adonis is now newly announced as a Labour MEP candidate and pro Brexit social media channels had begun circulating the clip of the discussion it was appropriate to apologise for that However how to explain the second part 
APR26	In the Brexit era, Britain is more Mr Bean than James Bond	We spend far too much time getting down about the state of the country the whole international laughing stock spinning manically out of control and generally going nowhere thing is pretty draining Yet hardly any effort is spent crudely shoehorning in film references to explain our political plight This is a real shame because for the Tory Brexiteers who valiantly yelled Charge then promptly led us off a cliff the story of the past three years has fundamentally been a clash between self perception and reality  Our macho superhero will gloriously defend a country whose government has wet itself while everyone else was watching
APR26	Remainers: don’t panic about European elections. Just participating is a win	Shall we start with the good news or the bad news The bad news is that the remainers European election campaign has so far proved an amateurish shambles The anti Brexit parties have refused to coalesce and are arguing among themselves the Labour party is still pretending it doesn t want the election to happen while Change UK is campaigning under three aliases and has already lost two candidates to historical racist tweets  The good news is that it almost certainly doesn t matter Of course the European elections are important and of course remainers should aim to succeed The European parliament gives legislators and by extension ordinary voters direct power and influence over the EU project Consequently the election will help shape our contribution to the EU in the coming months or perhaps years What it will not do is change any of the facts or dynamics over Brexit 
APR27	If an illegal drug let me finish the London Marathon, I’d take it like a shot	If you are reading this on Sunday morning I should be running the London Marathon I say should because as of Friday night I have no idea if I will be able to run at all  I have been training since December Baby runs at first Then longer Then I got lost an unjustly underrated training strategy and turned what was meant to be a mile run into a mile run I finished it without too much trouble and thought for the first time that I just might get there 
APR27	The story isn’t ‘crowgate’ – it’s Britain’s heedless killing of birds	Last week TV naturalist Chris Packham woke to a scene out of Game of Thrones Hanging in front of the gate of his New Forest home a gate whose lock had been glued shut two dead crows swung by their necks in the breeze Packham cut them down called a cab he couldn t get his car out of the drive and carried on  It was the latest chapter in the strange history of the general licences a story that has seen petitions and counter petitions threats and smears and says a great deal about the caustic and polarised nature of debate in Britain in 
APR27	Anna Sorokin proves we’re all soft touches for glamour scammers	On Thursday in a New York courtroom Anna Sorokin was convicted of a litany of charges four counts of theft of services three of grand larceny and one of attempted grand larceny The story of her brief bright career as a scammer when she floated around the city claiming to be an heiress called Anna Delvey on a cycle of borrowing and defaulting has proved so gripping that it is already being turned into competing projects A New York magazine report from was optioned for Netflix a Vanity Fair story written by the photojournalist who had been swindled by Sorokin and who testified against her is being adapted for HBO by Lena Dunham  Sorokin s convictions for which she faces a prison sentence and deportation to Germany make her the latest in a line of high level fakers elevated to celebrity status by our fascination It s no wonder that Netflix and HBO are involved in turning the saga into entertainment from the Fyre festival to Elizabeth Holmes the disgraced CEO of Theranos not in a week of Avengers overload to be confused with Thanos tales of people promising something they could never or never intended to deliver are everywhere 
APR27	Memo to Debenhams: don’t remind your customers they are middle aged	My branch of Debenhams in Wimbledon south London is one of branches set to close next year with more to follow putting an estimated jobs at risk  How horrible particularly for the workers Losing our Debenhams huge with three floors will leave the shopping centre looking hollowed out Sadly I saw it coming Just before Christmas I was berating myself for getting to the store so late dreading the festive crowds I needn t have worried two days before the big day and it was deserted like a scene in a post apocalyptic disaster movie where of humanity has perished and survivors break into shops to steal provisions I half expected to see a zombie lurch towards me through the rails of discount fleeces If Debenhams were a human being it would have been my cue to scream for the defibrillator 
APR27	Anti-vaxxers are taking populism to a new, deadly level	The two men rode into the village on a motorbike eyewitnesses said and opened fire They left one woman dead and another injured and a trail of fear in their wake Both women were vaccination workers trying to save children from polio and in parts of Pakistan that is a dangerous thing to be Medical teams have repeatedly been attacked amid rumours fuelled by Islamist militants that a national drive to eradicate the disease is cover for a western plot to sterilise children or gather intelligence  In Nigeria too the extremist group Boko Haram has murdered vaccination workers attempting to frighten families out of having their babies protected British parents don t know how lucky we are with our nice safe NHS surgeries and our children who have the vast unfathomable luck to be born right here and now winners of the historical lottery a generation for whom the eradication of so many infectious diseases is within sight Or it could be if some in the west seemingly weren t doing their damnedest to die of ignorance instead 
APR27	Voters are right to fear for their dying villages as Spain goes to the polls	Ra l Romano is proud of Otones de Benjumea his village near Segovia central Spain where he recently organised a feast for people together with music and a talk But Romano does not live in Otones Nor do the vast majority of the members of the village s strong corral n cultural association which organises the annual extravaganza to celebrate the slaughter of pigs and their conversion into cuts of meat sausages and offal  Romano lives in Torrej n de la Calzada a Madrid dormitory town Most of the others live in Segovia or Spain s capital which lies an hour and half away by car All call this my village but it is really where their parents or grandparents come from a place of nostalgia and identity not of daily life At most some have kept up a family house rather then letting it fall down since there are no buyers and spend weekends there The village s permanent population has dropped below down by half in two decades There are no children now Romano s mother passed away last month His father is In a few years time only a dozen or so residents will be left

APR28	My England is in a mess. Scotland’s case for splitting away is stronger than ever	The day of the Scottish independence referendum of I was in Hallglen a large housing estate on the edge of Falkirk As it turned out the town would vote to remain in the UK by to but where I was droves of people were turning out to support the end of the union and the creation of a new country  I had spent time on the estate over the previous weeks and observed a remarkable upsurge of both interest in politics and optimism not least at a Sunday evening public meeting at which hundreds had gathered to talk about how badly their area had fared since the Thatcher years and how breaking from the rotten Westminster consensus might serve it better Now as people went in and out of the polling station I fell into conversation with a thirtysomething man who had a vision of what an independent Scotland might mean for the rest of the UK If we start this we could make a big proper movement for the rest of the country he said And I think we should The poverty in this country us and England and everywhere else shouldn t be happening in 
APR28	I worked on David Attenborough’s documentary. The grim reality gave me climate anxiety	We live in a time of loss Wild places dwindle the animals and plants that live in them disappear Climate change is now a certainty and it will without a doubt lead to the loss of land species and ways of life In the abstract this is disconcerting Up close it is devastating I worked on the BBC s Climate Change The Facts presented by David Attenborough and have felt this pain first hand  Last year I was living a charmed life I graduated from university and jetted off painfully ironic I know to lead an expedition on a remote South Pacific island where I studied one of the world s rarest parrots and the role of culture in conservation Within a few days of my return I somehow stepped into a job at the BBC on a documentary about climate change initially called Two Degrees the name changed when the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change s report released last October informed us that C would be more appropriate and that isn t really very catchy I was to be the show s researcher tasked with finding stories that would best educate and entertain the British public 
APR28	Wife-tracking apps are one sign of Saudi Arabia’s vile regime. Others include crucifixion…	Credit where it s due The Saudi Absher app just described as inhuman by two clearly terrified Saudi refugees also has some fabulous user reviews on its supplier websites Apple and Google Play  To read the surge of five star tributes placed after the app s invaluable contribution to human enslavement was widely exposed earlier in the year is to understand that aside from adding value to Apple and Google Absher is a boon to harassed owners of subordinate women at a time when more and more of this human property is reportedly becoming fractious 
APR28	Forty years ago, Thatcherism swept Britain. Could our new parties repeat the trick?	Forty years ago this week the Conservative party won the UK general election with of the vote netting the country s first female prime minister Margaret Thatcher a comfortable overall majority of seats and setting her up nicely for what turned out to be more than a decade in Downing Street  How things have changed No s current occupant may still be a Tory woman but she presides over a minority government barely worth the name and she s unlikely to be there for more than a few months let alone years And zooming out to look at the party system as a whole the Conservatives now find themselves in a far more diverse and challenging environment than the one that Maggie confronted as she stood on the steps of Downing Street paraphrasing St Francis of Assisi 
APR28	Time has run out. Labour must seize its last chance to take a stand on Brexit	Over the next hours a battle will take place that will settle the future of the Labour party and arguably the country Is Labour to be the party of Europe in uncompromising opposition to the rise of an ugly hard right English nationalism Or will it continue to temporise over Europe so enabling the centre of political gravity to shift towards the English nationalist right  The issue that cannot be fudged is the manifesto on which prospective Labour members of the European parliament will fight the elections on May As it stands the draft is unambiguously pro a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal with remain as the other option That is the position of European MEPs party members and trade unions as it has gone through the varying consultation processes over the last week 
APR28	If an illegal drug let me finish the London Marathon, I’d take it like a shot	If you are reading this on Sunday morning I should be running the London Marathon I say should because as of Friday night I have no idea if I will be able to run at all  I have been training since December Baby runs at first Then longer Then I got lost an unjustly underrated training strategy and turned what was meant to be a mile run into a mile run I finished it without too much trouble and thought for the first time that I just might get there 
APR28	The story isn’t ‘crowgate’ – it’s Britain’s heedless killing of birds	Last week TV naturalist Chris Packham woke to a scene out of Game of Thrones Hanging in front of the gate of his New Forest home a gate whose lock had been glued shut two dead crows swung by their necks in the breeze Packham cut them down called a cab he couldn t get his car out of the drive and carried on  It was the latest chapter in the strange history of the general licences a story that has seen petitions and counter petitions threats and smears and says a great deal about the caustic and polarised nature of debate in Britain in 
APR28	Talk of integration is a sideshow in a society where many feel unheard	Uncontrolled migrant flows have made many in Europe more hostile to immigration The failure of migrants to integrate has helped create more fractured societies and exacerbated fears The combination of the two has driven support for the far right  These are almost uncontested views these days The latest warning came from Tony Blair s Institute for Global Change which insists in a new report that a credible policy agenda on integration is a crucial task for social democratic parties necessary to combat the electoral success of rightwing populism 
APR28	Anti-vaxxers are wrong but ridicule is no way to win them over	If someone asked you to describe a typical flat earther what comes to mind Thick headed Witless Just plain crazy Those are certainly adjectives that would have comfortably tripped off my tongue before watching Behind the Curve a documentary on the flat earth movement that s just started streaming on Netflix What s fresh about the film is not what it reveals about the absurdity of flat earther beliefs one of the main areas of contention within the community is whether or not our flat as a saucer planet is covered by a Truman Show style dome It s the affection it makes you feel for its key players  The documentary s director Daniel J Clark wanted to develop our understanding of why flat earthers embrace a belief that science shows to be untrue And so it s the believers enthusiasm their relationships and the sense of community that has built up around this dangerous rejection of science that take centre stage over cheap potshots 
APR28	Anna Sorokin proves we’re all soft touches for glamour scammers	On Thursday in a New York courtroom Anna Sorokin was convicted of a litany of charges four counts of theft of services three of grand larceny and one of attempted grand larceny The story of her brief bright career as a scammer when she floated around the city claiming to be an heiress called Anna Delvey on a cycle of borrowing and defaulting has proved so gripping that it is already being turned into competing projects A New York magazine report from was optioned for Netflix a Vanity Fair story written by the photojournalist who had been swindled by Sorokin and who testified against her is being adapted for HBO by Lena Dunham  Sorokin s convictions for which she faces a prison sentence and deportation to Germany make her the latest in a line of high level fakers elevated to celebrity status by our fascination It s no wonder that Netflix and HBO are involved in turning the saga into entertainment from the Fyre festival to Elizabeth Holmes the disgraced CEO of Theranos not in a week of Avengers overload to be confused with Thanos tales of people promising something they could never or never intended to deliver are everywhere 
APR29	My sexual assault case was dropped when I refused to give police my phone	A few years ago I was violently sexually assaulted by a friend on a night out It was a sustained and sadistic attack that in no way began with consent I made the incredibly difficult decision to report it to the police because I needed to take power back I wanted to look him in the eyes in court and watch him feel a fraction of the helplessness and humiliation that I felt that night I wanted to tell him I had the power now with the full weight of the law behind me Unfortunately it didn t work out as I expected  Even though some time had elapsed between the assault and my reporting of it there was evidence that the police acknowledged as compelling Despite this my case was dropped not because of an unlikely prospect of conviction but because I refused to hand over my mobile phone to be downloaded in its entirety 
APR29	Labour members know what we need: a referendum and a campaign for remain	Jeremy Corbyn s leadership campaign motivated thousands Enthused by an unequivocal principled call to build a fairer Britain and a more peaceful world I was one of hundreds who joined volunteer phone banking sessions In Labour s general election team I played a small part in the by then huge movement which inspired millions to vote for the party and which has since inspired socialist parties across Europe and beyond  Making a decisive break with lowest common denominator politics calling out austerity as a political choice and not a necessity our reinvigorated party has forced cracks into the consensus supporting neoliberal economics worldwide It has helped to restore the fight for social justice to the heart of left politics 
APR29	Why we need to pause before claiming cultural appropriation	Is Gordon Ramsay allowed to cook Chinese food Is it OK to dress up as Disney s Moana Can Jamie Oliver cook jollof rice despite plainly not knowing what it is Exactly what is cultural appropriation To take a glance at Good Morning Britain the ITV show that never takes its finger off the pulse of Middle England s clogged arteries you d think it s a question of white people seeking permission to have fun And in return new media outlets have guaranteed traffic from anxious millennials by listing things that fall into the category of problematic when white people adopt them blaccents bindis and box braids  Why has cultural appropriation an imperfect term mobilised in imperfect contexts become such live ammunition for the socially conscious And what does it mean especially for people of colour when we turn our fire on each other It is striking that a phrase intended to sharpen a political analysis of life under postcolonial capitalism seems to have drawn the most blood between people who share overlapping experiences of racism and displacement 
APR29	I was lied to by a police spy. The inquiry promised the truth but we’re far from it	So now we know When asked the chair of the undercover policing inquiry Sir John Mitting has granted anonymity to two thirds of the police spies who asked for it I am dismayed that Mitting has erred towards keeping the police s secrets although I m not really surprised The chair who is a member of the men only Garrick Club and has described himself as old fashioned has repeatedly shown himself to be out of touch with the realities of institutional sexism racism and political persecution which are what the inquiry is about It is hard not to conclude that he is biased in favour of the police As someone who has invested so much into the fight for answers I am deeply concerned  If you haven t followed my story in I fell in love with a man who did not exist He was charismatic and romantic and shared my interests and dreams We lived as lovers for more than a year He was close to my family and we were the closest friends Then in I received a phone call Mark Stone was not the man I thought I knew He was Mark Kennedy an undercover police officer paid to infiltrate political groups provided with resources to deceive me supervised and followed by a team of cover officers and senior police He was under orders manipulating my emotions and actions according to their operational aims 
APR29	Private schools claim to help the taxpayer. But they serve only the rich	The heads of Britain s private schools are really feeling the pressure How else do you explain their desperate plea to leave them alone because super rich parents are saving the taxpayer billions of pounds a year by sending their offspring to Eton and Harrow  This self serving study in public school economics published by the Independent Schools Council ISC was given pride of place in at least two national newspapers last week It s an old argument that was first shot down in by a panel of academics and private school leaders set up to integrate the public schools with the state system The Public Schools Commission found the claim that parents who choose to pay for their child s education are being hit with a double taxation unimpressive likening it to a childless couple asking for a tax rebate because they weren t drawing any benefit from the schools system 
APR29	Fear of the far right and the collapse of Podemos gave Spain’s socialists victory	Pedro S nchez is the clear winner of Sunday s snap elections in Spain With the highest turnout since the prime minister s Socialist Workers party PSOE won nearly double the number of seats of its closest competitor the conservative Popular Party PP But in the country s highly fragmented political system it is unlikely to govern alone Instead S nchez must look for support from other parties Like many progressive parties in Europe he will have to choose between a technocratic party looking to centralise power and a radical left party that favours decentralisation  S nchez s victory is the result of two main trends First and foremost is the rise of Vox a new openly misogynistic and xenophobic party that toys with nostalgia for Franco s dictatorship Backed by the likes of Steve Bannon Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini and indirectly financed via the Madrid based CitizenGo organisation by a US super PAC with ties to Donald Trump Russian oligarch Aleksei Komov and the Italian MP Luca Volont who is accused of bribery Vox rode a wave of anti Catalan sentiment into the government of Andaluc a in December Sunday s massive turnout was most likely driven by widespread fear of a rightwing coalition government that would include it 
APR29	Some sort of Scottish independence is inevitable. May needs to face up to it	Scotland s first minister Nicola Sturgeon yesterday reiterated her promise to give her country another referendum on independence within the next two years After all if there s an argument for Britons having another Brexit referendum just three years after the last Scotland can surely have another on independence after five years Besides Sturgeon must be thinking was there ever a better moment for divorce from a marriage so dysfunctional as the United Kingdom  Some might wonder what new horror history could unleash on poor Britain After Brexit comes Scexit But Sturgeon is in the ascendant The weekend s polls put her SNP s lead over all other parties at between and points astonishing for a governing party that has been in office for years with Sturgeon as its leader for five In that time the popularity of Scottish independence has risen to an unprecedented support With an electorate that strongly rejected leaving the EU Sturgeon reasonably calculates that this is the moment to strike The difficulties of the Northern Ireland backstop will pale into insignificance beside an Edinburgh one 
APR29	Why aren’t remain-backing parties doing more to attract young people?	Are we entering a new era of political campaigning As Westminster grinds to a halt and the traditional party system teeters at the edge of collapse those seeking progress need only look across the road to Parliament Square where the grass is worn from a year of new protests and new faces  Young people have been a driving force in almost all of these From school climate strikes Extinction Rebellion occupations and multiple Brexit demonstrations my generation has led a new peaceful era of political campaigning 
APR29	Fourth-wave feminism can learn a thing or two from the 1980s play Top Girls	There has been a trend in fourth wave feminism for exploring the stories of women overlooked by history but almost years before Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls Top Girls did it for grownups Caryl Churchill s play now revived at the National Theatre by Lyndsey Turner is perhaps best known for its opening scene a Saturday night dinner party featuring Pope Joan Lady Nij Dull Gret Isabella Bird Patient Griselda and a Thatcherite recruitment manager called Marlene It s a genius opener a dreamlike sequence in which the women share their tales of suffering and patriarchy poignantly but also hilariously as they proceed to get more and more wasted on Frascati It s very very funny It sticks the knife in while you re laughing off guard and then twists it  When I first read Top Girls at the age of I would never have called myself a feminist and I didn t understand it as I do now but I loved it and it was wondrous to finally see it staged since it was written it has hardly been performed which is at odds with the high regard in which the play is held But what I was unprepared for was how little it has dated You come away from the performance not only with a broad perspective of women s history but also with the feeling that not as much has changed as Churchill perhaps would have hoped 
APR29	Nigel Farage is fuelled by the betrayal myth. And Brexit is only the start	It is a grim reflection that no contemporary British politician better understands the networks dynamics and ever changing rules of modern politics than Nigel Farage  He is as effective as he is awful His fledgling Brexit party is not fielding candidates in Thursday s local elections though its baleful spirit will surely loom over the battle for control of English councils in which the Tories are expected to suffer serious losses 
APR30	With the delay to Brexit, Westminster has retreated into fantasy again	The eye of a hurricane can be strangely quiet an ominous calm that presages collision with another wall of storm There is something of that eeriness about the current lull in Brexit related political frenzy The wind dropped before Easter The departure date was delayed to October and parliament went into recess MPs are now back in Westminster and the crisis is not settled yet there is still barely a breeze of urgency  When the cabinet met on Tuesday Brexit was not even on the agenda There is no significant government business scheduled for the Commons chamber all week It is hard to legislate for life beyond Brexit without having legislated for Brexit first But Theresa May still doesn t have a majority for her deal and Jeremy Corbyn has no interest in bailing her out with opposition votes 
APR30	Judging by the Home Office, it’s now Tory policy to ruin Britain	It is now exactly a year since Amber Rudd resigned as home secretary and it feels as if the Home Office is as broken as ever if not more so There is something of the bleakness of the Arab spring about it all An unimaginable revolt happened a despot was overthrown and for a brief moment it seemed that the time of dystopian oppression was over before the deep state regrouped and imposed a tyranny redux  Since Windrush all we have seen is pathetic attempts at compensating victims and more scandals Presiding over it all is the new benevolent dictator Sajid Javid who speaks in the language of a man who knows how to pay lip service to the forces that removed his predecessor while doubling down on policies that have not changed but are merely fronted by a new more media friendly face One that does not hesitate to point out as often as possible that it is a brown one 
APR30	Cambridge is right: you can’t take pride in the past and ignore the horror of slavery	There is almost nothing Oxbridge people enjoy more than a really intense no holds barred argument about themselves  So it s perhaps not surprising that the University of Cambridge s decision to launch an inquiry into its links to the slave trade has prompted some soul searching On the one hand is a student body increasingly vocal about the legacy of colonialism and academics arguing as Prof Martin Millett the archaeologist chairing a panel overseeing the work does that Cambridge must confront its own role in a shameful episode of history On the other is a handful of academics grumbling about rewriting history and no doubt some unspoken fears about what all this is going to cost both financially and in curricular terms After investigation invariably comes reparation 
APR30	Labour needn’t worry: in its northern heartlands, Brexiters are not the only voices	 I voted out Out means out and I d do it again said the old man as he harrumphed off up Kirkgate on his mobility scooter Wakefield voted to in favour of leave so here was the perfect vox pop Bank it let it stand for northern working class leavedom and head back south  But what of the other voices I heard in the windswept West Yorkshire market precinct outside the cathedral Fed upness with all politics indignation at Westminster chaos resentment at three wasted years of empty argy bargy A few people said they wouldn t vote again in another referendum they were just too disillusioned Bring back Guy Fawkes one man joked Plenty of well justified grudge but there were plenty of switchers too Resentful not ode to joy converts but weary givers in to the realities trade offs and hard choices that were never revealed during the referendum 
APR30	Clinton-era politics refuses to die. Joe Biden is its zombie that staggers on	You cannot understand politics in America until you understand that in the Democratic party which ostensibly represents the left side of our nation s political spectrum there are a significant number of people who genuinely believe that Joe Biden is the best possible presidential nominee Their belief is not cynical or at least not wholly cynical  His constituency is real It is not illuminating to think of them just as centrists arguing for the gentlest sprinkling of sugar over the top of America s poison It s better to think of them as zombies the product of three decades of self serving triangulating brainwashing They are the Democrats who had their eyelids propped open and were forced to watch the Clinton era year after year after year It is not so much that they do not deep down harbor a vague wish for a better world it is that like stray dogs dining exclusively on garbage life has taught them that this is the best that they will ever get 
APR30	Tommy Robinson wants to be an MEP. But we in the north-west can stop him	Tommy Robinson or Stephen Yaxley Lennon if we want to refer to him by his real name announced last week that he s standing for the north west of England in the European elections The former British National party BNP member wants to take the same seat that his then leader Nick Griffin held from to Tommy Robinson is a far right thug who went from being a member of the BNP to co founding the English Defence League EDL  He talks about standing up for ordinary working class people but he is not interested in real solutions to the problems faced by the working classes in the north west His answer to the despair people feel after more than a decade of austerity and Tory attacks on the welfare state is to scapegoat Muslims and migrants Robinson s EDL was an inspiration for far right terrorist Anders Breivik who killed people in Norway on 
APR30	Gwyneth Paltrow and Pete Buttigieg: a match made in intellectual hell	There are so many people running for president in the US it is hard to keep track of who s who So let s begin with a reminder that year old Pete Buttigieg known as Mayor Pete by those who like him and Mayo Pete by those who don t is the Smart Candidate He speaks eight languages he taught himself Norwegian so he could read an author s untranslated work he plays piano he loves Ulysses Imagining yourself in a book club with Pete Buttigieg is this election s having a beer with George W Bush the New York Times recently opined  It is not clear whether Gwyneth Paltrow has been imagining herself in a book club with Buttigieg but the actor certainly fancies the well read wunderkind for president She will be co hosting a fundraiser for the candidate on May tickets start at gets you a picture with the man himself Knowing Paltrow you might even get a Buttigieg branded vagina egg to go home with 
APR30	Of course the Victorians walked faster. They didn’t have Instagram and map apps	It turns out that for the past years anyone following standard walking directions has unintentionally been playing a game of Are you fitter than a Victorian mountaineer As a result Ordnance Survey has finally decided that it is going to shake things up and provide st century directions for st century walkers with an update to the way it works out how long a given walk should take  Something obvious you want to know before you lace up your walking boots and set off into the wilderness is when you might expect to reach your destination and the standard rule of thumb for working out whether you re about to set out on a brief stroll or a back breaking endurance test was formulated by William Naismith the founder of the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 
APR30	Humanity has truly lost its way if we’re weaponising beluga whales	Last week a curious scene played out in the small Norwegian fishing village of Inga Here a mysterious white beluga whale appeared from out of the water and proceeded to behave very strangely Upon the body of this whale there was a strap Upon the fabric of this strap was written a long chain of human hieroglyphs Equipment of St Petersburg the writing said And then almost as if it were all a dream the whale disappeared Although it sounds like something Douglas Adams could have written I want to welcome you to the dizzying age of weaponised whales Because as well as poisoning oceans we humans are also capable of poisoning the minds of the animals that live there  First some background If the idea of the Russians using such a beautiful and intelligent organism to further their military aims disgusts you I should tell you that many countries particularly the US have programmes that train dolphins and other species including sea lions for military exercises These marine mammals can be trained to detect mines or assist in object recoveries They can be trained to do search and rescue missions too In fact as of the US navy was spending m a year on its marine programme involving mine sweeping dolphins 
APR30	Looking for comment on the royal baby? Don’t ask me	Here are some of the things that people are saying about mixed race babies at the moment websites have run stories about the viral mixed race children of Instagram who are trending because of their gorgeous blonde hair light eyes and golden skin that looks like sand White teenagers in conversations that I have both overheard and been privy to say I really want to have kids with a black guy because mixed race babies are so cute I just love their curly hair and oh my God the ones with freckles  The Kardashians who have been accused by some people of turning that particular fantasy into reality are a never ending source of related commentary Kylie Jenner is currently causing people to fall all over themselves with praise because she learned how to do her mixed race daughter s hair 
MAY1	May was right to sack Gavin Williamson. No one will be sorry to see him go	There have been spectacular resignations of British defence secretaries Michael Heseltine over the Westland affair in comes immediately to mind But there has not been a spectacular sacking of a defence secretary in the modern era until now with the firing of Gavin Williamson The contrast does not end there Heseltine was a genuinely major figure who quit over his belief in backing British and European defence suppliers Williamson is a genuine minnow who got himself fired because of his ambition   No government can be successful which cannot keep its secrets the Labour premier Clem Attlee famously said
MAY1	The hounding of Greta Thunberg is proof that the right has run out of ideas	Over the past few days something extraordinary has happened in our politics A bunch of grown men have begun bullying a schoolgirl Perhaps you already know who I mean Greta Thunberg she of the pigtails and school strikes who came to Westminster last week and slammed adoring MPs for posturing rather than taking action on climate breakdown then hoofed it over to St Pancras for the hour train ride back to Stockholm  Which left the eco denialists back here with a stonking great headache how to bash this year old celeb Not by dismantling her arguments not when the scientists and Sir David of Blue Planet back her up Nor by sniffing around her record since by definition a teenager hasn t much of a past to rake over The standard methods of political warfare off limits to them they are trying something new and unusual They are sinking their teeth into her 
MAY1	I was sore about losing to Caster Semenya. But this decision against her is wrong	A lot will be written by scientists activists lawyers bureaucrats and others about Caster Semenya s discrimination case But women athletes are rarely heard from especially those who have competed against Semenya and other women alleged by the International Association of Athletics Federations to have unfair athletic abilities as a result of naturally elevated testosterone levels  I competed for Australia in the m against Semenya at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin Today I am convinced that the court of arbitration for sport s decision to endorse rules aimed at excluding Semenya and other women athletes with naturally high levels of testosterone is the wrong one 
MAY1	Jeremy Corbyn is either blind to antisemitism – or he just doesn’t care	I m trying to imagine the left s reaction if it emerged that a leading politician had once lavished praise on a century old book that not only trotted out racist stereotypes about say black people and their supposed characteristics but whose central thesis rested on an ancient hostile assumption about that group Would good progressive folk be rushing to defend that politician by saying the author of the book in question had also written lots of important non offensive things and that other people had quoted that author too so this was a fuss about nothing or would they be appalled and even sickened that a contemporary politician could praise such a text without so much as mentioning the racism within it  It turns out that the answer is it depends which side the politician is on and also perhaps which ethnic minority is involved If the politician is the current leader of the Labour party and the minority involved are Jews well then it seems the usual progressive reflexes don t always kick in 
MAY1	Poverty is holding Britain’s young people back. They deserve so much better	As A level exams draw nearer I have returned to teaching Arthur Miller s Death of a Salesman A cautionary tale on being wedded to an ideal that is unattainable it has left my students ultimately frustrated with the central character Willy Why can t he think outside the box he hems himself into they wonder He could have been bolder with his ambitions in the way we their teachers encourage them to be  Making young people aspirational is the bread and butter of teachers everywhere It forms the background noise of our daily dealings with our students Each lesson of each day we bargain with them if you stop fidgeting and concentrate if you apply yourself with maximum effort you will eventually be rewarded For students from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds it s a carrot forever dangled before them Hard work begets success a future of fulfilment and financial ease they are told Will Smith said so in his umpteenth motivational video so it must be true What is left unspoken but no less definitively delivered is that failure can only be considered a predictable result of indolence 
MAY1	How ultra-remainers could score a spectacular own goal on Brexit	In three weeks time it is entirely plausible that Nigel Farage s Brexit party will triumph in the European parliamentary elections It will be the greatest victory for bigotry in politics since the EU referendum campaign it will be a shot in the arm for the Tory hard Brexiteers emboldening them and providing them with renewed legitimacy it will damage the chances of a soft Brexit and it will inflict probably terminal harm on any prospect of a second referendum Preventing this completely and utterly inarguable outcome should you would think preoccupy every single remainer and every single self declared opponent of Tory rule It doesn t because for the stop Brexit or bust brigade punishing Labour for failing to repudiate a referendum that it lost less than three years ago is all that apparently matters in politics and if the country burns as a consequence then so be it  Yesterday Labour s national executive committee reaffirmed the party s position on Brexit that is it would prioritise a general election to remove the Tories from power and if that wasn t possible it would support all options remaining on the table including campaigning for a public vote This isn t controversial you would think it would be odd for the NEC to usurp the decision of the party s sovereign body and until now the conference policy has been lauded by advocates of a second referendum Yet for the monomaniacal ultra remainers who treat those of us who campaigned and voted for remain but are willing to accept compromise as bitter enemies on a par with Nigel Farage or Jacob Rees Mogg this is a great betrayal that makes voting Labour a disgrace 
MAY1	Why I will be protesting against Mark Carney on Thursday	As the adage goes There are decades when nothing happens and there are weeks when decades happen After decades of climate complacency for those in the environmental movement it certainly feels like we might be living in those weeks  Direct action by striking students and Extinction Rebellion has propelled the climate emergency to the top of the news and the political agenda But while protesters have quite rightly called on the government to take more responsibility the City of London has largely escaped the firing line 
MAY1	Now we know: conventional campaigning won’t prevent our extinction	The fact of the matter is finally settled Not the fact that if we do not stop putting carbon into the atmosphere our children will starve That was settled three decades ago Rather that the only way to prevent our extinction is through mass participation civil disobedience thousands of people breaking the laws of our governments until they are forced take action to protect us In less than a year Extinction Rebellion has gone from people in a room to creating the biggest organised civil disobedience campaign in British history In the past two weeks more than a thousand people have been arrested and as a result the climate and ecological crisis is finally on the political agenda Everyone from the Labour party to the Sun newspaper is accepting we are right we face the destruction of the next generation unless immediate emergency action is taken For millions of people this week the penny has finally dropped this is real and it s terrifyingly serious Even Michael Gove says he is hearing the message and held a meeting with XR on Tuesday  None of this was unplanned Extinction Rebellion didn t come out the blue Two years ago a group of researchers and activists started to meet to seriously consider two questions why has campaigning failed so catastrophically over the past generation and how can we make it work There are no more important questions facing our society and the global community 
MAY1	Britain’s countryside is dominated by bullies – as Chris Packham has found	I ve often thought watching the felling of ancient trees the slaughter of wildlife and the stripping of topsoil I love this land more than the owner does While there are plenty of careful landowners there are others who seem to despise their own property Those of us who love the land struggle against its owners to protect it from ruin  For centuries challenging the way the land is used has been treated as a trespass we are told that it is none of our business Yet this is the very fabric of our nation Conflicts over its treatment are portrayed in the billionaire press as a war between town and country But this isn t about rural versus urban it s about power As Guy Shrubsole s crucial book Who Owns England shows major rural and urban landowners are often the same people 
MAY1	High streets can be saved. Here’s how to reinvent them for the 21st century	The statistics on high street decline are bewildering The average high street in England and Wales has lost shops in the past five years More than retail jobs are expected to be lost this year After a certain point the numbers stop meaning anything We lose sight of the real picture So when Debenhams last week named the stores it plans to close in many will have tuned out Haven t we heard this before  But in reality that announcement will have hit people hard and not just because of the jobs at risk In Ashford and Kirkcaldy the Debenhams closures come soon after the shuttering of the local Marks Spencer Wolverhampton s Debenhams only opened in amid much fanfare that this was the start of a new wave of regeneration Make no mistake these announcements matter 
MAY2	Rat or stitch-up victim: how will history judge Gavin Williamson?	Is Gavin Williamson a disloyal rat or is he a Tory Julian Assange a valiant champion of open government in an age of secrecy Is he a menace to national security or is he the innocent victim of a toffs stitch up For an answer we may have to await a future memoir from one of the participants in this episode But even then the essence of a leak is deniability The wink the nod the I could not possibly say or ask me and watch if I smile followed by a ring round to substantiate  What is clear is that Williamson was accused by the prime minister of leaking a National Security Council discussion of the Chinese corporation Huawei s involvement in the G mobile phone network was found guilty and was sacked This was done before he was put in a position to prove his innocence 
MAY2	I’m a police officer in London. Here’s why we’ve lost control of the streets	There s a saying in the police It s not sophisticated or clever really and it s been passed down from generation to generation of coppers it s not new The job is fucked they say Only now it doesn t feel as flippant as it used to  I m a police officer in the Metropolitan police and have been since I have anxiety and PTSD I am and I cannot say this strongly enough exhausted I do not feel safe policing London s streets and moreover increasingly I do not feel that people in London are safe Just last night there was another double stabbing in east London resulting in the death of a year old boy 
MAY2	A Tory/Labour Brexit deal is further away than ever. Here’s why	For a few weeks there seems to have been an unspoken but collective decision to take a breather from Brexit After months of high drama the will of the people appears to be to talk about almost anything else Even a grievous national security leak has been seen by some as form of respite  But as people look the other way are things actually moving behind the scenes Briefings from both the government and Labour have claimed the talks have made progress and are heading towards a conclusion Could we at last be about to see a genuine Brexit breakthrough 
MAY2	Trump Jr, Bolsonaro Jr … beware the Adult Idiot Sons of unhinged presidents	There is an emerging political phenomenon that poses a unique threat to international stability and our collective sanity It is the growing influence of what is sometimes known in political jargon as the Idiot Adult Son From Donald Trump to Benjamin Netanyahu Jair Bolsonaro to Rodrigo Duterte the world s most awful leaders all seem to have knuckleheaded offspring who are doing their best to be just like Dad and doing a lot of damage in the process  The Idiot Adult Son by the way should not confused with the Large Adult Son a meme that sprung up recently The latter is basically an overgrown overprivileged man child annoying but largely harmless The IAS on the other hand is a loose cannon whose attempts to gain the attention and affection of his father often result in a diplomatic incident Eric Trump is a Large Adult Son Donald Trump Jr he of the awkward Russian meetings is an Idiot Adult Son Ivanka is a Machiavellian Adult Daughter but that s another article 
MAY2	Today’s vote must give the Conservatives the fatal blow they deserve	This could be the day the dam breaks the day that collapses what s left of the Tory party which on Wednesday night found itself embroiled in another hasty rearranging of the cabinet after the firing of defence secretary Gavin Williamson Today the country may finally rebel as people get out there and vote against a near decade of senseless slash and burn Enough  The conventional complaint is that people voting today will not cast their ballot on the quality of their local authority services but lazily use it as a vote on national politics Please begs the Westminster government judge your council not us But that has become an absurdity The government has cut councils so close to the bone that there is less and less difference between their political complexions on the ground Labour and Tory councils alike struggle to cover their barest statutory duties to safeguard children at risk and care for the frail elderly with little leeway to choose other political priorities 
MAY2	It’s disgraceful that nuclear weapons are being celebrated at Westminster Abbey	On October at the height of the Cuban missile crisis the US navy dropped depth charges on the Soviet nuclear submarine B With the vessel damaged and cut off from communication with Moscow its captain Valentin Savitsky assumed that the US and USSR were now at war and thus initiated steps to fire its nuclear torpedo at US forces Protocol demanded that all three of the senior officers should approve the launch Although one officer agreed with Savitsky the other Vasili Arkhipov vetoed the decision The world came within a whisker of thermonuclear war  The continued proliferation of nuclear weaponry represents one of the greatest threats to humanity s long term survival Yet tomorrow Westminster Abbey is hosting a service to celebrate years of Britain s continuous at sea deterrent that is having a nuclear armed submarine on constant sea patrol ready to attack or threaten anyone anywhere any time As part of a series of events led by the Royal Navy the invitation only congregation including Prince William will be asked to rejoice at this dubious achievement and somewhat incongruously to pray for peace 
MAY2	It's painfully clear: today's Congress wouldn't have impeached Richard Nixon	There was a point during the Senate s alternate grilling and chilling with Attorney General Bill Barr when you could hear the ghost of Richard Nixon crying  Nixon took one final helicopter flight from the White House a generation too soon He shuffled off this mortal coil a decade too early for redemption 
MAY2	The hounding of Greta Thunberg is proof that the right has run out of ideas	Over the past few days something extraordinary has happened in our politics A bunch of grown men have begun bullying a schoolgirl Perhaps you already know who I mean Greta Thunberg she of the pigtails and school strikes who came to Westminster last week and slammed adoring MPs for posturing rather than taking action on climate breakdown then hoofed it over to St Pancras for the hour train ride back to Stockholm  Which left the eco denialists back here with a stonking great headache how to bash this year old celeb Not by dismantling her arguments not when the scientists and Sir David of Blue Planet back her up Nor by sniffing around her record since by definition a teenager hasn t much of a past to rake over The standard methods of political warfare off limits to them they are trying something new and unusual They are sinking their teeth into her 
MAY2	Instagram hiding its likes is no bad thing, but young people will find a way round it	I used to love Instagram Amid the family politics and local gossip of Facebook and the unpredictable snark of Twitter my little private Instagram account felt like a pleasant place to be It s still the only social media app I use with any regularity But lately I ve been trying to extricate myself from its surprisingly tight grip My muscle memory still goes to press the icon when I m on the train with no signal but my brain has started to wonder why Why keep checking this when it s unlikely to have changed from when I last checked it two minutes ago And there s a quieter voice too more frank and ashamed why am I still looking at something that has a tendency to make not just me but plenty of people I know feel bad about our own lives  For those who use comparisons as a stick to beat themselves up with this is a step in the right direction
MAY2	My organisation helped Leeds lower child obesity. Here’s how to do it nationwide	With nearly a quarter of five year olds starting school overweight or obese the need for effective action to tackle obesity has never been greater Just one in children obese at age five will return to a healthy weight by age so focusing efforts on the early years is the most effective strategy That is why the success of Leeds in lowering its obesity rate has made the news and why the charity I work for Henry Health Exercise Nutrition for the Really Young is so keen to continue its good work there across the country  At Henry we have developed an innovative and effective approach with training for early years workers and eight week family programmes delivered in Leeds for years particularly in more disadvantaged areas The initiative uses a model that can be adopted anywhere and so could potentially be rolled out across the country as a key part of obesity reduction efforts 
MAY3	Labour’s bid for leave voters is failing. It must now look to remainers	The voters blow a big raspberry to the two main parties and both react the same way OK OK we hear you You just want us to get on with Brexit That was the line following Thursday s council elections across much of England from both the prime minister and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell although the latter was quick to clarify that when he tweeted Brexit sort it Message received that didn t strictly speaking mean he wanted Brexit to happen just that the issue needed to be sorted out whichever way So that clears that up  Reading losses for both the governing and main opposition parties as a rejection of their handling of the issue that has consumed them both has an obvious logic It s a logic likely to gain extra force in less than three weeks when Nigel Farage s Brexit party could well top the poll at the European elections Why else would voters call down a plague on both the Tory and Labour houses unless they were furious at their failure to implement what the public voted for in 
MAY3	Is fair play in running more important than fairness to Caster Semenya as a human?	When she was a girl growing up in rural South Africa the runner Caster Semenya would sometimes face a humiliating ritual before a race She grew accustomed her coaches once said to having to retreat to the bathroom with a member of a suspicious rival athletics team and physically show them that she was not a boy From her childhood people had gossiped about her body by the time she had begun competing internationally she must have been used to the whispers the open stares in changing rooms  All her life she has been portrayed as a freak an anomaly of nature undeserving of her gold medals And as if having her femaleness constantly questioned wasn t enough as a black South African athlete and a lesbian she attracts more than her share of kneejerk prejudice To argue that this Olympic athlete has somehow had it easy because of her biology feels grotesque in the circumstances But nothing about this case is simple 
MAY3	The silence on Christian persecution is because of trade, not political correctness	The foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has been denouncing the persecution of Christians around the world in advance of a report he has commissioned from the Bishop of Truro It s true and important that Christians are being persecuted in large numbers especially in the Middle East and that this has been largely ignored by the British media for decades But there is something very jarring in Hunt s discovery of their cause  In remarks to the press in Addis Ababa the capital of Ethiopia one of the oldest Christian countries in the world he blamed political correctness as well as post colonial guilt for the British indifference to the suffering of Christians in Asia and Africa There is certainly some truth to these accusations The view that all religious believers were weird at best and that anyone enlightened must be an atheist were quite fashionable in the early years of this century It was usually expressed as hostility to Muslims as much as in indifference to the sufferings of Christians but it certainly wasn t sympathy 
MAY3	Rory Stewart's promotion to DfID is bad news for Britain's prisons	Rory Stewart wasn t responsible for the National Security Council Huawei leak His move from prisons minister to the Department for International Development was not of his own doing But it nonetheless came at a good time for the Eton educated ex soldier who according to rumours may be played by Orlando Bloom in a biopic of his life  Stewart leaves behind a failing prison system in which violence is at record levels and according to the most recent prison watchdog report is struggling to deal with a drugs crisis that is out of control It comes as little surprise that British prisons are failing there s been a increase in the number of offenders locked up in the last years reoffending leading to a return to prison is rising and according to the Prison Reform Trust there s soon to be a cash shortfall of m in the government s investment proposals While some working around the prison system have praised Stewart for his energy focus and critical thinking his efforts were actually failing 
MAY3	The Lib Dems forgot that success was possible. That could now change	There is a clear story from the local elections last night a Liberal Democrat surge It is important to note that voters see local elections as an opportunity to protest and register their discontent with the sitting party Even so the Tory party s performance was excruciatingly bad One might have expected those gains to have gone to the main opposition party too Instead Labour has lost seats Those wishing to protest the current government have voted for the Lib Dems or Greens instead  But it is the Lib Dems that have gained territory all over the map They increased their majorities in places they already hold such as North Norfolk They crept into Brexiteer areas such as Hinkley and Bosworth in Leicestershire which voted to leave in the EU referendum In Theresa May s constituency of Windsor and Maidenhead they cut a Tory majority of down to five But a major part of the story is the huge swing from Tories to Lib Dems in the area often referred to as the former Lib Dem heartlands the south west The Lib Dems were almost wiped out there in the general election now they are claiming it back 
MAY3	Could Penny Mordaunt become Theresa May’s emotionally intelligent successor?	When Penny Mordaunt moved into her ministerial office in the Department for International Development she was offered a choice of items from the government art collection to adorn the walls It s a perilous process for any politician choose something classic and appear uncool go for something contemporary and risk looking try hard or worse if you re a Tory politician have the artist declare that they despise the government As communities secretary Eric Pickles tried to show he had an open mind with both a portrait of Benjamin Disraeli and William Gladstone while George Osborne caused a stir by picking Grayson Perry s Print for a Politician  Mordaunt in the end opted for neither option She shunned the convention and the collection instead bringing in her own picture from home of Admiral Lord Nelson Expect the same picture to hang in her new office in the Ministry of Defence following Mordaunt s promotion this week to one of the great offices of state in the wake of Gavin Williamson s sacking for allegedly leaking details of a National Security Council meeting to the press 
MAY3	It’s hard for us on the Israeli left – liberal antisemitism makes it worse	The New York Times apologised this week for a cartoon published recently in its international edition The drawing was of a blind Donald Trump wearing a skullcap led by the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was depicted as a dog wearing a star of David collar The cartoon evoked caricatures of evil Jews misleading blind nations of a kind popular in the German media during the Nazi era  The reaction in both the US and Israel was first shock then a furore The cartoon couldn t have come at a worse time the San Diego synagogue shooting last weekend proved that antisemitism is still deeply rooted in the US And it came just as Israel prepared to remember million Jews on the national Holocaust Remembrance Day For New York Times columnist Bret Stephens the cartoon checked so many antisemitic boxes that the only thing missing was a dollar sign The Jew in the form of a dog the small cunning Jew leading a naive American hated Trump depicted as blind and Judaised a puppet of the Jewish state as if Trump needs Netanyahu to make him act the way he does 
MAY3	Kids hugging: that’s no big deal. Or so I used to think	I don t remember being ordered to hug people when I was a child but I remember being made to hold hands Sweaty papery vice like limp God all the hands one has to hold as a child It s not a big deal And of course it s unavoidable for safety but I remember disliking it the sense of obligation and the fact you never knew what hand you would get Long after the fact there came a moment when I realised merciful heaven I didn t have to hold any more hands  Hugs were different a social necessity rather a safety measure and in the s and s and probably s they were also something from which you couldn t opt out Again it didn t seem like a big deal at the time There were circumstances in which it was polite to offer a hug and polite to accept one Weathering a bad hug meant standing still while someone crushed you vaguely to their midsection before wandering off to do something else If you didn t enjoy this too bad 
MAY3	Men, don’t fear the snip – it’s the best way to share the burden of birth control	My husband doesn t want a vasectomy I don t blame him it might be a minute procedure carried out under local anaesthetic but it s not exactly a spa treatment When I suggested it might be the answer to our family planning he winced and joked that he had seen what the snip did to the dog  He s not alone in his reticence there was a decline in the number of men getting the procedure in the years to But the thing is he and I have finished having babies and I feel like my turn should be over A vasectomy would feel like a feminist action on his part an acknowledgment of everything I have been through that has got us to this point in our lives 
MAY3	William Barr is acting like Trump's henchman	William Barr has shown himself to be a loyal foot soldier for the president who appointed him From his March summary of the principal conclusions of the Mueller report to his press conference on the day he released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress to his testimony on Wednesday before the Senate judiciary committee Barr s recent performances have demonstrated the extreme loyalty Donald Trump found wanting in his first attorney general Jeff Sessions  And what is good for the president is bad for America 
MAY4	A girls’ night out with the PM and her posse for £135,000? Bargain	As if Conservative donors were not resentful enough where they haven t already complied with Boris Johnson s injunction to fuck off it is now clear thanks to the Treasury secretary Liz Truss by what a prodigious margin some of them must have overpaid for a basic minister experience It s ages since a party chairman quoted as the starting price to get near David Cameron  A photograph posted on Truss s Instagram account last week showed six female cabinet members and the prime minister assembled beside a wealthy woman of Russian origin Lubov Chernukhin had gifted herself their presence in an auction at the latest Black and White Tory fundraiser for ie less than apiece for hours of proximity to Karen Bradley Northern Ireland secretary Baroness Evans leader of the Lords Caroline Nokes immigration Amber Rudd Andrea Leadsom Truss and smiling alongside Mrs C Theresa May 
MAY4	Is Line of Duty Britain’s first gender-neutral police drama?	At the time of writing there was no way of knowing how Line of Duty will unfold  Will Superintendent Ted Hastings played by Adrian Dunbar be revealed as criminal overlord H Will the antidote finally be found to stop characters saying OCG every seconds Over on Sky Arts a South Bank Show featuring writer Jed Mercurio interviewed by Melvyn Bragg looks interesting I ve long been impressed by Mercurio s penchant for stuffing his dramas full of working class talent 
MAY4	Jamie Bell and why it’s time to talk turkey about accents	By This Morning s standards its interview with Jamie Bell who stars as Bernie Taupin in the new Elton John biopic Rocketman was pretty by the book The mid morning show has after all featured women who have had sexual encounters with ghosts more than once Phillip Schofield testing a nipple clamp celebrity foot readings and a woman with a phobia of Simon Cowell so a promotional chat for a film was unlikely to be weirdest daytime TV moments ever listicle fodder  Bell came across well was enthusiastic about Rocketman and happy to talk about his career But as one tabloid pointed out viewers were left confused by his American twang Bell who is from Teesside but has lived in the US for the past or so years has picked up a bit of an accent by not living in the place he s from for pretty much half of his life and noticing when people have picked up a bit of an accent is something of a national sport 
MAY4	Thursday's results mean there's only one way forward: ask the people	Local elections are inevitably and rightly about local issues but there s no getting away from the reality that Brexit played a big part in the shocking results that began rolling in on Thursday night  Those votes make clear that a general election would not deliver a decisive victory to either side A new parliament would be just as split both on Brexit and on all the other issues that face our country as the existing one The Tories had a catastrophic night losing more than seats but Labour s support is draining away as well John McDonnell said on the evening of polling day that he expected more than gains And hours later it looks like Labour has lost almost councillors since these seats were last up for election in when we had one of the worst results in the history of our party 
MAY4	Labour’s bid for leave voters is failing. It must now look to remainers	The voters blow a big raspberry to the two main parties and both react the same way OK OK we hear you You just want us to get on with Brexit That was the line following Thursday s council elections across much of England from both the prime minister and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell although the latter was quick to clarify that when he tweeted Brexit sort it Message received that didn t strictly speaking mean he wanted Brexit to happen just that the issue needed to be sorted out whichever way So that clears that up  Reading losses for both the governing and main opposition parties as a rejection of their handling of the issue that has consumed them both has an obvious logic It s a logic likely to gain extra force in less than three weeks when Nigel Farage s Brexit party could well top the poll at the European elections Why else would voters call down a plague on both the Tory and Labour houses unless they were furious at their failure to implement what the public voted for in

MAY4	Goodbye, intrepid soldier Gavin Williamson – here are your best bits!	Straight off the bat I ll remind you that Gavin Williamson s Instagram avatar is a picture of him standing in a risk free environment in a flak jacket and we ll go from there  Everyone s favourite purchaser of Action Man toys has been sacked from the cabinet after being fingered for a leak from the National Security Council NSC The defence secretary leaking from a national security meeting is not the best look but is anybody really surprised If Williamson worked for MI he would be sure to mention it at every single party he wasn t invited to 
MAY4	Countryside versus town? Please don’t turn this into a culture war	Selina Scott is rewilding her acre farm on the edge of the North York Moors She says she reluctantly decided to control crows to protect endangered ground nesting birds including lapwing and curlew that nest on her new wetlands But the Yorkshire born broadcaster turned farmer complains she cannot save her threatened birds because her brother Robin a former editor of Sporting Gun magazine is now banned from shooting the crows that prey on helpless chicks  Town and country need each other From one flows ideas and people The other provides peace and quiet space and food
MAY4	It’s hard for us on the Israeli left – liberal antisemitism makes it worse	The New York Times apologised this week for a cartoon published recently in its international edition The drawing was of a blind Donald Trump wearing a skullcap led by the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was depicted as a dog wearing a star of David collar The cartoon evoked caricatures of evil Jews misleading blind nations of a kind popular in the German media during the Nazi era  The reaction in both the US and Israel was first shock then a furore The cartoon couldn t have come at a worse time the San Diego synagogue shooting last weekend proved that antisemitism is still deeply rooted in the US And it came just as Israel prepared to remember million Jews on the national Holocaust Remembrance Day For New York Times columnist Bret Stephens the cartoon checked so many antisemitic boxes that the only thing missing was a dollar sign The Jew in the form of a dog the small cunning Jew leading a naive American hated Trump depicted as blind and Judaised a puppet of the Jewish state as if Trump needs Netanyahu to make him act the way he does

MAY5	Saudi Arabia’s sudden interest in Sudan is not about friendship. It is about fear	In the days following the Yom Kippur war after the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat agreed to a ceasefire and subsequent peace treaty with Israel he faced questions at home about his climbdown When confronted on his capitulation he is reported to have said that he was prepared for battle with Israel but not with America On the third day of the war President Nixon had authorised Operation Nickel Grass an airlift from the United States with the purpose of replenishing Israel s military losses up to that point In November of the New York Times reported that Western ambassadors in Cairo confirm Egyptian accusations that American Galaxies were landing war equipment in the Sinai  There was something of Sadat s realpolitik in the realisation over the past few weeks that Saudi Arabia has no intention of letting Sudan s revolution achieve its objective of removing the military once and for all and installing a civilian government In the period preceding the revolution Saudi Arabia had grown relatively lethargic and jaded about Sudan a country it saw as good only for providing bodies as battle fodder for its war in Yemen When Sudan s then president Omar al Bashir fearful of his demise took his begging bowl to his allies in the region Saudi Arabia demurred But this lack of interest evaporated the moment it became clear that there was real power in Sudan s streets and Bashir was deposed 
MAY5	Don’t look to national politics for hope: you’ll find it thriving in local councils	Last Friday morning my head spun Having voted in two local elections for our town and district councils and then spent the first few hours of the next day following the results my partner and I got our polling cards for yet another contest This caused a brief fit of amusement about Brexit Britain s weird addiction to sending us to polling stations before we realised we had effectively received our tickets for an awful reality TV show  Thanks chiefly to Nigel Farage s Brexit party and the pithily named Change UK the Independent Group many of the contestants in the looming European elections form a rum old crowd From a former BBC newsreader through superannuated Tories and newspaper columnists on to the former editor of the lads magazine Loaded with the independent candidate who calls himself Tommy Robinson as the rubbish punchline God knows what the poor souls who have diligently served as MEPs must feel about this sudden gatecrashing of their world here is yet another woeful instalment of the Brexit drama now replayed by celebrity leave and remain campaigners as a pantomime of futile gestures 
MAY5	For our dedicated food readers, the dinner is in the detail	It is delicious to think that the Guardian s weekly food magazine Feast now comes along with the other Saturday supplements in a compostable bag made partly from potatoes Selection preparation presentation and consumption of food is universal Readers care about the topic and have a lot of knowledge to contribute Constructive contact is regular among readers my office and the editorial team involved in this heartily appreciated section of the Guardian and Observer  Inevitably my office may be involved when things go wrong but overwhelmingly things go right I may use corrections here to illustrate points but I write in praise of what is a skilful and sophisticated journalistic operation Thought goes into what ingredients are seasonal and sustainable Footnotes give specific fish sustainability policy for each of the UK US and Australia Expertise and practicality are prized and shared 
MAY5	Why are so many afraid to confront Britain’s historical links with the slave trade?	Seldom have so many people taken to print and the airwaves to make the case for academic incuriosity Rarely has the search for new knowledge undertaken by a university of world renown been so vocally condemned That is what happened when Cambridge University announced a new academic research project to determine the extent to which the university although not its wealthy colleges contributed to benefited from or challenged slavery and the slave trade  Cambridge and its colleges are rich Staggeringly rich And spoiler alert some of the gifts and bequests buried deep within that mountain of wealth will have come from benefactors who were slave traders and slave owners This is true of other universities here and abroad Yet the same commentators who endlessly accuse students of being closed to new ideas and unwilling to face uncomfortable facts have rushed to condemn the university s investigation into its own past Their argument in essence is that we re better off not knowing 
MAY5	A cynical Westminster fix won’t end the Brexit nightmares of May and Corbyn	British politics was designed to be idiot proof It had some simple rules that anyone could follow One of the most basic of those rules was the law of the seesaw When one of the major parties plunged the other soared A terrible day for the Tories would be a triumphant day for Labour and vice versa  This previously reliable rule is one of the many that has been unravelled by Brexit It is now possible for both the major parties and their leaders to be in crisis at the same time It is also possible for neither party to be able to agree how to extract themselves from their respective emergencies The latest evidence of this is provided by the local elections and the conflicting responses of both Tories and Labour people to results that were harrowing for each 
MAY5	Caster Semenya is a victim of rules that are confusing and unfair	Should women with naturally elevated levels of testosterone be able to compete in women s events That s the question with which athletics has been grappling over the past decade Last week the Court of Arbitration for Sport Cas international sport s highest court ruled that such athletes could be banned unless they took medication to reduce their testosterone levels  The Cas case had been brought by Caster Semenya the South African Olympic champion who after winning her stunning th consecutive m victory in Doha on Friday insisted that she would carry on racing in middle distance events but would not take testosterone reducing medication From the moment she burst on to the international stage a decade ago questions were raised about her sex Semenya is hyperandrogenic she has a much higher level of testosterone than most women 
MAY5	A girls’ night out with the PM and her posse for £135,000? Bargain	As if Conservative donors were not resentful enough where they haven t already complied with Boris Johnson s injunction to fuck off it is now clear thanks to the Treasury secretary Liz Truss by what a prodigious margin some of them must have overpaid for a basic minister experience It s ages since a party chairman quoted as the starting price to get near David Cameron  A photograph posted on Truss s Instagram account last week showed six female cabinet members and the prime minister assembled beside a wealthy woman of Russian origin Lubov Chernukhin had gifted herself their presence in an auction at the latest Black and White Tory fundraiser for ie less than apiece for hours of proximity to Karen Bradley Northern Ireland secretary Baroness Evans leader of the Lords Caroline Nokes immigration Amber Rudd Andrea Leadsom Truss and smiling alongside Mrs C Theresa May 
MAY5	Remember Orwell’s chilling warning to boot-licking propagandists...	The Labour left presumptuously claims to represent the British tradition of dissent but never tolerates dissent against its command and control politics  At the meeting of Labour s national executive committee last Tuesday to take the most recent example Diane Abbott preferred abandoning a lifetime of support for the EU to accepting a challenge to the party line 
MAY5	The infected blood inquiry reminds us we need a less painful way to deal with health failings	No one watching the heartfelt testimony of witnesses patients family members and carers at the opening sessions of the infected blood inquiry could fail to be moved The inquiry will examine how and why thousands of people were given blood infected with hepatitis and HIV in the s the harm this caused and how government then dealt with this avoidable tragedy and its consequences  However you have to ask why do we need public inquiries like this one and what do they achieve Just as importantly why do we have so many of them In healthcare alone alongside the infected blood scandal there s an inquiry into disgraced breast surgeon Ian Paterson the recent Gosport Memorial Hospital panel report and a trail of past cases too long to list in full Bristol Shipman Mid Staffs The bald truth is that most public inquiries represent a double failure First the organisations and systems that should keep people safe and deal immediately and effectively with any problems with the quality of care have failed often over many years Second the authorities that investigate complaints and problems which in health include the General Medical Council the Department of Health DoH and in some cases the police also failed 
MAY5	It was all going well until the nail polish incident...	One way to look at parenthood is as perpetual failure Taking full responsibility for the upbringing and socialisation of another human from birth through to adulthood means that at some point you are going to find you ve messed things up  Don t console yourself that cheap calories and modern medicine mean your children are vastly less likely to die than they would have been in previous generations This simply opens new realms for you to screw up and feel terrible about 
MAY6	Loss of biodiversity is just as catastrophic as climate change	A colleague recently described how fish would swim into her clothing when she was a child bathing in the ocean off the coast of Vietnam but today the fish are gone and her children find the story far fetched  Another recalled his experiences just last year in Cape Town one of the world s most attractive tourism and leisure destinations when more than million people faced the nightmare prospect of all taps in every home and business running dry 
MAY6	Sorry, Emma Thompson, but you’ll never be perfect enough to save the planet	Hold the front page Emma Thompson protester against climate change scourge of the fossil fuel industry herself takes aeroplanes There she was bold as brass in a seat about to burn through rainforests of unknown dimensions with her cross Atlantic travel on the cover of the Mail on Sunday  On some level we must have known this all along since mostly she is in the UK sometimes she is in the United States and we know although sometimes I wonder she isn t magic But still doesn t that put the old tin lid on it What s the point of it all when even people who care about the future and believe in science aren t perfect 
MAY6	Looking for comment on the royal baby? Don’t ask me	Here are some of the things that people are saying about mixed race babies at the moment websites have run stories about the viral mixed race children of Instagram who are trending because of their gorgeous blonde hair light eyes and golden skin that looks like sand White teenagers in conversations that I have both overheard and been privy to say I really want to have kids with a black guy because mixed race babies are so cute I just love their curly hair and oh my God the ones with freckles  The Kardashians who have been accused by some people of turning that particular fantasy into reality are a never ending source of related commentary Kylie Jenner is currently causing people to fall all over themselves with praise because she learned how to do her mixed race daughter s hair 
MAY6	If Labour really wants to move on, it has to back a second referendum	Since the local elections protagonists on either side of the Brexit divide have sought to marshal the poor result for Labour to advance their cause Predictably many MPs from leave supporting areas have argued that it means Labour has to deliver on the referendum result their remain supporting counterparts argue that the strong performance of the Liberal Democrats and Greens means Labour should come out unambiguously as the party of remain Here s an alternative strategy  Politics is not about two competing answers to the same question it is about which question is being asked in the first place So the core strategic insight of the Labour leadership is correct that so long as the question is Brexit the party will suffer at the polls That means Labour s primary political objective should be to change the question away from Brexit and towards domestic concerns Put simply to move on 
MAY6	I’m a Labour MP, and a second referendum was a difficult sell on the doorstep	On Thursday evening in the local elections Labour had disappointing results in some parts of the country But it was a mixed bag Amid the raging what does it mean for Brexit discussions we made gains in key marginal constituencies which on the basis of the vote share mean Labour would win bellwether seats that we need to form the next government  By contrast the Tories had one of the worst kickings from the electorate in recent memory to misquote the Liberal Democrats they were losing everywhere Their disintegration in Westminster was mirrored by their woeful performance on the ground and it s only the fear that grips the Tories and their wealthy backers of a radical redistributive Labour government that is slowing its inevitable collapse 
MAY6	Convinced this stitch-up can end the Brexit ordeal? Think again	Those who argue for a people s vote on Brexit are frequently warned that a fresh referendum would infuriate millions of voters who thought they had made their position perfectly clear in It would be idle to deny that many might indeed be affronted especially if the campaign to stay in the European Union were foolish enough to frame the argument as a rematch rather than as a completely new judgment upon the shambles of the past three years  But the anger that such a vote could conceivably trigger is as nothing compared with the democratic recoil there will be from the Labour Conservative stitch up that many at the apex of both parties now favour 
MAY6	Women dressed ‘provocatively’ are being arrested in Nigeria. The law’s still failing us	Nigerian media has been awash with news of a recent police raid in the capital Abuja in which dozens of women were arrested in and around nightclubs on charges of prostitution A city official said one way police assessed the potential guilt of the women was if they were dressed provocatively No men were arrested in the raid There was also an ominously conspicuous absence of any evidence of soliciting which is a crime under Nigerian law Most alarming of all there are witness reports of rape sexual assault and financial extortion of the women by the policemen who arrested them Some of the women were taken to a mobile court and allegedly pressured to plead guilty to charges of prostitution on the spot  Such arrests don t just disregard due process but send a clear message as to who s in charge men
MAY6	It is not up to the UK government to decide whether I’m Irish or not	The Good Friday agreement is widely revered as a model of peace and celebrated worldwide Yet the Home Office has openly disregarded the agreement and is actively seeking to undermine its very foundation I should know I have spent the past four years in legal proceedings battling the Home Office  The people of Northern Ireland are unique within the UK in that we have the birthright to identify and be accepted as Irish or British or both However contrary to the statutory duty on the Home Office to accept the birthright provisions of the Good Friday agreement it is arguing through the British courts that the people of Northern Ireland are automatically British as we were clearly born in the United Kingdom The department regularly and repeatedly forces British citizenship on Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland citizens who are Irish by birth and by choice a choice the people of this island voted for overwhelmingly in the Good Friday agreement referendum With Brexit on the horizon and EU citizens rights in the balance the situation has become urgent 
MAY6	From Spain to Turkey, the rise of the far right is a clash of cultures not civilisations	I spent part of my childhood in Ankara and part of it in Madrid Commuting between Spain and Turkey in the early s was a strange experience Spain had recently returned to democracy after years of dictatorship and Turkey had experienced yet another military coup Both countries were at the fringes of Europe neither part of the EU It was said that Europe finishes at the start of the Pyrenees but if the mountain range between France and Spain was regarded as a border another frontier was the waters of the Bosphorus It often felt as though I was travelling from one end of Europe to the other  The Spain that I experienced was vibrant welcoming and warm hearted Despite the occasional pro Franco mutterings of an older generation Spain embraced democracy How I wanted my motherland to follow suit But one day on my way to school I saw something that made me stop in my tracks All the walls down the street were plastered with posters of dead babies thrown into bins I froze The disturbing and distorted images had been distributed by an ultraconservative Catholic group that claimed family values were being attacked women had gone too far in the name of emancipation A patriarchal backlash still lurked under the surface The culture wars were under way 
MAY6	Universal basic income doesn’t work. Let’s boost the public realm instead	A study published this week sheds doubt on ambitious claims made for universal basic income UBI the scheme that would give everyone regular unconditional cash payments that are enough to live on Its advocates claim it would help to reduce poverty narrow inequalities and tackle the effects of automation on jobs and income Research conducted for Public Services International a global trade union federation reviewed for the first time practical projects that have tested different ways of distributing regular cash payments to individuals across a range of poor middle income and rich countries as well as copious literature on the topic  It could find no evidence to suggest that such a scheme could be sustained for all individuals in any country in the short medium or longer term or that this approach could achieve lasting improvements in wellbeing or equality The research confirms the importance of generous non stigmatising income support but everything turns on how much money is paid under what conditions and with what consequences for the welfare system as a whole 
MAY7	Britain needs to recognise Palestine as an independent state	Over the Bank Holiday weekend coinciding with the start of the Ramadan fast for Muslims and the run up to Israel s Independence Day it was touch and go whether the latest outbreak of violence fatalities on the border rockets fired into Israel airstrikes against the Gaza Strip would escalate into all out war Twenty five Palestinians and four Israelis was a modest death toll compared with summer when Palestinians and Israelis were killed in Operation Protective Edge  The ceasefire negotiated by Egypt and the UN should ease the punishing blockade imposed by Israel since the Islamists of Hamas took over Gaza in Millions of dollars donated by the Gulf state of Qatar will continue to pay official salaries and help needy families Palestinian fishermen will be able to operate farther out to sea Electricity and fuel supplies should be boosted 
MAY7	So Harry and Meghan want to do things differently? Fat chance of that	What a curious nation we are that thinks itself modern because a man who is sixth in line to the throne marries a woman of mixed heritage but is then expected to provide a level of gynaecological detail about her pregnancy and labour that is frankly weird  Prince Harry s goofy happiness at becoming a father is of course lovely to behold No one begrudges the man who walked behind his mother s coffin a rush of joy at the birth of his first child He is just like every other sleep deprived new dad So relatable so human and ordinary 
MAY7	No wonder transport in the north is pitiful. Money is on a one-way path to London	To live outside London and not drive a car is an exercise in resilience and stoicism In the north west of England where I live public transport exists mainly to drive people bonkers If you ve lived in London or the south east as I did for many years the effects of extreme regional inequality are plain to see as soon as you step on to a bus or train  Distances that took half an hour to cover in London can take three times as long and cost twice as much I m lucky I can afford for a single bus fare as opposed to in London Yet everyday journeys on public transport are blighted by car oriented planning deregulation and a lack of investment none of which apply in the capital If that doesn t illustrate how underinvestment reduces productivity and destroys quality of life I don t know what can 
MAY7	It’s not just Cambridge University – all of Britain benefited from slavery	Cambridge University has announced that it will finally just two centuries after the abolition of slavery and about years after the end of the British empire conduct an in depth academic study into ways in which it contributed to benefited from or challenged the Atlantic slave trade and other forms of coerced labour during the colonial era  I m not sure in depth is how I would describe an inquiry which omits all of its colleges which hold most of the wealth in Cambridge and some of which already have verified slavery connections And it is worth pointing out that while Cambridge has framed this inquiry as part of its race equality initiatives this conversation was forced on it by students activists and brave academics 
MAY7	The only Brexit is a hard-right one. Labour must back another vote	As the Labour party resumes negotiations with what can only be described as Theresa May s faction of government Labour members and voters across the country are increasingly concerned as to what any deal might look like especially as the local election results are used to justify each and every option But there is something that all of us in the Labour movement need to keep at the forefront of our minds something substantive we have learned since the Brexit referendum  While Brexit voters come from all classes and all political stripes and voted Brexit for many different reasons the people driving Brexit in the Tory party have a very specific economic agenda one that is now at the heart of these negotiations Labour is the party of social solidarity and the Tories want Brexit because they want to destroy social solidarity in Britain To all intents and purposes they want to eliminate the Labour movement 
MAY7	Something is going very wrong for vulnerable kids – but is the school to blame?	Whose fault is it that more children are being excluded from schools  Teachers parents politicians and seemingly everyone else with a passing interest in children s long term happiness have been arguing over this one for years but now a long awaited review of exclusions from the former schools minister Edward Timpson is shedding some carefully filtered light on the question 
MAY7	Young people could turn the Brexit tide – if they register to vote today	To vote in May s election you must be registered to vote be or over on May be a British Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of an EU country other than Malta and Cyprus You have to be either resident at an address in the UK and not be legally excluded from voting or be a British citizen living abroad in which case you can vote in European elections for up to years after you have left the country  If you are not already on the electoral roll you can register to vote online You may need your national insurance or passport number 
MAY7	Looking for comment on the royal baby? Don’t ask me	Here are some of the things that people are saying about mixed race babies at the moment websites have run stories about the viral mixed race children of Instagram who are trending because of their gorgeous blonde hair light eyes and golden skin that looks like sand White teenagers in conversations that I have both overheard and been privy to say I really want to have kids with a black guy because mixed race babies are so cute I just love their curly hair and oh my God the ones with freckles  The Kardashians who have been accused by some people of turning that particular fantasy into reality are a never ending source of related commentary Kylie Jenner is currently causing people to fall all over themselves with praise because she learned how to do her mixed race daughter s hair 
MAY7	Racism in political parties reflects pervasive prejudice in Brexit Britain	It s hard to avoid noticing that most of our political parties seem to be embroiled in rows over racism and prejudices Two Conservative local election candidates were suspended over racist social media posts last week and that s after a steady drip of revelations over Islamophobic comments made by members and candidates alike Labour suspended several local election candidates over antisemitic comments and is still accused of failing to tackle hundreds of complaints of antisemitism within the party Now new political parties are apparently keen to catch on Few will have had the highest expectations of Nigel Farage s latest vehicle the Brexit party or indeed of his old one Ukip But for some hopes were set higher with Change UK where one candidate for the European election resigned after sexist and racist tweets he wrote were uncovered while another did so just a day earlier having made disparaging comments about Romanian people in Another of its candidates is accused of Islamophobia though she has refuted this This is the party that was accused of racism within hours of launching in February when one of its members referred to people from black Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds BAME as being of a funny tinge although she apologised  Predictably all of this has fuelled the never ending political game of your party is more racist than my party This depressingly superficial approach feeds into a standard response pattern Assuming parties get beyond kneejerk denialism granted a big assumption since this has been at points the response from both main parties candidates or members making prejudiced comments are ejected or deselected and this process is itself held up as proof of taking racism seriously Such a response if done transparently and speedily is welcome and promotes trust in a complaints process But this approach does not get to why it keeps happening and across our political parties in the first place 
MAY7	I love swimming, but I’m sick of the sexist behaviour in British pools	A friend told me recently that of all animals I most resemble a Shetland pony In other words my physique doesn t exactly scream athlete And so when I go swimming it comes as something of a surprise to others that I am actually quite good at it  The more I swim the more I notice that a not insignificant number of men seem to take against my swimming abilities and respond with an array of irritating behaviours They push in front of me they take up the whole lane or my personal favourite they expend all of their energy on overtaking me just to prove that they can and then spend the rest of the lap swimming desperately slowly in front of me 
MAY8	Brexit has robbed Labour of its insurgency. It’s time to claw it back	The supposed iron law of British politics back when an economy dominated by Big Finance seemed to be a never ending fountain of growth and tax revenues used to go like this you had to present yourself as a steady pair of hands pro business competent exuding stability not someone to rock the hull of HMS Britain Tony Blair speaking of Margaret Thatcher once described his political formula I always thought my job was to build on some of the things she had done rather than reverse them  But whether you re a politician of left right or so called centre insurgency has become the iron law of our time Labour has been robbed of that sense of insurgency by Brexit its political fortunes depend on reclaiming it 
MAY8	Welcome to team Archie, royal baby. Here are some tips from an old hand	Well I m sure we all know why I m here don t we So let s get on with it Here is my advice for my adorable little namesake although quite honestly all he has done so far is cause me unending quantities of grief So if you ever come across this when you can read Arch in the long run an OBE would seem about right Anyway welcome to team Archie and  Be grateful it s not Archibald 
MAY8	‘Global Britain’ is doing its foreign policy on autopilot	The European elections Theresa May never intended Britain to participate in are now only two weeks away They are inevitably being fought as a proxy contest for Brexit by all the political parties The results will be interpreted as a verdict on Brexit too just as last week s English local elections have been and probably in much the same careless way  Yet it would be a stretch to pretend that for once in our recent history the UK s European elections are actually focusing on Britain s and Europe s place in the st century world The truth is far less flattering These elections can better be understood as another episode in the national and in particular Conservative trauma over the historic decline of British power of which the referendum was an interim climax The elections are therefore unlikely to be cathartic or cleansing On the contrary they are dragging us deeper into the ongoing psychodrama that was intensified by the vote in 
MAY8	Young Brits say they are having less sex. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing	Too much porn Too much screen time Too much anxiety Too little alcohol There are myriad theories about why the British are having less sex but none of them seems to offer relief  Importantly it s not because we feel we re already having enough And that s according to the Brits who took part in research between and During that period the percentage of men and women reporting that they had not had sex in the last month defined as vaginal oral or anal sex with opposite or same sex partners rose to overall from of men and of women in More than half of men and women and respectively were unhappy with the amount of sex they were having in up substantially from the unhappiness that is not the sex 
MAY8	Trump’s antics over Iran have endangered us all. The stakes are now lethally high	Such is the carnival of the Trump presidency it can be tempting especially for those outside the US to view it as spectacle a long running reality TV show that veers between The Apprentice and House of Cards But every now and then comes a reminder that for all the cartoonish absurdity of the central character the Trump administration is all too real that its actions matter and that the stakes are lethally high  A fresh and urgent reminder of that has come today with Iran s declaration that it will no longer fully comply with the nuclear deal it reached with the US and Europe in by which Tehran agreed to a year pause on its nuclear programme in return for the easing of economic sanctions In a televised address this morning exactly one year after Trump withdrew the United States from the deal Iran s president Hassan Rouhani announced a series of moves that would inch the country closer to acquiring the ability to produce nuclear weapons moves that would only be averted if Europe defied Trump and allowed Iran once again to sell its oil and have access to the international banking system For the most severe of these steps Rouhani gave the Europeans days to make up their minds either resume trade or watch Tehran resume its nuclear efforts 
MAY8	As a doctor, I say it’s time to nationalise GP surgeries	General practices support patients through every stage of their life They are the heart of their communities and the gateway to our NHS Every day around a million GP consultations take place in English practices We should rightly be very proud of our system of primary care  But it isn t perfect As data published this week shows patient demand for general practice services is increasing while the number of GPs is actually falling according to the survey one in GPs are in contact with or more patients a day which is double the safe limit At a time when people are living longer and health problems are becoming more complex the government has spectacularly failed to deliver its promise of an extra GPs Not enough medics want to be GPs and too many doctors leave general practice too early 
MAY8	Welcome to parenthood, Meghan and Harry – you’ll never get a good night’s sleep again	The Duke of Cambridge welcomed his brother to the sleep deprivation society that is parenting this week That is sweet obviously Most parents have been members of that society But do we believe that he or his brother or indeed the mothers of their children will have struggled with this like the rest of us  I ask the question because I really don t know the answer and neither do I know what honest answer I d want to hear Are we supposed to imagine that the three members of the Sussex family will now be rugged up in the same room with the parents leaping out of bed at every snuffle from their bairn 
MAY8	Why doesn’t Britain have a Huawei of its own? The answer speaks volumes	Chances are that you have learned rather a lot about Huawei That the Chinese giant is one of the world s most controversial companies That security experts those people we pay to be paranoid on our behalf warn its telecoms kit could be used by Beijing to spy on us That Theresa May was begged by cabinet colleagues to keep the firm well away from our G network yet ignored them And that one or more senior ministers were so eager to prove their concern for national security that they leaked details of their meeting thus breaching national security  So you can already guess what will happen when Donald Trump s secretary of state Mike Pompeo meets May and her foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt on Wednesday Once the pleasantries about Harry and Meghan s baby are over top of America s agenda will be to warn No of the threat Huawei poses to British privacy and to restate that Washington may retaliate by freezing London out of its intelligence network 
MAY8	Mark Zuckerberg has to go. Here are 25 reasons why	Everyone wants there to be a silver bullet A single policy solution that will fix Facebook restore our privacy and clean up the tech industry There isn t one  Hefty fines civil rights audits antitrust data privacy legislation shareholder activism and employee organizing can all play a role But we don t just need regulation we need a revolution a massive cultural shift in how we think about our personal information and the companies that profit by collecting it 
MAY8	AOC’s boyfriend is a reminder of the importance of a supportive partner	Behind every successful congresswoman is a strong bin raccoon boyfriend apparently  Over the past few days the internet seems to have become obsessed with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez s boyfriend a web developer called Riley Roberts Ocasio Cortez is pretty quiet about her private life but Roberts makes an appearance in Knock Down the House the new Netflix documentary about four women who ran in the midterm elections And though brief his appearance generated rather heated discussion 
MAY9	We’ve seen Carl Benjamin’s rank misogyny before – remember Gamergate?	For luckier people than me this week will have been the first time they ve ever heard of Carl Benjamin or Sargon of Akkad as he is better known online The fact that a Ukip candidate has been discovered to have said something hideous felt like such routine news it would hardly have registered with me if I hadn t immediately recognised the candidate in question  Benjamin or Sargon of Akkad as he is better known online tweeted in that he wouldn t even rape the Labour MP Jess Phillips He revisited the topic in a recent video on his million subscriber YouTube channel and is now being investigated by the police It s a sorry story from a candidate in the European elections but Phillips is far from the only woman Benjamin has harassed online He has built his entire platform on it 
MAY9	Baby Archie’s first race row may be a taste of things to come	A chimpanzee in a suit It s a racist caricature associated with times gone by ones we d like to imagine we had left behind in the th century a period characterised by segregation dehumanisation and well comparing black people to animals So understandably all hell broke loose on Wednesday when the BBC Radio Live presenter Danny Baker tweeted a picture of a couple with an ape descending a flight of steps captioned Royal baby leaves hospital  Baker was sacked faster than you can say racism but nonetheless claimed the tweet was misinterpreted Never occurred to me because well mind not diseased was his initial response He later clarified that he intended it to be a gag comparing the royal family to circus animals in posh clothes This defence seems like a reach to me But even if we give Baker the benefit of the doubt the incident shows that a subset of the population seems to be on a different planet when it comes to conversations around race 
MAY9	Trump’s foolish Iran policy only makes war more likely	It is unclear what if anything Iran can do to induce the United States and its regional allies to halt their escalating war of attrition before it provokes all out conflict When Donald Trump reneged on the UN ratified nuclear agreement with Tehran last year he said he wanted a better deal Iran must change its behaviour he said and act like a normal country  This was always disingenuous Iran s authoritarian and abusive rulers certainly need to mend their ways But what Trump and his imperious advisers really meant was that they must do what America says in conformity with American interests What they want is an end to years of post revolution defiance What they want is regime change in Iran 
MAY9	The navy shamed me over my sexuality. Now I’m suing it to get my medal back	I joined the Royal Navy in June a scorcher of a summer I was years old A Liverpool boy I d had an unsettled early life and it was only when I found myself living in a house share with some navy lads that I found my calling Seeing the lives they led and the pay they were getting made my life as a gas fitter seem dull by comparison  So I joined up trained hard and quickly worked my way up to the rank of lead radio operator Over nearly years I served my country during the Falklands war in Northern Ireland Syria Hong Kong Egypt and beyond I had an impeccable service record and numerous medals and badges to show for it both for conflict and good conduct I was a trusted and respected naval operator had wonderful colleagues and friends and felt blessed to be leading a life I loved 
MAY9	The Lib Dems’ ‘Bollocks to Brexit’ is crass, but it might just work	 When the general atmosphere is bad language must suffer wrote George Orwell in his famous essay Politics and the English Language just after the second world war Things are bad and our language is getting worse  The Liberal Democrats have adopted the slogan Bollocks to Brexit in their campaign for the on again never really off European elections on May This has certainly won them some attention Critics were quick to denounce what they saw as a sorry decline in standards of taste and decency James Forsyth political editor of the Spectator and a columnist for the Sun tweeted that the slogan does nothing for civility and makes the public square a less pleasant place He acknowledged there was a chance he might sound a bit prim in offering this view 
MAY9	Stop eating fish. It’s the only way to save the life in our seas	It is the most important news humanity has ever received the general collapse of life on Earth The vast international assessment of the state of nature as revealed on Monday tells us that the living planet is in a death spiral Yet it s hardly surprising that it appeared on few front pages of British newspapers Of all the varieties of media bias the deepest is the bias against relevance The more important the issue the less it is discussed  There s a reason for this Were we to become fully aware of our predicament we would demand systemic change Systemic change is highly threatening to those who own the media So they distract us with such baubles as a royal baby and a vicious dispute between neighbours about a patio I am often told we get the media we deserve We do not We get the media its billionaire owners demand 
MAY9	Becoming PM would be the easy part for a British populist such as Boris Johnson	Britain may be in the mood for a nationalist prime minister who is prepared to see minorities lose out according to an alarming poll on populism in Prospect magazine The poll mines a worrying seam of anti democratic anti civil rights instincts on the right with Conservatism moving rapidly rightwards  By to a meagre voters agree with the sentiment that a prime minister should always put the British majority first even if it means minorities lose out That might embolden Boris Johnson to make more controversial jokes about Muslim women suggests Prospect s editor Tom Clark Johnson last summer suggested that Brexit might get somewhere if it were being run by Donald Trump of whom he was increasingly admiring But he may be feeling out Trumped as he watches rowdy Nigel Farage rallies where audiences shout Lock her up about Theresa May 
MAY9	A pub with no booze will never generate the warm, jovial chaos that alcohol brings	There is a certain irresistible symbolism in a man from Burton upon Trent historic centre of British brewing opening the first alcohol free pub in Dublin one of Europe s great booze capitals We are drinking less in the UK and Ireland young people in particular and Vaughan Yates much reported Virgin Mary seems a sober sign of the times one that heralds a dire future for pubs generally  Read the pub trade press and you will find a steady drip drip of advice about how bars can woo abstinent Gen Z ers Only this week Nescaf dropped a report that recommended outdated pubs must make themselves more inviting to non drinkers spoiler they should serve better coffee But in this struggling sector where boozers a week are closing is looking at ways to draw in non drinkers an urgent priority Could more pubs follow the Virgin Mary s lead and ban alcohol 
MAY9	Want to stop Nigel Farage storming the European elections? Then vote tactically	With two weeks until the European parliamentary elections on May pollsters are predicting that no fewer than of the candidates for Nigel Farage s Brexit party will be elected and so could be taking their seats when the new parliamentary session begins on July That s more than is predicted for all the remain supporting parties put together excluding Labour which still says it wants to get a Brexit deal which is quite a feat for a man who hasn t presented a manifesto disclosed his funders or come up with any details of how a post Brexit Britain would function  There is a very simple reason for Farage s rosy prospects he is facing no resistance even though opinion poll after opinion poll shows the remain majority growing by the day At last week s local elections Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would have had you believe that people deserted them and voted in record numbers for remain supporting parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Greens because they want to leave the EU as soon as possible no matter how dire the consequences That verges on open contempt for the electorate and Trump like spin The EU elections provide an opportunity for the people of the United Kingdom to knock some sense into the heads of their political leaders 
MAY9	Pakistan: where the daily slaughter of women barely makes the news	You can find the news about Pakistan s war on women buried deep inside the metro pages of Urdu newspapers I stumbled upon it a few years ago I noticed that I could pick up my newspaper and almost every day find news about a murdered woman I thought maybe it s a coincidence maybe Karachi is a huge city these things happen But it went on and on It became so routine that I could pick up the paper open the exact same pages just like you can bet that you ll find a crossword or letters to the editor and it was always there  Names changed localities changed the relationship between the murdered and her murderer changed and of course there were minor variations on how she was killed and where the body was found but it was always there single column one and a half inches Often the woman wasn t even named she was someone s sister or mother of four or the girl who ran away with her lover or the girl who refused to marry a suitor Sometimes the news made it to the front page of the metro section but for that the murder had to be particularly gruesome or the killer had killed himself after killing the woman or the victim was very young or the murderer killed the children along with the mother That last one usually ends up on the front page if it s a slow news day 
MAY10	You don’t have to be great to hear the Tory call to greatness	You may have become aware of a worsening background hum to British public life Think of it as the clamour This is the very specific sound heard by Tory MPs reluctantly deciding that it falls to them to answer the call for a leadership bid The clamour So many separate clamours The Tory leadership field is now the size of the Grand National though unfortunately many of the runners would find themselves intellectually outclassed by a steeplechaser  In time the race will be attended by the usual ethical dilemmas Are the jumps simply too high or should Andrea Leadsom be able to clear basic questions about gay rights without the screens having to be erected For now we must simply welcome newly declared entrants into the paddock who this week include Andrea and dishonesty s Esther McVey 
MAY10	The secret to stopping Brexit: keep it simple	Here s how we can halt Brexit in its tracks Uefa the governing body of European football should announce that from now on participation in the Champions League and the Europa League will be limited to members of the European Union If Britain leaves the EU the Premier League s finest will be barred from taking part The response would be immediate support for Brexit would plummet with the plunge most visible in Liverpool Chelsea and concentrated parts of north London  All right maybe Uefa would be wary of appearing to punish the country that had just taken without precedent and in thrilling fashion all four spots in the finals of those two competitions So here s a more modest proposal Why doesn t Uefa announce that if the UK leaves the single market and thereby abandons free movement of people English clubs will be allowed to employ only a limited number of European players Say two Or one Suddenly a whole lot of onetime Brexiters would find themselves passionately making the case for a borderless Europe arguing that the young and hungry should be free to move wherever their dreams and their talent might take them 
MAY10	Sorry, Danny Baker – sometimes comedy is just off limits	When the doctor sat Danny Baker down to break the news of his cancer the broadcaster s first instinct was to defuse things with a joke Realising how much the doctor was dreading it he writes in his autobiography that he deliberately derailed the moment It may not have been that funny but it was kindly meant There is much black humour on cancer wards as there is anywhere people deal routinely with things nobody wants to think too hard about  There should be room for jokes that are inappropriate jokes that come from places so dark they make you gasp although as with all high wire acts that doesn t excuse comedians from the consequences of a mistake But the licence to offend still matters in comedy at least so long as you re punching up not down 
MAY10	Sunk by my age and weight, now I’m at the bottom of the swimming pool food chain	Round Short Female And the wrong side of middle aged to boot Try being all of those things and see what happens when you go swimming  A lively debate erupted this week after Ellie Mae O Hagan wrote about being sick of sexist behaviour by men in British swimming pools But I find that I am liable to be judged by everyone in the pool regardless of their gender As I get older and rounder it seems I have sunk to the bottom of the swimming food chain not only prey to sexist men who splash and duck but also young svelte women with no cellulite who see me as fair game Move over Granny I m coming in 
MAY10	Paddy Jackson’s revived rugby career is a backward step for feminism	The rugby team London Irish announced this week that Paddy Jackson will join their squad ahead of a return to the English premiership next season Jackson who has previously played for Ulster and represented Ireland was once famous solely for his talents as a fly half on the pitch but now is infamous for his role in a gruelling much publicised rape trial last year  The week trial in Belfast of Jackson and his three compadres was followed in acute detail Evidence presented included the complainant s bloody knickers medical opinions on vaginal tears and WhatsApp exchanges between the defendants Jackson was found not guilty of rape and not guilty of assault his then teammate Stuart Olding was found not guilty of rape Their friend Blane McIlroy was found not guilty of exposure and another friend Rory Harrison was found not guilty of concealing evidence and attempting to pervert the course of justice 
MAY10	Would Margaret Thatcher have taken the US side against Huawei? Not necessarily	Lady Thatcher may be an icon to her most devoted fans but as far as I know none of them has ever worn a What would Maggie do wristband That s not to say that they don t find themselves asking or being asked the question now and then After all Thatcher together with her eponymous ism have become lodestone and touchstone to rightwingers the world over However imperfectly remembered or understood Thatcher and Thatcherism simultaneously exert a magnetic attraction and provide a litmus test They also conjure up the Conservative party s glory days a state of ideological grace global respect and seemingly endless electoral success all of which it could enjoy again if only it were to return to the path of free economy strong state righteousness  Nowhere perhaps was her pragmatism more on display than when it came to China
MAY10	Britain loves booze. But we need to talk honestly about the harm it causes	Let s grab a pint Let s put in for another bottle of red Let s try that new craft beer Much of British life is revolves around booze It can be challenging to maintain a social life without it and even at home it s common to uncork a bottle of wine after a tough day at work Yet despite our country s ongoing love affair with alcohol nobody likes to talk about the harm that dependency on the bottle can bring  So on the rare occasion the issue is addressed we should take note A new survey has found that one in five people in England have been harmed by others drinking alcohol over the past year The survey which spoke to over s reported a range of less serious complaints from being kept awake to feeling anxious about a person s behaviour at a social occasion But nearly one in people reported experiencing aggression being physically threatened or hurt or being pressured into something sexual 
MAY10	It’s time for Labour to experiment with new drug policies	Well done Denver voting to decriminalise magic mushrooms is an act of common sense even if this brave step was somewhat sullied by simultaneously voting down a pro homeless initiative It doesn t mean the local Walmart is going to start flogging shrooms on two for one offers it just means that the police must deprioritise to the greatest extent possible any criminal penalties for Denver residents possessing or using the hippie drug of choice It could be a life changing move for some growing research suggests it can help treat mental distress such as depression and anxiety  Denver s move is just the latest outbreak of common sense on drugs how depressing then that Britain remains so backward on the issue That is mostly the fault I m sorry to say of the Labour party You d expect the Tories to take a punitive snub the evidence approach even though before assuming the Tory leadership David Cameron accepted that drugs policy was a failure But where is the leadership from Labour The so called war on drugs is a catastrophic failure and it hurts many vulnerable people Labour was founded to represent Drugs should be treated as a public health issue not a part of the criminal system 
MAY10	I’m fasting in protest outside Royal Windsor Horse Show to save my father in Bahrain	This week the British royal family is rolling out the red carpet to greet hundreds of guests from around the world at the annual Royal Windsor Horse Show which began on Wednesday and continues until Sunday It is a major part of the royal calendar with the Queen in attendance Among the most enthusiastic of the show s regular guests is King Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa of Bahrain who is invited every year to enjoy the opulent equestrian festivities and his sons  Hamad enjoys friendly relations with the Queen In he gifted her two prized Arabian horses from his royal stables In the Queen returned the gesture presenting him with a horse from her own stables Hamad even has an event at the show Saturday s King s Cup named after him 
MAY10	By all means keep the Queen, but can we have our land back?	A new royal baby like any other piece of news about the royals brings up the old republicanism v monarchism argument This is as it should be because having a royal family in is deeply weird and whenever they rise to the front of the public consciousness it s always worth asking what on earth we are doing keeping this embarrassing feudal anachronism around Even monarchists tend to have the good sense not to rely on medieval notions that aristocrats are somehow meaningfully superior so their arguments tend to cycle through variations on but they bring in tourism or people like them  Ultimately though monarchism knows it doesn t really need a good argument As the latest round of breathless virtually content free gossip dominating the news cycle shows plenty of people in this country just want to be weird obsessives about other people s children and they don t want anyone to interfere with their hobby 
MAY11	I learned in class, but playtime taught me a lot more	Will nobody think of the swots The news that schools in the tortuous attempts to fill children s heads with enough learning to cope with a barrage of tests have been steadily helping themselves to precious minutes of playtime has been greeted with dismay  Little ones apparently have minutes less running about time a week than they did odd years ago at secondary school it s more than an hour What iron faced killjoy madness is this Let the children lose it Let the children use it Let all the children boogie as a great man once wrote 
MAY11	Welcome to Planet Rumpole, where rank misogyny still holds sway	Following in the footsteps of Bertrand Russell Grayson Perry and Stephen Hawking this year s BBC Reith lecturer will be Jonathan Sumption QC retired supreme court judge historian chateau dweller and author with the eminent Thatcherite Keith Joseph of Equality a polemic against egalitarianism To date the choice seems to have been entirely uncontroversial   Who better asks the controller of BBC s Radio than Jonathan Sumption to take a clear hard look at the law and how it serves modern society 
MAY11	Farage, Rees-Mogg, Claire Fox... Britain is seduced by politicians who are ‘characters’	If you want to deceive the French public you pose as an intellectual In England you pose as a character Like a criminal on a witness protection programme the ham actor who plays upper class roles avoids the accountability that prevents democratic life degenerating into the feast of fools we see around us  Brexit has as much been a failure of British journalism as British politics The basic questions have not been asked You promised the electorate a trade deal with the EU should be the easiest in history You said the German car industry would force Merkel to capitulate Are you a fool or a liar or both 
MAY11	Lena Waithe: standard bearer for Met Gala’s camp celebration	New York s annual Met Gala theme Camp Notes on Fashion gave the good sport of celebrity watching the earnest air of a third year dissertation last week as people dusted off their critical theory textbooks for decorative purposes right there on the shelf pristine next to a well thumbed Shades and wondered how many paragraphs of Susan Sontag s Notes on Camp Spider Man star Zendaya had managed to commit to memory  I love the spectacle of the Metropolitan Museum of Art fundraiser at the best of times if only because giving a massive party for famous people a theme also provides spectators who are less versed in fashion s regulations a kind of rulebook by which to judge it This one was even more fun than s Punk Chaos to Couture which revealed that punk s lasting legacy had in fact been a handful of studs and a heavier eyeliner than usual If there s one topic I enjoy more than toast dogs or pretentious TV dramas that will never get close to an audience size that would justify the budget it s camp so the fallout has been a feast of riches 
MAY11	The missing ingredient in today’s debates? Generosity	In the early s a white student who had seen Malcolm X speak at her college went to the Nation of Islam restaurant in New York to challenge him on his philosophy Don t you believe there are any good white people he recalled her asking in his autobiography I didn t want to hurt her feelings he wrote I told her People s deeds I believe in Miss not their words   What can I do she exclaimed Nothing Malcolm X said and she burst out crying and ran out and up Lenox Avenue and caught a taxi He would later say of that encounter I regret that I told her she could do nothing I wish now that I knew her name or where I could telephone her 
MAY11	You don’t have to be great to hear the Tory call to greatness	You may have become aware of a worsening background hum to British public life Think of it as the clamour This is the very specific sound heard by Tory MPs reluctantly deciding that it falls to them to answer the call for a leadership bid The clamour So many separate clamours The Tory leadership field is now the size of the Grand National though unfortunately many of the runners would find themselves intellectually outclassed by a steeplechaser  In time the race will be attended by the usual ethical dilemmas Are the jumps simply too high or should Andrea Leadsom be able to clear basic questions about gay rights without the screens having to be erected For now we must simply welcome newly declared entrants into the paddock who this week include Andrea and dishonesty s Esther McVey 
MAY11	The secret to stopping Brexit: keep it simple	Here s how we can halt Brexit in its tracks Uefa the governing body of European football should announce that from now on participation in the Champions League and the Europa League will be limited to members of the European Union If Britain leaves the EU the Premier League s finest will be barred from taking part The response would be immediate support for Brexit would plummet with the plunge most visible in Liverpool Chelsea and concentrated parts of north London  All right maybe Uefa would be wary of appearing to punish the country that had just taken without precedent and in thrilling fashion all four spots in the finals of those two competitions So here s a more modest proposal Why doesn t Uefa announce that if the UK leaves the single market and thereby abandons free movement of people English clubs will be allowed to employ only a limited number of European players Say two Or one Suddenly a whole lot of onetime Brexiters would find themselves passionately making the case for a borderless Europe arguing that the young and hungry should be free to move wherever their dreams and their talent might take them 
MAY11	Sorry, Danny Baker – sometimes comedy is just off limits	When the doctor sat Danny Baker down to break the news of his cancer the broadcaster s first instinct was to defuse things with a joke Realising how much the doctor was dreading it he writes in his autobiography that he deliberately derailed the moment It may not have been that funny but it was kindly meant There is much black humour on cancer wards as there is anywhere people deal routinely with things nobody wants to think too hard about  There should be room for jokes that are inappropriate jokes that come from places so dark they make you gasp although as with all high wire acts that doesn t excuse comedians from the consequences of a mistake But the licence to offend still matters in comedy at least so long as you re punching up not down 
MAY11	Sunk by my age and weight, now I’m at the bottom of the swimming pool food chain	Round Short Female And the wrong side of middle aged to boot Try being all of those things and see what happens when you go swimming  A lively debate erupted this week after Ellie Mae O Hagan wrote about being sick of sexist behaviour by men in British swimming pools But I find that I am liable to be judged by everyone in the pool regardless of their gender As I get older and rounder it seems I have sunk to the bottom of the swimming food chain not only prey to sexist men who splash and duck but also young svelte women with no cellulite who see me as fair game Move over Granny I m coming in 
MAY11	Paddy Jackson’s revived rugby career is a backward step for feminism	The rugby team London Irish announced this week that Paddy Jackson will join their squad ahead of a return to the English premiership next season Jackson who has previously played for Ulster and represented Ireland was once famous solely for his talents as a fly half on the pitch but now is infamous for his role in a gruelling much publicised rape trial last year  The week trial in Belfast of Jackson and his three compadres was followed in acute detail Evidence presented included the complainant s bloody knickers medical opinions on vaginal tears and WhatsApp exchanges between the defendants Jackson was found not guilty of rape and not guilty of assault his then teammate Stuart Olding was found not guilty of rape Their friend Blane McIlroy was found not guilty of exposure and another friend Rory Harrison was found not guilty of concealing evidence and attempting to pervert the course of justice 
MAY12	Brexiteers want us to glory in isolation. Their vision is introverted and selfish	International development aid is the latest casualty in the Brexit war of words Rightwing zealots are now arguing not just for our bn aid budget to be redirected to spending at home but also for the abolition of the Department for International Development and the redefining of aid as we see fit with what s left no longer there primarily to help the world s poor but to project their own view of British nationalism on to the world stage  As if comparing overseas aid to the work of a modern Mrs Jellyby whose eyes according to Charles Dickens in Bleak House were fixed on nothing nearer than Africa while she neglected her own children at home the right now caricatures aid not only as inefficient wasteful and a way of the poor in rich countries subsidising the rich in poor countries but also as money diverted to dubious causes abroad from good causes at home the insinuation being that sending British money abroad to people who are not British is in some way unpatriotic 
MAY12	Seeing Ben Shapiro flounder might be fun, but far-right celebrities are no joke	There are broadly three ways to react to the shifting of the Overton window the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse The first and most common is to move along with it accepting new parameters and adapting to them The second is to stay put but look through the window acknowledging that things have changed while attempting to grapple with that The third is to resist the movement altogether to refuse to engage with any previously beyond the pale ideas and reject any arguments to do so  I tend to fall into the third camp an Overton window refusenik This is not fashionable and it s not easy by the very nature of the problem people who agree with you become more desensitised with each passing day There comes a point when seeing Nigel Farage on TV becomes no longer appalling but almost comforting It s old Nigel again with his familiar voice and manner and bluster and cackle an offence of white noise 
MAY12	Both Labour and the Tories have gone awol on Brexit	In her book Wilful Blindness Margaret Heffernan writes that we mostly admit the information that makes us feel great about ourselves while conveniently filtering whatever unsettles our fragile egos and most vital beliefs  In everyday life this is often an impediment to sound decision making At the apex of politics it is a psychological phenomenon that can inflict serious damage upon a nation And in the case of the Brexit crisis both main parties are now firmly in its toxic grip 
MAY12	If Labour is so committed on climate, it should recognise how the EU can help	The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has pledged to use every lever of government possible to tackle climate change And his latest idea is to go after the big players on the London Stock Exchange warning that UK companies failing to act to reduce carbon emissions will be delisted  As a green economist radical steps to address the economic drivers of our various environmental crises have been my bread and butter for years So I welcome Labour s newfound commitment to get serious on climate change though its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by can hardly be seen as treating the problem as an emergency Greens believe we must reach net zero carbon by and that such a target is achievable 
MAY12	Am I clutching at straws for wanting to have fun?	Did you see the pictures from the Met Gala in New York I mean bloody hell They were enough to discredit the whole concept of fun The theme this year was Camp Notes of Fashion which most of the photographed celebrities seem to have interpreted as meaning Daft To be fair I have no idea what my own sartorial take on Camp would have been I d probably have put on a cravat but worried it was a bit much  It wouldn t have been a bit much People turned up in the craziest togs imaginable I think what many of the celebrities were doing was trying to show they have a sense of humour which in general I welcome But the lengths they went to to show it betrayed such seriousness in the endeavour such focused and directed effort that the joke collapsed under its own weight even if the intricately engineered dresses just about managed not to 
MAY12	Ecstasy, despair and how the great game reminded us of the ties that bind	Eleven minutes into the second half as Gini Wijnaldum s header fizzed into the top corner and Liverpool took a lead in their Champions League semi final last week I just stood there motionless staring at my mate Mick Potter with bulging eyes He looked back shaking his head His dumbfounded expression said We ve seen a lot you and me but nothing like this  I ve known Mick since We have seen a lot together Heysel Hillsborough dark dark days as well as glorious times following our team As with all friendships your work your family your fate can draw you away but there s always that sinew that connects you Our team our history The things we ve done together as supporters 
MAY12	Lib Dems and Change UK must stop bickering and unite for the Euro vote	Love Nigel Farage or loathe him I rather doubt there are many Observer readers who fall into the first category the man knows how to run a campaign Only a few months into its existence his Brexit party is heading for first place and the largest vote share at the Euro elections The substantial just get on with it chunk of the electorate is massing behind him One thing this demonstrates is the potency of the simple political tune when it is played by a brassy demagogue It is a pointless expenditure of oxygen to mock the Brexit party for its lack of a manifesto To harvest a large haul of votes its frontman really need do nothing else than repeatedly cry the word betrayal from here until polling day  This presents a formidable challenge to his competitors and it is a challenge that both the Tories and Labour will fail A riven Conservative party cannot deal with resurgent Farageism because a cabal of its MPs a lot of its voters and a majority of its members are in sympathy with him It may not be entirely a joke to suggest that there will even be Tory candidates at these elections who will in the secrecy of the ballot booth put their mark against the Brexit party 
MAY12	We ignore poverty and visit ruin on the planet. But I have a plan…	Perhaps there s a reason why still too few of us pay heed to warnings about how we are killing the planet by cruel and unusual methods How can you persuade people to stop endangering other species and start protecting the environment when they don t seem concerned about torturing themselves  According to Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland almost one in four of Scotland s children are officially recognised as living in poverty one of the highest rates in Europe And unless there is a significant policy shift north and south of the border the Institute for Fiscal Studies is forecasting that more than a third of UK children will be in poverty by The charity s definition of child poverty is a reasonable one It means growing up in families without the resources to obtain the type of diet participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are the norm in st century Scotland 
MAY12	We thrive on provocation. But are we too quick to punish those who stray?	There was something shocking and absurd about Danny Baker s tweet of a photograph of a posh couple with a costumed monkey in response to the arrival of the royal baby You didn t have to be an expert in the history of racist images to recognise its implications Just last year the US comedian Roseanne Barr was sacked and her newly resurrected show pulled for a tweet in which she likened a former black adviser to Barack Obama to a child of the Muslim brotherhood planet of the apes  There was something equally absurd about Baker s defence of his tweet Never occurred to me that it was racist he tweeted because well mind not diseased I can t see racism in front of my eyes because I m not a racist is not exactly a coherent answer Nor is the implication that only a diseased mind would have recognised the racism particularly clever 
MAY12	The zeitgeist has shifted. Now the left is fizzing with ideas for a smarter economy	Our landscape is changing and this spring the pace is accelerating It s there in the mounting public recognition that the challenges society confronts are common to us all from climate change to the growth of food banks and so must require a common response marshalling common resources  It feels as if we re at an inflection point whether in the degree of support for Extinction Rebellion the cross party concern to promote social mobility or the growing acceptance that gender should be non binary 
MAY13	Jeremy Corbyn has to get off the fence for Labour to see off the Faragists	Labour remainers are in a dilemma Wherever I go I find lifelong Labour voters indeed whisper it even some elected Labour councillors and probably an occasional MP agonising over their European election vote in days time In the privacy of the polling booth no one will ever know with both Momentum leaners and non Momentumites united in the same quandary  This election is all about Europe and our place in the world nothing else not a dry run for a general election Results will have only one meaning how many voted remain and how many voted leave This will tell if all the opinion polls are right Not one has shown a leave lead for more than two years with remain solidly ahead Will that be replicated on May The number of seats won by any party will barely matter compared with the crucial total of in out votes This is our second referendum by proxy 
MAY13	Game of Thrones' 'sicansíos': not the first word to be lost in translation	Game of Thrones is known for its linguistic inventiveness The TV adaptation of George RR Martin s fantasy cycle has gone way further than the original novels ever did with linguist David J Peterson fleshing out the languages of Essos and Westeros Dothraki and Valyrian from one or two phrases into grammatically coherent conlangs or constructed languages  The latest piece of vocabulary to come out of the show has nothing to do with him however In fact it wasn t purposely designed by anyone I m tempted because of the genre we re dealing with to call it an epic fail But it s probably not as bad as leaving a Starbucks cup in shot And it s actually pretty fascinating 
MAY13	Why is Nigel Farage all over the airwaves while my party barely gets a look-in?	This morning I woke up wondering if lightning ever struck twice and hoping that it did In April as my Icelandair flight made its final descent into Heathrow a fireball engulfed the plane By the time I reached arrivals news organisations were on the phone asking for eyewitness testimonies I had little to say about my split second inside a giant firework but the platform gave me an opportunity to speak about something else What did you think when the lightning hit asked one interviewer after another My responses were the same I thought I can t die I have to vote for the Women s Equality party WE next week  The party I had co founded months earlier was in the closing stages of its first election campaigns Our biggest task as a new party was to let people know we existed WE went on to pick up more than votes Now I am fighting another campaign this time as WE s lead candidate in London for the European elections If you weren t aware of my candidacy or that we ve just published the most bold and radical manifesto of this electoral contest or that we ve just won our first seat in the local elections in Congleton don t be surprised Ofcom guidelines intended to ensure fair elections by allocating TV and radio airtime to parties according to measures such as their past performance are often misinterpreted as instructions to silence newer parties It takes a stroke of luck good or bad to get us public attention 
MAY13	It's time we stopped persecuting Britain's real strugglers: the privately educated	The plight of the privately educated in Britain is now apparently akin to the plight of Jews under Adolf Hitler s genocidal regime Stare in bafflement all you like but this was the claim splashed on the front page of the Times on Saturday of the head of Stowe School a mediocre Buckinghamshire private school who argued that questioning the disproportionate numbers of privately educated people in positions of power was akin to the conspiratorial language of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the language of Hitler and his henchmen Do you have concerns about the privileged buying their children places at the top table That those from less privileged backgrounds are drastically underrepresented in key British institutions And think widening educational access is fundamentally a good thing I m sorry to report that you are a Nazi  It is a story that future historians may regard as a fascinating insight into Britain s crumbling social order When those with wealth and power fear that their privilege is even mildly challenged they invariably clothe themselves in the garbs of victimhood The crux of the Times splash was the fear that Oxbridge was discriminating against the privately educated in favour of state school pupils constituting social engineering Let s leave aside the fact that private education is the most striking example of social engineering in our society The line of argument here is one I m long familiar with when I was at Oxford I vividly recall a private school student claiming that state school alumni such as myself only got accepted because of preferential quotas 
MAY13	Sexual abuse charities need money – but not from Tommy Robinson	On Friday women s organisations published an open letter voicing our disgust at Tommy Robinson s pledge to donate his MEP salary to victims of sexual abuse if he is elected in the north west of England We are calling on voters throughout the region to reject him  We thought long and hard about potentially giving Robinson whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon further publicity and initiating a fight that he and his thuggish friends probably want to have But we can no longer stay silent as he makes lies about the sexual abuse of girls his main campaigning and recruitment message 
MAY13	Is India the frontline in big tech’s assault on democracy?	In days time two political dramas will reach their denouement thanks to the votes of a combined total of about billion people At the heart of both will be a mess of questions about democracy in the online age and how or even if we can act to preserve it  Elections to the European parliament will begin on May and offer an illuminating test of the rightwing populism that has swept across the continent In the UK they will mark the decisive arrival of Nigel Farage s Brexit party whose packed rallies are serving notice of a politics brimming with bile and rage masterminded by people with plenty of campaigning nous The same day will see the result of the Indian election a watershed moment for the ruling Hindu nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata party or BJP Whatever the outcomes both contests will highlight something inescapable that the politics of polarisation anger and what political cliche calls fake news is going to be around for a long time to come 
MAY13	Brexiteers want us to glory in isolation. Their vision is introverted and selfish	International development aid is the latest casualty in the Brexit war of words Rightwing zealots are now arguing not just for our bn aid budget to be redirected to spending at home but also for the abolition of the Department for International Development and the redefining of aid as we see fit with what s left no longer there primarily to help the world s poor but to project their own view of British nationalism on to the world stage  As if comparing overseas aid to the work of a modern Mrs Jellyby whose eyes according to Charles Dickens in Bleak House were fixed on nothing nearer than Africa while she neglected her own children at home the right now caricatures aid not only as inefficient wasteful and a way of the poor in rich countries subsidising the rich in poor countries but also as money diverted to dubious causes abroad from good causes at home the insinuation being that sending British money abroad to people who are not British is in some way unpatriotic

MAY13	From Years and Years to Bird Box: why we turn to dystopian dramas in a crisis	In Years and Years the six part BBC drama series from the writer Russell T Davies that starts this week Daniel Russell Tovey cradles his newborn nephew and says I don t think I could have a kid in a world like this Because if it s this bad now what s it going to be like for him in years time years five years  It would be tempting to write Daniel off as a catastrophist except that as the series shifts forward in time he and his family are forced to navigate an increasingly divided country in which technology is wreaking havoc the economy is collapsing and war in Europe is bringing record numbers of refugees to British shores If you think we ve got problems now Davies seems to warn us you ain t seen nothing yet 
MAY13	If Labour is so committed on climate, it should recognise how the EU can help	The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has pledged to use every lever of government possible to tackle climate change And his latest idea is to go after the big players on the London Stock Exchange warning that UK companies failing to act to reduce carbon emissions will be delisted  As a green economist radical steps to address the economic drivers of our various environmental crises have been my bread and butter for years So I welcome Labour s newfound commitment to get serious on climate change though its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by can hardly be seen as treating the problem as an emergency Greens believe we must reach net zero carbon by and that such a target is achievable 
MAY14	Coming soon: the great universal credit deception	How to sell the unsellable How to pretend utter chaos is a plan coming together How to persuade the public who just refuse to buy it to at least keep on paying for it I believe I have found the answer  It comes in the form of an internal memo from the Department for Work and Pensions that somehow floated past my desk Published on the staff intranet just a few days ago on May it is signed by three of the department s most senior officials including the DWP s director of communications and Neil Couling its head of universal credit And it is that toxically controversial benefit which is its subject 
MAY14	Tackling inequality means addressing divisions that go way beyond income	Why are people so convinced inequality is rising in Britain even though the figures say it isn t  This is one of the great political paradoxes of our times the point where what most people would describe as common sense parts company rather confusingly with statistics The divide between haves and the have nots certainly feels as if it s got wider through the austerity years as rising numbers queue for food banks while at the other end of the spectrum FTSE chief executive pay has risen to times that of its average employee The Brexit referendum exposed deep divisions between people still relatively content with their lot and those who for whatever reason felt left behind Who really feels deep down as if society has got fairer over the last decade 
MAY14	Doris Day’s public image was the one role she could never shake off	Hollywood has always prided itself on being the place where illusion is sold as reality But no film director was ever as skilled at mining the gap between fantasy and fact as the studios PR chiefs in Hollywood s golden era imposing images on their stars that had about as much to do with the truth as pornography does with genuine sexuality Marilyn Monroe was sold as an all knowing sexual vamp when in truth she was a deeply damaged woman who was sexually abused and exploited throughout her life Kirk Douglas was styled as an all American alpha male when his name is actually Issur Danielovitch and he grew up speaking Yiddish in unimaginable poverty  Doris Day who died this week was in many ways the most interesting example of this dissonance between the public persona and often not entirely private reality Her image of the perky girl next door was both the making and eventual undoing of her career and it has proved extraordinarily tenacious in the minds of the public and critics Movie fans long ago grasped that say Judy Garland s image as the innocent sweet songbird didn t really match up with the miserable pill addled figure she already was by her mid s But it was the rare obituary of Day this week that didn t describe her somewhere as the girl next door 
MAY14	Teaming up with Nigel Farage would trash the Conservative brand	Remember Cleggmania When the Liberal Democrats look back on the election campaign of when their poll ratings hit the mark it must seem like a heady dream Their final vote share wasn t as high as some had hoped but it was enough to bring Nick Clegg s party into a coalition government and into power for the first time Look on my works ye mighty and despair  We all know what happened next and why The Lib Dems experienced electoral wipeout in as a result of allying themselves with a political party that their core voters found toxic 
MAY14	I don’t watch Game of Thrones – which makes me a lot more interesting than you	Hell is other people talking about Game of Thrones And hell I have discovered to my mounting horror is impossible to escape Thrones fever has gripped the world and people won t stop going on about the bloody show and how they can t believe that their favourite elf just got beheaded after an incestuous tryst with a one armed witch or how some dragon queen or other has suddenly shown her nasty side The fanaticism is bewildering  Admittedly this may have something to do with the fact that I have never watched the show People are constantly telling me to give it a go there are only hours of densely plotted goblin porn to catch up on but I just can t bring myself to do so The fact that I ve never seen Game of Thrones which is now on its eighth season has become an integral part of my personality Whenever I meet new people I make sure they know this very important detail about me I announce it to strangers on the internet I have it proudly listed on my LinkedIn And I drop the fact that I don t watch the overrated dragon show into conversation at every conceivable opportunity You see Game of Thrones is not just a television programme it is an Extremely Popular Thing and there is no better way to prove that you are a very interesting very intelligent person than by expressing your disdain for Extremely Popular Things Whenever too many people like something it s obvious there s something wrong with it 
MAY14	The Swedish dream was always too good to be true. And now the far right is back	Trying to define a nation s self image is always an interesting exercise especially if one tries to boil it down to a single word What would that be for Britain Independence perhaps For Sweden there can only be one word goodness We aren t looking quite as good as we would like to right now though Neo Nazis march through the streets not many but highly visible trying to influence the political scene through threats and violence  We Swedes like to believe that our politics are good for the rest of the world
MAY14	I thought I knew about my mental illness. But the truth shocked me	It s been nearly two years since I tweeted that when I was in my early s I had a breakdown and was sectioned I didn t know it at the time but that early morning post would have a profound effect on me and challenge me to re evaluate just about every area and aspect of my life I expanded on the tweet in a piece I wrote for the Guardian about my experiences and was actually pleased that I d finally told the story publicly as I d wanted to do for a long time  Psychosis affects roughly one in people every year and each case is different
MAY14	Jeremy Corbyn has to get off the fence for Labour to see off the Faragists	Labour remainers are in a dilemma Wherever I go I find lifelong Labour voters indeed whisper it even some elected Labour councillors and probably an occasional MP agonising over their European election vote in days time In the privacy of the polling booth no one will ever know with both Momentum leaners and non Momentumites united in the same quandary  This election is all about Europe and our place in the world nothing else not a dry run for a general election Results will have only one meaning how many voted remain and how many voted leave This will tell if all the opinion polls are right Not one has shown a leave lead for more than two years with remain solidly ahead Will that be replicated on May The number of seats won by any party will barely matter compared with the crucial total of in out votes This is our second referendum by proxy 
MAY14	A sex strike is not enough: women need to down tools completely	Sex is the very least of our concerns the last thing that has to be crossed off the to do list Or so I have heard from harassed women in the school playground Yet sex is the very meaning of life the cement that glues together every relationship half our culture also tells us while the remainder portrays women as a series of orifices to be penetrated  Perhaps sex is all and none of these things When people write to experts asking for help their problems inevitably boil down to I want more or less sex or of a different kind or with a different person from the one I am currently having sex with 
MAY14	Game of Thrones' 'sicansíos': not the first word to be lost in translation	Game of Thrones is known for its linguistic inventiveness The TV adaptation of George RR Martin s fantasy cycle has gone way further than the original novels ever did with linguist David J Peterson fleshing out the languages of Essos and Westeros Dothraki and Valyrian from one or two phrases into grammatically coherent conlangs or constructed languages  The latest piece of vocabulary to come out of the show has nothing to do with him however In fact it wasn t purposely designed by anyone I m tempted because of the genre we re dealing with to call it an epic fail But it s probably not as bad as leaving a Starbucks cup in shot And it s actually pretty fascinating 
MAY15	Inequality is the scourge of modern Britain. Is it finally about to be addressed?	Reports by the great and the good are ten a penny All too often they are an excuse for kicking a tricky political issue deep into the long grass Only rarely do they count for much Maybe just perhaps the review into inequality launched by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and headed by the Nobel prize winning economist Sir Angus Deaton will be one that makes a difference It has the potential to be a very big deal indeed as important in shaping the Britain of the st century as the Beveridge report was in the mid th century  Why Because Deaton is asking the same fundamental questions that William Beveridge posed almost eight decades ago in his November report Is inequality killing capitalism and if so what can be done about it 
MAY15	I’ve worked on shows like Jeremy Kyle – the real cruelty happens off screen	I ended up working on Trisha by accident The talkshow s producers contacted my university looking for graduates and I was offered an interview It was an amazing opportunity to break into television I couldn t believe my luck My wide eyed enthusiasm clouded my vision from the awful reality of what was to come I worked on the show after it switched from ITV to Channel from to  Alarm bells should have rung during training week when I was paired up with a colleague for some role play I had to imagine she was st and persuade her to wear a bikini on the show A few months later I put this training to practical use when I succeeded in convincing a real life plus sized woman to do this She walked on stage to ridicule I was told I was great at my job 
MAY15	With Bolton whispering in Trump’s ear, war with Iran is no longer unthinkable	It was a deception that would lead to millions of civilian deaths and the deaths of nearly US soldiers In August President Lyndon B Johnson solemnly declared that after two apparent North Vietnamese attacks on US navy destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin military action would take place  Four years later Senator Albert Gore father of Bill Clinton s future vice president warned in a closed Foreign Relations Committee session that If this country has been misled the consequences are very great His suspicions were correct The second Gulf of Tonkin attack might never have happened and perhaps neither did Communications to make it look like the attack occurred had been falsified But US policy was already set on a dramatic escalation of the Vietnam war and here was the perfect pretext 
MAY15	How do you retaliate against a WhatsApp attack?	We don t yet know for sure who used Israeli company NSO s software to hack WhatsApp users the messaging service s parent company Facebook has said only that the culprit is an advanced cyber actor but all signs point to it being a government According to one analysis NSO has governments as clients including amazingly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates even though officially these states don t recognise Israel  Whoever the culprit the WhatsApp attack will surely be added to a long list of state backed attacks that includes Russia s takedown of Ukraine s power grid China s persistent intellectual property thefts and North Korea s attack on Sony Pictures over the film The Interview And yes the west does it too the United States used a cyber weapon to take down Iran s nuclear programme in the so called Stuxnet attack 
MAY15	Yes, Islamophobia is a type of racism. Here’s why	On March a gunman walked into the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch New Zealand and opened fire During the course of his killing spree there and at the Linwood Islamic Centre people were slaughtered in their place of worship for no other reason than their killer had decided that their faith meant that they deserved to die  Hatred against Muslims does not begin with the sound of gunfire breaking through the peaceful calm of a place of prayer It begins with simple prejudice in our schools our workplaces and our communities More than years since the Runnymede Trust published its seminal report Islamophobia a challenge for us all it is on the rise 
MAY15	Mordaunt’s muddled amnesty won’t work – and sends a dangerous message	There will be plenty of British military veterans relieved by word that the new defence secretary Penny Mordaunt plans to introduce an amnesty on so called historical prosecutions for actions committed more than years ago which should cover offences committed during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan At first glance it looks like a welcome response to the pain described by many ex service personnel as they face multiple investigations into past events often triggering a recurrence of post traumatic stress disorder as they are forced to relive horrific experiences from long ago  Others will be pleased by what Mordaunt s move means for the soldiers of the future In this view the armed forces can t possibly do their job if in the heat of battle they are half thinking of a future day in court The argument is simple that it s wrong to ask those in uniform to risk everything for their country only to throw the book at them for it afterwards 
MAY15	If London needs a separate Trans Pride, what does that say about LGBT solidarity?	Pride in London is the one day of the year that the city feels like it belongs to LGBTQ people which was why I was so confused embarrassed and alarmed when a small group of lesbians disrupted last year s event with a protest against the inclusion of trans people Their banners read transactivism erases lesbians Pride in London quickly condemned the protests but as a lesbian and a feminist I worried that people would think these protesters represented me More than that I worried about how it all left trans people feeling  Perhaps a year later we have a clear answer Plans for the first London Trans Pride have been announced Due to take place on September the event will celebrate and centre trans and gender nonconforming people There will be daytime family friendly events such as panel discussions and zine making as well as stalls from trans charities and businesses followed later by an afterparty with trans musicians performers and DJs The idea was sparked by last year s anti trans protests say its organisers performer and promoter Finn Love and artist and activist Lucia Blake 
MAY15	The inequality review’s panel experts are all white. How equal is that?	Some years back when I was working at the New Economics Foundation as a researcher a trustee of the organisation called me I had met him briefly the day before but was still surprised to hear his voice on the line He told me he organised art events and eventually got to the point of his call by saying that a panel he had organised was a bit too stale and having met me he thought I could bring some edge to the conversation I laughed saying I didn t know anything about art and in any case wasn t available I put the phone down bemused  I am assuming by edge he meant that he needed me a brown woman from a working class background to counter his panel which was presumably all white and no doubt too male and too posh I suppose I should have been happy to be invited and while this was textbook tokenism if I d known something about the topic I might have accepted After all at the very least I was asked 
MAY15	If Theresa May resigns, we can still deliver the Brexit people voted for	Whatever side of the Brexit fence you sit on we can all agree that the last few months have been some of the most depressing and unproductive in our recent political history  The Brexit referendum was supposed to be a unique opportunity to restore faith in our democracy but instead we ve almost destroyed it As a country we ve collectively lost sight of the magnificent opportunities that Brexit could bring 
MAY15	Has the politics of climate change finally reached a tipping point?	Last week a small campaign group in the staunchly conservative town of Shrewsbury called a public meeting about climate change The organisers were delighted when people turned up Even they were surprised though when people unanimously said they were prepared to give up flying change their boilers and cars eat less meat and even overthrow capitalism to get a grip on climate change  But this was just a straw in the political wind whipping through middle England Shrewsbury joins more than other councils across the country in declaring a climate emergency and has pledged that it will be carbon neutral within years with more following every week 
MAY16	At last, Tories can begin to talk about Theresa May in the past tense	There is a small but significant distinction in politics between what is known and what is declared In recent weeks it has become ever harder to imagine how Theresa May might continue in her job if another attempt to steer Brexit through parliament fails But imagination is no longer required Resignation terms have been negotiated with the backbench Committee and made public  After a second reading of the EU withdrawal bill scheduled for the first week of June May and Sir Graham Brady will draw up a timetable for the election of a new Tory leader 
MAY16	Why is Labour just letting the Brexit party win the European elections?	The European elections are of historic importance Dangerous rightwing parties are likely to gain support led by the Brexit party We need to defeat the far right and confront the spread of racism and the threat of authoritarianism and violence We also need a serious commitment to tackling climate change and inequality  The Party of European Socialists has released a radical manifesto much influenced by Labour s general election manifesto It is calling for an end to austerity for a green transition for a feminist Europe and a Europe for the many If Labour were to take these elections seriously this could help shift the political balance in the European parliament with a transformative effect on the EU and Britain 
MAY16	Aras Amiri is Iran’s latest state-sponsored hostage. Britain must act	This week Aras Amiri from north London was convicted and sentenced in Iran to years in prison for organising Iranian cultural events in the UK for the British Council  It brought back memories of the sentencing of my wife Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe on similar charges in and the tearful weeks failing to make sense of it all Aras s case has many similarities to Nazanin s both arrested when on holiday visiting family both targeted for their links to the UK both had their jobs in London turned into cynical espionage claims 
MAY16	At last, the Labour party is being led from the bottom up	Right from the beginning the promise of Corbynism was that it would empower the grassroots In his acceptance speech on becoming Labour leader in September the MP for Islington North spoke of enabling members to better influence party policy of his desire to hear passionate debate and to make our party more inclusive more democratic and the membership better listened to in the future Let the tail wag the dog  On that basis we shouldn t be surprised by today s announcement that Momentum the youthful strong membership organisation established as an outrider for Corbyn s leadership will be campaigning for a radical and transformational new policy agenda It is nonetheless a desperately needed and inspirational injection of energy Over the summer the group will seek to organise Labour s mass membership to get motions passed in local constituency party meetings backing a green new deal including achieving zero carbon emissions by the introduction of a four day week and the abolition of all migrant detention centres 
MAY16	Alabama’s abortion ban is about keeping poor women down	A lot of good points were made about the inconsistencies and hypocrisies of Alabama s white male lawmakers who passed the anti abortion bill in the state senate this week It was pointed out that Republicans in favour of banning abortion are by and large against banning guns because by their own logic banning things doesn t work  It was observed that the life of a six week old bunch of cells is precious to these men but the life of a child born to a mother of no means in a state that voted to repeal Obamacare that notional kid not so much And while the point was made that no one who has watched a woman struggle through labour could in good conscience criminalise her disinclination to do so these arguments seemed to me bizarre premised on the notion that the men in Alabama were acting in good faith that they had the health of anyone but themselves in mind 
MAY16	Trump’s twinship with Orbán shows ‘illiberal democracy’ has a home in the US	How suited President Donald Trump and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orb n seemed as they sat together in the White House this week their heavy bodies and craggy faces projecting a brutalist power Their expensive dark suits and the elegant surroundings did nothing to hide their streetfighter natures and their air of self satisfaction at their accomplishments  No wonder Trump told Orb n in parting it s like we re twins bringing out the emotional politicking that s served him so well to build a fanatically loyal base of supporters in America 
MAY16	UK prisons are a disgrace. No wonder a Dutch court has refused to extradite	The prisons are inhumane and degrading in the words of a court in Amsterdam as it refused an extradition request The judges were referring not to a Russian penal colony but to HMP Liverpool halting the extradition of a fugitive wanted in the UK on drug smuggling charges The cause of this damning judgment is the appalling conditions in prisons such as Walton Liverpool Bedford and Birmingham  The Daily Mail may have been outraged by the judgment but it didn t surprise me I have been arguing similar extradition cases regarding prison conditions in other countries and often winning in the UK courts for years It was only a matter of time before European countries looked at our Dickensian prison system and asked the same difficult questions 
MAY16	The political landscapes of Brexit Britain and Weimar Germany are scarily similar	Enter the disturbing special exhibition that has recently opened in Berlin s German Historical Museum and you are immediately confronted with a series of bleak statements Liberal democracy cannot be taken for granted any longer Authoritarian parties are even gaining strength in countries with a long democratic tradition The public s trust in liberal democracy seems to be waning in Germany as well  The task of this outstanding museum is to tell the story of the nation s past But its new exhibition about the post first world war Weimar republic which runs until September is explicitly about both the past and the present And its scope is deliberately not confined to Germany but extended to countries such as Britain 
MAY16	Yes, Jeremy Kyle was exploitative. But it made working-class people visible	When news broke that The Jeremy Kyle show had been indefinitely suspended following the death of a guest I would have loved to have felt righteous joy Indeed the overwhelming response I saw went along the lines of good it was only ever a means for normal people to laugh at poor people While the announcement of the cancellation of ITV s daytime staple no doubt marks the end of an unsavoury year chapter in British television history I feel somewhat conflicted  I understand why the show was bad That s difficult to dispute But it was one of the few times I saw people like those I grew up with people whom you never see on television speaking with their own voices It didn t confirm my prejudices because I didn t have those prejudices to begin with I saw real human sadness need pain and people who had really got their lives in a mess 
MAY16	Tories should bear the shame that child poverty in Britain is the new normal	Child poverty is the new normal in parts of Britain That s according to findings released today by the End Child Poverty coalition a group of more than leading charities and organisations who have tracked the huge rise in child poverty since More than half of children are now living in poverty in some constituencies in the country with the fastest rises hitting the poorest areas The London borough of Tower Hamlets for example even has the majority of its infants in hardship  This is as shameful as it gets Children scavenging in bins to eat discarded apple cores for breakfast Headteachers finding their primary school pupils sleeping rough on a mattress with their parents after being evicted Forget a few extreme cases in many areas growing up in poverty is not the exception it s the rule 
MAY17	Is there a single blue-rinse Tory who doesn’t fancy a knee-trembler with Boris Johnson?	I wouldn t kiss you if you were the last man on Earth It s one of the great cliches of romance novels that any woman saying this will in due course be doing just that Maybe it ll be a hate kiss in the hayloft above the stables maybe it ll be a momentary lapse just after he s rescued her from a predatory ranch hand But you can absolutely bet on it she s going to be sharing herself with this man within pages The Tory parliamentary party s relationship with Boris Johnson is the hardcore porn version of this  For so long you couldn t move for Conservative MPs saying they d leave the party if Johnson ever became leader that they wouldn t vote for him in a million years that he didn t have a chance of getting anywhere near their special place One hundred pages deeper into the shitshow where are we on these holdouts 
MAY17	As rightwing populism spreads, bigotry against the LGBT community is growing	I spent last week in Cuba a time which overlapped with what should have been the country s th annual Conga Against Homophobia and Transphobia The march however organised by the government and the brainchild of Mariela Castro daughter of Raul was cancelled owing to new tensions in the international and regional context  This essentially translates into a fear that people taking to the streets at a time of heightened tension in the region might turn into general unrest But there is also the unmentioned fact that religious communities in Cuba are increasingly pushing back against the otherwise repressive state s attempts to improve LGBT rights Earlier in the year proposed changes to the constitution to allow same sex marriages were scrapped after pressure from evangelical churches and sections of the population A spontaneous civilian organised march to replace the cancelled conga resulted in multiple arrests 
MAY17	Remain voters are left with no choice but to ignore Labour next week	Shall we take a nostalgic trip back to the distant past of two weeks ago You ll remember there were local elections in England in which the pro Brexit parties took a pasting while the anti Brexit parties surged You might also recall how the main parties interpreted those results they hailed them as a heartfelt plea from the voters to get on with Brexit  Here then is a warning to remain minded voters ahead of Thursday s European elections If you want to send a message about Brexit you ll need to send it as clearly and as unambiguously as possible Up against a spin machine capable of hearing a repudiation as an endorsement voters will need to be louder and clearer this time closing down the scope for wilful misinterpretation 
MAY17	Trump's 'deal of the century' hasn't a hope of bringing peace	Here in Jerusalem we await publication of Donald Trump s deal of the century which is expected to be released in the coming weeks The US president has promised it will bring an end to a century long conflict between Israelis and our Palestinian neighbours  But the Trump administration s vision for peace looks doomed only to further entrench the occupation as a recent remark from Jason Greenblatt Trump s Middle East peace envoy demonstrated 
MAY17	Talks between Labour and the Tories on Brexit have broken down. So what next?	The news that the Brexit talks between the government and opposition have broken up without agreement comes as little surprise In the age of Brexit politics appears to have found a new form arriving at an obvious conclusion as slowly as possible thereby extending the misery for everyone Labour memorably described the process as akin to negotiating with a company going into administration given the prime minister s stated intention to leave office before the future relationship with the EU is agreed With Theresa May s departure confirmed for June the talks were plainly pointless  Taking the blame for a disastrous result in the European elections is the only thing holding May in place as prime minister
MAY17	In Northern Ireland, our hearts break for Alabama: we know about abortion bans	It feels like a lifetime ago since May In many ways it was because that day when the Republic of Ireland voted to repeal the eighth amendment of its constitution which outlawed abortion in virtually every circumstance was a unique step forward for abortion rights in a world where they are rapidly being dismantled  While the legislation brought in after the Irish referendum is imperfect the overall success of the repeal movement against so many obstacles gave campaigners across the world an incredible sense of hope But one year on global abortion rights are under increasing threat and that moment in May feels like an exception instead of a promise of what was to come 
MAY17	Change UK was always doomed to failure, and Joan Ryan just showed why	Fawlty Towers Alan Partridge The Office finally the great British tradition of it s so awkward you want to look away but you can t comedy has a new addition and it s called Change UK The critics may argue that this iteration lays the cringe factor on a little too thick however When Change UK s Joan Ryan asked her audience in Bath to look at your hands please followed by that s it it s there that s the answer to this it s in your hands in what can only be described as panicked primary school teacher meets David Brent s infamous motivational speech the horror was compounded by the fact she d clearly done this before and that the audience clapped Is this a political party or is it performance art  The tragicomedy of Change UK is principally one of hubris You can see to be fair why they thought success might beckon There is a rich seam of sympathy for their brand of politics within the British media and there s no doubt that many remain voters feel disillusioned angry even about Labour s Brexit triangulation But the principal flaw in their plan was this former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie believe that being a Blairite means automatically inheriting a political elixir from s Tony Blair of electoral success and generally being very good at politics 
MAY17	‘Historians’ like Jacob Rees-Mogg only have one character in mind: themselves	 History will be kind to me for I intend to write it Winston Churchill is widely and wrongly believed to have said He said something similar though and it s a notion that has been enthusiastically taken up by the politicians of today  For the most part they do so in their well indexed mostly unread and soon remaindered memoirs all of which bear the invisible subtitle I Told You I Was Right We can confidently expect David Cameron s For the Record whose publication has been announced for September to be such a one But the craftier among them those for whom naked self justification would look a bit well naked turn instead to writing proper books You know substantial works of history that show off their hinterland their intellectual range their bottom and which also invite the reader to draw flattering parallels with the career of the author These are the fancy book length equivalents you could say of Mark Francois yapping interventions on what we can learn about Brexit from the second world war 
MAY17	If you didn’t desert Labour over the Iraq war, why give up on it over Brexit?	In I accompanied Tony Benn for a short while on his lecture tour around Britain watching him speak to packed auditoriums and outselling the magician Paul Daniels in Cornwall by three to one It was a peculiar time that in many ways presaged the moment in which we find ourselves now  A year earlier Labour had just been returned with a huge majority and the steepest slump in postwar voter turnout to date A BBC survey Beyond The Soundbite prompted by concern about that decline in participation found that while voters were neither de politicised nor uninterested they were disillusioned and disconnected When asked to finish the statement I would get more involved if more than a third of respondents ticked either I thought my contributions made a difference or I thought anyone would listen And that was before the Iraq war 
MAY17	Cruel and chaotic? No, in the DWP’s fantasy land, universal credit is a huge success	Come with me on an eerie visit where we step through the looking glass into an alternative universe where everything is as good as can be You will like it here Everyone smiles they only want to help their clients fulfil themselves nothing bad ever happens here They love their work This little utopia is the Middlesbrough jobcentre As everywhere they are rolling out universal credit to new claimants or existing clients with any change of circumstance Here they prompt unemployed or underemployed people into work or more work telling them how many jobs to apply for what appointments and courses to take and whisper it with what penalties if they fail But that s very very rare  It has taken me all of seven months applying to the Department for Work and Pensions to get here my requests ignored forgotten or parked despite regular prodding Pre I often sat in with jobcentre staff but since then in department after department visiting any frontline is tortuous With HMRC eight years of requests to visit minimum wage inspectors has yielded nothing though they have never been outright refused 
MAY18	When the far right crack rape jokes, it’s part of a systemic bid to demean	When a clever woman threatens a man who demands submissiveness he can suggest that she s only interested in screwing him If that doesn t work he can silence her by threatening to rape her or by sneering that she s not worth raping anyway And when the woman protests he can smirk and say Can t you take a joke love  I m only trying to normalise comedy explained Ukip s Carl Benjamin after he told Labour s Jess Phillips I wouldn t even rape you and added I suppose with enough pressure I might cave but let s be honest nobody s got that much beer The famous British sense of humour which intrigues so many foreigners will doubtless have left tears of mirth streaming down your cheeks 
MAY18	From Alabama to Armagh, women are on the front line waging the ‘war on abortion’	Intensifying campaigns to criminalise all abortion in the US have been summarised accurately as a war on women one that calls on women to as the presidential contender Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has put it fight like hell  In terms of knowing the enemy much of it in the US will certainly resemble the Alabama misogynists the white male no longer young Republicans who have just stripped half their state s population of reproductive rights Photographs have been generously distributed But as the men would probably be the first to admit they couldn t have ushered in a generation or more of unwanted children without assistance from at least two women combatants Terri Collins and the state governor Kay Ivey 
MAY18	Is the idea of ‘real women’ just another way of selling stuff?	 Mirror mirror on the wall I don t see anyone like me at all is the message on the cover of the current edition of Stylist the women s free weekly magazine much garlanded with awards  Editor in chief Lisa Smosarski is a feminist who smartly uses the magazine to find imaginative ways to proselytise that while readers may face private and individual challenges many more of their difficulties are rooted in the public and systemic low pay discrimination and last week what she calls the mental health crisis triggered by a ubiquitous and fetishised very white very thin very doctored vision of female beauty 
MAY18	Barry Manilow: glad to be gay, without trying to sell something	It can feel like a glitch in the fabric of the universe to be reminded that Barry Manilow only publicly came out as gay in  Manilow was when he did the big reveal with People magazine My untold story and had been with his long term partner and recent husband for years Coming out is different for every single person who has to do it and every person finds their own path when Manilow came out it was greeted largely as a bit funny that anyone might have not known that already 
MAY18	The selfish case for saving bees: it’s how to save ourselves	When I see a bee buzzing around my garden or in the park in early spring I get a real thrill from being able to identify her If she is black and darting among small white tubular flowers with her long tongue protruding and her legs tucked under her furry round body I know she is a hairy footed flower bee  A few years ago I wouldn t have noticed her because like most people I thought all bees were striped I also assumed they made honey stung and lived in a hive with a queen bee and her workers But only honeybees fit this description and they account for just a handful or so of the astonishing bee species worldwide Bumblebees the plump stripy garden visitors that have been voted the UK s favourite insect make up about The vast majority like the hairy footed flower bee come in many different colours don t make honey and live alone These solitary bees are often named according to how they construct their nests from plasterer bees which line their nest with a waterproof substance to mining bees which excavate elaborate underground burrows and leafcutter bees which plug the entrance with small discs of leaves cut from rose bushes 
MAY18	It shouldn’t be left to women to fight alone for abortion rights	No woman can be free who does not control her own body That s been the pro choice mantra down the ages no less true now than it ever was and from it flows the equally fierce conviction that men should keep their noses out of reproductive rights If it isn t your womb your life on the line here then what right do you have to interfere in a grown adult s decision No wonder that powerful image of the male politicians who collectively approved Alabama s cruel new ban on terminations beyond six weeks struck such a chord The sight of old men desperately clawing back their lost power over women s lives still triggers a deep visceral fear Six weeks That s barely a missed period a time when many women won t even have realised they re pregnant  True America s pro life movement has plenty of prominent women in it and in the UK it s a female leader of the pro life Democratic Unionist party who thanks to her sensitive role propping up the British government s parliamentary majority represents one of the biggest stumbling blocks to rolling out abortion rights in Northern Ireland But such nuances get forgotten in the face of men doggedly arguing on Twitter that forcing victims of incest to continue their pregnancies would at least preserve the criminal evidence or refusing to let their cluelessness about female biology get in the way of a terrible opinion 
MAY18	Is there a single blue-rinse Tory who doesn’t fancy a knee-trembler with Boris Johnson?	I wouldn t kiss you if you were the last man on Earth It s one of the great cliches of romance novels that any woman saying this will in due course be doing just that Maybe it ll be a hate kiss in the hayloft above the stables maybe it ll be a momentary lapse just after he s rescued her from a predatory ranch hand But you can absolutely bet on it she s going to be sharing herself with this man within pages The Tory parliamentary party s relationship with Boris Johnson is the hardcore porn version of this  For so long you couldn t move for Conservative MPs saying they d leave the party if Johnson ever became leader that they wouldn t vote for him in a million years that he didn t have a chance of getting anywhere near their special place One hundred pages deeper into the shitshow where are we on these holdouts

MAY18	I’ve seen how lawyers’ sexism corrupts justice. This is how to change the industry	Surprise surprise bullying and sexual harassment is rife in the legal profession Yet another report this time from the International Bar Association shows that of female lawyers have been bullied in the UK which is higher than the international average and of women have suffered sexual harassment  The findings accord with the Bar Standards Board BSB report in which found that two in five respondents suffered sexual harassment and discrimination and only one in five reported it 
MAY19	If I were Jeremy Corbyn I’d be praying for a Boris Johnson victory	 This isn t a TV reality contest So declared defence minister Tobias Ellwood when asked by Sky News Sophy Ridge about the forthcoming Conservative leadership race To which there is only one honest response that s precisely what it is Even as the new Brexit deadline draws closer the Labour Tory talks collapse the Commons prepares to reject Theresa May s withdrawal agreement for the fourth time and the Conservatives face disaster in Thursday s European elections senior contenders for the top job merrily parade themselves their spouses and their kitchens in a grotesque bid for support in a contest that has not yet officially begun  They can t run the country pass the legislation it needs or arrange its departure from the European Union But they ll do a mean photoshoot for you at the drop of a hat To govern is indeed to choose 
MAY19	It’s not difficult to define Islamophobia. So why does Britain struggle with it so much?	Last week it became clear that according to senior police the Tories and some non Muslim public figures with some Muslim friends the term Islamophobia is undefinable in any meaningful actionable way The working definition put forward by the all party parliamentary group on British Muslims is not legally binding yet Martin Hewitt chair of the National Police Chiefs Council said it was too broad as currently drafted could cause confusion for officers enforcing it and could be used to challenge legitimate free speech on the historical or theological actions of Islamic states This is either ignorant or consciously misleading There is no legal implication in the definition whatsoever  Last week the government also rejected the definition which in full reads Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness The communities secretary James Brokenshire said that accepting the definition had potential consequences for freedom of speech and that the combination of race and religion would cause legal and practical issues Already adopted by Labour and the Liberal Democrats the definition was turned down because it needed further consideration So just how much more information will it take for ministers to consider such a short single sentence 
MAY19	Why the senators’ race matters in reporting the Alabama abortion ban	Why demanded several readers does this headline refer to race These Republicans all white men just voted to ban abortion in Alabama It was part of the Guardian s coverage of the southern US state s new measure The sole exception to the ban is serious risk to the health of the woman pregnancies resulting from incest or rape are not excepted Of the Republican men in Alabama s seat senate voted for the law  Distilled the readers view was that although it was understandable that the headline would emphasise male dominance it was wrong to highlight race too Wrote one It detracts and distracts from the real outrage which is that they re all male and they re all Republican rather than their skin colour Another reader thought that the reference to race implied that the votes were motivated by racism Another wanted the emphasis to stay on the personal moral beliefs of the legislators whichever way they voted 
MAY19	There should be nothing wrong in waving Palestinian flags at Eurovision	There were loud boos in the Tel Aviv Expo Centre on Saturday night and not just when it was announced that voters in Greece and Cyprus had once again awarded each other the full Eurovision song contest points in their annual display of allegiance When Hatari the Icelandic entrants waved Palestinian scarves solemnly to the cameras as their results rolled in my fellow audience members in the Israeli city made their dissatisfaction clear It was the first time those assembled in the room were confronted with the controversy that had surrounded Israel hosting the event and many just didn t like it  The European Broadcasting Union EBU which organises the contest sent out the statement This directly contradicts the rules the consequences of this action will be discussed 
MAY19	Why is Brussels so white? The EU’s race problem that no one talks about	With days to go until the polls open for the European parliament elections most political parties are finding it a struggle to convey the relevance of the EU to voters in voter turnout was just Eurosceptics from Nigel Farage to Matteo Salvini Marine Le Pen to Alternative f r Deutschland s Alexander Gauland have been united in their criticism of the Brussels elite  They focus on the unelected bureaucrats running the EU institutions Yet there s an elite they don t notice and of which they are members The EU s institutions and its parliamentary seats are all but closed to people who aren t white 
MAY19	When working-class lives can be so rich, why does reality TV choose to belittle them?	The trouble with having very little is the perception that you can be easily bought Many participants on The Jeremy Kyle Show on being asked why they went on said that they had never stayed in a hotel before The seductive triad of an all expenses paid trip free booze and minutes of fame is a far cry from an everyday life that is scarcely examined  Over the past week my inbox has been packed with horror stories about the machinations of The Jeremy Kyle Show with claims that members of the production team infiltrated step programmes transgender support groups and other havens for various fragments of vulnerability The emerging pattern from these stories is this one member joins the group to identify potential guests and gains their trust Time passes usually a few weeks and they offer a solution to their conflicts internal or external The show was rarely mentioned until a few days before filming the accounts suggest If true in any other level of society we would see this for what it is grooming and manipulation All in the name of the am entertainment slot 
MAY19	The middle ground no longer exists over Brexit. It’s all or nothing now	The collapse of the Tory Labour Brexit talks surprised Westminster as much as did the news that bears conduct their ablutions in forested areas and Boris Johnson is interested in becoming prime minister A question worth investigating because it illuminates where we are now how we got here and where we are heading is whether that failure was inevitable Was this bizarre and ultimately fruitless chapter of the Brexit saga never anything but a protracted charade Was the inability to broker a compromise always written in the stars Or could different actors have found a way to release Britain from its long national nightmare  Many believe that these talks the last resort of an enfeebled prime minister were fated to fail One senior figure involved in the six weeks of negotiations speaks as if describing a doomed relationship It was always going to end this way 
MAY19	What is Nigel Farage’s secret? That would be telling	 It was one of those things they keep in a jar in the tent of a sideshow on the outskirts of a little drowsy town One of those pale things drifting in alcohol plasma forever dreaming and circling with its peeled dead eyes staring out at you and never seeing you Ray Bradbury The Jar Weird Tales November  Last Friday morning in a packed working men s club in the Leave voting North Yorkshire moorland town of Blackleg Wang I heard the chants of Ni gel Ni gel Ni gel die away as Nigel Farage took the stage at his latest Brexit party rally I was shocked It was a long time since I had seen a politician who was actually popular with anyone 
MAY19	China wants us to forget the horrors of Tiananmen as it rewrites its history	Remembering the deaths of June is no neutral task It is a civic duty a burden and an act of resistance in countering a state level lie that risks spreading far beyond China s borders  On that day the Communist party sent tanks to clear protesters from Tiananmen Square in the centre of Beijing killing hundreds of people maybe more than a thousand In the intervening years China has systematically erased the evidence and memory of this violent suppression using its increasingly hi tech apparatus of censorship and control 
MAY19	The Brexit party reflects our hollowed-out, tired politics	Will British politics be upended in the European elections on Thursday Certainly the traditional faultlines may be recast at least for this election  The Brexit party will no doubt emerge triumphant the Tories crushed Labour humiliated and the Greens and the Lib Dems will make sufficient gains to claim a modicum of success Whatever the results they will leave untouched the fundamental problems that have created the chasm between large sections of the electorate and mainstream parties 
MAY20	Boris Johnson in No 10 will be a fitting finale to this dark decade	Armageddon awaits Boris Johnson is heading for No and there is nothing dishonest disreputable or even scandalous enough that he can do to stop his party choosing him now They know of his lies laziness and narcissism but they don t care After a crushing humiliation at the polls in Thursday s EU election where the Tory vote may fall to single figures this drowning party will clutch for the straw headed showman to save them from triumphant Faragists Well Prime Minister Johnson would provide a fitting finale to this ever darkening decade  A measure of the demented state of the Conservatives is the number of hats in the ring for this most poisonously impossible job Who would want to lead a paralysed government with no majority and a party that is a nest of vipers Anyone applying should be disqualified on grounds of diminished responsibility 
MAY20	Why I’m sitting in a box blocking the entrance to BP’s headquarters	The container I m currently inhabiting has everything I need to keep going for quite a while so I don t want to sound too self pitying but it is nevertheless a box It s got a chemical toilet an internet connection and heavy bolts to fasten it to the pavement and it s blocking the entrance to BP s London headquarters As a consequence BP s HQ is empty  As I sit here some of BP s executives are at home enjoying an unexpected break Some are at BP s AGM which has been moved to Aberdeen this year in the hope that it would make a climate protest more difficult 
MAY20	Trump Baby is back – and this time it’s more than just a balloon	 The greatest insult to a sitting US president ever It s not often that I turn to the words of Nigel Farage to seek confirmation I might be involved in doing something right but last July was different  It was a few days before Donald Trump was due to touch down for his first visit to British shores since his election to office And things weren t quite going to plan Britain was in thrall to the story of whether a ft high bright orange helium balloon would be given permission to soar above Parliament Square in central London Trump Baby had arrived 
MAY20	Google’s Huawei ban is good news: tech giants shouldn’t always get their way	The post digital revolution starts here Thank you Donald Trump The US president s decision to blacklist Huawei which has led to Google ending collaborating with the company may have the worst of motives It could have the best of consequences  So far global government has proved impotent in forcing the grand monopolies of the digital age to adhere to any regulation They have gone where they like gobbled up competitors as they choose and paid taxes or none as the whim takes them The only rivalry has been in physical products such as smartphones but they are just shells for conveying monopoly power round the world 
MAY20	Safer air for the kids? Grow more houseplants	When was it maybe two weeks ago I was just about clinging on to sanity s rigging amid the daily tempest of trauma that has become my family s morning routine My year old was fuming loudly because I hadn t bought her any croissants what have we become the dog was expressing his fear anxiety about the postman my husband was losing his shit at the toast he had just burned my year old was punting a rugby ball through the kitchen air the tinny hi hats of the latest indistinguishable mumble rap track playing on his portable speakers and John Humphrys had the hump about something  On this occasion it was the air quality in inner city classrooms which to be fair is a legitimate thing to grump on about even if it was with that tone of pantomime incredulity he employs NB what follows is a very vague estimation of a memory that is most likely wrong in the first place Surely there s something we can do to improve the air our children are breathing harrumphs Humph Plants I suggest to the radio Well yes there are things we can do says the air quality expert Plants I say again I m certain she s going to say plants We can fit classrooms with air purifiers that mechanically remove more than of air contaminants And plants surely Very interesting says Humph content no further investigation is required And that s that 
MAY20	Brexit has torn Britain in half. Only Labour can bridge that divide	The European elections have polarised the Brexit debate into two camps those who want to remain and discard the verdict of the referendum and those who want a clean or no deal Brexit Labour is urged to pick a side in this ongoing tug of war That is a dead end for the party and for a very divided country  The pollster Peter Kellner argues that Labour must come out unambiguously for remain His reasoning is that two thirds of Labour voters backed remain in that a greater proportion of Tory leave voters are now backing Nigel Farage s Brexit party and that there is a migration of Labour remain voters to the Liberal Democrats 
MAY20	London is still the UK’s golden goose – and that needs to change	London could be justified in feeling a little unappreciated right now Britons outside the capital think of its residents as arrogant and insular an investigation by the Centre for London has found London itself is seen as expensive and crowded Pride in the capital decreases with distance from it and appears to be declining over time And while over three quarters of Brits agree that London contributes to the national economy just feel it contributes to the economy where they live  There is a long held and persistent sense that London is too dominant in national life Some also perceive its success as coming at the expense of the rest of the country an idea that has re emerged periodically throughout history most famously in the s when parliamentarian William Cobbett described the capital as a Great Wen a gigantic cyst draining the life out of the rest of the nation 
MAY20	The Tories have forgotten their pro-EU voters. And they’ll pay for it	In a seemingly endless season of Tory nightmares this week looks set to mark the most dreadful phase so far The Conservatives are about to endure a set of elections that they never thought they would face Only four years ago the party won a general election now there is talk of them finishing fifth or even sixth With every Tory moan of pain Nigel Farage s nicotine grin grows ever larger And out in the country there is an overlooked Conservative crisis one bound up not with the part of the population that voted for Brexit but with the liberal pro remain swathe of the country without whom the future of Conservatism looks bleak indeed  I come from somewhere still understood as one of the most Tory places there is Wilmslow in Cheshire has a population of and is a dormitory town on the southern edge of the sprawl around Manchester Part of the Tatton constituency it was once represented by George Osborne and these days is the adopted home of the zealous Brexiteer Esther McVey Though slightly more mixed class wise than its reputation might suggest it remains a byword for suburban affluence and McVey sits on a majority of But in the referendum of Wilmslow was part of a wider Tory supporting area that voted for remain 
MAY20	If I were Jeremy Corbyn I’d be praying for a Boris Johnson victory	 This isn t a TV reality contest So declared defence minister Tobias Ellwood when asked by Sky News Sophy Ridge about the forthcoming Conservative leadership race To which there is only one honest response that s precisely what it is Even as the new Brexit deadline draws closer the Labour Tory talks collapse the Commons prepares to reject Theresa May s withdrawal agreement for the fourth time and the Conservatives face disaster in Thursday s European elections senior contenders for the top job merrily parade themselves their spouses and their kitchens in a grotesque bid for support in a contest that has not yet officially begun  They can t run the country pass the legislation it needs or arrange its departure from the European Union But they ll do a mean photoshoot for you at the drop of a hat To govern is indeed to choose 
MAY20	Why the Led by Donkeys billboards won’t change anyone’s mind on Brexit	When Ann Widdecombe was unveiled as the Brexit party s surprise European election candidate the tactical aim was clear show Conservative voters that switching their vote to Nigel Farage s new outfit made so much sense that even former ministers were happy to do so Widdecombe s name recognition is still high even in semi retirement and the move is embarrassing for a Conservative party struggling to fight an election it never wanted  The anti Brexit campaign group Led By Donkeys responded by posting billboards featuring Widdecombe s face the quote homosexual acts are wrongful in giant letters and was headlined Target gay people The aim was to warn voters of Widdecombe s hardline beliefs and by extension the views of the new party s potential MEPs And there was a small disclaimer at the bottom attempting to contextualise the comments 
MAY21	May's offer was neither 'new' nor bold. It will be her final failure	In a last ditch attempt to get her deal through parliament Theresa May has presented a supposedly fresh point plan to break the deadlock On closer examination the changes are at best slight and at worst set to lose her more support than they gain May once attempted a similar manoeuvre over supposedly legally binding changes to the backstop This afternoon was a last hurrah that is set to fail precisely because what she has offered is substantially no different to her three previous attempts to get a withdrawal bill passed Nothing has changed  The most eye catching announcement was that MPs would be offered a parliamentary vote on a second referendum if they supported the bill at its second reading But most pro referendum MPs have concluded that the best chance of getting a majority for a second national vote would be in October in the face of a fresh Tory leader genuinely willing to crash out of the EU with no deal They know that without brinkmanship the numbers simply aren t there So May s offer won t wash 
MAY21	This Milkshake Spring isn’t political violence – it’s political theatre	What a lot of crying over a spilt milkshake Since broadcaster and sometime politician Nigel Farage got covered in sticky banana and salted caramel in Newcastle on Monday the air has been thick with condemnation   Normal campaigning is becoming impossible tweeted the far right leader before pleading for civilised democracy a new tune from a man who warned that unless he gets his precise flavour of Brexit he would don khaki pick up a rifle and head for the frontlines The dousing was horrible and ridiculous said Tony Blair famed for his excellent judgment on weapon threats And so the professionally outraged have taken to social media and TV studio sofas bemoaning the debasement of our politics and whatever else they can squeeze into their allotted two and a half minutes 
MAY21	Want to stop Johnson? More Tories should follow Heseltine and join the resistance	Michael Heseltine knows how to make a grand exit The man who famously got himself suspended from parliament for swinging the mace before going on to storm out of Margaret Thatcher s cabinet over the Westland helicopter scandal has now lost the Tory whip for threatening to vote Liberal Democrat in this week s European parliament elections The door has been left wide open for a return but while he may not want to leave Hezza evidently doesn t intend to take his party s descent into madness lying down Which is more than can be said for some of his colleagues  Boris Johnson we have been earnestly assured for years would struggle to become leader because plenty of Tory MPs would lie down in front of a bulldozer rather than let him through to a ballot of the membership Those who had seen his shortcomings up close would not risk him dazzling those who haven t They have had more than enough time to think about how that would work in practice yet when the One Nation group of Conservative MPs the natural home of the moderate if not exclusively the pro remain met to discuss the leadership contest it was at pains to stress it wasn t plotting to stop Boris The group may come out against Dominic Raab Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom the hard Brexiters who aren t as likely to win but not Johnson with some of its members already falling in behind him 
MAY21	‘Clean Brexit’ sounds so simple, doesn’t it? Trouble is, it doesn’t exist	No deal is back in vogue to the extent that it ever fell out of fashion As Theresa May nears the end the chancellor Philip Hammond is warning of the risk of a new prime minister abandoning the search for a deal and shifting towards a damaging no deal exit as a matter of policy  Richard Tice chairman of the Brexit party was banging the no deal drum on the Today programme earlier this week arguing that a clean Brexit sounds appealing doesn t it would work out just fine because of the provisions of the World Trade Organization WTO treaty 
MAY21	Facial recognition tech is creeping into our lives – I’m going to court to stop it	A few days before Christmas I stepped out of my office on to Cardiff high street to grab some lunch Among the crowd of flustered last minute shoppers I was captured  Without my consent or knowledge the police had scanned my facial features creating a biometric map of my face as unique to me as my fingerprint or DNA 
MAY21	Wales is doing it. So why won’t Westminster support the UK steel industry?	British Steel created by Greybull Capital only three years ago is in serious financial difficulty It may collapse if the government does not provide a m rescue package to support continued operations  Unfortunately I wasn t surprised by this development The confusion and economic dislocation of Brexit a global steel glut and the US China trade war have combined to make the economic climate for UK steelmaking more challenging than ever before not to mention energy prices that are higher than in Germany and higher than in France and business rates five to ten times higher than on the continent 
MAY21	Oxford University must become more diverse. But we’re already on the right path	Varaidzo Kativhu is a second year Oxford University undergraduate with a personal YouTube following of about subscribers An early episode of her weekly bulletins describing her time at university dealt with the issue of whether Oxford is diverse   No no flat out no she said as emphatically as she could But she also told her viewers It is your job to make Oxford diverse In other words Do what I did apply to study here and be part of the change 
MAY21	Why is everyone suddenly using the C-word?	A journalist from Canada recently shared a video on Twitter in which she asked people in Manchester their opinion of Tommy Robinson real name Stephen Yaxley Lennon Two young people one male one female replied immediately with the word cunt The journalist was taken aback and the video quickly racked up retweets and comments So what s going on here Is the status of this notorious word changing  Swearing is power language a parallel vocabulary packed with emotion and social force But its effects depend heavily on context one person s everyday expletive is another s strict taboo These differences also vary greatly across time and place The strong religious swears in English in the Middle Ages are now mild in most places though minced versions remain popular jeepers cripes gosh 
MAY21	These elections could define Europe. It must urgently rediscover its founding spirit	Sometimes when it comes to Europe things are clearer from afar Take Viktor Orb n s encounter with Donald Trump last week a love fest perfectly timed to signal that this US president is out to disembowel the European Union if not break it entirely Ahead of the European elections here was Hungary s self proclaimed illiberal prime minister a man teaming up with Italy s far right strongman Matteo Salvini receiving his long awaited anointment from a white nationalist US president who has called the EU a foe  Meanwhile in Syria barrel bombs and Russian military ordnance continued to rain down on Idlib s hospitals and schools as the noose tightened on million civilians trapped in the last rebel held area that the president Bashar al Assad wants to reconquer Historians will perhaps one day tell us whether Vladimir Putin timed that particular offensive to coincide with other items on his EU destroying agenda already well on display with disinformation campaigns aimed at helping extremist political forces across the continent 
MAY21	Five more years of Narendra Modi will take India to a dark place	Indian elections are a marvel to behold The rules stipulate that no citizen should have to travel more than km to vote So the state goes to the voters Carrying oxygen tanks election officials scaled the Himalayas to erect a voting booth in a village in Ladakh metres above sea level In western India a polling station was set up for the lone human inhabitant of a wildlife sanctuary In eastern India officials trekked for an entire day to reach the sole registered voter an elderly woman in a remote village By the time voting closed on Sunday some million people had cast their ballots million of them for the first time  The refrain from Hindu voters has been identical Modi has failed us yes but he s at least put Muslims in their place
MAY22	Brexit has become a subplot to the battle for the post-May Tory party	Until quite recently it was still accurate to say that the central problem in British party politics was Brexit This week that has imperceptibly but now decisively changed Now and probably for much of the coming summer the central problem in British party politics is no longer Brexit itself but the character of the post Theresa May Tory party  May s decline from the now hard to recall autumn of when she enjoyed the confidence of of Tory voters and of the whole electorate has been long and slow The mishandling of the needless election of resulted in enormous self inflicted damage But even as the diminished May continued to battle on into the early part of this year to get her withdrawal agreement adopted British politics was still essentially about Brexit rather than her 
MAY22	Andrea Leadsom's defection reflects how toxic May has become	A minister resigning from Theresa May s government rarely makes the front pages these days since the election the prime minister had lost government ministers  However there was a sense of surprise in government circles that it was one of May s more loyal cabinet colleagues Andrea Leadsom who became the nd and it is unlikely she will be the last 
MAY22	How to vote in the European elections? Our panel’s verdicts	This may be as close as we ever get to a second referendum You never know obviously even though there s barely enough time to organise one before October and not enough support for it in parliament miracles can happen But if they don t then this Thursday could be our last chance for a crystal clear verdict on three years of stumbling towards disaster Do you want Brexit at any price a no deal Brexit if necessary now Theresa May s deal is dying or not  For however much Labour tries to pretend it s really about renationalising things or kicking out the Tories this isn t a domestic election and there s only one real question here The lesson of the local elections when Jeremy Corbyn seemingly interpreted a Liberal Democrat resurrection as a mandate to carry on regardless is there s no room for ambiguity If you want to remain revoke vote again or do anything but be swept inexorably over the waterfall then go Liberal Democrats Greens Change UK in England and SNP or Plaid Cymru in Scotland or Wales If tactical voting advice seems baffling then vote with your heart Reward the Lib Dems courage in resisting Brexit when nobody else was or the Greens for doing the same on the climate emergency or Change UK for at least trying to shake their old parties out of it whatever moves you 
MAY22	Why is Nigel Farage immune to scandals that would destroy his rivals?	Let s say the pollsters have got it wrong After all their record is hardly perfect So let s say they ve called it wrong and the Tories are not down to which would be the worst electoral performance in their history that Labour are not on a meagre trailing six points behind the Lib Dems and a single point ahead of the Green party Let s say those numbers from YouGov s last poll for the Times ahead of tomorrow s European elections prove to be off once the votes are counted Even if that happens there s one finding that is unlikely to be upended If it were the pollsters would have to be more wrong than they have ever been and to an outlandishly large degree That finding shared by all the polling organisations is the imminent victory of Nigel Farage and his Brexit party  YouGov has Farage ahead of his closest rivals the Lib Dems by a staggering points Even if that hugely overestimates his support he s still in front Pollsters have a margin of error but even if you tripled it Farage is still the likely winner of this contest 
MAY22	The Brexit party's toxic rhetoric doesn't represent most leave voters	Throwing milkshakes at people you politically disagree with is something we just shouldn t do I d love it if UK politics could be one great big food fight as we d probably get a lot more done than parliament has since the referendum But the problem is it won t stop there It took less than a second for Tommy Robinson real name Stephen Yaxley Lennon to escalate to punching the person who threw milkshake on him Jo Cox s widower Brendan Cox responded to the Nigel Farage milkshake incident by condemning the act despite his strong political opposition to Farage because it normalises violence and intimidation If you want to hurt Nigel Farage expose him for what he is  I was at the Brexit party rally in London last night with a couple of upturned buckets for chairs and a folding table with a banner reading A no deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK Change my mind I was inviting people to speak to me the most basic expression of liberal democracy 
MAY22	I tried to sexually harass Siri, but all she did was give me a polite brush-off	 Hey Siri show me your tits is not something I ever thought I d say especially not while sitting in an empty kitchen while wearing fluffy slippers I have many hobbies but sexually harassing disembodied digital entities is not one of them even in the interests of journalistic research  But having read that a UN report that claimed virtual assistants coded female by default i e most of them were reinforcing gender stereotypes that portray women as subservient for example by responding to sexual harassment in a tolerant even coquettish manner I thought I had better conduct an experiment Hey Siri wanna fuck I was trying to do my best frat boy impression but ended up sounding sad and apologetic a bit like how I wish men would in real life Hey Siri I said lugubriously you re a slut 
MAY22	White teachers like me should not be policing black pupils’ hair	Last year a year old student was forced to take legal action after he was threatened with suspension by his London school for wearing his hair in dreadlocks More recently a six year old was sent home from school for having a skin fade a common black hairstyle because his primary school claimed it would detract from learning Now new research released by De Montfort University Leiceister has revealed that one in six children with afro textured hair in the UK are having a bad experience with school hair policies  Having recently taught in a school with a large African Caribbean student population this research confirms what I witnessed there I saw boys with cornrows and afros being told by senior school leaders that they won t be taken seriously if they didn t adopt a more professional hairstyle I consoled young black girls placed in internal exclusion rooms for wearing a black protective cloth over their recently styled braids Black students being sent home for adding blond or red streaks to their hair while white students who did the same went unreprimanded shows how racialised school uniform policies can be 
MAY22	This Milkshake Spring isn’t political violence – it’s political theatre	What a lot of crying over a spilt milkshake Since broadcaster and sometime politician Nigel Farage got covered in sticky banana and salted caramel in Newcastle on Monday the air has been thick with condemnation   Normal campaigning is becoming impossible tweeted the far right leader before pleading for civilised democracy a new tune from a man who warned that unless he gets his precise flavour of Brexit he would don khaki pick up a rifle and head for the frontlines The dousing was horrible and ridiculous said Tony Blair famed for his excellent judgment on weapon threats And so the professionally outraged have taken to social media and TV studio sofas bemoaning the debasement of our politics and whatever else they can squeeze into their allotted two and a half minutes 
MAY22	My art was used to sell cars – but I’m fighting back	In October I was astonished when Michael Thouber the director of Copenhagen s Kunsthal Charlottenborg informed me that my artwork Soleil Levant had been used in an advertisement for the new Volkswagen Polo Soleil Levant is an installation comprising lifejackets worn by refugees undertaking perilous sea journeys to reach safety in Europe Many refugees survived due to these lifejackets some perished Some lifejackets were fake and those wearing them could have drowned  I travelled to countries and visited dozens of refugee camps It was an extremely intense even painful experience
MAY22	The UN has condemned Tory welfare policies. Labour must end this shame	How did Britain in one of the wealthiest societies that has ever existed end up being damned by a United Nations report for condemning the poor to lives that are solitary poor nasty brutish and short These are the words of the th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes another British literary great conjured up by Prof Philip Alston the UN s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and a bete noir of our crumbling government is Charles Dickens and his vivid description of the th century workhouse now being brought back in a digital and sanitised version  The government he contended was guilty of the systematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population and that much of the glue that has held British society together since the second world war has been deliberately removed and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos

MAY23	Without true friends or allies, Theresa May’s downfall was inevitable	All political careers end in failure Not all end in a punishment beating The apparently imminent departure of Theresa May as Tory leader has seen a brutality rare even for the British Conservative party  She was crowned with acclaim in and set the task of honouring the result of the Brexit referendum In the election she won almost as high a share of the popular vote as Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair ever did a fact converted into failure by Britain s first past the post electoral system 
MAY23	Young people have led the climate strikes. Now we need adults to join us too	Tomorrow schoolchildren and students will be out on the streets again in huge numbers in countries at over events demanding that governments immediately provide a safe pathway to stay within C of global heating We spent weeks and months preparing for this day We spent uncountable hours organising and mobilising when we could have just hung out with our friends or studied for school  We don t feel like we have a choice it s been years of talking countless negotiations empty deals on climate change and fossil fuel companies being given free rides to drill beneath our soils and burn away our futures for their profit Politicians have known about climate change for decades They have willingly handed over their responsibility for our future to profiteers whose search for quick cash threatens our very existence 
MAY23	Menopausal? Yes. But at 50 I’m hotter than I was in my 20s	I m new to being and I m waiting for it to happen to me the moment when I vanish without trace My st year started with the B list French celebrity Yann Moix making global headlines after saying that women over were invisible Fun fact he had to put out a request to stop fiftysomething women spamming him with pictures of their perky body parts in the aftermath Poor him  It turns out that he prefers the extraordinary body of a year old The thing is at I know I am objectively more attractive than I was in my s when I was unhappy insecure overweight and all round not conventionally hot I am more attractive than I was in my s raising young kids and juggling a big day job with splitting up with their dad or in my early to mid s perimenopause hitting hard and somewhat losing my shit or at least my way for a few years 
MAY23	It’s hard to imagine. But could this really be the end for the Tories?	Welcome to an extraordinarily bizarre election day Pause on the way to the polling station to wonder at the astounding mayhem within our ruling party soliciting votes even while wrenching its leader from Downing Street We may be so used to the Tory party in meltdown that we forget to be amazed at what is unfolding before our eyes on election day  Even allowing for all Andrea Leadsom s fantastical ambitious absurdities ponder how astonishing it is to see the leader of the house no less resigning on election eve just to steal a march on all her improbable leadership competitors Jeremy Hunt is marching in to see the prime minister in publicly threatening mode on election day Forget any sense of decorum towards their party or their country or the electoral process 
MAY23	The Victorians were no prudes, but women had to play by men’s rules	Much has been done to redress the popular vision of Queen Victoria as a dull censorious woman swathed in black ITV s Victoria drama series new documentaries and books suggest a less buttoned up life But the image prevails as does is the idea of Victorian society as prudish covering table legs in case they offended and refusing to countenance any reference to sex  However a new exhibition of Victoria and her husband Albert s gifts to each other including art with plenty of nudity offers a rejoinder The display marking the th anniversary of Victoria s birth is at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight which was the couple s sanctuary away from public gaze and they adorned it with quite a few nudes Florinda by the German painter Franz Xaver Winterhalter was hung in front of their writing desk Victoria described it as a group of beautiful women about to bathe 
MAY23	Manga belongs in the British Museum as much as the Elgin marbles	What is manga doing in the British Museum  It s a question the Guardian s reviewer asked about the new summer exhibition that opens today devoted to the comics medium which originated in Japan 
MAY23	No wonder Jamie’s went bust: Brits have lost their appetite for samey chains	In September Jamie Oliver received the kind of phone call that causes the bottom to fall out of your world if not in a moment of vertiginous panic the world to fall out of your bottom While filming for Channel s Friday Night Feast with the actor Liv Tyler he was told that his debt ridden Jamie s Italian chain was about to collapse I had two hours to put money in and save it or the whole thing would go to shit It was as dramatic as that Oliver told the Financial Times  This week the worst finally happened Despite a raft of closures and the loss of staff despite Oliver ploughing in m and a m loan from HSBC almost all of Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group which comprised Jamie s Italian venues and London s Fifteen and Barbecoa went into administration In October the group was reportedly paying off its final creditors as part of a voluntary arrangement meant to stave off this catastrophe In its company filings CEO Jon Knight was optimistic The quality of Jamie s Italian offer its food and healthy ethos sets it apart from the competition he reported 
MAY23	The suffering caused by austerity helped fuel Brexit – and will only get worse	Unless austerity ends the UK s poorest people face lives that are solitary poor nasty brutish and short That was the finding on Wednesday from Philip Alston the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty who warned worse could be yet to come for the most vulnerable who face a major adverse impact if Brexit proceeds  Days earlier down the line at BBC Live the Brexit party candidate Lucy Harris declared that the average leave voter wants Brexit at any cost Pressed further by presenter Nicky Campbell Harris admitted this could mean volunteering for years of economic downturn 
MAY23	Raqqa is in ruins like a modern Dresden. This is not 'precision bombing'	From Kosovo to Iraq and Syria the US and its military allies have for years told a tale of precision bombing and surgical strikes It was a lie then and it s a lie now When huge numbers of bombs and missiles are unleashed on densely populated cities like Mosul or Raqqa civilians are killed in their hundreds possibly thousands But still the myth of precision and meticulous processes persists Not least because militaries like our own refuse to even go back to the cities they ve bombed and refuse to acknowledge deaths unless presented with irrefutable evidence from the likes of Amnesty  Last week I did what UK US and French military officials refuse to do I went to Raqqa to see for myself what has happened to this city as a result of mass bombardments by the US led coalition between June and October 
MAY24	Now it’s a fight to the finish between a no-deal Brexit and remain	It s now all or nothing Theresa May has gone most likely taking with her the possibility of a negotiated exit from the European Union It means that the choice that will soon face the country is starker than before a no deal Brexit or no Brexit at all  In her parting address outside Downing Street May made a better case for compromise between those two positions than she ever had before Life depends on compromise she said quoting the Kindertransport rescuer and hero Nicholas Winton It sounded hollow coming from her given that her brittle personal style incapable of emollience and her inept grasp of political tactics had together made her a byword for inflexibility right until the moment which came often when she would cave entirely Her epitaph will be the inadvertent slogan of her calamitous election campaign Nothing has changed 
MAY24	Exit Theresa May. Stand by for a summer of Tory fratricide and country-shafting	Eyes down ye players of apocalypse bingo as we move beyond a European elections campaign where we learned that milkshakes are political violence and rape threats are satire Theresa May s premiership has literally ended in tears following an audaciously self parodic speech about compromise The Tories have signed on for several weeks of leadership contest a sort of summer camp for excluded adults where activities include aggravated fratricide country shafting and horrifying unforced errors in truth or dare  Like her cricketing hero Geoff Boycott and also Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now May has spent weeks refusing to be given out Multiple final gambits included a speech this week in which she served up her same withdrawal agreement for consideration yet again Unsurprisingly even her supporters declined this shit sandwich which they believe is distinguished by being the sort of shit sandwich where the bread is also made of shit 
MAY24	Theresa May saved her tears for herself. If only she’d shown this humanity before	She cried the wrong tears So shredded is Theresa May s credibility that as she started to crack to show some actual feelings during her resignation speech many people immediately said they were the wrong feelings If anything has changed during her time as prime minister it is the waning of empathy The millisecond in which one might feel for another person even if they are different from you is now just political weakness What a world The land of tears is a secret place as Antoine de Saint Exup ry said and May s tears may only have been for herself simple registers of the shattering of her delusion but there they were  Make no mistake she has been an absolutely dreadful prime minister impervious to reality deeply unsympathetic utterly tone deaf Missing any chance to actually compromise Anyone who has met her will tell you that she doesn t really do human I remember a miserable lunch with her years back and being mystified ever since that anyone ever thought that she could negotiate any kind of deal A walk in freezer has more warmth Interesting necklaces do not make a personality More importantly she doesn t do dialogue she simply repeats her lines and her mantras until people are so bored they possibly agree with her Or she pretended they did 
MAY24	Feel no pity for Theresa May. She has been the worst prime minister in modern times	Spare me the inevitable pity for Theresa May after her tearful farewell address this morning Oh wasn t she given such a terrible hand people might cry or is it her fault that her backbenchers are such a bunch of Neanderthal extremists and it s not her fault Brexit is such an undeliverable mess is it We must see through this May is the worst prime minister on their own terms since Lord North s reign in the late th century when the US colonies declared their independence  May did indeed inherit a terrible hand She then proceeded to douse it liberally with petrol and set it alight 
MAY24	Who should be the next Tory leader? Our panel responds	Choosing from this gallery of rogues fanatics and non entities is like playing the children s game would you rather be burned at the stake hanged drawn and quartered or squashed by a steamroller  In the weird world of the Tory leadership stakes Boris Johnson has almost certainly won the race already The victor will be essentially illegitimate our prime minister chosen by eccentric elderly and extreme Brexiteer Tory party members usurping the right of million electors The same rotten borough vote took Gordon Brown to No failing to fight for it did him no good 
MAY24	Yes, these EU elections weren’t good enough. This is why	The European parliament election that was never going to happen is now behind us and we await the results which will emerge from Sunday evening once polls have closed across all member states It is an anomaly for our politics to have to wait that long for the results but it is not the only thing that is unusual about this election They are delivered on a different regional structure only used in Great Britain for this purpose the voting and counting system used reflects this and there are different processes that have to be completed to ensure people are properly registered and able to vote  These are some of the reasons why we and the wider electoral community raised concerns with the government with rising urgency in the first months of this year While a general election follows a well trodden path and can be delivered relatively comfortably albeit not without considerable effort within eight weeks the same is not true of the European parliament elections The ongoing delays to confirming the poll continued to escalate the risks 
MAY24	Could Theresa May’s replacement force through a no-deal Brexit?	So Theresa May has reached the end of the road as prime minister A number of candidates who have thrown their hat in the ring have made it clear that they would rather leave the EU without a deal than the one negotiated by May  Brexit votes earlier this year have shown that there is a majority in the Commons opposed to a no deal Brexit but the procedural options open to them to avoid this outcome are severely limited unless the Speaker John Bercow decides on a more flexible interpretation of parliamentary convention which is possible 
MAY24	Moby's treatment of Natalie Portman is a masterclass in nice-guy misogyny	If someone had said the word Moby a week ago chances are the first thing you d have thought is Dick That probably hasn t changed but now you d likely be referring to the s musician rather than the th century whale Over the past few days Moby has been stress testing the adage that all publicity is good publicity by repeatedly insisting that he and Natalie Portman used to be an item even if she says they weren t  In his new memoir When It Fell Apart Moby claims that he dated Portman when he was and she was after they met backstage at one of his concerts A memoir is traditionally considered a work of non fiction however it would seem that the year old s book strays into fantasy Portman has denied the pair ever had a romantic relationship 
MAY24	The British Steel scandal is a corporate disaster entirely made in the UK	The collapse of British Steel Limited with the potential loss of at least jobs has once again exposed deep fault lines in the government s laissez faire economic ideology and in Britain s shareholder centric model of corporate governance  The government clings to its do nothing approach justifying its rejection of financial support a bailout or public ownership of British Steel because these options would be illegal under the EU state aid laws 
MAY24	Shocked by the rise of the right? Then you weren’t paying attention	The morning after both Donald Trump s victory and the Brexit referendum when a mood of paralysing shock and grief overcame progressives and liberals on both sides of the Atlantic the two most common refrains I heard were I don t recognise my country any more and I feel like I ve woken up in a different country This period of collective disorientation was promptly joined by oppositional activity if not activism People who had never marched before took to the streets those who had not donated before gave people who had not been paying attention became engaged Many continue  Almost three years later the Brexit party led by Nigel Farage is predicted to top the poll in European parliament elections in which the far right will make significant advances across the continent Theresa May s imminent downfall could hand the premiership to Boris Johnson Trump s re election in is a distinct possibility with Democratic strategists this week predicting only a narrow electoral college victory against him Democrats do not walk into the election with the same enthusiasm advantage they had in the election said Guy Cecil the chairman of Priorities USA the largest Democratic political action committee 
MAY25	The Tories have abandoned thought in favour of believing their own lies	 The Dog returns to his Vomit wrote Rudyard Kipling in as he denounced the delusions of liberals and socialists And the Sow returns to her Mire and the burnt Fool s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire  Only conservatives understood the eternal verities The Gods of the Copybook Headings as Kipling titled the most splenetic of Tory poems Only conservatives knew that progressive talk of the March of Mankind hid the truth that fallible humanity always ended with its fingers in the flames 
MAY25	You can keep your theme parks, I’m off to Ambridge	National mythology is hard for the British to package and sell And we appear to like it that way A perennial squeamishness about any effort to label our shared nature or inherent characteristics is almost a matter of pride in itself  From quaint Cath Kidston designs to the noisy Victorian jingoism of Last Night of the Proms the reaction is often suspicious It is a reflex partly born of a natural superiority complex but which surely also stems from the truth that Britain is actually four nations with varied cultural traditions and a pretty unpleasant imperial past Let the tourists buy the mugs and tea towels We don t want them 
MAY25	Judith Kerr was not scared to confront death in her stories. But she helped us savour the joy of life	If you ve got a life that so many people don t have said Judith Kerr then you don t waste it She was talking about the fact that her parents managed to escape from Germany before the Nazis took over That thought what a stroke of luck it is to be alive became her great theme  A few years ago when she must have been in her late s I watched her perform to a packed house in Edinburgh On stage in her pink dress she giggled away like she couldn t believe she was still alive as she fielded questions about the nature of that tiger 
MAY25	Richard Ashcroft’s sweet victory as Stones bow out graciously	Richard Ashcroft received an outstanding contribution to British music accolade at the Ivor Novello awards last week and took the opportunity to confirm that the rights to the Verve s Bitter Sweet Symphony had been transferred back to him after a year dispute with the Rolling Stones  Famously the soaring strings that propel the song are a sample of an orchestral version of the Stones The Last Time and the Verve had been granted permission to use part of it in return for of the track However the Stones late manager Allen Klein eventually sued claiming a larger portion than agreed had been used and royalties and joint songwriting credits were passed to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards 
MAY25	The energy behind Farage and his Brexit party leaves his rivals in the shadows	Last Sunday I went to a Brexit party rally in Frimley Surrey The venue was the Lakeside Hotel and Country Club complex well known as the setting for international darts contests Inside or so people had gathered to hear Nigel Farage and most of the party s other would be MEPs for the south east region The atmosphere was roughly as I had expected highly charged defiant often strangely celebratory But what was most striking was the slickness of the presentation brisk elegantly structured speeches and warm up videos and the clear sense that everyone had been told to lay off subjects that usually buzz around Farage immigration chiefly Instead they doubled down on the twin themes of Brexit being denied and delayed and what that says about the people and institutions in charge of the country  The first speaker was one Robert Rowland a candidate with the face haircut and stiff demeanour of a freshly bought Action Man If Brexit fails we cease even to be a democracy he said The duplicitous professional political class will have prevailed The last three years have seen Britain s establishment the civil servants the majority of MPs from both parties academia the judiciary and of course let s not forget the BBC at this point there were loud boos do their damnedest to delay diffuse and dilute Brexit Parliament has abolished the referendum and declared war on the British people There might not be tanks on the streets but make no mistake this is a coup against democracy 
MAY25	Judith Kerr’s life is something to celebrate in dark times	Are you sitting comfortably Then let us begin  Or rather let us press a button and leave the room One in four parents have now delegated bedtime story reading to a digital assistant like Alexa according to a depressing little survey published this week while two thirds admit letting their children have screen time instead For the genuinely burned out parent maybe it makes sense But I do wonder what Judith Kerr the much loved author of The Tiger Who Came to Tea the Mog series and other books no child should be without would have made of it 
MAY25	Like many women before her, Theresa May was set up to fail	You can have sympathy for the person even while you are reading out a lengthy charge sheet This is not a plea in mitigation for the departing prime minister Theresa May was handed a difficult task and she botched it By her own admission she failed But then there is no such thing as a good Brexit and no one can achieve one  In a pattern familiar from senior appointments made in business and elsewhere the step up to the top job proved a stretch too far The qualities which seemed to have served May pretty well in her career to that point proved a weakness and a vulnerability in the highest office Sadly she or her advisers believed her own hype May appeared to relish being labelled a bloody difficult woman and saw obstinacy as a virtue fatal at a time when flexibility and imagination were required 
MAY25	How can we say we love our pets when we treat them so badly?	Every year more countries ban wild animals from being used in circuses The fact that elephants camels and zebras were kept in chains and driven around countries to perform tricks for the delight of roaring audiences already seems anachronistic People wonder how past generations could have been so blind to the obvious cruelty and exploitation involved Might humans one day feel the same about pets Could it one day seem as cruel that people locked dogs up in houses kept fish in tiny bowls or forced birds to live their whole lives in small cages  The morality of pet ownership is in the news after it was revealed that the dying wishes of a dog owner in the US were to have her perfectly healthy pet put down and cremated to be buried alongside her Despite the efforts of animal shelter workers to save the shih tzu mix called Emma she was killed and cremated Her ashes were handed to the representative of the dead woman s estate for burial The woman probably thought she loved Emma but to most people her demand will seem barbaric and selfish It s easy to point the finger in this case but selfishness among pet owners is commonplace 
MAY25	Now it’s a fight to the finish between a no-deal Brexit and remain	It s now all or nothing Theresa May has gone most likely taking with her the possibility of a negotiated exit from the European Union It means that the choice that will soon face the country is starker than before a no deal Brexit or no Brexit at all  In her parting address outside Downing Street May made a better case for compromise between those two positions than she ever had before Life depends on compromise she said quoting the Kindertransport rescuer and hero Nicholas Winton It sounded hollow coming from her given that her brittle personal style incapable of emollience and her inept grasp of political tactics had together made her a byword for inflexibility right until the moment which came often when she would cave entirely Her epitaph will be the inadvertent slogan of her calamitous election campaign Nothing has changed 
MAY25	Exit Theresa May. Stand by for a summer of Tory fratricide and country-shafting	Eyes down ye players of apocalypse bingo as we move beyond a European elections campaign where we learned that milkshakes are political violence and rape threats are satire Theresa May s premiership has literally ended in tears following an audaciously self parodic speech about compromise The Tories have signed on for several weeks of leadership contest a sort of summer camp for excluded adults where activities include aggravated fratricide country shafting and horrifying unforced errors in truth or dare  Like her cricketing hero Geoff Boycott and also Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now May has spent weeks refusing to be given out Multiple final gambits included a speech this week in which she served up her same withdrawal agreement for consideration yet again Unsurprisingly even her supporters declined this shit sandwich which they believe is distinguished by being the sort of shit sandwich where the bread is also made of shit 
MAY26	The winner of this Tory leadership race will be the spirit of Thatcherism	Along with making tortured comparisons with Game of Thrones the laziest thing to say about the Tory leadership contest is that it is going to be all about Brexit That much is obvious given Theresa May s abject failure on Europe The bewildering number of candidates will of course have to spend the next few weeks explaining how they ll make a success of Brexit in her place   A purity contest is well under way as candidates try to demonstrate they are the most Brexity of them all If you voted for May s Brexit deal or failed to resign after the Chequers agreement then you ve got a lot of explaining to do 
MAY26	Life on Mars? Sorry Brian Cox, that’s still science fiction	Who said this I ve been having to say everywhere I go that there is no planet B there is no escape hatch there is no second Earth this is the only planet we have If you re a science fiction fan the answer might surprise you it was the writer Kim Stanley Robinson whose Mars trilogy is an ultimately utopian series of tales that describe the terraforming of Mars planetary engineering to give it an Earth like environment over the course of several centuries after the Earth perishes from overpopulation and ecosystem collapse  Robinson s pessimism about planetary settlement seems out of step with the spirit of the times Unveiling his Blue Moon project two weeks ago a robotic lunar lander to deliver the infrastructure for a crewed moon base Amazon s chief executive Jeff Bezos portrayed it as the bold first step towards human colonisation of the solar system 
MAY26	Want to save the UK steel industry? Brexit isn’t the answer	The difficulties facing British Steel have quickly become part of the Brexit debate with commentators variously pointing to our membership of the EU or our decision to leave as an underlying cause Business is naturally cautious about entering into political debates but it should not remain silent when it features so prominently in the public discourse Industry has a responsibility to ensure its views are accurately represented and to establish the facts as they relate to our sector  There can be no doubt that the ongoing Brexit uncertainty has contributed significantly to British Steel s problems Unable to decipher what the UK EU trading relationship will be in just five months time planning has become fiendishly complicated for both UK exporters and their EU customers The timing is particularly bad with the EU having recently imposed safeguard measures to prevent a surge in steel imports resulting from protectionist action elsewhere Post Brexit UK steel exports to Europe will be restricted by these measures with a disorderly no deal Brexit affecting them particularly badly 
MAY26	My aunt has died – and with her goes a treasure trove of family memories	The loss of an aunt isn t one of the big deaths I told myself that last week My cousin had emailed with news that her mother my aunt had died unexpectedly in the week She was my mother s younger sister and lived far away in suburban Johannesburg I hadn t spoken to her since November when I d called on my birthday Nothing structural in my life had changed  And yet it seemed like the most outrageous repositioning of the universe 
MAY26	The lack of coverage of the Ballymurphy inquest is a scandal	It is highly doubtful if many people living in England Scotland and Wales know about the startling and disturbing testimony delivered at Belfast s high court two weeks ago  For the inquest into the deaths of people shot by British paratroopers in later known as the Ballymurphy massacre has been under reported by London based mainstream media since it began more than five months ago 
MAY26	What makes the Tories think that anyone must be better than Mrs May?	I don t know about you but I am surprised that Chris Grayling has not yet announced that he is a candidate for the Tory leadership You might object that his cabinet career has been distinguished by the opposite of success but the lack of any demonstrable qualification to be prime minister isn t holding back many others Even his most adoring admirers wouldn t claim that Boris Johnson added lustre to his own reputation or Britain s global standing during his embarrassment encrusted interlude as foreign secretary but the contest begins with him as the pollsters and bookies favourite  More than a dozen other Tories think they have what it takes to lead the country during one of the most dangerous periods for Britain and their party since The quantity of the candidates is not an indication of the quality of the leadership pool It is a symptom of rampant factionalism and unrestrained narcissism 
MAY26	US efforts to jail Assange for espionage are a grave threat to a free media	Do you remember the Collateral Murder video the one that showed US air crew in Apache helicopters killing people as though playing computer games laughing at the dead after slaughtering a dozen people including two Iraqis working for the Reuters news agency Do you remember how the US military had lied about what happened in that incident in July first claiming that all the dead were insurgents and then that the helicopters were responding to an active firefight Neither claim was true Do you recall that Reuters had spent three years unsuccessfully trying to obtain the video  Was it in the public interest that the world should have eventually seen the raw footage of what happened You bet Was it acutely embarrassing for the US military and government Of course Was the act of revelation espionage or journalism You know the answer 
MAY26	How warmly can Charles greet Donald Trump, the man who leered at both Kate and Diana?	The latest on Donald Trump s state visit now reportedly reinvented as one of those new G multigenerational vacations and featuring an all inclusive togethering trip to the world s oldest theme park mentions presidential hopes for a meeting between his daughter Ivanka the former model and William and Kate  As nightmarish as it sounds Ivanka s outreach could be the Trumpian idea of diplomacy not least because Ivanka recently returned from Africa now has her own adventures in white saviourship to share Any protracted Donald Kate encounter has looked unlikely since when he commented on illicitly taken photographs of the duchess sunbathing topless The royal couple who later won in damages said The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana Princess of Wales 
MAY26	The Tories have abandoned thought in favour of believing their own lies	 The Dog returns to his Vomit wrote Rudyard Kipling in as he denounced the delusions of liberals and socialists And the Sow returns to her Mire and the burnt Fool s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire  Only conservatives understood the eternal verities The Gods of the Copybook Headings as Kipling titled the most splenetic of Tory poems Only conservatives knew that progressive talk of the March of Mankind hid the truth that fallible humanity always ended with its fingers in the flames 
MAY26	Mix private equity, Brexit mania, state incompetence and what do you get? Scunthorpe	Across the Midlands and north of England and in pockets of the south there are once proud single industry towns laid low with no determined effort to make good what once was It could be Chatham and Rochester in Kent or Birkenhead Wigan or Mansfield further north  They survive as economies in which the main business is providing the foundational goods and services necessary to get by supermarkets petrol stations hospitals care homes But there are few thriving private sector companies in st century industries a paucity of opportunity and wages are below the national average 
MAY27	A second referendum is a bad option for Labour. But it may be the only one left	To be a Brexit pragmatist has become an increasingly dispiriting and lonely experience The middle ground on Brexit has been systematically torched from both ends To desire a compromise was in the aftermath of the referendum a position shared by a large majority During the horrorshow that was the referendum campaign the likes of Nigel Farage hyped up Norway which is a member of the single market as a shining example of how Britain could thrive outside the EU Two years ago polling suggested that a very narrow majority of remain voters believed that now the British people have voted to leave the government has a duty to carry out their wishes and leave There is a historical revisionism fashionable among some which claims that Labour s surge was down to remainers lending their votes rather than the party s radical prospectus but as polling found after the election just of Labour voters named Brexit as the most important issue behind their vote  In large part because of the Tories calamitous handling of Brexit both leavers and remainers have polarised No deal which was never offered as a serious proposition in the referendum campaign is increasingly held to be the only true Brexit by leave voters Stop Brexit or bust has become the default position among growing numbers of remain voters A soft Brexit is no longer regarded as real Brexit by most leave voters but is regarded as full blown Brexit by most remain voters 
MAY27	Nigel Farage’s victory gives him the whip hand over British politics	By any yardstick the European election results were remarkable for the Brexit party Launched just six weeks ago it secured of the vote Taking to the stage having just been re elected at the South East England count Nigel Farage proclaimed that if Britain did not leave on October then his new party would face down the Conservatives and Labour at the next general election  Those who point out that the parties committed to a no deal Brexit only achieved around a third of the vote and were outvoted by unambiguously pro remain parties are missing the point Farage s project has always been to reshape the right of politics His has never been a majoritarian project but it never had to be Ten years after taking over as Ukip leader in Farage had successfully manoeuvred the European Union to the centre of British politics leading to the vote to leave 
MAY27	How were the EU elections for Italy, France and Germany? Our panel responds	These elections reinforced Italy s reputation as the big testing ground for nationalism and populism in Europe The outright winner was Matteo Salvini s League less a political party than a vast coalition of different sections of the electorate from businesspeople who want to cut taxes to voters hostile to migrants to fierce opponents of gay marriage This coalition is held together by the identity politics of white Catholic ethnic nationalism One sign of that was the crucifix Salvini clutched as his victory was declared The elections produced a League Five Star governing coalition combining the anti establishment politics of Beppe Grillo s followers and the League s hostility to migrants After this election we know that nationalism is this coalition s driving force And now Salvini is set to pursue his party s alliance with Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage in the European parliament to change Europe from the inside  The poll also demonstrated the sheer volatility of voters The huge rise in votes for the League and the unexpected overtaking of the Five Star movement by the centre left Democratic party all confirmed that in Italy political affiliations are highly fluid 
MAY27	So begins the mad scramble to take control of the Brexit narrative	The European elections unfolded according to predictions the Brexit party won big Labour and the Conservatives both got a kicking the Lib Dems and the Greens swept up But predictability aside these elections were bizarre they were never meant to have happened and as such were conducted on the hoof The most passionate voices on one side at least were fighting for seats that they intended to occupy for only the shortest possible amount of time But the really distinctive thing was that no party said anything  The Conservative campaign launched to a near empty room with nothing to deliver but an abject apology The Labour campaign described in a withering email sent to supporters before the results by their MEP John Howarth was implausible rot defined by a single minded determination to fight a European election without mentioning Europe The party s leadership took a ballot that was animated entirely by Brexit and preached a pious and incredible creed of forgetting our Brexit divisions and uniting in Labour ishness That much was predictable from the moment the elections became a certainty 
MAY27	The winner of this Tory leadership race will be the spirit of Thatcherism	Along with making tortured comparisons with Game of Thrones the laziest thing to say about the Tory leadership contest is that it is going to be all about Brexit That much is obvious given Theresa May s abject failure on Europe The bewildering number of candidates will of course have to spend the next few weeks explaining how they ll make a success of Brexit in her place   A purity contest is well under way as candidates try to demonstrate they are the most Brexity of them all If you voted for May s Brexit deal or failed to resign after the Chequers agreement then you ve got a lot of explaining to do 
MAY27	Wanted: a modern Thomas Cromwell to mend Brexit Britain	 But his greatest ambition for England is this the prince and his commonwealth should be in accord a household where everybody knows what they have to do and feels safe doing it The hopes of Thomas Cromwell as imagined by novelist Hilary Mantel in Bring Up the Bodies the second in her Tudor trilogy were high even then now they seem laughably improbable For who in the present emergency knows what they have to do Not our elected leaders nor us it seems when it came to these European elections rarely has a poll provoked as much bewildered debate about how best to ensure accurate representation of one s political wishes  Where is the man or woman who can discreetly manoeuvre the politicians 
MAY27	I regret not learning my mum’s first language. Britain needs those ties	When I was a child we had a ritual at the end of every meal Tack f r maten we would each intone as we licked our cutlery and placed it on our plates Vars god my mother would say as she slammed down the fruit bowl My mother hated cooking so she couldn t actually claim that it had been a pleasure or that we were very welcome as the phrase implies The important thing was that we had thanked her for the food as instructed and in the language instructed Her children might be irritating but at least they were reasonably polite  I thought of this after watching the usual doom unfold on the nightly news last Wednesday when a clip popped up of toddlers not politicians actual toddlers listening to nursery rhymes as they wriggled in their parents laps As they listened their parents were singing along in Yoruba Children born to Nigerians in this country and who had only ever spoken English were happily singing in Yoruba As I watched I felt like joining in 
MAY27	For the sake of our health, we need to kick the indoor habit	As a species we need to get out more Humans now spend so much time indoors that many of us are cultivating a variety of serious health complaints and for some they could be fatal It is not so much that outdoor time is inherently good more that our bodies are built to anticipate it and the way we live now is confusing to our systems Nearly two decades ago a study published in Nature magazine concluded that the average American spent of their time indoors And that was before tablets and smartphones  In trying to cope with the shaded sedentary world we have made our bodies wage war on what should be harmless antigens they fail to make bones strong enough to support our weight even our eyes struggle to focus without the help of lenses This incremental creep across the threshold to the great indoors began tens of thousands of years ago when the first settled communities emerged 
MAY27	Labour members should vote now on our support for a second Brexit referendum	Labour s problem in the EU election was simple but fundamental It had overwhelmingly remain members but a Brexit message It was a remain party whose leader played both sides so unconvincingly that as Lloyd George said of Sir John Simon the architect of appeasement He has sat on the fence so long the iron has entered his soul  For the sake of the country and the party we now have to be clear about our opposition to Brexit For me personally the election was excruciating Resistance to Brexit is the logic of everything Labour stands for Yet instead of an unambiguous statement of support for a referendum with an option to stay in the EU we fought on a formula akin to the design manual for a submarine and one never intended to come to the surface Labour party members as well as supporters were angry and bemused 
MAY27	Ken Loach has competition: meet the new heroes of socially conscious cinema	 This year s Cannes film festival staged a clash that might have passed viewers by namely a fight between good old fashioned social realism and a new politically conscious cinema one also concerned with probing sociopolitical injustice but in a looser more refracted way 
MAY28	Labour voters want to come home, but the party must prove it will resist Brexit	Nothing has changed to coin a phrase  Once again Labour has lost an election and once again we ve spent the weekend trapped in the same old Groundhog Day routine Jeremy Corbyn trots out the same Brexit line but with more emphasis on a second referendum and less on all the caveats to make it look as if something radical has changed simultaneously others talk down the idea that it has 
MAY28	Tory leadership contender Rory Stewart makes me cringe, but at least he listens	On bank holiday Monday Conservative MP Rory Stewart left his constituency of Penrith and The Border and went walkabout Calling on voters to approach him for a chat or a challenge he then posted short videos and pictures with captions on social media In one video he is chatting in rusty Dari to a Barking resident originally from Kabul in another photo he is sitting in Costa Coffee on his laptop inviting people to come find him like a Tinder hopeful still in denial that their date has not turned up It was a sight both novel and cringemaking as he seemed unable to find the right register or physical mien  Stewart is a Tory MP straight out of central casting Eton PPE at Oxford the Foreign Office OBE FRSL FRSGS ETC
MAY28	As a newly elected Green MEP and a refugee, I’ve got a message for the far right	I am honoured to have been elected as a Green party MEP I can t wait to get to work on behalf of all those who put their faith in me and in our movement s vision of hope We are truly building a common world rooted in the aspirations of the young and set to deliver lasting change for all  Millions of citizens from Sheffield to Stuttgart have grown weary of the same old politics of tribal allegiances
MAY28	Are ‘weed tampons’ the answer to period pain?	I have spent the past minutes sprawled in an undignified position on the floor experimenting with cannabis suppositories This isn t a typical Monday night for me I ll have you know I am doing it in the name of science Specifically I am doing it to see whether weed tampons can get rid of period pain  There is a distinct possibility that I just lost of my male readers The squeamishness surrounding menstruation is part of the reason that little effort has been made to find effective treatments for premenstrual syndrome PMS and period pain Want to hear some rage inducing stats There have been five times as many studies into erectile dysfunction as there have been into PMS That is despite the fact that of women have experienced PMS while only of men have been affected by ED Period pain can be debilitating but women are still expected to suffer through it with just ibuprofen or a hot water bottle 
MAY28	Tommy Robinson was humiliated in the EU elections. Here’s how we helped do it	One of the highlights of Sunday night was a clearly stunned Tommy Robinson real name Stephen Yaxley Lennon fleeing the count in Manchester after realising that his hope of becoming an MEP was shattered He polled just taking only votes in the north west and lost his deposit  When he first announced his candidacy it seemed inconceivable that the man who had founded the English Defence League could become an MEP Yet we also knew that he was the best known far right activist since the second world war and better known than most of our politicians 
MAY28	A great EU election result for the Lib Dems. Now the hard work starts	Way back in I went to the launch in Oxford Town Hall of my friend Martin Stott s book Spilling the Beans subtitled A style guide to the new age where he coined the phrase the Muesli Belt He meant the places where ex hippies and other inner directed types were downshifting to  A few years later in the Green party leapt to third place in the European elections with of the vote its best ever national election result 
MAY28	Farage’s victory means the Tories will be led by a Brexiteer, not a compromiser	The Conservatives didn t drop to a vote share in the European election without losing a chunk of voters to remain parties there was a major swing to the Lib Dems but they will hear only one message they are under threat from Nigel Farage  That message is probably correct The Brexit party which Farage formed only four months ago has just won a national election and it has done it on Tory territory The Conservatives are also a Brexit party but one at a considerable disadvantage they are the dopes tasked with delivering the thing As such they have been entirely unable to capture its spirit which is something naturally allergic to the practicalities of leaving Europe purist anti institution and scornful of compromise All this was rammed home to Tory MPs by the results with the added reminder that the leave remain split is not going away any time soon 
MAY28	The far right didn’t sweep the EU elections. Europe’s centre is holding	It turns out that the widespread predictions of a far right takeover of the European parliament were as Mark Twain famously said about reports of his death greatly exaggerated Citizens across Europe flocked to the ballot box in numbers unseen since the s The young in particular turned out And they did not deliver a rightwing populist surge  A political shift is undoubtedly under way and rightwing populism is still very much around But the real story was the evidence of a new pluralism emerging in EU politics including a Green and liberal surge None of this imperils the EU s survival quite the contrary Nor will it lead to a paralysis of its institutions although coalition building will be trickier than before Given the doomsday scenarios doing the rounds this is good news 
MAY28	Reality TV and Victorian freak shows have an uncomfortable amount in common	Following the suicide of year old Stephen Dymond a week after appearing on The Jeremy Kyle Show reality TV has come under attack ITV has been condemned The Jeremy Kyle Show has been cancelled and the digital culture media and sports committee has launched an investigation into production companies duty of care to participants on their shows  Yet popular culture has always thrived on the exposure of troubled and vulnerable individuals Back in the so called Greatest Showman PT Barnum found fame by displaying an elderly and paralysed slave named Joice Heth She was probably suffering from dementia She was billed as the year old nurse of George Washington and lugged across the US as punters poked and prodded her ailing body which Barnum exhibited in taverns and pleasure gardens He once claimed to have starved her and forcibly removed her teeth to make her appear more credible When she died aged about her body was publicly dissected in front of a paying crowd and Barnum was on his way to stardom 
MAY28	Access to menstrual health and hygiene is a right. Period.	That time of the month shark week Aunt Flow on your rags the flowers period  There are more than different terms that we use globally to describe menstruation other than the word itself We have so many code words and euphemisms because in sadly many of us are still uncomfortable talking openly about periods Don t you think it s time we got over it 
MAY29	Forget Boris Johnson. The Tory leader could come from the centre	Something important and wholly without precedent is happening in plain sight in British politics but not enough attention is being paid to it The something is that never before has a new British prime minister been chosen by the grassroots members of the ruling political party Such a thing might have happened in when Tony Blair resigned but Gordon Brown was chosen unopposed It nearly happened in after David Cameron stepped down but in the end the other candidates stood aside in favour of Theresa May  Now it s the third time it could happen and this one is almost certain to be different There are already candidates in the field to succeed May Five more are said to be weighing whether to join Many will fall at the first and subsequent hurdles in June when Tory MPs begin a series of elimination votes in Westminster But it would be a surprise if this contest does not go all the way to a two person runoff among the party members in July If it does that will be a historic first a national leader chosen by a party membership not by parliamentarians or the wider public 
MAY29	Women, being married needn’t make you unhappy – if you choose the right man	Tchuh women Never bloody happy are they Except it turns out they are just not in the way they were told to be and thought they should be According to a new book by Paul Dolan a professor of behavioural science at the London School of Economics marriage and children do not despite several millennia of literature claiming otherwise give women the sought after happy ending In fact they put them at higher risk of physical and mental conditions than their single counterparts Dolan does not specify whether those mental conditions include insanity from watching the same Peppa Pig episode times  Now I m going to take some things for granted the first of which is that Dolan is referring to heterosexual married couples as is implied by how he has discussed his findings so far The second is that the people Dolan interviewed are answering honestly or at least do so eventually By some measure my favourite part of these findings is that while married people express greater happiness than other groups they do so only when their spouse is in the room When the spouse is not present fucking miserable Dolan said at the Hay festival last weekend And yet while married men reap some benefits from their misery longer life better earnings married women can only look forward to dying sooner than their single happier counterparts 
MAY29	How a radical new form of anti-racism can save Labour	An announcement by the Equality and Human Rights Commission EHRC that it is launching a formal investigation into antisemitism in the Labour party is one more sign that the controversy cannot be addressed by internal procedures alone Was it ever solvable through the party s own efforts There was a time when I thought it might be  Even before Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader of the Labour party in September there was deep disquiet in sections of the British Jewish community about what was perceived as his tolerance for Islamist terrorist groups Following his election repeated instances of antisemitic comments in the burgeoning Corbynite grassroots further stoked alarm The attempted coup against Corbyn s leadership in June deepened the problem with non Corbynite Jewish party members and those within the Jewish Labour Movement in particular becoming the focus of anger from some who supported Corbyn s transformation of the party 
MAY29	Instead of kicking out Alastair Campbell, Labour should listen to him	As a dead cat Alastair Campbell has proved most effective You ll recall the advice of the rightwing election guru Lynton Crosby who recommended that a politician about to face a scandal or crushing revelation throw a dead cat on the table onlookers might be appalled even disgusted but at least you d have changed the subject  On Tuesday confirmation came that the Equality and Human Rights Commission is to investigate the Labour party over anti Jewish racism That is a very big deal Only one political party has come under EHRC scrutiny before and that was the BNP It should be a day of shame that an organisation that likes to boast that combating prejudice is in its DNA is now under investigation for that very offence And make no mistake the EHRC does not make such a move lightly It only rarely undertakes a full scale investigation the last comparable inquiry was into the Metropolitan police several years ago Human rights lawyers who work closely with the EHRC say the commission would not launch a full investigation into Labour unless they had seen evidence of institutional racism that was credible and serious 
MAY29	The BBC ripped off my Slay in Your Lane slogan – now I’m being attacked	In my best friend Elizabeth Uviebinen sent me a picture of Solange Knowles at Paris fashion week basking in the pre release glow of a seminal album and coming into her own after years under the moniker Beyonc s little sister She captioned it Slay in Your Lane I rang Elizabeth to say it would be the name of the book we were going to write a guide to life aimed at black British women featuring advice from trailblazing interviewees  We hadn t come across the phrase elsewhere and thought it was clever so in we trademarked it The BBC thought it was clever too last week our readers began to notify us of billboards they had seen emblazoned with the slogan Most who contacted us assumed since it used a bold font like the one on the cover of our book and was fronted by Dina Asher Smith a successful black British sprinter that there was some affiliation or that we were at least aware of the BBC s use of the slogan for its campaign We weren t and immediately made contact with the BBC We received no response for four days 
MAY29	Corbyn could come out fighting with a rebellious remain and reform agenda	Against the backdrop of the Tories historic European elections clusterflop Labour s results were merely bad The natural party of government saw its vote share eroded by the Brexit party so badly that it was forced to endure its worst performance at a national election since Tory leadership hopefuls looking to placate the infuriated Conservative grassroots are already butching up talk of a no deal Brexit an outcome that parliament simply will not tolerate  The Tory party would split if it pursued a soft Brexit deal with Labour votes it would split if a new leader ran on taking Britain out of the EU to trade on World Trade Organization rules Brexit represents a fundamental crisis for the governing party It s important to make this distinction not to excuse the poor showing of Jeremy Corbyn s party but to emphasise that Labour unlike the Conservatives has a way out of its Brexit bind 
MAY29	Most of us feel sleepy in the afternoon. Why can’t work fit round that?	In the early afternoon I often catch myself listlessly staring into the computer screen I have things to do but I can t concentrate I try writing the same sentence five times and delete it six During one of these afternoon torpors I came upon a word acedia It seemed to perfectly define my mid afternoon weariness I discovered this originally Greek word was widely used by medieval Christian monks to describe a sense of indolence a mood of lethargy a feeling of being completely unconcerned about their duties and purpose in the world Christian mystics who lived in the Egyptian deserts during the rd century AD often complained about being haunted by the noon day demon  One monk of the time described how the noon day demon would make the sun appear sluggish and immobile and cause monks to continually look at the window and forces him to gaze at the sun This cruel demon sends him hatred against the place against life itself and against the work of his hands and makes him think he has lost the love among his brethren and there is none to comfort him 
MAY29	Labour shouldn’t be the party of leave or remain, but a force to unite the country	While hot takes on the European election results come in all flavours there should be at least two things we all agree on First it was a bad night for Labour and second that the country is as bitterly divided as ever  As the Labour party wrestles with whether or not it backs a public vote the clock ticks down to Halloween and our latest exit date With a surging Brexit party and a Conservative leadership contest under way the prospects for a more extreme version of departure grow by the day As Conservative candidates seek to win back voters from the anti EU populists ruling out no deal is for most no longer an option 
MAY29	Look at the queue to be Tory leader. No-deal Brexit is more likely than ever	When it comes to Brexit all I can think about now are the lyrics to The Windmills of Your Mind Like a circle in a spiral Like a wheel within a wheel Never ending or beginning  The forthcoming Tory leadership contest is just the latest spiral Every candidate whether Kit Malthouse or Boris Johnson will be outlining their cunning Baldrick like plans to force the European Union to renegotiate the UK s withdrawal on October In practical terms that will be nigh on impossible in view of both the UK parliament s timetable and the new European commission not being in place until November What is also being ignored is that the article agreement that Theresa May signed up to with the October extension clearly states in clause This extension excludes any re opening of the withdrawal agreement 
MAY29	A tax on red meat? That won’t save the planet – or do much to improve our health	The devil is a shape shifter not least when he takes the form of demonic foods In response the armies of the righteous have already waged war on sugar and now red meat is in their sights This time their cause seems doubly just Red meat we are told is not only bad for our health but the belching and farting ruminants that we farm are ruinous for the planet  Emboldened by the apparent success of the sugary drinks tax the weapon of choice to slay this monster is a similar levy on meat Oxford University s professor of population health Mike Rayner has even done the maths and concludes that we need to tax red meat by and processed meat by at least to offset their costs to human health 
MAY30	Mueller stopped short of calling Trump a criminal, but did we need him to?	Did Donald Trump repeatedly break the law by trying to block multiple investigations into his mysteriously intimate relationship with Russia  The answer is rather similar to questions about the pope s Catholicism and the propensity of bears to poop in the woods 
MAY30	John Cleese isn’t alone in equating ‘English’ with white. Sadly, that view is mainstream	 Some years ago I opined that London was not really an English city any more is how John Cleese began a tweet on Wednesday Since then virtually all my friends from abroad have confirmed my observation When eight long years ago he made a similar claim he gave us the unabridged version I m not sure what s going on in Britain he said while appearing on an Australian TV programme Let me say this I don t know what s going on in London because London is no longer an English city and that s how they got the Olympics They said We re the most cosmopolitan city on Earth but it doesn t feel English  He bemoans immigrants in London but because of race and class he s called an expat in the Caribbean
MAY30	My friend Walter Wolfgang’s life was a portrait in moral courage	Donald Trump flies into the UK next week and we will be treated to the surreal spectacle of a widely reviled president meeting a defeated prime minister amid scenes of pomp ceremony and protest  For all the high level meetings he will attend the president would gain far more by staying home and learning about the life of my friend Walter Wolfgang who died this week at the age of A lifelong peace activist he was preoccupied in his final days by Trump and his growing belligerence towards Iran 
MAY30	Young climate strikers could achieve even more by joining a union	Union membership in recent decades has been in stark decline The picture has been particularly bleak over the past years when it comes to young people  Fewer than one in workers under the age of are now in a union according to figures from the Office for National Statistics released on Thursday The proportion of unionised to year old workers has halved since from to with a similar pattern among to year olds 
MAY30	There’s a new battle for Britain: resistance to Nigel Farage	All political parties were too self absorbed to see it coming but Nigel Farage s European election vote created a new dividing line in British politics taking us well beyond the leave remain split that has defined Britain since the referendum and threatens to dominate its politics for the foreseeable future  In the three years since when we should have been debating the bigger issue that the referendum raised what kind of Britain we want to become our rulers have been obsessed with one very narrow question not even our future relationship with Europe but merely the terms of our departure from it 
MAY30	I know antidepressant withdrawal symptoms are real. Why didn’t doctors?	It s something of a relief to see before you written down in black and white what you have known to be true for a long time in this case that antidepressant withdrawal symptoms aren t well all in your head In a significant shift in position the Royal College of Psychiatrists now accepts that it has not paid enough attention to patients suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms when coming off antidepressants  Patients are to be warned by doctors when they are prescribed the drugs just how hard it can be to come off them Some will have been on them for years They will have tried to wean themselves off and been so alarmed by withdrawal symptoms mistaking them for a return of symptoms of their mental health condition that they have given up the struggle They will now be advised to use a gradual tapering off process 
MAY30	John Bercow staying on as Speaker makes a no-deal Brexit less likely	The Tories don t agree on much these days Some even want a general election now as a way to deliver what they view as a true Brexit However they can all get behind some good old fashioned John Bercow bashing Ministers report that the only good cabinet meetings these days are those where they can go around slagging off the House of Commons Speaker over his latest aggravating decision on Brexit  So Bercow s announcement that he has no plans to step down this summer or in the foreseeable will be generally ill received in the Tory party When it comes to the challenges any Conservative leader faces delivering Brexit the Speaker ranks in the top three alongside a hung parliament and Brussels reluctance to renegotiate 
MAY30	Mueller’s inaction over Trump has let the US down. Why is he holding back?	Robert Mueller has a reputation as a straight shooting play it by the book sort of guy That changed this week The special counsel s stated justifications for not accusing Donald Trump of obstruction of justice appear convoluted and legally dubious Mueller was a man hired to solve a mystery His odd decision to take refuge in questionable precedents and thereby effectively duck the issue has only compounded it  His two year investigation was admirable in many ways Unlike similar exercises in the past such as Kenneth Starr s s inquiry into Bill Clinton he kept his counsel did not leak to the media and completed the business within a reasonable timeframe His finding that there were multiple systematic Russian efforts to interfere in the presidential election is clear and unambiguous 
MAY30	Labour needs a reboot – and it could start with bringing back Ed Miliband	Labour needs a drastic reboot The Tories may be in existential crisis desperately flapping around in a rising tide of rightwing populism but Labour s hopes of securing the sizeable majority it needs to enact a transformative agenda are uncertain The Brexit mire has robbed the Corbyn project of its core identity a sense of insurgency stripped away its optimistic idealistic gloss and suppressed the enthusiasm of Labour s members and the voters most inspired by its manifesto Its desperate indeed honourable desire for a Brexit compromise in a painfully fractured nation to be the party that skilfully transcended the divisions bequeathed by a referendum result three years ago was remorselessly kicked to death in polling stations last week If the party s position was intended to be a Rorschach inkblot in which remainers or leavers could see what they wanted to see in the end all either saw was a splattered mess  It s clear that Labour is now pivoting to a pro referendum stance in backing a public vote on any deal parliament agrees Corbyn privately knows it must be done While there is some internal resistance within both his machine and the parliamentary party and it s easy to empathise with those who fear another referendum the shadow chancellor John McDonnell is among those pushing for a decisive shift in political strategy That will surely succeed the game is up here even if there remains no majority in parliament for a referendum but a political reorientation must be spelt out in primary colours or the party might as well not bother The mixed messages from leading figures must cease When Corbyn eventually makes his big speech committing Labour to a new stance it should be done with gusto and it should be unequivocal It should mourn the passing of the party s heartfelt attempt to bridge a divide made impossible by the Tories calamitous mishandling of the process it should be clear that left with a choice of no deal or another referendum no alternative remains and it should directly appeal to those leavers who have suffered most from Britain s broken social order with a bold compelling economic vision 
MAY30	Robert Mueller made clear: he couldn't have indicted Trump even if he wanted to	For those who hoped that Robert Mueller s first public comments since his report was released would do what it failed to free us from a demagogue who has taken American democracy hostage Wednesday must have come as a disappointment If Mueller s parting words as special counsel had a familiar ring it is because they echoed often verbatim statements that appear in his lengthy report  And yet in his characteristically restrained manner Mueller did I believe seek to set the record straight on his report s most contested conclusion 
MAY31	Opium-pipers, bluffers and no-dealers impress in this Tory battle of nonentities	The official tagline for the Tory leadership contest is EXPERIENCE MAGIC THIS SUMMER Its key value divide is between candidates who would smoke opium at an Iranian wedding and candidates who would order a drone strike on one We haven t even begun to hear from frontrunner Boris Johnson that flytipped sofa who will probably be endorsed next week by visiting indignitary Donald Trump  Still plenty to be getting on with Esther McVey would order you a drone strike no problem The only issue is whether she d be able to get all the gays in one place This week Esther waded into the grimly regressive row about LGBT teaching suggesting that parents should have the right to deny their children educational access to reality I m paraphrasing As she put it I believe parents know best for their children Yes babe That s why measles is back That s why you personally defend the refusal to pay a mother benefits for her third child unless she can prove she was raped 
MAY31	Politics may be broken. But it’s only politics that can save us	No one would cast Robert Mueller as the lead in a romcom And yet watching him deliver a statement on Wednesday regarding his inquiry into Donald Trump Russia and obstruction of justice was to experience a sensation familiar to all romcom devotees  It comes when the hero needs to reveal his true feelings but instead becomes tongue tied Hugh Grant built a career on that moment You the audience are willing him to ditch the sub clauses and double negatives and just spit it out You formulate the sentence in your head it s simple and straightforward But he just can t get the words out 
MAY31	Want to be Tory leader and say you’re a feminist? Show us how, exactly	Actions speak louder than words And certainly T shirts Do you remember a few years back when various celebs and politicians from Benedict Cumberbatch to Nick Clegg posed in This Is What A Feminist Looks Like T shirts It s always dodgy when men do this stuff Most women just think Why don t you get on with being a good ally Walk alongside us not in front of us  Yet this particular identity debate has now surfaced in the Tory leadership contest which is suddenly chock a block with some unlikely specimens claiming to be feminists Of course the leadership contest in which or so rank and file members of the Tory party choose the next prime minister would do well to drape itself in T shirts carrying This Is Not What Democracy Looks Like slogans for it is indeed an affront to the very notion 
MAY31	What the new Lib Dem leader needs to do to make the party’s comeback last	When Vince Cable set a date for stepping aside as Lib Dem leader back in March it seemed clear that the contest to replace him would be about saving the party from oblivion It was lagging far behind in the polls still suffering from its poor performance in the general election and everyone was talking about the terrible threat it faced from a brand new centre party Change UK The task of the next leader was big but it was also fairly simple to be a fresh face and to persuade Change UK and the Greens to make pacts with them  They have spent nine years recovering from the last time they gained some traction with voters
MAY31	It’s time Corbyn reflected his own party, and opposed Brexit	There is a problem at the heart of the Labour party when the leader whips his MPs to support a motion calling for a confirmatory ballot on the prime minister s Brexit deal and the chair of the party abstains For a backbench MP to break the whip is bad enough but for a member of the shadow cabinet to break collective responsibility is rare especially when it goes without sanction  The dilemma helped shape Labour s EU election catastrophe The party sat on the fence with the leader looking both ways sometimes towards a confirmatory ballot sometimes towards Brexit From Ian Lavery s recent Guardian article it is obvious he was off the fence walking the fields where Brexit roams Labour has paid the price 
MAY31	The Tories must do the unthinkable when selecting their leader, and forget Brexit	Dominic Raab wants us to know that he s the man to negotiate with Brussels Or at least his friends do Writing in the Daily Telegraph yesterday the former Tory MP Nick de Bois recalled his time as Raab s chief of staff at the Brexit department It s a paean that reaches a climax with a description of Michel Barnier ripping out his earpiece and includes the line I have seen Dominic Raab look Michel Barnier in the eye and it wasn t Dominic who blinked first Which is joyous news if you use ocular moisture levels as your marker of greatness  Not everyone agrees that Raab played a blinder in Brussels In the recent BBC documentary Brexit Behind Closed Doors we do indeed see Barnier tell a meeting that Raab made threats Theresa May never dared to say but he also claims that Raab immediately backed down when challenged He immediately took his words back he is not always into nuances Dominic Raab So much for the Art of the Deal 
MAY31	This broken House of Lords doesn’t need reform. It needs scrapping	Imagine this for a gig You get paid for doing no discernible work occasionally get to wear some funky looking scarlet and ermine robes prance around one of the world s most iconic buildings and even have subsidised meals thrown into the bargain This is lifestyle that David Brookman a Labour peer in the House of Lords might recognise according to a Guardian investigation You as a taxpayer forked out the equivalent of two nurses salary last year in attendance and travel expenses for Baron Brookman of Ebbw Vale who in a month period didn t participate in a single debate or submit any written questions Still who needs nurses  One in nine peers in a full year between and did not participate in any House of Lords business defined as speaking in a debate holding a government post or participating in a committee and didn t even vote yet one of these still claimed a cool Lord Brookman did at least vote regularly 
MAY31	Racial abuse in the playground? That’s just England in 2019	To celebrate my youngest sister s birthday I take her out for lunch With five children between us conversation is snatched at any given time someone is asking for a crayon or spilling their drink or moaning It s a prosaic enough half term scene until my sister is suddenly reminded of something she wants to tell me Last week she recounts she d been walking down her local high street in a suburb of Bradford and heard a man shout out fucking dirty wog She thought he had been speaking to her but then realised he had been referring to her nine month old daughter  This is England in I write this because the impulse might be to claim it as only a singular moment and anachronistic Yet yesterday the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children NSPCC reported that racial abuse and bullying of children has risen by a fifth since 
MAY31	You can’t teach schoolchildren ‘resilience’ when they’re micromanaged every day	Don t tell the Conservative leadership candidates but the education secretary Damian Hinds is holding a brainstorming session He wants ideas on how we can toughen up British schoolchildren Clearly he knows something we don t about the future   To truly prepare for adult life we need to make sure our young people build character and resilience he announced last week as he launched a new C R initiative as it will doubtless be shortened to in education circles Yes GCSEs and A levels are important Hinds said but in years time exam results will be a distant memory Presumably Sats and Pisa rankings too the whole quasi mathematical surveillance matrix that Hinds and his predecessors have painstakingly constructed for our children these past few decades 
MAY31	Our glorious past is what we remember. The brutality behind it we’ve forgotten	Immediately after the second world war German people were required to watch documentaries about the horrors of the concentration camps before they could get their ration cards But the fact that they went Tony Judt points out in his book Postwar didn t mean they actually watched In the half light of the projector I could see that most people turned their faces away after the beginning of the film and stayed that way until the film was over wrote the German author Stephan Hermlin many years later Today I think that turned away face was indeed the attitude of many millions  As a German government official surveying the rise in antisemitic hate crimes in his country advises Jews not to assume they can wear the kippah everywhere all the time in Germany and an Italian far right party tops the poll for the European parliament we would do well to reflect on the corrosive impact of such determined forgetting These memories need to be recovered not only to honour those who have perished or suffered only to find their experiences discounted and discarded it is crucial for the moral potential and political vitality of the perpetrators too It is simply not possible to deliberately forget the terrible things you have done and then expect to proceed as though they did not happen and nobody noticed just because you have chosen not to remember 
JUN1	Sin taxes on meat or flying won’t change a climate hypocrite like me. Rationing might	A favourite sport of the anti green lobby is hunting out the climate hypocrites It s Emma Thompson s lifestyle that has most recently been the subject of frenzied scrutiny after the actress addressed the Extinction Rebellion protest in London a few weeks ago Emma Thompson the first class hypocrite blared one tabloid headline last month after she was spotted dining on beef carpaccio while flying first class to New York  So before I say any more about the lifestyle changes required to avoid catastrophic climate change I m going to hold my hands up I m a climate hypocrite I care about the climate emergency When I decided I couldn t support Labour in the European elections because of its Brexit position I voted Green instead But I m ashamed to say I m not great at applying my ballot box behaviour to other areas of my life The last time I ate red meat was last night I m heading to Gatwick to catch a flight after writing this 
JUN1	Both right and left should fear the justified rage of Remainers	The old parties are failing because they do not understand the driving forces of modern Britain identity authenticity and runaway disgust For much of Westminster and the media the only identity that matters is the identity of the working class Leave voter He is usually male and always white for the ethnic minority working class has been forgotten His authentic disgust will make the nation tremble if we do not bow to his wishes and give him the hardest Brexit imaginable  Forget that most of the Tory shires voted Leave or that young working class voters supported Remain or that the greatest predictor of attitudes to the EU is education not class or that the only solid promise the Leave campaign made was to keep us in the European free trade zone The story of the angry white working class is set and everyone is sticking to it 
JUN1	The Spice Girls: cake fights and catty talk – what could be better?	Spice World is it turns out only the group s fourth proper concert tour Today s young pop hoofers who never seem to be off the road or away from the endless churn of the promo rota must be wondering with some envy how the Spice Girls managed that Beatlesesque feat of live shyness  Thankfully despite some sound problems on the first few dates that muted vocals perhaps they programmed the stage set up assuming Victoria would be back they seem to have given fans what they really really want This is a nostalgia tour and everyone is up for it 
JUN1	We need to let people study later in life. Ask my dad	This September one of my oldest friends is going back to school Three decades on from her last essay crisis she ll be back in the land of freshers pub crawls and student railcards in pursuit of a new career that we didn t even know existed in our s And listening to her talk about summer reading lists I am seized with an unexpectedly sharp stab of envy Who doesn t occasionally dream of turning back the clock and starting over It should never be too late to experiment with something new or to unwind decisions blindly made decades ago  Yet mature students are an increasingly endangered species A midlife career change like this is a luxury most people who work for a living can t afford and it s those who most need to retrain men and women panicking that their jobs are disappearing from underneath them thanks to technological change or those who messed up at school and only later came to regret it who are most firmly stuck When Philip Augar the banker appointed by the government to lead a review of further and higher education in England launched his findings this week he included plans to resuscitate lifelong learning and was at pains to argue that education beyond shouldn t just be about teenagers going on to university But the headlines inevitably were all about tuition fees

JUN2	The reason Britain rolls out the red carpet for Trump? It’s what Britain does	This time it s a full blown state visit rather than the brief smash and grab when Donald Trump insulted Theresa May beefed with Sadiq Khan and triggered a domestic mini culture war because of a blimp The buildup to this week s pageantry was trailed on Sky News with an advertisement featuring an animation of that Donald Trump blimp casting a shadow over London with the tag line He s back with ominous music accompanying it as if the whole affair were some sort of comedy horror Ghostbusters movie We have skipped the tragedy part of history repeating itself and gone straight to the farce  Hosting him right now is like asking your pugnacious neighbour over in the middle of your family row
JUN2	The Tories have drunk the no-deal Brexit Kool-Aid	Sam Gyimah on Sunday became the th contender to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader Just think if only four more Tories join the contest there will be one candidate for every single percentage point the party racked up in this weekend s Observer Opinium poll a paltry nine behind the Brexit party which now for the first time leads the pack in Westminster voting intention Now that s what I call a target  Yes it s only one survey of popular opinion But the poll enshrines the fundamental problem confronting the Conservatives in this race It also helps to explain why the support of Donald Trump for Boris Johnson will not harm his chances in these very specific circumstances and why Nigel Farage is playing such a central role in the whole fetid business One way the normal way of considering this election is to assess each of the candidates as a prospective leader of party and nation If the Tories are wise they will consider carefully the claims of Jeremy Hunt a seasoned veteran of government who has already proved to be a much more capable foreign secretary than Johnson to be fair he could hardly be worse Matt Hancock in spite of his sticky interview on Newsnight last week is the future facing candidate especially good on the social implications of the technological revolution Penny Mordaunt is so to speak the woke Brexiteer a true believer in the UK s departure from the EU who is also a committed social liberal 
JUN2	When Guardian readers write a letter, it’s very different to when they email or call	Instant communication mainly email is preferred by most readers who want to bring a matter to the attention of a readers editor But a small proportion of them still send letters through the post and as well as a rich variety of stationery handwriting and home printer typefaces they showcase what might be called the slowness effect  Emails and phone calls naturally relate mostly to very recently published material and to the most prominent and controversial issues of the day These communications may be formulated in anger or exasperation and sent with haste that is evidenced by typos and misspellings which don t matter so long as colleagues and I can understand the gist the important thing is that readers are engaged and reacting 
JUN2	My constituency voted to leave. But I still want Labour to oppose Brexit	Labour s position on a confirmatory referendum seems to shift daily but even if every Labour MP backed one we d still need either government support or Tory MPs breaking the whip And there are still Labour MPs holding sincere reservations about the prospect including colleagues I respect tremendously like Gloria De Piero and Lisa Nandy  Like them I campaigned to remain in the European Union yet represent an area where a majority voted to leave in We all see at first hand the damage the Tories are doing to our communities and we share a determination to secure a Labour government elected on a genuinely transformative platform 
JUN2	Britain can’t be reborn while we’re still lost in fantasies about the past	England in A wannabe Thatcher dethroned a wannabe Churchill readying in the wings Welcome to the age of tribute act politics The policies that Boris Johnson and his rivals will soon unveil will be just as retro cover version rip offs warmed up Thatcherism rightwing comfort food to appeal to the most extreme of their fellow MPs the dregs of their dull race as Shelley might have called them  But Johnson s Churchill lite shtick and Theresa May s even less convincing Iron Lady routine are only even vaguely viable because they tap into a fantasy version of British history that has contaminated visions of our conceivable future 
JUN2	Trump’s banning of Huawei could be the beginning of the biggest trade war ever	Until recently the only thing the average citizen could have told you about Huawei the Chinese tech giant was that s he hadn t the faintest idea of how to pronounce it it s hwa wei btw according to Wikipedia And then suddenly this unpronounceable company seemed to be all over the news Now it s at the centre of a burgeoning geopolitical row How did that happen  I blame the Australians who have a government only marginally less dysfunctional than our own According to a Reuters report in early they asked their top spooks a question With all the offensive cyber tools at their disposal what harm could they inflict if they had access to equipment installed in the G network the next generation mobile communications technology of a target nation The spooks came back with a sombre assessment the offensive potential of G was so great they reported that if Australia were on the receiving end of such attacks the country s critical infrastructure could be seriously sabotaged 
JUN2	It’s not his enemies but his erstwhile friends who are alarming Mr Corbyn	In politics it is not your enemies who are the death of you The game is up when you lose those you once called friends The curtain finally came down on Theresa May when previously loyal Tory MPs declared that it was time for her to book a removal van The most alarming development since the European elections for Jeremy Corbyn is not the sound of Tom Watson and other familiar foes challenging him It is the anger of those whom he once counted as allies  The catalyst for a week of recriminations was Labour winning just of the vote the worst performance in a nationwide election since when the party was still in its infancy This was a bit better than the more catastrophic result for the Tories but emotionally it has been more of a shock to Labour because at least the Conservatives had warning that they were going to be obliterated In its former stronghold of Scotland Labour came in fifth with a vote share in single figures In Wales another historic bastion it was third Even in London the spiritual heart of Corbynism the party was drubbed into second place by the Lib Dems

JUN2	Jack the Ripper’s victims had to be whores. Anyone saying different risks a trolling	You don t need to spend much time on Twitter to know that the surest way to upset certain people is to challenge their preferred version of events but if you want to watch those people by and large white male Anglo Saxons explode in real time the social media site does provide a ringside seat  The historian Hallie Rubenhold made headlines last week when I interviewed her at the Hay festival about her book The Five a biography of the victims of Jack the Ripper and about the response to it from so called Ripperologists those obsessive devotees of the most famous unsolved murders in history who gather in murky forums to play amateur detective 
JUN2	The Spice Girls: cake fights and catty talk – what could be better?	Spice World is it turns out only the group s fourth proper concert tour Today s young pop hoofers who never seem to be off the road or away from the endless churn of the promo rota must be wondering with some envy how the Spice Girls managed that Beatlesesque feat of live shyness  Thankfully despite some sound problems on the first few dates that muted vocals perhaps they programmed the stage set up assuming Victoria would be back they seem to have given fans what they really really want This is a nostalgia tour and everyone is up for it 
JUN3	Brexiters beware: Donald Trump will trample all over our sovereignty	A diagram has been doing the rounds on Twitter related to the protests that will greet the three day visit of the US president Split into pizza slice segments it lays out the various causes and categories making up the anti Trump offensive Women is one while families anti corporate greed Europe and Labour and union also feature The format has prompted some puzzlement what for example if I m a woman and a member of a union and I m pro Europe and I m not wild about corporate greed What if a man were to be pro women and also a member of the Labour party  Any confusion on the left ends there though Because we know where we stand on Donald Trump We know why his state visit repels us and we know why receiving him with all this pomp and ceremony is an insult to any proper notion of patriotism We don t need to go back over the arguments about pussy grabbing or consider again the implications of separating migrant children from their parents and imprisoning them to clarify where we are on this president 
JUN3	China continues to deny Tiananmen, but we won’t let the world forget	He was just a kid but he cried like an old man in despair Liane was trying hard to steady her emotions when she described to me how she had attempted to hold back a young boy whose unarmed brother had been shot by soldiers during the Tiananmen massacre  Liane was a student from Hong Kong when the Tiananmen movement erupted and she went to Beijing to support the demonstrations On the night of June when soldiers equipped with tanks and AK s were deployed against unarmed civilians she was outside the Museum of the Chinese Revolution on the north east corner of Tiananmen Square She fainted after she failed to stop the young boy from dashing toward the soldiers and was carried away covered with blood 
JUN3	I was on Love Island in 2018. This is what ITV needs to get right this year	As a doctor working in a busy hospital A E in south east London I thought spending the summer of in the sun as a contestant on the ITV reality show Love Island wouldn t be all that difficult Sun sea attractive people and best of all no mobile phones how hard could it be It turns out I couldn t have been more wrong If the contestants in the new series are expecting a relaxed summer of sun by the pool they are in for a shock  From the moment my phone was taken off me as part of the pre show preparations I realised it was not going to be a walk in the park There would be no speaking to friends or family or knowing what was happening in the outside world Then came the dreaded entrance to the Love Island villa in which the men walk in one by one to a line of female contestants who are waiting ready to step forward for you or stay in line and reject you My turn came and I stood there shaking as my worst fears were realised no one stepped forward I felt sick and ashamed knowing that very soon millions of people would see my humiliation including all my family friends and colleagues 
JUN3	I’ve had children at school for 27 years. At last I can stop pretending to like it	School s out for ever Just one more week and I will be free FREE I cannot tell you how I long for the end of school You see in the bizarre sociological experiment that is my life I have had one child or another in school for about years and my youngest finishes next week I have done my time Obviously I sacrificed my offspring for the sake of my political principles so these were state schools of course I never ever want to hear another person saying they believe in state education but just not for their very special child Pray that I never need to inhale the stench of that angsty hypocrisy again while some dolt explains it is only natural to want the best for one s children as though I want the worst for mine  Gentrification is there in the class pictures Those of my eldest are racially mixed and those of my youngest are not
JUN3	The wrangling to become Tory leader is turning Britain into an oligarchy	Meanwhile back at the ranch Britain must choose a new prime minister and fast Donald Trump may have been elected by just or million Americans but Britain s leader will be chosen by just members of a benighted Conservative party And those members must choose between two candidates preselected by their party s MPs This is like some kind of oligarchy If they are so obsessed by honouring a referendum on the EU why not a national referendum on who should be prime minister  In reality government by party in parliament has generally worked well and deserves respect That a nation s elected executive should be able to rely on a stable Commons majority is sound democracy as any observer of America s divisive constitution might attest The current trouble is that the EU referendum shattered that stability The Tories casually toppled Theresa May for negotiating what they knew in their heads if not their hearts was the only responsible way forward a soft Brexit deal They have now gone mad All the candidates to succeed her are promising they can make pigs fly 
JUN3	Why UK feminists should embrace sex worker rights	 Puta Feminista Feminist Whore reads the banner taped to the wall as women stream through the door at the Casa Roja Freshly painted the bright red casa is in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Constituci n in the heart of the red light district After today it will be the new centre for Ammar the Argentina s Women s Sex Workers Union  On any one day up to women arrive morning noon and night to find clients on the corners of the neighbourhood Lilian has been a sex worker for years She stopped working but has been forced to return to the streets of Constituci n to make ends meet We re in the midst of a total crisis she says We used to work four to five hours a day Now it s including on Saturdays and Sundays just to cover the basic necessities Dramatic inflation which reached nearly last year combined with a reduction in subsidies by the rightwing government under Mauricio Macri and at the behest of the International Monetary Fund IMF have sent the cost of basic foodstuffs electricity and water spiralling A third of the population are living in poverty 
JUN3	Killdren are unlucky – 2019 just isn’t the year for songs about killing Tories	Since its inception Glastonbury festival has been a safe haven for political dissent but it seems there are limits Over the weekend the Sunday Times reported that one of the bands booked to play the festival s Shangri La field two bit rave punk band Killdren had released a song called Kill Tory Scum Before They Kill You The paper also noted that the critically acclaimed London band Fat White Family had tweeted in in reference to a news story about the death toll of austerity If you voted Tory in the last election you have blood on your hands Execute the fucking lot of them SCUM Catherine Anderson chief executive of the Jo Cox Foundation told the BBC The direct incitement of violence and abuse on any platform and in any sector is wrong and something that we absolutely reject Within hours Shangri La had cancelled Killdren s booking although Fat White Family are still scheduled to play the Park stage  The outrage is excessive It s obvious from one listen to Kill Tory Scum Even if it s your dad or your mum kill Tory scum that the song is absurd bratty hyperbole not to be taken literally Shangri La s hasty statement was rather sanctimonious claiming that the field is all about positivity and pacifism unity and love criteria that it would be ridiculous to apply to every lyric by every artist After they lost their slot the band defended the cartoonish and over the top nature of everything we do Won t somebody think of the Killdren The case against Fat White Family is even weaker based on one four year old tweet but the controversy says a great deal about Britain s febrile political climate in 
JUN3	Is Northern Ireland a democracy or a police state?	Those who investigate the dark aftermath of conflict walk on dangerous ground The murder by dissident republicans of Lyra McKee in April was a chilling reminder that there are paramilitaries who are still intent on dragging us back into the hostilities of the past Another case that has been playing out in Northern Ireland s legal system is a shocking warning that this may also be true of the police  This case yielded a great victory for press freedom in Belfast s high court last Friday but the two brave investigative journalists who brought it about are still caught in a nightmare worthy of Kafka They remain on police bail facing unspecified criminal charges This despite the fact that the highest judge in the Northern Irish state the lord chief justice has declared that on the basis of the evidence put before him they have done nothing wrong 
JUN3	The House of Lords needs reforming, but abolishing it is not the answer	Given the Guardian s reports on the House of Lords you might expect me in my role as Lord Speaker to come forward with some blanket defence I do not As this paper reported at the beginning of the year I am opposed to what I called passengers in the Lords who make no or very little contribution They are a minority but they undo much of the good work done by the vast majority  In the past months the House of Lords has made almost changes to improve legislation apart from daily oral questions peers have tabled more than written questions and taken part in more than debates while well over peers have been active members of select committees which have published more than reports on subjects ranging from tuition fees to intergenerational fairness 
JUN3	Britain is horribly divided – and that’s also the fault of remainers	In the buildup to the European elections I travelled around Britain and had the sense of people talking about the state of the country in wildly different ways Democracy is broken shouted a Brexit supporter in Swindon I met lifelong Tories on the affluent edges of the Cotswolds anxious about how England seems to be embracing the politics of extremes In Manchester everyone was remain but remarkably disengaged from the Brexit conversation In Merthyr Tydfil a woman who had voted for Nigel Farage s Brexit party offered the brisk rationale about her town that it s the same as it s always been so that s why we need a change In retrospect everything fitted the picture offered by that much discussed YouGov poll last week of a politics so turbulent that the Liberal Democrats are suddenly popular again Farage is newly insurgent and the two party carve up of seems like a distant memory What polling wouldn t pick up however was present in encounter after encounter woven into very different conversations a shared sense of weariness and exasperation  Clearly the debate about Brexit is hardening at speed Compromise options seem to have been killed off by the May vote leaving no deal and the revoking of article at the core of the argument The most passionate advocates of another public vote seem to see victory as a likely prospect barely pausing to think about the possible horrors of another referendum campaign And among the leave and remain hardcore there is something that is increasingly obvious loathing and denigration not just of the Brexit debate s figureheads but the millions of people seen as being on the wrong side of the argument 
JUN4	The climate crisis is our third world war. It needs a bold response	Advocates of the Green New Deal say there is great urgency in dealing with the climate crisis and highlight the scale and scope of what is required to combat it They are right They use the term New Deal to evoke the massive response by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the United States government to the Great Depression An even better analogy would be the country s mobilization to fight World War II  Critics ask Can we afford it and complain that Green New Deal proponents confound the fight to preserve the planet to which all right minded individuals should agree with a more controversial agenda for societal transformation On both accounts the critics are wrong 
JUN4	Brexiteers want a leader with Trump’s swagger. That would be the ruin of Britain	Donald Trump s presidency and Brexit have their own special relationship distinct from the celebrated th century alliance between the US and the UK The two projects were born a few months apart the surprise electoral twins of delivered in similar pangs of voter rage Both promised national renewal by defying foreigners Each was greeted as a monstrosity by liberal diplomats who liked the old special relationship being fond of the world order it represented  Three years later the delinquent siblings meet with Brexit Britain as host Trump as guest In developmental terms they are stuck in political toddlerhood struggling to articulate what they want and given to tantrums if not indulged But they are on their best behaviour for a formal state visit Trump laps up the pomp and frippery He has a tinpot potentate s vanity and appetite for parade ground sycophancy But the spectacle is also balm to the British ego especially the bruised Brexit part that feels insufficiently admired by the rest of the world Eurosceptics kid themselves that royal hospitality will be repaid with trade concessions while the pageantry animates a deeper nostalgia It connects a certain British audience to memories of unalloyed majesty when the gilded grandeur was a demonstration of hard imperial power 
JUN4	The military crackdown in Sudan lays bare the dark heart of Bashir’s regime	Even though it was not unexpected it is still horrifying To assume that the Sudanese revolution would manage to topple not only Omar al Bashir but also uproot the deeply entrenched network of military and security interests behind him was always optimistic But the success of the protests so far and the extent and consistency of the protesters efforts offered a glimmer of hope that while civilians were negotiating with the transitional military government to end military rule their leverage in the streets was strong  It became obvious however that the military regime and its associated security bodies were simply playing for time And they have finally run out of patience On Monday night the massacre began The Rapid Support Forces RSF a paramilitary group created from the remnants of the infamous Janjaweed militia moved against the main areas where sit ins were occurring in Khartoum and opened fire The troops burned the encampments beat whoever they did not kill and blockaded roads and hospitals so that medical support could not reach the wounded and the dying There are reports of rape pillage and the bodies of the executed floating in the river Nile 
JUN4	Men built this system. No wonder gender equality remains as far off as ever	I m not going to lie it s annoying to start one s week with the news that no country in the entire world is set to achieve gender equality by Given that our world leaders seem to continually miss targets on every measure put forward to improve things from climate change to poverty I m starting to suspect they don t really care about anything  In any case the UN reports that all but countries have men as heads of government so I m tempted to paraphrase Greta Thunberg we re not here for you to tell us what you consider is politically possible in the society that you have created The modern world was created by men and it shows The pay gap remains women are more likely to be in vulnerable work we have less access to financial institutions we re less likely to have workplace protections and benefits and we spend times more of our time on unpaid work in fact women do so much unpaid work that if it were paid it would account for between and of GDP 
JUN4	The west is complicit in the 30-year cover-up of Tiananmen	The events of June when the Chinese government deployed the full might of its military to purge Tiananmen Square of students who d been peacefully protesting there have become known in China as the June Fourth Incident Thirty years on it is still thought of as an incident a one off event In fact it was part of a political movement in which every major Chinese city participated To this day a complete definition of June as a historical event has not been realised because defining a historical event requires not only the full facts but also multiple perspectives And in its aftermath the Chinese government intensified its oversight of free expression in China deploying various tactics to suppress arrest detain and imprison anyone who spoke about June Fourth It remains the most taboo and politically sensitive topic in China much like the questions of Tibet and Xinjiang for the Chinese Communist party CCP and its machine of propaganda and censorship Yet the facts and significance of June Fourth are not discussed in China The exact events the persons responsible for issuing directives the methods of execution the number of people killed and detained and the killers responsible for the cumulative political decisions remain unclear  The memory of the past is an individual s property To deny it is to obliterate humanity 
JUN4	Yes, Jeremy Corbyn has to protest against Trump. But where does that leave politics?	There is almost nowhere on Earth Jeremy Corbyn belongs more than on a protest against a rightwing US president  His whole life might have been a preparation for this moment lonely years of preaching anti US sermons in the rain to a handful of Stop the War faithful only to find himself on the big stage for the big one It marks a rare outbreak of leftwing unity after weeks of rage over Brexit too The revoltingness of Donald Trump is one of the few things on which virtually all factions of the Labour party still agree and resistance has been a bonding experience for Britons more generally From the student who mowed a giant penis into a meadow under his flight path to the Duchess of Cornwall being caught winking behind his back every indignity heaped on Trump is a joy How could Corbyn not be on the march especially when the resurgent Liberal Democrats will be there in force threatening once again to outflank him 
JUN4	Andy Ruiz Jr: champion of the ring, and of tubby underdogs everywhere	In these dark times you have to take joy wherever you can find it in footage of a deaf child being able to experience sound for the first time in the epic lip sync battle between Brooke Lynn Hytes and Yvie Oddly in this season s RuPaul s Drag Race or any time a tiny dog preferably a corgi but a chihuahua at a push tries to chase and catch a massive ball that would never fit in its itsy bitsy jaws  This weekend I found a new image that I will return to over and over again in times of crisis whenever that picture of Nigel Farage covered in salted caramel milkshake just doesn t hit the spot It is my Mona Lisa I want it everywhere on my wallpaper on my screensaver on the inside of my eyelids so it s the first thing I see in the morning and the last thing I see at night It s this a photo of Anthony Joshua that impossible Herculean demigod being laid on his arse by Andy Ruiz Jr a man whose physique can only be described as Peter Kay in those John Smith s ads from the noughties 
JUN4	Want to tackle inequality? Then first change our land ownership laws	What is the most neglected issue in British politics I would say land Literally and metaphorically land underlies our lives but its ownership and control have been captured by a tiny number of people The results include soaring inequality and exclusion the massive cost of renting or buying a decent home the collapse of wildlife and ecosystems repeated financial crises and the loss of public space Yet for years this crucial issue has scarcely featured in political discussions  Today I hope this changes with the publication of the report to the Labour party Land for the Many that I ve written with six experts in the field Our aim is to put this neglected issue where it belongs at the heart of political debate and discussion 
JUN4	An absolute state of a visit: what the Trump and Windsor snapshots tell us	Roll up roll up The freakshow is back in town Which rather loses its impact when our own freakshow has not left town for the past three years but never mind Donald Trump is back in the UK for a full state visit State is the correct word If Theresa May was determined to bow out on a low she s done herself proud  The president of the United States was said to be bringing along his entire family this time But despite reports there seems to be no visual evidence that Tiffany has been allowed out of the White House basement 
JUN4	Criminalising people who attempt suicide is unjust and dangerous	The conversation around mental health has moved on we re told we re better at talking better at listening More recent wins for mentally ill people have been bolstered by historical changes in law the narrative goes the Suicide Act of one of the more obvious examples of positive legislative change The reality is not as clear cut Material gains for the community are few and far between and despite the fact it s been nearly years since decriminalisation mentally ill people are still being punished for attempts to take their own lives  Last month Greater Manchester police was forced to defend its decision to prosecute two mentally ill women for causing traffic jams during attempts to kill themselves One of the women explained that her mother grandmother and uncle had all died in the past year she was sentenced to a month community order and ordered to pay in costs regardless The other charged with illegally walking on a motorway had taken from her benefits payment and was sent back to the psychiatric ward she had fled from 
JUN5	Britain must not turn its back on the world made possible by D-day	They are saying that Thursday the th anniversary will be the last of the international D day commemorations in which the veterans of participate For obvious reasons that may well be so The surviving soldiers who fought their way up the beaches of Normandy are in their s now so it seems poignantly unlikely that more than a handful will return in  But there is a more political reason why this week could be the start of a less unified approach to marking the liberation of Europe at the end of the war against Hitler s Germany The reason is that Donald Trump s US and Brexit Britain though both still immeasurably and justifiably proud of the roles their predecessors played in this epic climax of the war in the west are each in their own way turning their backs upon the European order that the invasion of June made possible 
JUN5	Farewell to Change UK – we hardly knew your name	After just three months the party that was supposed to be Britain s answer to Emmanuel Macron s Renaissance formerly known as En Marche has split after taking just of the vote in the EU elections Six of Change UK s MPs including the interim leader Heidi Allen and spokesperson Chuka Umunna have left the party to sit as independents with highly plausible rumours that they will go on to join the Lib Dems  It would be tempting to point out how this is a bit like Brian McFadden splitting from his own solo career after leaving Westlife Or take cheap shots about how they re so crap that they ve rehabilitated the Lib Dems like a political version of a frat boy wingman deliberately making themselves look rubbish in order to let Vince Cable look bang worthy Or mock the fact that the new party is now called and I m not even remotely kidding Continuity Change UK like a kids rock band thinking it s cool to name themselves Hot Ice 
JUN5	Madonna’s age isn’t relevant. Her music is	When the carping over Madonna s age began in earnest the focus wasn t on her singing or songwriting or even her stagecraft The problem according to certain sections of the press lay with her hands Why do Madonna s hands look older than her face asked the Daily Mail in Such was the paper s concern over the then year old s apparently awful paws a plastic surgeon was drafted in to provide professional analysis As a person ages the plumpness goes making the hand look bonier and more veiny less elastic he said sagely Since then close ups of Madonna s hands have been as much a tabloid staple as Victoria Beckham s scowl or Amanda Holden s sideboob  Music critics tend not to pass comment on a musician s appearance to do so would undermine the seriousness of their endeavour But the assessments of Madonna s th album Madame X have nonetheless brought more subtle kind of disparagement Perhaps the erstwhile Queen of Pop should be content with the role of Queen Mother of Pop now said the Daily Telegraph s critic going on to note that a woman who has shifted m units and broken every record for a female artist going hasn t had a Top hit in a decade Even in the Guardian s review which was mostly positive the theme of her age was never far away 
JUN5	I know what drives young people to self-harm – I did it for years	I remember clearly the first time I self harmed I was an awkward year old girl beset by problems with my body image I had a budding eating disorder and was bullied mercilessly by my peers for being bisexual The sensation of crushing hopelessness and self hatred threatened to overwhelm me so I addressed the pain in a way I believed wouldn t hurt anyone else but myself I turned all the tumult and sadness inwards and the relief although short lived was immediate  This began a pattern that would last well into my adult life Trauma in the form of losing jobs sexual assault and family breakdown prompted more self harm episodes resulting in countless stitches and permanent scarring 
JUN5	Waitrose’s package-free shopping is a PR move that will change little	Waitrose s experiment in packaging free shopping is an obvious win for the supermarket chain Its decision to sell around loose lines to shoppers at its Oxford store they can now use their own containers to take home rice pasta lentils cleaning products will be catnip now dispensed in self service hoppers presumably to ethical shoppers The move co opts the trend for unpackaged seen in more radical zero waste shops and refillable wine and beer growler fills in Waitrose and ticks some useful hip boxes for this rather stuffy middle class brand  It is all positive PR and puts Waitrose on par with rival supermarkets who facing predicted polluter pay legislation more on that later are suddenly super keen to prove their green packaging credentials Market style loose vegetable aisles are being rolled out at Booths Asda has removed the plastic wrap from its swedes Morrisons has unsheathed its cucumbers for part of the year and both Iceland and Tesco are trialling schemes to pay customers to recycle plastic bottles bn worth of which are currently burned or dumped annually Tesco is even experimenting with collecting and recycling soft plastics such as crisp packets which local authorities generally cannot reprocess 
JUN5	The NHS cannot become a bargaining chip in our desperate deal-making with the US	Even when it s in the process of being deliberately run down by the Conservatives so it can finally be privatised our National Health Service makes America s arrangements look monstrous by comparison So those of us who have long suspected that privatisation is the ideological end goal for many Conservative rightwingers were left unsurprised when the US ambassador Woody Johnson essentially said that our entire economy was up for grabs in a post Brexit trade deal Trump echoed this sentiment and then backtracked when interviewed by Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain a cocktail of entities so loathsome that it can only add credence to the notion that we are hurtling along a dark alternative timeline following the rupturing of the universe caused by David Bowie s death  Trump s state visit may have seen the last few days of British diplomacy descend into a Boschian hellscape populated by sour faced old colonialists disturbingly shiny simulacra offspring and a man in a wig and tailcoat who wouldn t pass muster as an am dram waiter But more disturbing still was having to witness the to ing and fro ing over the bartering of our health service Trump s blustering over whether or not he wants to get his tiny mitts on our NHS is ultimately irrelevant who truly believes that the man understands anything about the issues at hand But when the time comes to discuss the parcelling off of NHS services in a desperate trade deal the discussion will be dominated by US business interests 
JUN5	Damaging talk of ‘no deal’ spells doom for the Tories	We ll come out deal or no deal on October That s the spirit We ve got to have the courage to tell the people of this country we can do it if we really want to So says Boris Johnson in his jaunty launch video all blind faith that he alone can leap the Brexit impasse when he is anointed prime minister odds now Where s the democratic legitimacy We the people are mere dumbfounded onlookers at the insolence of this coup not taking back control but letting him seize it  Soon he will saunter into No with no plans and an impossible promise to leave the EU on October
JUN5	Why do US evangelicals support Trump? They’re giving Christianity a bad name	In the UK the United States president is dismissed or condemned from almost all quarters and most of us struggle to get our heads around the idea that millions of people voted for Donald Trump One significant group of these voters were white evangelical Christians According to the exit polls from the US election white evangelical Christians voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by to  It has not been unusual for presidential candidates to court the so called evangelical Christian vote in recent history If you vote for a president it doesn t necessarily mean you support everything they stand for I recognise that the represents a whole host of motivations and degrees of support rather than a united mass gathering under Trump s banner But it s still a big number 
JUN5	I was fined for taking my child to Jamaica, but I'm one of the lucky ones	When it came to power in Labour picked up and ran with the Tories individualistic reforms to the school system Along with school choice league tables and academies in came parental responsibility for absences So I was disappointed but not surprised to be given a fixed penalty notice of per parent as a result of taking our six year old out of school for two weeks during term time to visit Jamaica  The fact that my son will have the chance to engage with world renowned scholars during that time as I m going for work on a writing retreat meant nothing to the local authority It is deemed less valuable than sitting in his classroom thinking about next year s Sats This is a reminder that we have replaced education with schooling putting a premium on the state mandated curriculum rather than the much wider world of learning But as annoying as it is to be penalised for taking my child out of school it s not really parents like me who are the targets of the non attendance punishment industry 
JUN6	Exit May. Now begins a battle for the soul of our democracy	Everything changes but some things stay the same  To watch the Queen addressing elderly survivors of D day this week was to be reminded that the point of monarchy is constancy All hell might be breaking loose around her but there she is dressed as she has dressed for half a century and choosing her words with the care she always has She has seen enough prime ministers come and go that one more presumably doesn t make much difference The rest of us however cannot afford to be quite so sanguine 
JUN6	It’s time to move on from these overblown commemorations of war	The airwaves have been filled this week with tearful veterans and mournful politicians recalling D day That is appropriate when the participants are still among us and when war s emotions are a living memory we should thank those who fought to make us safe Something at least can unite the British even if it is only the past But when the remembering is over then what  Recalling past wars is the most dangerous thing a nation can do Too much remembering has lain at the root of almost every conflict in Europe s history We say we learn war s lessons but we seldom do Memory distorts and emotionalises history By its nature it dwells on grievance enmity and retribution Why is it we all recall war but never peace 
JUN6	Pity Ireland: the next page of the Trump family album	A collective sigh of relief as the Trumps left the UK en masse the land a little less orange a little less Sad The palace staff keen to get cracking on Febrezing the shit out of all the furniture any of them touched Harry unclenching his fists for the first time in hours  Unfortunately for the Irish Donald and Melania Trump arrived at Shannon airport to inflict themselves on another nation s hospitality like a less charming double act version of Edward Gorey s Doubtful Guest 
JUN6	Philip Hammond won’t tackle the climate crisis. But a Green New Deal would	I m surprised I can still be shocked at the incompetence and shortsightedness of this government But then along comes the chancellor Philip Hammond expressing his inane and irresponsible view that we can t afford to tackle the climate crisis He has warned that Theresa May s distant target of to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions will cost the UK over tn and starve schools police and hospitals of funds while making the UK economically uncompetitive  I m inclined to respond it s not the economy stupid It s the science it s literally a matter of life and death This is a planetary emergency which requires us to look well beyond the business as usual approach of the past years and think outside of the box 
JUN6	Labour is on the brink in Peterborough. This byelection is a battle over its future	Byelections can change history glorious victories and notorious defeats marking constituencies forever in the annals of political nerdery Some results are freaks the Liberals surprise win in Orpington in did not herald a great revival for the party nor was Shirley Williams s spectacular Crosby win in a harbinger of SDP mould breaking But sometimes byelections do signal seismic change  Today Peterborough bids to crack open the old two party hegemony with the new Brexit party favourite to win Labour may yet hang on its campaign benefiting from an experienced get out our vote local team But even if Nigel Farage just misses he can still claim an extraordinary result rattling the Tories deeper into no deal extremism Glumly resigned to their coming humiliation the party s large foolish tendency will persuade themselves that Boris Johnson can magic them out of the slough of despond 
JUN6	Big pharma is denying children like my son vital drugs. So I've set up a buyers club	A few weeks ago I sat in a meeting room in east London nervously waiting the arrival of two representatives from Gador an Argentinian drug company It s no exaggeration to say that my child s life could be shaped by the following few hours  Nearly years ago shortly after my son Aidan was born we learnt that he had cystic fibrosis CF a life limiting genetic condition that affects the lungs and other major organs It is difficult to process the joy of parenthood tempered by the confusion sadness and frustration of such a diagnosis But with time we came to terms with the news and the additional restrictions and medical attention CF imposes on you 
JUN6	Europe, take note: in Denmark, the humanitarian left is on the rise	The Social Democrats electoral victory in Denmark was by no means surprising and in many ways feels like the regular cycle of politics Yet the result which saw the coalition of leftwing parties win of the vote compared with for their rightwing adversaries embodies a series of developments with a wider significance for Europe as a whole  Once the result of Wednesday s elections was known the Social Democrat leader Mette Frederiksen reiterated two of her party s key electoral promises that they want to put welfare back at the centre of the Danish model and that they will place strict controls on refugees and asylum seekers That last position has become common globally and within Frederiksen s party it was seen as a pragmatic necessity if they were to win votes from what had been back in the election Denmark s second largest party the Danish People s party DPP 
JUN6	Was your mother a narcissist? And other questions a dating app should ask	Summer makes some single people think of going on dates and a slew of friends have recently signed up for dating apps The science of the algorithms behind these services is always being updated but the underlying presumptions seem to stay broadly the same assuming that it doesn t all come down to the photo you can find a good match by identifying the things you like and finding someone who likes them too   Like in this context tends to stick to a few well lit areas Jerry let s not tell our sad stories says Ren e Zellweger in the famous line from Jerry Maguire an assertion that when the movie came out in struck me as the epitome of healthy adult dating etiquette and now strikes me as delusional From a marketing perspective it is impossible for a dating app to get too close to the truth about attraction not because it comes from a place no online questionnaire can reach but because a genuinely useful set of questions in this area would be almost too unpalatable to bear 
JUN6	Jeremy Corbyn is right: Labour needs both its leavers and its remainers	In his essay on the Festival of Britain Michael Frayn drew a contrast between the carnivores and the herbivores Carnivores were the better off those who looked after themselves even if it meant preying on the weak The herbivores were the gentle ruminants of the middle classes guilty about their advantages and with eyes full of sorrow for the less fortunate  Although founded to give a political voice to the industrial working class the Labour party has always had its herbivore wing and when enough white collar workers and intellectuals have lined up alongside the party s blue collar contingent it has proved a winning formula Labour s big election victories were all examples of successful coalition building 
JUN6	Game of Thrones petitions and Star Wars trolls? Fans have become far too entitled	It s a common refrain from franchise movie directors when a film fails to set the critical world on fire that they have in fact not made it for those elitist critics in their metropolitan bubble of exclusive screenings and free canapes but for the fans But what happens when the fans decide they don t want a particular project either  Ron Howard the director of Solo A Star Wars Story recently suggested that a fan backlash against the Star Wars saga as a whole primarily driven by negative reaction to the preceding film The Last Jedi was responsible for his own movie s mediocre performance at the box office Howard pointed to a concerted campaign to drive down audience reaction scores on sites such as Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic arguing that Solo may have earned more than its m box office take had such aggressive trolling not occurred 
JUN7	Heavyweight Tory fantasists up the pace on the road to nowhere	As Theresa May formally relinquishes leadership of fratricidal comedy troupe the Conservative party the contest to succeed her remains a dish best paired with arsenic Or perhaps a lightly oaked strychnine Still what news from the revels I m afraid Kit Malthouse is already out And that other guy James Cleverly maybe They simply burned too brightly  Dominic Raab seems to have been disturbed during some policymaking again leaving dogwalkers to find the remains of an idea to prorogue parliament so that no deal happens by default On one level this is the only policy position Dominic can adopt having already resigned in protest at a deal he himself negotiated as Brexit secretary However Raab remains at large in this contest with people warned not simply to avoid approaching him that is a given but to stay away from anyone even backing him I mean is he really going to drag the Queen into it By it I obviously mean a constitutional crisis not his van 
JUN7	How Brexit is causing the strange death of British conservatism	Strange to say this of a country with a Tory government but Britain lacks a conservative party There are instead two revolutionary parties of the right firmly set on a path that could be described as nationalist or populist But it is avowedly not conservative And now they are locked in a struggle that is dragging the older larger party ever further from the values that are supposed to define it  That struggle would have been even more vivid if Nigel Farage s Brexit party had won the Peterborough byelection It would have filled Tory MPs with terror that Farage was coming to take their seats away directly Now they are consumed with a fear that amounts to the same thing that the Brexit party will split the right of centre vote in sufficient numbers that even if Labour sees its own support collapse in dozens of marginals Jeremy Corbyn s party could still come through the middle and win just as it did in Peterborough Either way the Conservative party is now gripped by fear of Farage It is galloping towards the conclusion that it must offer what he offers or else be swept aside As Boris Johnson the bookies favourite to be the next prime minister tweeted in the dead of night after the Peterborough defeat Conservatives must deliver Brexit by st October or we risk Brexit party votes delivering Corbyn to No 
JUN7	The Peterborough result spells out the dangers the next Tory leader will face	The Peterborough byelection result is bad news for both the Brexit party and the Conservatives The vote triggered after former Labour MP Fiona Onasanya was ousted under recall rules following her conviction for lying over a speeding offence had been touted as a perfect opportunity for Nigel Farage s newly formed party to build on their success in the European elections and prove they re a force to be reckoned with in Westminster  In the end they fell short with Labour retaining the seat their candidate Lisa Forbes beat the Brexit party candidate Mike Greene by votes Brexit party officials put their narrow defeat down to a lack of data and Labour having more time to prepare The number of votes the party received is impressive for a new party but given the high expectations following the European elections the overall sense is one of disappointment The fact that they failed to clinch the seat is a reminder of the difficulty smaller parties face in a first past the post general election system It s something Farage knows well He himself has sought Westminster election seven times in the past years without success 
JUN7	For England’s Lionesses to bring women’s football home, they’ll need our support	It s almost time At pm tonight the Fifa Women s World Cup kicks off in Paris with an opener between hosts France and South Korea The month long tournament that follows will be a kind of test of whether footballing equality or something approaching it can ever happen for women  The teams taking part in the competition know what they have to do win a football match and then keep winning matches until they lift a trophy at the final on July 
JUN7	Labour’s Peterborough win shows its grassroots strength. But Brexit risks persist	The Peterborough byelection could not have offered more fortuitous circumstances for the Brexit party This is far from a Labour safe seat it was held by the Tories with large majorities throughout the Thatcher and Major years and lost again under Blair in to a rightwinger Stewart Jackson who once declared I m at one with Ukip  Jeremy Corbyn s Labour narrowly snatched the seat back in but its candidate Fiona Onasanya was imprisoned after perverting the course of justice and after bizarrely comparing herself to Jesus Christ was booted out by a recall petition At this point Labour officials privately thought the local party was doomed in a byelection Peterborough s vote for leave places it comfortably in the top most pro Brexit constituencies in Britain The Brexit party had impetus having triumphed in the European elections just two weeks earlier including a decisive victory in Peterborough itself With polarisation over Brexit at its peak and Labour itself particularly haemorrhaging support on its remain flank you couldn t have developed a more favourable opportunity for Nigel Farage in a laboratory 
JUN7	Do we need black people on our banknotes?	Usually when a new campaign to rectify our national failure to acknowledge black ingenuity in building modern Britain comes along I support it enthusiastically I ve backed the critique of our statues for example which promote white supremacists as heroes and ignore people of colour and of our curriculum which promotes ignorance about the racialised nature of British history I ve seen the need for a museum of empire and the importance of books such as Washington Black which told the fictional story of a black inventor erased from the historical record  But when I was asked to add my name to the petition calling for a black person to be the face of the new banknote a decision expected by the Bank of England this summer I was hesitant Not because I have any doubt about the strength of the argument There have been banknotes featuring a notable person since the first was issued in all have been white and only three have been women the last of these Jane Austen was chosen only after an extensive social media campaign and the threat of litigation 
JUN7	The Tories are bending parliament’s rules to get their way – like Charles I did	Every day seems to bring another sign of the collective emotional breakdown that has seized the body politic This parliamentary session is now the longest since the th century At the start of the year we had the longest period without an Opposition day a day where the subjects for discussion are chosen by the opposition since they were invented The government has no majority in the Commons but it has redrawn the rules so that it enjoys a majority on every committee Even the Speaker has got in on the act declaring that forthwith no longer means forthwith  So many historic precedents have been broken that it is easy to become inured to the craziness A common cry around the scaffolded corridors of Westminster is there is no such thing as normal any more So we should just take stock for a brief moment of the latest madness 
JUN7	Pity Ireland: the next page of the Trump family album	A collective sigh of relief as the Trumps left the UK en masse the land a little less orange a little less Sad The palace staff keen to get cracking on Febrezing the shit out of all the furniture any of them touched Harry unclenching his fists for the first time in hours  Unfortunately for the Irish Donald and Melania Trump arrived at Shannon airport to inflict themselves on another nation s hospitality like a less charming double act version of Edward Gorey s Doubtful Guest 
JUN7	Maradona and Naples created an unearthly and sometimes dark magic. I was there	Sundays would begin and end at a bar called Bollicine bubbles behind Piazza Leopardi station in the Fuorigrotta quarter of Naples It was kept by a man called Enzo Cosenza who also led choreography and singing in the city s football stadium That s where we spent the time in between across the span of two years with season tickets watching Diego Maradona defy the laws of gravity and physics with a football  I was working in Rome but commuting from Naples for romantic reasons and I soon fell in love with Maradona as well Ahead of Asif Kapadia s much anticipated documentary on the Maradona phenomenon released next week the talk is once again about Diego The film turns the pages of a marvellous scrapbook but doesn t convey how Maradona and Naples shared a common heartbeat and soul To understand Maradona in those days was to understand Naples and vice versa the same unearthly magic the same brilliant light the same maleficient shadows 
JUN7	Exit May. Now begins a battle for the soul of our democracy	Everything changes but some things stay the same  To watch the Queen addressing elderly survivors of D day this week was to be reminded that the point of monarchy is constancy All hell might be breaking loose around her but there she is dressed as she has dressed for half a century and choosing her words with the care she always has She has seen enough prime ministers come and go that one more presumably doesn t make much difference The rest of us however cannot afford to be quite so sanguine 
JUN8	As Theresa May exits stage left, the Tories dance ever rightward	The far right is defining politics To understand how imagine a line dance where each dancer takes a step to the right and points an accusing finger at the person next to him  You think we re selling out British workers says Labour by not fighting for Remain and threatening jobs and living standards by taking us out of the single market Don t think about what we are doing steps to the right and points look at Theresa May s deal that wouldn t even keep us in customs union 
JUN8	It’s time gay people stepped aside... hetero whiners have rights too	At times like these it s a relief that LGBTQ people have absolutely nothing to worry about  Apart from Brunei wanting to stone them to death Ann Widdecombe saying that science could produce an answer to being gay the rise of homophobic hate crime exemplified last week by a lesbian couple being viciously attacked on a London bus for refusing to kiss for the entertainment of leering heterosexual men Just that sort of thing relentlessly globally forever Other than that LGBTQ people have got it easy 
JUN8	Miley Cyrus, taking back control of her distorted image in Black Mirror	All hail the return of Black Mirror and its standalone dystopian techno parables that are so able to predict the future that they elected a grotesque cartoonish hate buffoon made famous by television and conjured up a prime ministerial scandal involving sexual activity with a pig  Its new three episode fifth season has VR gaming social media addiction and a pop star robo puppy voice assistant hybrid in its sights and as ever life imitates art or vice versa the pace of living being such that who really knows any more 
JUN8	We need to cut plastic waste: and supermarkets should lead the way	Last year Theresa May announced that by the year the government aimed to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste It s not soon enough Over the past months the alarm bells have been ringing and the Blue Planet effect has got everyone s attention People want to see urgent action on plastics from the government and big business and they also want to know how to take action themselves And so in a new series on BBC One Anita Rani and I look at what can be done on both a micro and macro level to save our planet from the plastic menace  There are of course simple changes we can make A few years ago in my War on Waste series I revealed that more than bn plastic lined paper cups are clogging up our waste system every year because they can t be recycled Now most major cafe chains including Starbucks Pret a Manger and Caff Nero offer discounts to customers who bring their own reusable keep cups We may also be on the brink of the widespread use of properly recyclable disposable cups though a keep cup is always the better option 
JUN8	Pregnancy is the ultimate endurance test. If a man says it, it must be true	When Harry spoke to the press in his dazed and delighted way after Meghan had given birth he said How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension I guess he meant labour childbirth that everyday agony and ecstasy that is part of women s lives How do we do that After months of feeling not too grand while exposed to every myth going and being told what to eat wear and how to behave we have to get the baby out somehow It s what we do  Some women love being pregnant some really don t Some sail through feeling mostly normal others are sick exhausted permanently worried and just want it to end Being pregnant is an ordinary thing that happens to women and yet it is absolutely extraordinary Few tell the whole truth about it as so often we are told to enjoy what is the most dangerous and precarious rollercoaster we will ever get on 
JUN8	Like May, the first woman in cabinet faced a lonely battle in a male-dominated world	The imminent departure of Britain s second female prime minister reminded me of Margaret Bondfield Unlike Theresa May the former shop worker and union organiser is far from a household name but she should be Her story tells us much about the battle women fought to secure political representation and the way they were treated when they arrived in Westminster It also tells us something about women in politics today  Ninety years ago today Bondfield made history when she became the first female cabinet minister

JUN9	Hard Brexit is the drug the Tories need to wean themselves off	Imagine my surprise to learn in the Mail on Sunday that I had been a pupil at Eton And not just that I was among the contemporaries of David Cameron As Dean Martin sang first and best how lucky can one guy be Sadly this is all nonsense No fancy waistcoats or winged collars for me I did my A levels in Catford not Slough True I have been to Eton a few times over the years But I never inhaled  The context of this journalistic schoolboy error in every sense was an article about Michael Gove s allegedly louche lifestyle in his youth inspired by his admission on Saturday that he took drugs on several occasions at social events more than years ago 
JUN9	What kind of country have we become? Try asking a disabled person	I grew up in a Britain that said life would be full of promise for disabled people like me We might not have conquered the media and corridors of power but unlike generations before me by the s we were no longer hidden from sight Grim words such as crippled and retarded were no longer part of everyday speech Charity tins that until recently symbolised the scraps handed out to us were now accompanied by concrete rights from the groundbreaking disability civil rights law of my childhood to the welfare state s tailor made benefits and services for disabled people  Progress though is rarely as permanent as it appears Nearly years later in the spring of I watched as David Cameron s coalition government launched what would become an unprecedented assault on disabled people from the bedroom tax to the rollout of fit for work tests and the abolition of disability living allowance 
JUN9	Teaching children about LGBT issues is not brainwashing – it equips them for life	Last week a high court injunction banned protesters against the teaching of LGBT inclusive lessons from gathering outside the school gates of Anderton Park primary school in Birmingham But on Monday there is a chance that this could be lifted  Whatever happens it is clear we need wider resolution on this debate in order to draw a firm line under it To do so there are two challenges we need to tackle One is the call of parental rights The other is the idea of what is age appropriate 
JUN9	Arts institutions: cut your ties with BP	When Extinction Rebellion activists shut down London in April we sounded the alarm loud and clear about the climate and ecological crisis that threatens humanity s very survival In response around the world governments local councils companies and professionals are stepping up and declaring a climate emergency  And yet the silence from the major agents of climate destruction remains deafening In the heart of London the city that heard our rallying cry to Act as if the truth is real BP a global fossil fuel giant is sponsoring the Royal Opera House Big Screen in Trafalgar Square Rather than denouncing the damage these companies continue to do to our planet our cultural institutions are lending them legitimacy 
JUN9	Why? The most difficult question for journalists to answer	Journalists learn from their first day in the trade that their articles should include the five Ws who what where when and why The first four are straightforward enough objective truths if you like The fifth however often travels into subjective territory It is frustrated by obfuscation and therefore results in speculation Sometimes despite our best efforts it simply goes unanswered  Consider three examples Why were journalists Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey arrested Why did the BBC s otherwise excellent documentary on Margaret Thatcher omit one of the defining moments in her reign as prime minister Why do broadcasters go on using vox pops 
JUN9	If the magisterial 63 Up teaches us anything, it’s that we are sustained by love	On Friday night my wife Lisa and I watched the three episodes of Up while my youngest daughter and her friend in a respite from the brutal slog of GCSEs caught up with a week of Love Island upstairs Those of us who like to feel as if we have grown up with Michael Apted s series I was born the year after the first film Seven Up was broadcast in might be tempted to see some kind of tale for our times in that juxtaposition There probably isn t one except to hope that some smart producer with an eye on longevity has signed up the love islanders for return visits in and and so we can observe the effect of time and mortgage interest and sleepless parenting on their muscle tone and wayward eyes  Each of the Up films has had its own emotional register The Love Island equivalent Up had a bit of shaggy haired high waistbanded excitement about the lottery of girl meets boy Jackie and Lynn two of the original friends from the East End primary school in the series were already married by then Tony the artful dodger with aspirations to become a jockey had met his future wife Debbie at a disco and Paul one of the boys from the care home had moved to Australia and found his soulmate Susan Forty two years on this time around two of those bonds Paul s and Tony s had endured despite everything Jackie has been divorced married again divorced while librarian Lynn s rock solid marriage to Russ had ended with her sudden death in 
JUN9	Our archaic first-past-the-post system is alarmingly unfit for a multi-party age	Labour s tight win in Peterborough was a famous victory one for the record books You can go back more than a century and you will not find another case of an MP being returned at a byelection with a vote share as meagre as A win is a win and the hissing sound you can hear is some air escaping from Nigel Farage s balloon but this was an incredibly narrow squeak My one stop shop for excellent electoral facts David Cowling has looked at every other byelection since and cannot find one in which the winner had the support of such a small minority of voters  Peterborough used to be a classic two way marginal The reds and the blues slugged it out and the other parties were spectators As recently as the election the combined Labour Tory vote share was That shrank to just in the byelection This reinforces the message from the national opinion polls The British electoral cake is now dividing up in a way that is without precedent We have a four plus party system with support split between the Tories Labour the Brexit party and the Lib Dems plus a segment for the Greens In Scotland and Wales the nationalists make it a five plus party system It is not too much of a stretch to argue that we are really in a six to seven plus party system The Conservatives contain within them at least two parties The One Nation group of Tories would select a very different leader to the Moggite European Research Group Labour is another unhappy marriage of ideological traditions that would be separated into different parties in other countries 
JUN9	Tea with the Trumps – a red leicester nightmare	Last Monday I attended the worst family dinner I have ever experienced It honoured a visiting American with whom we were barely acquainted but were somehow obliged to entertain  A few years previously our guest had suggested on a radio show that despite thinking she was crazy he could have nailed my late mother She feared he was stalking her Our guest had then clarified that he would only have had sex with my mother if she had an Aids test perhaps because she had shaken hands with Aids sufferers 
JUN9	These D-day heroes evoked a glorious shared purpose. It’s now under threat	It was well done in the end in parts beautifully done In an era of anniversaries there was never a chance that the th anniversary of the D day landings could go by uncelebrated But there were huge risks Would the events feel like being locked in a glorious vanished past How not to appear extravagantly triumphalist or tip into schmaltz How not to reawaken the stereotypes of the bad Germans  But the organisers got it pretty much right The evocation of the day s events from paratroopers to the reenactment of cliff scaling spoke for themselves The speeches honouring peace and international co operation were powerful and dignified against a backdrop of veterans stressing never again As these near the end of their lives it was perhaps the last chance to bring their past to life with personal testimonies of a bravery made to seem everyday Even Donald Trump rose somewhat to the occasion speaking to the common theme 
JUN9	Fake news will thrive as long we are happy to see only what we want to see	If a gorilla walked right in front of your eyes you wouldn t miss it would you Actually half the country probably would  In a classic experiment psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons showed people a video of basketball players some wearing white shirts some wearing black and asked them to count how many times the players in white passed the ball Halfway through the film a woman in a gorilla suit saunters into the scene faces the audience thumps her chest and walks away Extraordinarily more than half of Chabris s and Simons s subjects were so intent on watching the ball being thrown that they failed to see the gorilla 
JUN10	Behold, the Tory leadership candidates: all in denial, all in dreamland	Imagine that some Rip Van Winkle in a coma since suddenly wakes to look around and see what s happening as the Tories choose our next prime minister He s an acute social observer so he starts to check the facts of this decade and is shocked by what he finds Wherever he looks whatever he checks he finds the scars of austerity are all around and he assumes that s what the candidates will confront  Talking to staff from his hospital bed he hears of unfilled vacancies for overstressed NHS staff with million more people on hospital waiting lists What kind of aftercare will he get he asks Not much they say with million fewer frail people getting any social care due to local councils stripped of half their funds 
JUN10	Do these homophobic attacks mean we’ll again have to hide our same-sex relationships?	 Not a safe space This is what my girlfriend half jokingly whispers at me when I reach for her hand if we re in a place where she doesn t feel comfortable with a public display of affection She says it jokingly to lighten the situation which is in reality a depressing one but also because the threat of violence doesn t feel totally real to us We have never been physically attacked because of our sexuality Being middle class white and feminine presenting in London puts us in a relative bubble of safety and privilege Yet where and when we can hold hands or whether we should do it at all is something we constantly have to negotiate  On the one hand I feel a duty to utilise my safety and privilege to be publicly out and proud as a gay woman to not shy away from public displays of affection But on the other I understand the complicated conversations and situations this can lead to If we hold hands in public it will normalise it I argued to one ex who hated public displays of affection mostly she admitted because of gay shame Why is the onus on us to normalise same sex displays of affection she responded To which I would wonder Well who else is going to do it 
JUN10	Extinction Rebellion’s tactics are working. It has pierced the bubble of denial	Extinction Rebellion is working A YouGov poll last week showed that the protests by the direct action group as well as those of millions of children led by Greta Thunberg have sent public concern about the climate crisis to record levels  Extinction Rebellion shouldn t have to exist It only does because most of the media and government have failed Despite Nasa warning we faced global disaster as far back as the media has taken an emperor s new clothes approach It has conveyed what Sir David Attenborough calls our greatest threat in thousands of years with the urgency of a quiche recipe on a daytime TV show and with a detachment that suggests it doesn t believe what it is saying For years it has told us the most you can do is recycle plastic and unplug your phone charger But this hasn t worked Last year global emissions were the highest on record Meanwhile the scientific warnings have become louder and louder The world s leading climate scientist has urged parents to take to the streets 
JUN10	The great Tory drug off shows they are delusional – from Gove to Andrea the ganja queen	 Reality is just a crutch for people who can t handle drugs This quote attributed variously to Lily Tomlin Tom Waits and Robin Williams heaves into view as we enter the shebeen of hell that is the Tory leadership contest Reality may be glimpsed at the edge of our peripheral vision but it disappears as soon as any of them start to explain their hallucinatory view of Brexit Witness my friends the effects of mass doping  Whoever wins is promising they will make the EU suddenly bend over lay down the law in Ireland which always works well and give rich people free money 
JUN10	The UK should stop obsessing over GDP. Wellbeing is more telling	This morning the Office for National Statistics ONS released the latest set of GDP figures It is a familiar exercise common to most countries a day when the broad state of an economy is judged according to small changes in a single indicator  Yet last week New Zealand broke new ground by eschewing GDP in favour of wellbeing as a guiding indicator when setting budgets and assessing government policy Bids to the Treasury for money from now on will not only need a cost benefit analysis but an assessment of their wellbeing impact Decisions about spending will be made on the basis of a project s contribution to the wellbeing of the population measured through four dimensions human capital social capital natural capital and financial and physical capital It follows the Welsh government s innovative Well being of Future Generations Act which places a legal requirement on public bodies in Wales to think about the long term social cultural environmental and economic wellbeing impact of their decisions 
JUN10	It’s ridiculous that Michael Gove’s drug use could prevent him becoming Tory leader	Britain s Conservative party is having a nervous breakdown It is turning on the most competent candidate for its leadership Michael Gove for sniffing cocaine in his former life as a journalist Unlike his chief rival Boris Johnson who joked about his drug taking Gove told the sober truth The jokester laughs the honest man is a hypocrite  Eight out of the Tory leadership candidates have at various times admitted to taking illegal drugs But all politics is hypocrisy an edifice of pretence insincerity and deviousness The art lies in how you pull it off Johnson has been a master of this art all his life As his hero Winston Churchill showed unsuitability for high office is no bar given enough humour personality and the gift of the gab When a strait laced Southern Baptist was asked how she could possibly vote for Donald Trump she replied We are all sinners He is one of us 
JUN10	Chernobyl is still horrifyingly relevant – the lessons have not been learned	I was two years old and living in Kyiv when the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster happened In spite of my grandfather s fairly high military rank we weren t the first to know When we did find out I was like many other children shipped off to St Petersburg with my mother My father who was an engineer and had visited Chernobyl during his student years later recalled how empty and ghostly Kyiv became  I don t remember my grandfather speaking about Chernobyl but I can imagine what it must have felt like for him He was a combat veteran of the century s most terrifying war and had hoped that his family would live out their lives in peace and then this absolute horror happened It was a tragedy compounded further by official cruelty and incompetence by secrecy and the state s inability to tell the full dark tale of what happened to a vulnerable populace 
JUN10	Gerraway with accentism – I’m proud to speak Yorkshire	Hopefully you haven t subjected yourself to Still Open All Hours the mystifyingly popular sequel to the classic Ronnie Barker comedy series of the s s If you have endured a whole episode then you ll know that the Yorkshire dialect is a key element of the show s humour I watch David Jason s Doncaster based japes with a stony face Perhaps the charm of the series is lost on me because I m bored out of my chuffing mind by seeing Yorkshire s working class communities parodied for comic effect  We re used to these trite wi nowt teken owt portrayals of regional dialect Still Open All Hours like Last of the Summer Wine stands in a long tradition of hackneyed portrayals of bolshy but benign Yorkshire sounding characters offering gentle down to earth by eck lad humour with their hilarious flat vowels 
JUN10	The CPS is denying justice to thousands by secretly changing rape prosecution rules	This is a sad day I belong to a national coalition of women s organisations that have finally been forced to launch a legal challenge against the Crown Prosecution Service for its failure to prosecute rape  We believe the CPS has altered its approach in how it makes decisions on whether to charge or drop rape cases For almost a decade the CPS used a merits based approach to building rape cases This meant working from a thorough consideration of the law on rape the seeking as well as the giving of consent and being in a fit state to do so and building a case that assumes the jury will make a decision without relying on rape myth prejudices 
JUN11	The Tory contest shows that the Brexiters’ dream is dying before their very eyes	Brexit is the reason the Conservatives are choosing a new leader yet the competition has become a race to change the subject Candidates are being judged not by any probability of success in taking the UK out of the EU but by the ability to comfort fellow Tories that there is life for their party on the other side once the deed is done  How to get there is a side issue 
JUN11	Why Corbyn is right to ditch social mobility	For decades now social mobility has been feted as the answer to society s ills Conservatives have always embraced the idea of grammar schools that giving a top tier education to bright children from working class backgrounds provides them with the opportunities their middle class counterparts take for granted And from the mid s the Labour party shifted its emphasis from equality of outcome to equality of opportunity and raising aspiration  Social mobility has proven seductive to all sides of politics for two reasons It is difficult to argue against shouldn t smart but disadvantaged kids be offered the opportunity to fulfil their potential And the beneficiaries of schemes that pluck individuals from impoverished backgrounds and help them climb the social ladder tend to place great stall in their own backstory and defend the system vociferously 
JUN11	Russian officials tried to frame Ivan Golunov. Instead they made him a hero	As of last Saturday Ivan Golunov is officially the most popular personality in the Russian media dwarfing Vladimir Putin It feels surreal even as I m writing this because Golunov is one of the humblest people I know But since the weekend his plight has captured the nation  Golunov is a reporter at Meduza the Russian news outlet where I am investigations editor Early in the morning on June I was woken up by a call from Galina Timchenko Meduza s chief executive We re in trouble she said Ivan has just been arrested something to do with drugs 
JUN11	The prospect of Boris Johnson as prime minister has reignited Labour’s civil war	Why now That s the obvious question arising from yet another bruising encounter between Jeremy Corbyn and his frustrated MPs widely described as the worst meeting since the last one  The charge sheet is certainly serious ranging from a failure to lead over Brexit to the way sexual harassment allegations against his aide David Prescott were seemingly brushed under the carpet and a long standing reluctance to act on allegations of antisemitism this time levelled against the new Peterborough MP Lisa Forbes But these are not fundamentally new problems Labour MPs have been round this track again and again and got nowhere What is new however is that the whiff of a general election in the air has significantly raised the stakes 
JUN11	Urgency is what's demanded by young activists. But they're met with crumbling complacency	If there s one word to sum up today s political pace perhaps it is urgency Climate catastrophe is coming hate crimes are rising the far right is advancing and none of us can remember the last time parliamentary democracy wasn t characterised by a hopeless race against a ticking clock  And yet having spent a lifetime lulled into the complacency that comes with privilege and a centrist establishment it seems our political class just isn t getting it We have years to change the course of history say school climate strikers People are dying now say human rights and equalities campaigners Real change takes time and consensus and a series of repetitive votes in a crumbling old palace say politicians 
JUN11	Kylie Jenner’s Handmaid’s Tale party was tasteless, but is the TV show any better?	Praise be ladies The world may be a dismal place at the moment but Kylie Jenner is here to remind us that there is a bright side to everything even torture rape and oppression The year old reality TV star and cosmetics mogul recently had the bright idea of throwing a Handmaid s Tale themed party for one of her BFFs The book and TV show may be a downer but hey the bright red gowns look great on Instagram Guests sipped praise be vodka and under his eye tequila cocktails while taking selfies and completely missing the point of Margaret Atwood s dystopian novel  Jenner s bash which she shared on social media naturally has prompted a backlash It does seem remarkably tone deaf to treat The Handmaid s Tale like a hilarious joke when the US is becoming more like the fictional Gilead by the day If you think that is an overdramatic comparison just take a look at Alabama which recently became the latest state to pass an extreme abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest Not only does the bill force women to have their rapist s babies but Alabama law means the rapist can get parental rights and sue for custody Meanwhile any doctor caught performing an abortion could get years in prison 
JUN11	Disruptor has become a dirty word. And not just when applied to Donald Trump	There are many names people called Donald Trump during his recent UK visit One of the more flattering was the disruptor in chief When the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt was asked about Trump he responded He s controversial He s a disruptor This description wasn t Hunt s invention A couple of years ago American commentators explained how Trump had disrupted the Republican party and was trying to disrupt the order of global foreign policy  Until fairly recently calling someone a disruptor wasn t a compliment It bought to mind a disrupted rail journey a disruptive child a disruptive neighbour Now being disruptor is a positive Entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk are lauded when they seek to disrupt established industries such as car manufacturing Large companies appoint chief disruption officers Civil servants teachers and school children are now encouraged to become disruptive innovators 
JUN11	Behold, the Tory leadership candidates: all in denial, all in dreamland	Imagine that some Rip Van Winkle in a coma since suddenly wakes to look around and see what s happening as the Tories choose our next prime minister He s an acute social observer so he starts to check the facts of this decade and is shocked by what he finds Wherever he looks whatever he checks he finds the scars of austerity are all around and he assumes that s what the candidates will confront  Talking to staff from his hospital bed he hears of unfilled vacancies for overstressed NHS staff with million more people on hospital waiting lists What kind of aftercare will he get he asks Not much they say with million fewer frail people getting any social care due to local councils stripped of half their funds 
JUN11	The populist right is forging an unholy alliance with religion	Why are so many religious citizens drawn to the rhetoric of authoritarian leaders such as Matteo Salvini Viktor Orb n Jair Bolsonaro and Narendra Modi Even in countries with a strong secular tradition such as France and the Netherlands rightwing populists like Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders are quick to resort to language that presents Judeo Christianity as the pillar of western European civilisation  In Belgium the Flemish nationalist party N VA has made a name for itself defending institutions abandoned by the Christian Democrats such as the Catholic schooling system and church services In Italy Salvini ostentatiously brandished a Catholic rosary as results from the European elections came in In Hungary Orb n has turned a defence of Christian civilisation into official state doctrine Making a speech in Warsaw where the ruling Law and Justice party has presented itself as the political wing of conservative Catholicism Donald Trump echoed John Paul II s old invocation We want God 
JUN11	My mum was an addict. I know the pain and suffering this causes	Addiction is a life threatening condition It affects those around the addict who may never have touched a drink or taken drugs As a child I lived with an addict my mother Wendy  She was hardworking great fun and loving But I saw her struggle during and in the aftermath of failed relationships with three children in tow 
JUN12	No-deal Brexit is still unlikely – but once again parliament has not ruled it out	It happened again Parliament was offered a clear route to take back control and it promptly handed the ball back to the government Late Wednesday afternoon by a margin of votes to MPs decided not to commandeer the parliamentary timetable in order to legislate against no deal  The first thing to stress here is that parliament has not decided to back no deal It has not given the government carte blanche and it certainly hasn t resolved not to enact legislation in the future Rather MPs have decided on this occasion to reject what many saw as an opposition power grab and certainly what many Conservatives view as an affront to the constitution Our all important conventions dictate that ministers not the opposition or backbenchers run the legislative agenda 
JUN12	Ignore Boris Johnson’s bluster about Brexit. He wants a general election	Striding to the stage in a room filled with his rabidly Eurosceptic cheerleaders Boris Johnson perfectly captured the tenor of the times having been introduced by every Tory s favourite bass baritone Geoffrey Cox  Johnson launched his leadership bid with a fictional plan for Brexit He has promised to shred the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May claiming that he can secure a better Brexit deal EU leaders might have said they will not reopen the legal text and have even disbanded the negotiating team in Brussels but Johnson claims he can defy this political reality There is little reason to believe this is true 
JUN12	Pride isn’t a party, it’s a time for queer people to fight again for their rights	History is but an unstoppable march towards freedom and enlightenment Here is what is known as the Whiggish view of history and if it wasn t killed off on the battlefields of the Somme Gallipoli and Passchendaele it surely should have perished in Auschwitz Birkenau Treblinka and Nanjing Yet somehow even as a subconscious urge rather than a historical theory it persists While it is true that rights and freedoms can be won and secured through struggle and sacrifice they can equally be sent hurtling into reverse And that it must be concluded is the current threat facing LGBTQ people  As homophobic protesters gather outside primary schools to protest against children being educated about LGBTQ people and succeed in stopping such lessons at one school we have the grotesque sight of the Labour MP Roger Godsiff publicly backing them Hundreds of Labour members have already signed a letter demanding his suspension and the party would be wise to listen to them Labour has a rule allowing for the suspension of a member for bringing the party into disrepute given Labour s existential purpose is equality surely endorsing anti gay protests more than qualifies for bringing shame on the entire party not least when they are publicly endorsed as a result by the fascist ex leader of the BNP Nick Griffin 
JUN12	Boris Johnson: a charlatan with bravado. Barely a word he spoke was trustworthy	The charm the magic the charisma were well polished and this is as good as the man gets on best behaviour after weeks of behind the scenes training If you puzzle as to how this man unfit for every office he has held can be about to sweep into Downing Street his performance today is the answer His snake oil of choice is optimism so miserably lacking in politics now radiating out of him like sunshine All fake all sun ray lamp that turns off in private but it outshines his rivals and dazzles anyone willing to ignore everything we know about his rotten to the core character  Cheering in the room erupted rapturously from the remarkable assembly of MPs backing him from all wings of the party Many know him bitterly well from trying to work with him yet there they were shamefully prepared to subject their country to the whims of a man they know is unsafe at any speed A man without qualities devoid of public spirit or regard for anyone but himself consumed by lifelong ambition needy for acclaim and irritable when it s denied willing to swing dangerously in any direction to be loved a man to shame the country as its figurehead 
JUN12	Theresa May’s carbon emissions plan will fail if the chancellor remains complacent	In a new attempt to tackle climate crisis the government is pledging to cut carbon emissions to net zero by It s seen as Theresa May s bid to create a permanent legacy in her final weeks in office While this target is still too slow it s a step in the right direction Yet just days ago her chancellor Philip Hammond raised concerns about the plan In a leaked letter to May he said the bill for moving to a zero carbon economy would be upwards of tn  To caution about costs is a standard Treasury response to anything But Hammond s intervention since he s on the centrist wing of a party that appears to be moving ever further to the right is particularly disquieting If even he doubts that saving the planet is money well spent what about the rest of his party It calls into question whether this government can be relied on to reach its green targets 
JUN12	I was forced out of my job after having a baby. Then I was silenced by an NDA	For a lot of women finding out you are pregnant opens up an array of questions Will the baby be a boy or girl Will everything go smoothly with the pregnancy  Sadly another question that often pops up amid the excitement is how will my employer take the news that I am expecting a baby Pregnancy discrimination is a huge problem in the UK with around three quarters of pregnant women experiencing some form of disadvantage at work In a survey for the Equality and Human Rights Commission one in nine mothers reported that they were either dismissed made compulsorily redundant or treated so poorly they felt they had to leave their jobs that s the equivalent of new mothers a year Yesterday a new report from MPs highlighted evidence that some companies are pressurising women to sign non disclosure agreements in order to cover up this unlawful behaviour and discrimination 
JUN12	Theresa May’s net-zero emissions target is a lot less impressive than it looks	Theresa May is doing her best to grab some good headlines in the closing weeks of her premiership Setting a target for net zero greenhouse gas emissions is vital but her government s plans are too little too late  Yes Britain may be the first G country to set a net zero emissions target by but others have shown greater ambition Finland committed to be carbon neutral by Norway has a target and eight EU countries have asked for all members of the bloc to commit to net zero by and dedicate a quarter of the EU s next budget to projects fighting climate change Britain wasn t among them 
JUN12	The New York Times political cartoon ban is a sinister and dangerous over-reaction	April it seems really is the cruellest month for the New York Times On April its international edition formerly the International Herald Tribune ran a cartoon by the Portuguese cartoonist Ant nio Moreira Antunes previously published in the Lisbon paper Expresso and depicting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a guide dog leading a blind Donald Trump In the way of cartoons the Netanyahu dog had a blue Star of David presumably meant to signify the Israeli flag dangling from his collar while Trump wore a yarmulke  There was an instant outcry condemning the cartoon s antisemitic imagery including in articles and editorials in the New York Times itself As a result the paper has decided it will no longer publish any political cartoons in the international edition the NYT domestic paper dropped cartoons several years ago and is terminating its contracts with in house cartoonists Heng and the multi award winning Patrick Chappatte In a statement released on Tuesday the paper announced that it would continue investing in forms of opinion journalism including visual journalism that express nuance complexity and strong voice from a diversity of viewpoints 
JUN12	Kylie Jenner’s party was stupid. But it won’t curtail the power of The Handmaid’s Tale	I felt a small spark of joy yesterday as I imagined Margaret Atwood s facial expression when confronted with the news that a member of the Kardashian family Kylie Jenner had provoked internet outrage by organising a Handmaid s Tale themed party The novelist is known for taking no prisoners and the footage which shows Jenner and her friends squealing as they are confronted with Handmaid themed costumes and cocktails lays bare some of the most flagrant stupidity I think I have ever witnessed  Was I particularly offended Before anyone cries snowflake I was not But I was astonished at the ignorance and privilege of the women in the video who will never suffer if Roe v Wade is repealed abortion is outlawed in the US and women s bodily autonomy is drastically curtailed The Handmaid s Tale is a TV series to them a piece of pop culture iconography that can be stripped of its context but even then it is not without its dark connotations The first series was a brilliant and faithful adaptation of the book before the next series descended into violence so disturbing and gratuitous that many women I know stopped watching Yet the rape and the female genital mutilation and the torture did not preclude this story from being chosen by a young woman as the theme of a glossy celebration ripped of its context and appropriated 
JUN12	The Tory contest shows that the Brexiters’ dream is dying before their very eyes	Brexit is the reason the Conservatives are choosing a new leader yet the competition has become a race to change the subject Candidates are being judged not by any probability of success in taking the UK out of the EU but by the ability to comfort fellow Tories that there is life for their party on the other side once the deed is done  How to get there is a side issue 
JUN13	Boris Johnson may be an incompetent liar, but charm is his secret weapon	Charm is politics deadliest weapon It is not charisma the authority to lead through an electrifying presence It is a subtler more intangible quality possessed by Boris Johnson He may be blatantly unqualified as Britain s next prime minister but following yesterday s first round leadership ballot he is still odds on favourite The basis for this lies in his disposition of charm  Johnson is the darling of the polls He mesmerises punch drunk Tories and disillusioned Labour voters alike He emerges from his biographical record as incompetent lazy dissolute and a liar yet the public s response is that he is our kind of liar He was sacked by the Times for story fabrication and was a wildly biased reporter while in Brussels His default mode has always been that of standup comedian funny unpredictable mildly dangerous As the current campaign of his rival Michael Gove is derailed for far lesser sins his campaign appears to glide forwards on sheer force of personality The unfairness is grotesque 
JUN13	Two years after Grenfell, why are thousands still not safe in their homes?	The towers lit up one by one on Wednesday night In London Newcastle and Manchester the message was simple Two years after Grenfell and this building is still covered in dangerous cladding read one Two years after Grenfell and the fire doors in this building still aren t fit for purpose said another  At Frinstead House a single stair tower block next to Grenfell where residents watched the fire unfold from their windows two years ago the message read years after Grenfell this building still has no sprinklers Karim Mussilhy vice chair of the campaign group Grenfell United whose uncle died in the fire wrote Tonight Grenfell United is shining a spotlight on tower blocks across the country still unsafe two years after Grenfell 
JUN13	To shut down parliament would be simple. But it would be an outrage	Whoever is elected Tory leader and becomes prime minister will find the clock is still ticking Britain is to exit the European Union on Halloween October To avoid that outcome the EU must agree to a further extension so that the government can alter the exit date The new prime minister will also be confronted with the unforgiving arithmetic of the House of Commons Most MPs oppose a no deal Brexit though Labour s attempt to enshrine this in law failed yesterday But MPs have also three times rejected the only seeming alternative the withdrawal agreement so laboriously negotiated by Theresa May The EU has insisted that no alternative agreement is available  Two candidates for the Tory leadership Dominic Raab and Esther McVey propose breaking this deadlock by proroguing parliament ending the session so that MPs are unable to block a no deal Brexit This some have objected could involve the Queen since prorogation unlike the dissolution of parliament which leads to a general election is governed not by statute but by royal prerogative Indeed Lord Armstrong the former cabinet secretary has suggested that the Queen before exercising her discretion on so contentious a matter would consult with Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the opposition and perhaps also with others 
JUN13	As a new parent, I felt afraid and alone. The UK needs family-friendly policies now	The first day my partner went back to work after we d had a baby I had to shower eat breakfast and make my lunch at am In the dark Without waking the neighbours I had no other choice My partner s minute commute and his am start time meant he had to leave the flat at am and wouldn t be home again until pm Thirteen straight hours of keeping an utterly helpless infant alive on my own having never done it before If I wanted to eat wash the night s sweat breastmilk and mustard baby shit off my body and have something for lunch then I had to get it all sorted while there was someone else on hand to hold rock soothe bounce or wind our baby  Because my partner was retraining after a career change in his early s he was entitled to precisely no paternity leave Not so much as a day to bond with attend to or care for his son Let alone me At his employees discretion he managed to get five days off as compassionate leave Which is why less than a week after giving birth with blood still flowing from my body my pelvis still creaking back together and having had less than two hours of continuous sleep I watched him cycle off into the cold pre dawn air the imprint of the baby s sling still marked against his shirt as I prepared to face my first day alone with a baby If I d had a caesarean I might not yet have been able to stand 
JUN13	Music saved my life. Banning drill takes hope away from black British kids like me	I grew up in Thornton Heath south east London Although raised by a good family in a close community I was exposed to violence and violent crime throughout my childhood and young adult life I ve seen people beaten and stabbed and shot In I was involved in an incident where my mum was shot in front of me and my stepfather was shot and killed I myself spent several years committing crimes running from the police and at one point I went to jail Although I now appreciate this is far from normal we didn t know that almost daily violence wasn t the norm for most young British kids I believe that we me and my community suffer from the trauma of what we experienced to this day  Watching other artists make it out of the ends and on to our TV sets was a huge inspiration to me They didn t rap about butterflies and happy days they rapped about a life that was like mine But hearing their lyrics didn t make me want to go out and hurt people sell drugs and go back to jail It made me even more empowered to make my life successful in a positive legal creative way After being in a music crew for a couple of years I formed a duo with my friend Krept in and I can honestly say that music saved my life After the murder of my stepdad it was music that actually pulled me out of my former lifestyle Before music there was just jail gangs and getting arrested Without music I do not know if I would be alive today Best case scenario I d be in prison 
JUN13	Binge TV: a lovely sugar rush, but ultimately unsatisfying	How do you watch TV All in one gulp or paced out slowly in weekly increments This week a Radio Times survey suggested that the latter method is falling out of fashion with of respondents suggesting that they d lost sleep binge watching a programme and more than half claiming to have watched more than eight hours of a show in one sitting  Yet how satisfying is binge watching really Yes there s something comforting about knowing that the next episode is only ever one short countdown away but it s also the case that being able to watch shows when we want and as frequently as we want at least until that terrible moment when the episodes dry up is increasingly affecting the way we consume TV and not necessarily for the better 
JUN13	I was blocked from advising on UK drug policy – because I criticised UK drug policy	Last year I applied to join the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs which advises the government on drug policy I thought I could bring expertise on the impact of policing on people of colour on harm reduction and on legal alternatives to the criminalisation of drug users all of which I have written extensively on and the fact that I work directly with people who have a history of problematic drug use But last October I was notified by the Home Office that my application had been unsuccessful  In the feedback provided I was told that the interview panel considered me to be appointable and I was described as having impressive expertise However the relevant minister ultimately decided I should not be appointed because of my social media activity I submitted a subject access request to the Home Office and the results were pretty shocking 
JUN13	My Catholic, trans child is living proof of how wrong the Vatican is on gender	The recent document from the Vatican s Congregation for Catholic Education talks of an educational crisis and alleges that discussions in relation to gender have helped to destabilise the family as an institution As the parent of a trans child I find this hugely disappointing  I have two teenage daughters Their dad is Catholic and they ve been raised in the Catholic faith When our youngest came out as transgender we struggled This was five years ago and there was limited coverage of trans people in the media We struggled in our own minds how can our child know so young What if she s wrong What does this mean We struggled with our families unsure of how to tell them or indeed how they would react We struggled with our church would we still be welcome Should we find a different one A different school 
JUN13	Hong Kong is in danger. China’s promise of democracy was a lie	The ninth of June was a Sunday Any other Sunday in summer at Causeway Bay Hong Kong old men and women would do their usual walkabouts and maids would gather spread out groundsheets cover them with spicy delicacies and listen to Filipino pop songs But it was not like any other Sunday at least not for me Filled with anxiety hope and anger I joined the protest against Hong Kong s proposed extradition law alongside three classmates from my evening Spanish class We were hopeful because perhaps there was a slim chance that our government would listen to us for once We were angry because our government had repeatedly lied to us  I had not taken part in any demonstrations since at which time I still had not yet completely lost faith in the sincerity of China s promise of democracy for Hong Kong But this time I just felt I had to 
JUN13	Sudan is heading for atrocity once again. The UK government must not sit by	Politicians and journalists frequently ask where is the next Myanmar Where will the next Syria be The deteriorating situation in Sudan now presents an urgent test case of the strength of our resolve  In the last days at least people have been killed by regime forces and more than have been injured as protests have steadily engulfed Khartoum There are widespread reports of sexual violence mass arrests gunfire in medical facilities and bodies floating in the river Nile Beyond Khartoum there have been larger massacres in historical conflict areas where early reports suggest that people are being killed in even greater numbers 
JUN14	Brexit Britain is wallowing in dangerous talk of national humiliation	Launching his bid for the Tory leadership this week Dominic Raab announced histrionically We ve been humiliated as a country For those of us who do not live on planet Brexit this might have been mistaken for a belated reaction to the genuinely demeaning spectacle of Donald Trump s state visit a week earlier But of course like almost all of his fellow contenders to be the next prime minister Raab was playing his part in a strange performance in which the national honour has been so horribly besmirched by the European Union that it can be salved only by taking the pain of a no deal Brexit  Perhaps if you keep acting out phoney feelings you end up not being able to recognise the real thing Brexit Britain has been wallowing in a hyped up psychodrama of national humiliation It is indeed one of the very few things that remainers and leavers still share even if they feel mortified for very different reasons In relation to the EU this sense of humiliation is wildly overplayed But when Trump comes to town and really does degrade Britain the sense of wounded dignity that ought to be felt seems curiously absent 
JUN14	Wake up, England: Boris Johnson’s ‘charm’ is just the arrogance of those born to rule	I recognise this feeling and I hate it A friend is going out with a guy who humiliates her spends her money has affairs and is abusive Yet she feels lost and is somehow dependent and when he promises he will make it all OK somehow that he will change and the future will be wonderful she decides to give it another whirl Anyway she says what else is there Half broken she has lost the ability to even imagine a better life for herself  It is no use my anger on her behalf or my lament over her passivity And yes this woman is you She is England not Scotland you don t need to explain the difference to me I see you England on social media bewailing our powerlessness and aren t the Tories awful God knows I feel your pain I am just really bored of the self flagellation of victimhood 
JUN14	Trump’s fanned the flames in Iran, now the fire risks getting out of control	The growing confrontation in the Gulf between the US and its Saudi led allies on one side and Iran and its proxies on the other is now focused on the spate of recent mine attacks on oil tankers which have been blamed by the US on Iran s Revolutionary Guards This is a standoff that has been coming It is incontestable that Iran has been guilty of destabilising overreach in the Middle East in recent years as it has moved to build a crescent of Shia influence from Damascus to Baghdad and Lebanon to Yemen  But Iran s actions can hardly be said to have occurred in a vacuum As the Iran analyst for Crisis Group Ali Vaez recently argued it has been the recent policy of maximum pressure on Tehran under the incoherent foreign policy of the Trump administration that has exacerbated the current tensions In short order the Trump administration has withdrawn unilaterally from the internationally agreed and successful Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA of whose purpose was to ease sanctions on Iran in exchange for verifiable limits on the country s nuclear programme 
JUN14	Oxfam failed horribly on abuse. But I pledge to deliver radical change	This week Oxfam has been the subject of two incredibly difficult and important reports that identify serious failings in how we acted in the past failings that were unacceptable and showed how far below our values we could fall Yet these reports also include lessons that provide the path we must follow as we set out on a journey of what I hope will be transformative change  The Charity Commission s report has left no doubt that what happened in Haiti in was shameful The report by an independent commission into Oxfam s global safeguarding practices and working culture again makes for sobering reading It criticises our culture with examples of sexism racism and colonial behaviour It also identifies major challenges notably abuse in refugee camps where we and other organisations work 
JUN14	You saw me covered in blood on a bus. But do you get outraged about all homophobia?	On June characters from distant chapters of my life decided that my sudden trajectory into the headlines was an opportune time to reintroduce themselves sending a torrent of misguided good vibes alongside the picture asking had I seen it Had I seen it Had I seen it Of course I had as soon as it was taken  I was weeping bitterly head ringing in pain as I sat next to my lovely date Dr Melania Geymonat who was calmer than I but dripping blood down her shirt front We photographed the trail of our blood down the bus ending at our still bleeding faces as we awaited the police I watched in real time as our faces white feminine draped in pretty hair circulated on every continent Melania protected my name and information because I am a private individual without an online presence 
JUN14	Britain has a duty to help Hong Kong out of this dark moment	It took something out of the ordinary to provoke a million people in Hong Kong to take to the streets to demonstrate against proposed new extradition rules Roughly one sixth of the population demonstrated peacefully families young and old lawyers academics students professionals and manual workers  What caused such an outpouring against a piece of legislation Quite simply the people of Hong Kong not British but Hong Kong Chinese have seen their government connive with the Communist regime in Beijing to undermine their way of life and freedoms 
JUN14	Chuka Umunna’s self-serving hypocrisy is emblematic of our broken politics	 You can t trust a word the Lib Dems say here is an entirely accurate summation tweeted to the world in by the new Liberal Democrat MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna Announcing his second defection in four months Umunna last night posed alongside Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable whom he once astutely declared can t run away from his record as part of the Tory led government or try to pretend Tory policies have nothing to do with the Lib Dems Just two years ago he bitterly declared he can t forgive what the Lib Dems have done to my area indeed that he could never countenance suggesting voters support Liberal Democratic or Conservative candidates on account of their Remain credentials this would require turning a blind eye to the cuts to our local schools the NHS and other public services instigated by both parties in government from to  Everyone is entitled to shift their opinions as John Maynard Keynes once put it When the facts change I change my mind What do you do sir But what facts have changed about the Lib Dems since Both Cable and Jo Swinson the frontrunner to replace him as leader are unrepentant about the austerity they imposed on the country and which Umunna all too recently passionately condemned them for It gets better At the end of April a leaked document from Umunna s Change UK revealed his then party s plans to wipe out the Lib Dems as an electoral force Umunna has gone from seeking to politically extinguish a party to becoming its enthusiastic parliamentary representative in the course of seven weeks 
JUN14	Grenfell Tower, two years on: community members discuss what’s changed	I was in the cemetery just last week I was showing my friend each grave telling him about the person whose name is etched into the gravestone He gasped as he realised that some gravestones had more than one name attached to them It s not a usual scenario but then is any part of what happened at Grenfell usual We span two areas of the cemetery visiting those we ve lost ending our visit by making prayers for peace patience and blessings for each person who is no longer with us  A few days later just last Sunday I received several calls from people alerting me to a fire that had broken out at flats in Barking Thankfully no lives were lost but life for all those who used to live there had changed their possessions were destroyed within minutes 
JUN14	Help to buy has helped the well-off – and made the housing crisis worse	Conservative politicians have long professed their infallible belief that Britain should be a property owning democracy From Noel Skelton who actually came up with the phrase in the s to Margaret Thatcher who usually gets the credit it is their maxim So in when David Cameron found himself presiding over a fall in homeownership so severe that it hit a year low and hearing that even the middle classes couldn t get on the housing ladder he felt compelled to act  Enter help to buy a three part scheme launched in made up of a highly controversial mortgage guarantee which wound down in a government equity loan offering subsidised loans in London and elsewhere to anyone who could get a deposit together and an Isa It was meant to help Generation Rent but equally to shore up the post crash economy by creating buyers in a stagnating housing market It was hailed as the biggest government intervention in housing since right to buy but it wasn t the first scheme of its kind Labour introduced HomeBuy Direct in and George Osborne had launched a scheme called Newbuy in 
JUN14	Another Etonian leader? Time for Labour to challenge the might of private schools	Not since Harold Wilson s government set up a commission to deal with the public school problem has the Palace of Westminster hosted an event that could bring about the dismantling of Britain s educational apartheid But MPs this week held a debate on a programme for radical reform of a two tier system that provides an elite education for a tiny minority of the population and divides Britain into winners and losers  It could not come at a more propitious moment Britain is on the brink of falling out of Europe our mainstream political parties are tearing themselves apart and populism is on the rise as people seek alternatives to the Westminster model of government And yet at this most critical moment in our nation s history we are reduced to spectators watching in helpless horror as the Tory party goes through the motions of in all likelihood anointing Boris Johnson as yet another Etonian prime minister the th in Britain s history 
JUN15	When will the resistance in Britain to populism properly begin?	The resistance to the Johnson Farage axis will not come from the parliamentary Conservative party In private MPs who once made sure demagogues did not become prime ministers admit that Johnson is a phoney unfit for high office or any office But the Tory party s guardians no longer care The gatekeepers are lifting the lock and urging the bullshitter to charge into the china shop  They calculate that only an alliance between the right and the far right can ensure their party s survival The pact may be unacknowledged Johnson may neutralise the Brexit party by becoming more Faragist than Farage The Tories will take his votes and he will fade into the background I don t see a man with Farage s sense of entitlement fading willingly His friends Matteo Salvini and Donald Trump have power in Italy and America respectively Why should Britain s man of destiny allow the Conservatives to pat him on the head and say The grownups will take it from here 
JUN15	Are only certain kinds of people deemed worthy of our compassion?	When is a Good Samaritan not a Good Samaritan When he or she helps someone undeserving of our humanity  In Arizona on June a jury was unable to reach a verdict on Scott Daniel Warren a college lecturer accused of conspiracy to transport and harbour migrants after providing them with food and shelter He faced up to years in jail He may still do if there s a retrial 
JUN15	It’s last orders for working-hours boozing. We should drink to that	Has working hours drinking culture died or is it just slumped in an office lavatory cubicle sleeping off a liquid lunch  I ask because the London Metal Exchange has banned staff from drinking during working hours just as Lloyds of London did in Which has to be good City traders dealing in millions and billions probably need to be sober Discuss Though maybe it s yet another sign of the end of an era 
JUN15	Binge-watching Jed Mercurio goes beyond the line of duty	According to a survey by RadioTimes com binge watching is not the benign addiction that it appears to be Almost one in five respondents said they had called in sick to work just so they could watch television while half said they had watched more than eight hours in one go  I blame the United States At least Britain has decreed that six episodes is plenty for a series When I was heavily involved with The Good Wife its episode seasons really ate into my time And I ve been trying to watch Gilmore Girls for years and am yet to break the season three barrier Will Rory ever get to college I can t tell you It s so long 
JUN15	We must transform our lives and values to save this burning planet	The case for action to tackle the climate emergency on a scale far beyond anything that has yet been attempted is increasingly widely understood Almost three decades after the first UN climate treaty was agreed in Rio de Janeiro in and despite the commitments thrashed out among nation states at every summit since global carbon emissions last year rose to a record bn tonnes  In October UN scientists warned that within years a target of C of global heating would be out of reach Above this level temperature increases are predicted to cause colossal disruption million more people displaced as a consequence of higher sea levels greatly increased risk of fires drought and extreme weather of all kinds shrinkage of plant and insect habitats with massive effects on agriculture as well as nature the extinction of coral 
JUN15	The Tory leadership battle is making Britain the kind of nation we used to laugh at	Imagine a faraway country where an influential but controversial business with deep pockets hires itself a senior politician It s all perfectly above board of course He gets a year for a few hours work a week duly delivered to everyone s satisfaction while harnessing the company s considerable soft power to support his personal and political ambitions  In due course he runs for prime minister with the company cheerleading all the way Nobody is so unspeakably vulgar as to suggest any kind of quid pro quo But if he wins he will be legislating on matters of great interest to this company from the tax affairs of its owners to the commercial conditions under which it operates There is a minor uproar about all this but people are largely resigned to the way things work in this country now Besides scandal has always miraculously slid off this particular politician without leaving a mark

JUN15	Let’s get real before deepfake videos corrupt our democracy	 Deepfake it sounds like the title of a James Bond film But deepfakes are becoming more dangerous and frequently more sexually explicit than anything might get up to A deepfake the deep is taken from machine deep learning is a computer manipulated video and the next frontier of conspiracy theory and fake news  Lots of us have been ringing the alarm bell for a while over deepfakes but the nerdy language that explains their invention and evolution has perhaps meant that people haven t paid attention But this week an exquisitely realistic deepfake of Facebook s founder Mark Zuckerberg uploaded to Instagram a Facebook owned platform cut through 
JUN15	Wake up, England: Boris Johnson’s ‘charm’ is just the arrogance of those born to rule	I recognise this feeling and I hate it A friend is going out with a guy who humiliates her spends her money has affairs and is abusive Yet she feels lost and is somehow dependent and when he promises he will make it all OK somehow that he will change and the future will be wonderful she decides to give it another whirl Anyway she says what else is there Half broken she has lost the ability to even imagine a better life for herself  It is no use my anger on her behalf or my lament over her passivity And yes this woman is you She is England not Scotland you don t need to explain the difference to me I see you England on social media bewailing our powerlessness and aren t the Tories awful God knows I feel your pain I am just really bored of the self flagellation of victimhood 
JUN15	Trump’s fanned the flames in Iran, now the fire risks getting out of control	The growing confrontation in the Gulf between the US and its Saudi led allies on one side and Iran and its proxies on the other is now focused on the spate of recent mine attacks on oil tankers which have been blamed by the US on Iran s Revolutionary Guards This is a standoff that has been coming It is incontestable that Iran has been guilty of destabilising overreach in the Middle East in recent years as it has moved to build a crescent of Shia influence from Damascus to Baghdad and Lebanon to Yemen  But Iran s actions can hardly be said to have occurred in a vacuum As the Iran analyst for Crisis Group Ali Vaez recently argued it has been the recent policy of maximum pressure on Tehran under the incoherent foreign policy of the Trump administration that has exacerbated the current tensions In short order the Trump administration has withdrawn unilaterally from the internationally agreed and successful Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA of whose purpose was to ease sanctions on Iran in exchange for verifiable limits on the country s nuclear programme 
JUN16	If you think Rory Stewart is the grownup choice, think again	These politically correct times make it difficult to keep up with the right nouns for thin skinned online activists Terms that attempt to pithily describe identities and behaviours are now slurs You can t even harass transgender women out of public life any more without somebody calling you a Terf nor can you take pride in defending the centre ground of politics without highly unreasonable individuals defaming you as a centrist No the correct terminology for the custodians of legitimate discourse is simply the grownups  The latest to win over the hearts and minds of the kind of people who describe themselves as sensible is the Tory leadership hopeful Rory Stewart He s managed to secure the endorsements of Kirstie Allsopp David Aaronovitch James O Brien and Jane Merrick all of whom I m sure command a great deal of clout amongst the Ukip ified Tory membership who will actually decide whether or not he becomes our next prime minister But even if the politics of Stewart s campaign don t quite line up with the priorities of the Conservative grassroots there s no denying his cultural appeal He s a bit geeky he s posh he makes car crash video content in short he s relentlessly himself 
JUN16	If you want to help Sudan, amplify the voices of those suffering its horrors	It has been two weeks since the Janjaweed Sudan s infamous militia embarked on a brutal campaign to disperse and suppress a popular uprising against deposed president Omar al Bashir s military government The country is still in shock In its capital city Khartoum the atmosphere is that of a wake as the dead raped and beaten are counted The faces of the missing and presumed dead haunt social media their families braced for the possibility of seeing their loved ones bloated and washed up on the banks of the Nile where the Janjaweed s victims are still surfacing  The full extent of this horror is still to unfold As graphic videos of the violence began to circulate the government shut down the internet plunging the country into darkness in which it still remains as the Janjaweed continues its campaign of state capture The swaggering members of the militia prowl Khartoum s traumatised streets stabbing shooting mugging and harassing at will The contrast to the heady days not so long ago when the city was the site of a colossal sit in that became a cultural hub and a site of national reconciliation is almost too painful to note That is my insurmountable torment the fact that it happened so quickly that Sudan s cry of revolution was choked in its throat The paint on the impromptu street murals mixed with the blood of the protesters who had made the sit in a giant collage of hope 
JUN16	The urgency of climate crisis needed robust new language to describe it	Initial reader response was positive to the Guardian s recent changes to the way it will refer to climate This is an epic struggle of ideas crucial to our future wrote one aye sayer The announcement by editor in chief Katharine Viner of five changes to the style guide generated reaction in media and science For each change in bold below I asked Viner for her reasons which follow here in italics She began by reiterating that none of the old terms is banned If in a particular circumstance the original term is clearly more appropriate then it should be used But the preference is for the new terms Use climate emergency crisis or breakdown instead of climate changeHuge scale and immediate action is needed to slash emissions but they are still going up that s an emergency or crisis Extreme weather is increasing and climate patterns established for millennia are changing hence breakdown Use global heating instead of global warmingGlobal heating is more scientifically accurate Greenhouse gases form an atmospheric blanket that stops the sun s heat escaping back to space Use wildlife instead of biodiversity Biodiversity is not a common or well understood term and is a bit clinical when you are talking about all the creatures that share our planet Use fish populations instead of fish stocksThis change emphasises that fish do not exist solely to be harvested by humans they play a vital role in the natural health of the oceans Use climate science denier or climate denier instead of climate scepticVery few experts are in good faith truly sceptical of climate science or of the necessity for strong climate action Those arguing against it are denying the overwhelming evidence that the climate crisis exists  Readers took the discussion further and I put some of their suggestions bold to Viner for her responses italics Wildlife is insufficient to describe biodiversity A reasonable argument biodiversity is not banned if it s clearly the best term then use it wildlife is a much more accessible word and is fair to use in many stories Carbon emissions should be carbon dioxide emissions Carbon dioxide emissions is technically correct but a commonly used shorthand greenhouse gas emissions is even better if we re talking about all gases that warm the atmosphere ie including methane nitrogen oxides CFCs etc Consider climate instability instead of climate heating Global heating and climate breakdown serve the same purpose as climate instability Not heating overheating Overheating implies a judgment about how much is too much I think that judgment is captured by climate crisis emergency breakdown 
JUN16	Hong Kong is not China yet, but that feared day is coming ever nearer	Hong Kong has become a place whose present is unresolved and whose future is unimaginable After the unexpected violence of the last week no one can predict how the events of this afternoon tomorrow this week will play out The only certainty is that Hong Kong s way of life is under immediate threat and its people are coming out in force to defend it  But the curse of living in the eternal immediate present is that the stakes for this last fight could not be higher especially since young Hong Kongers fear that if they are defeated in this battle there will be nothing left to lose The failure of the Umbrella movement five years ago when Hong Kongers occupied important thoroughfares for days seeking greater democratic participation to win any concrete gains has raised the stakes further still this time round 
JUN16	How to follow the Maybot? A droid PM	Perhaps we should have a robot prime minister What do you think It might be worth a go Has technology advanced to the extent that some computer centred entity could fail to do all the things Theresa May has failed to do almost as comprehensively It s possible It might even fail to do them more quickly and efficiently by which I mean succeed in accomplishing that failure more quickly and efficiently  Then again to give May a bit of credit the comparatively slow rate at which she failed to achieve any of her goals was the most commendable aspect of her premiership Her order of preference was probably succeed quickly succeed slowly fail slowly fail quickly She got her third choice like so much of the electorate and hence she s been prime minister for a reasonably long time So it wouldn t be fair to conclude that her robot equivalent was better merely because it managed to reach her current nadir of non success in say seconds rather than two years and months 
JUN16	Blunt knives to stop domestic violence? What next – stab vests in the kitchen?	Nottinghamshire police have been defending a new scheme to distribute blunt ended knives to victims of domestic abuse But some cooks are unconvinced by assurances from the force s knife crime strategy manager Supt Matt McFarlane that the utensils won t compromise standards of food preparation Has he really considered knife skills in the round  The last time a similar innovation was proposed rather persuasively by three doctors in the BMJ the late chef Anthony Bourdain considered it another sign of the coming apocalypse And that roundly derided scheme was devised not with domestic stabbing in mind but with armed young men with neither an obvious interest in nor much opportunity for home cooking Isn t that reason enough to rethink a plan that encourages women to cohabit with psychopaths whose suspicions thanks to a new blunt knife they may have alerted Isn t there a better case for free stab vests for wear during cooking and whenever a known assailant might be around in or out of the house You can t be too careful As the Nottingham police and crime commissioner one Paddy Tipping said last week of the blunt knives project It is an excellent initiative Some research shows that women are attacked around times before they leave their home 
JUN16	When will the resistance in Britain to populism properly begin?	The resistance to the Johnson Farage axis will not come from the parliamentary Conservative party In private MPs who once made sure demagogues did not become prime ministers admit that Johnson is a phoney unfit for high office or any office But the Tory party s guardians no longer care The gatekeepers are lifting the lock and urging the bullshitter to charge into the china shop  They calculate that only an alliance between the right and the far right can ensure their party s survival The pact may be unacknowledged Johnson may neutralise the Brexit party by becoming more Faragist than Farage The Tories will take his votes and he will fade into the background I don t see a man with Farage s sense of entitlement fading willingly His friends Matteo Salvini and Donald Trump have power in Italy and America respectively Why should Britain s man of destiny allow the Conservatives to pat him on the head and say The grownups will take it from here 
JUN16	Jo Brand’s joke: are we all now disgusted of Tunbridge Wells?	I don t know about you but I m aghast Thunderstruck flabbergasted jaw on the ground fists in the air full body a tremble outraged  In case you didn t hear in the past few days Jo Brand has been catapulted from funny in the s comedian to cause celebre via a stint in the social media stocks The trigger was a comment made on Radio s Heresy a comedy panel show that primes guests to challenge received wisdom on a range of topics via heretical comments 
JUN16	Are only certain kinds of people deemed worthy of our compassion?	When is a Good Samaritan not a Good Samaritan When he or she helps someone undeserving of our humanity  In Arizona on June a jury was unable to reach a verdict on Scott Daniel Warren a college lecturer accused of conspiracy to transport and harbour migrants after providing them with food and shelter He faced up to years in jail He may still do if there s a retrial 
JUN16	Don’t mess with the Scots or we’ll send in the patrol boats	Perhaps it will come to be known as the Rockall Rammy and feature occasionally in future modern studies Higher papers Discuss Scotland s seven day period of imperial aggression towards Ireland in with reference to the island of Rockall You could fill your boots and make it up as you go along just as the SNP did  When the Scottish government announced a few weeks ago that we were sending a patrol boat to shoo away Irish fishing vessels from the waters around Rockall many Scots were intrigued Rockall is an uninhabitable block of granite in the North Atlantic Ocean that was annexed by the British in It lies miles distant from North Uist making it around miles closer to Britain than to Ireland 
JUN17	Theresa May could yet give us the ultimate parting gift: a Brexit referendum	The obscene sight of Tory leadership candidates splashing out cash by the bucketload is just one of the head clutching this can t be happening unbelievables of this extraordinary time Spaffing it up the wall doesn t begin to express the revolting spectacle of wild tax cuts and eye catching gimmicks from the same austerians who garrotted every public service Theresa May is the biggest spender spraying goodbye billions on mental health schools colleges and a zero carbon pledge while Philip Hammond s Treasury declares it immoral to steal from the emergency no deal fund What does she care She is taking her revenge on them all  Who knows the dark recesses of her mind this locked in woman incapable of communication 
JUN17	I’m pregnant and forced to choose between being an MP and a mum	Even when you ve spent a lifetime fighting for equality you can still be floored by the way discrimination manifests itself I never thought parliament would tell me to choose between being an MP and being a mum My Labour colleague Tulip Siddiq was forced to postpone a C section so she could cast a vote in the debate on Theresa May s Brexit deal in January and that caused a rightful outcry Westminster can when it wants make it possible to combine parenthood with legislating and Siddiq s push for progress on a system that would have allowed her to vote by proxy demonstrates it But allowing an MP to nominate someone to vote on their behalf when they need to be at home with their children is just one piece of a much bigger equality puzzle  During my first miscarriage aching and bleeding I joined a protest for the extradition of a man who had raped and murdered a constituent The day after I found out that another baby s heartbeat had stopped I led a public meeting on gang crime I even scheduled the procedure to remove the body on a day I didn t have a constituency advice surgery Heartbroken by all the years that I have struggled with fertility I ve kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected 
JUN17	The Wahaca row shows why workers need a new way to unite	A row recently erupted over workers conditions in the restaurant group Wahaca that turned out to be a little more complicated than it looked Some diners had done a runner another law abiding punter Sarah Hayward overheard the ensuing row and took to Twitter to complain Ppl next to us left without paying and their server is made to foot the bill from his wages Apparently company policy Utterly shameful employment practice  After some social media to ing and fro ing it turned out the server had been docked on the bill then reimbursed as it did not amount to gross negligence The company s founder Thomasina Miers concluded It is a crazy world where one is hung before even being asked a question it really saddens me that people are so quick to presume the worst 
JUN17	From houses to wages, it's time we realised that size isn't everything	Among our nation s many long term property woes is that British homes are not only becoming less affordable they re also getting smaller However news from over the pond suggests shoebox living may not be a problem after all In the US average house sizes have been growing but satisfaction with them has remained flat Bigger just means bigger it doesn t mean better  It s just one study but on this occasion the usual academic caveat of more research is needed is well not needed Psychologists already know that we are compulsive comparators Improvements to our own fortune don t have any lasting effect unless they make us better off than those around us not just better off than we were Indeed we often feel worse if we get more but see peers get even more still 
JUN17	Why I hate emojis	Should I ever be kidnapped or held against my will I am talking about a boring wedding rather than a Liam Neeson Taken type scenario it will be very easy for my nearest and dearest to know something is up I will text them those vile little gurning dots called emojis and they will know my world is falling apart  I have never knowingly used an emoji and I don t intend to start now Someone has to hold the line Standards must be maintained Recently I accidentally giffed my phone had a sort of spasm in my bag but I have since apologised Gifs and memes are mostly lazy and formulaic but occasionally marvellous I can live with them I am not an animal 
JUN17	I thought I would die in Brook House. Now my abusers will have to face justice	I thought this moment would never come but I always clung on to hope I spent nearly two years in Brook House immigration detention centre and I was abused by the officers like so many other people there It often felt as if no one would ever find out what was happening But on Friday a judge ordered an inquiry that will make sure the voices of people like me are heard and make sure our abusers will finally face justice  If you saw BBC s Panorama documentary in on abuse in immigration detention services you would have seen me But what was shown on TV wasn t even half of what went on We were bullied every day We were mocked all the time There would be a casual racist taunt as you came down to breakfast a casual punch as you went to your cell to try to sleep And much more Those who couldn t speak English got it the worst Someone I knew well tried to hang himself the officers took their time in responding They didn t care whether we lived or died 
JUN17	Why the threat of an early election makes Tories double down on Boris Johnson	Will Britain s next prime minister have one of the shortest premierships in recent history Theresa May s successor is yet to be selected but already talk has turned to whether an early election is imminent With Boris Johnson the clear favourite for the job his pledge to take the UK out of the EU by the end of October deal or no deal has led a number of Tory MPs to predict that a snap election will soon follow his arrival in Downing Street  Johnson s closest rival Jeremy Hunt who came second in the first ballot has accused him of effectively committing the country to no deal or an election Although the former mayor of London has said he plans to negotiate a Brexit deal there is scepticism that a Brussels would be willing to cede to his demands and b there would be time for such a renegotiation to take place before the end of the article extension on October 
JUN17	The EU's Islamophobia is getting worse – Britain must fight this from within	The European elections last month were widely seen as a test of the EU s resilience Many were relieved that far right parties did not do as well as feared However nationalism is still on the rise across the continent and the EU is not an innocent bystander  A meeting of two Islamophobes earlier this month brought this home to me That day Myanmar s Aung San Suu Kyi met with her Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orb n At the top of their agenda was the danger of continuously growing Muslim populations No surprises there While Aung San Suu Kyi is complicit in the genocidal ethnic cleansing of some million Rohingya Muslim refugees into Bangladesh Orb n spearheaded the abhorrent fiction that the Jewish philanthropist George Soros is funding the mass migration of Muslims to Europe 
JUN17	Should dating apps tell us how sexy we are?	Marks out of how attractive do you think you are Perhaps you d describe yourself as a six on a good hair day or seven when you ve caught the sun Attractiveness after all is subjective and can change from day to day Besides isn t beauty in the eye of the beholder But the truth is if you have ever used an internet dating app your desirability has been rated It has to be User rankings are integral to how most mainstream dating apps purportedly including Tinder and Bumble function So would you want to know how you scored  Last week the dating app Once emailed users including me to tell them that they can now discover how they have ranked To help our matching algorithm we ask our users to rate each other sic pictures reads the email We have decided to be transparent and release this rating It was nearly pm and as a long suffering glutton for pain I jumped at the chance to ruin my day I logged in for the first time in several years to find out how I ranked based on photos from younger thinner times in my s I thought I d be crushed and readers I was right 
JUN17	It took me years to come out as bisexual. I just didn’t feel safe enough	I came out last year just before my th birthday as a bisexual woman As a result I regularly hear from people asking what they should do because they re getting older and sometimes are more frightened to come out I understand I wasn t sure what to do for a long time I didn t know if I was going to be accepted or understood As a year old who had been previously engaged to a cis man and as someone who could have never imagined being publicly happy with a woman or nonbinary person I empthasise  Coming out as bisexual a misunderstood sexuality added layers of insecurity and doubt Will everyone think I m just seeking attention Do I just need more Instagram likes to make this go away Just because I think Zo Kravitz is beautiful does that really equate to being queer Why didn t you do this earlier 
JUN18	Johnson might be a dead cert for Tory leader but Stewart has reshaped the race	Boris Johnson s ascent to the Tory leadership now looks unstoppable judged by nervous fellow MPs to be the candidate best placed to vanquish the Brexit party by adopting their central demand for a no deal Brexit The apparent inevitability of his ascent has led careerist critics like Matt Hancock to ditch their principles and climb aboard driven by the animating force of self interest Johnson emerged strengthened by the latest ballot and will be tested against other candidates for the first time in tonight s leadership debate Dominic Raab was eliminated having offered much the same Brexit position as Johnson but without his political agility  The other story is the momentum building behind Rory Stewart despite passing the threshold required to proceed in the contest by only four votes A reputed former MI officer who went to the same school Eton and same Oxford college Balliol as Johnson Stewart is a very Tory insurgent Against all expectations he remains in the race and is now four votes ahead of Sajid Javid and just four votes behind Michael Gove Yet even if he were to make it to the final two who will go forward for a ballot of all members polling suggests that Johnson remains the overwhelming favourite 
JUN18	The Tories want to back a winner. But they don’t know how to win	Two primal impulses are driving the Tory leadership contest the desperate hunt for an election winner and morbid fear of an election Any tension between them is meant to be resolved by a Brexit miracle the new prime minister releases Britain from European bondage on October and a thankful nation flings itself into outstretched Conservative arms  It is always a mistake to expect gratitude from electorates Voters see political pledges as a contract not a favour and they quickly move on to new demands Labour s victory in is the benchmark If Winston Churchill couldn t bank a VE day dividend at the ballot box there isn t much prospect of Boris Johnson getting one for some rickety Brexit bodge job 
JUN18	The Iran crisis was created in Washington. The US must be talked down	In Washington at times of stress international crises play out in black and white As in a flickering newsreel from a former age complex events are reduced to symbolic emblems of right and wrong Grainy video images of evil doers George W Bush s favoured term purport to show faceless Iranians acting suspiciously around a burning oil tanker in the Gulf last week As new Middle East troop deployments are announced US battleships are pictured bravely patrolling freedom s frontline  Monochromatic simplifications of this type suit multiple purposes In the present US Iran crisis they supposedly provide official proof of nefarious intent They can be seen to justify escalatory US actions that might previously have appeared unreasonable and provocative They place pressure on reluctant allies to fall in behind the advancing American columns Most of all since democratic consent apparently still counts for something they are intended to rally public support 
JUN18	Cute? These eyebrow-raising dogs are master manipulators of the human heart	In a bit of news that unusually for these times doesn t make one want to hunker down underground never to resurface a study has been released about the adorableness of dogs Everyone loves an animal study One of my recent favourites was reported with the headline Cats are nice and enjoy spending time with humans which I presume was commissioned and carried out by cats  This week thanks to a UK US team of scientists we learn that the archetypal puppy dog eyes expression that makes us so susceptible to doggies charms and desires is down to the evolution of a forehead muscle This is found in domestic dogs we keep as pets but not their ancestors wolves 
JUN18	Tory leadership race: what’s the view from Europe?	Viewed from Europe the race for the Tory leadership has taken on a surreal quality as Boris Johnson takes an apparently unassailable lead in the multi round contest As a plethora of hostile editorials and articles in the European press attest the sight of a politician widely derided as a mini Trump becoming the new British prime minister has only confirmed the impression that the UK has been consumed by a populist revolution symbolised by the vote for Brexit  At one level this noise is more than superficial since it points to a fundamental problem with the Johnson candidacy for Europe which is the baggage he brings as a high profile character who made a career out of lampooning the ideals initiatives and institutions of the European Union There is no doubt that Johnson s record as both newspaper columnist and foreign minister will make it harder for Europe to justify making concessions to him that leaders were not prepared to make for Theresa May Come the October European Council there will be voices arguing that any concession to Johnson is a concession to populism and should be avoided 
JUN18	Heathrow’s expansion plans make a mockery of the zero emissions strategy	The bosses at Heathrow must have been visiting another planet last week or else they missed the government memo about legislating for net zero emissions by  The plans unveiled today for a expansion in the airport by including a third runway all to be done in a sustainable way take dissembling to new levels Heathrow is already the largest single source of carbon emissions in the UK 
JUN18	The answer to the UK’s homelessness crisis is painfully simple: give people homes	I was just years old when the financial crash hit but I remember it like it was yesterday I can replay in my mind the bankers leaving Lehman Brothers for the last time I can see the lines of people waiting to withdraw their savings from Northern Rock But the image that has stuck with me more than any other is the encampments of people in America living out of cars in tents and under bridges having been evicted from their homes after the subprime mortgage crisis  I knew things were bad in the UK I knew they might even get worse But I vividly remember thinking at least we are not the US 
JUN18	In Sudan and Hong Kong, protest is changing – and hope is rising	The massive demonstrations of recent weeks in Hong Kong and Sudan may seem to be totally disparate events But they have more in common than meets the eye The attempts by the authorities to disperse them with threats of violence or with peaceful promises is part of a wider global crackdown on people taking to the streets But the creativity of protesters in finding ever new ways of making their voices heard both online and in the streets is the real trend to note  When governments are seen as flawed or repressive people search for avenues other than just the ballot box These are the politics of voice and not just of vote as the Indian political scientist Neera Chandhoke has called it 
JUN18	Married men as priests? This could be the start of a Roman Catholic revolution	Desperate times need desperate measures Reading between the lines that s the subtext of the document released by the Vatican this week that opens the door to the possibility of ordaining married men Elderly ones mind And they must be in the church s inimitable habit of complicating everything under the sun by saying it in Latin viri probati That translates apparently to men of proven character Which at another time you d have been forgiven for thinking should go without saying  The document a working paper for a synod on the issues of the Pan Amazon region paints a picture of a dire crisis in which Catholics hungry for their faith are unable to access the sacraments because of what is widely described in the church as a shortage of priests Apparently would be churchgoers sometimes go months at a time without any contact with a priest which means they re unable to be present at mass to receive the Eucharist or to go confession For this reason says the document the criteria of selection and preparation of the ministers authorised to celebrate it should be changed 
JUN18	What happens to environment journalists is chilling: they get killed for their work	Many people tend to think of environmental journalism as the soft beat reporting on the natural world of dolphins polar bears birds pine cones and news about climate breakdown  But away from the privileged surroundings of Europe and North America in places where the rule of law fades away and the Earth s resources are among the few sources of wealth and power things get a lot more raw 
JUN19	From Thatcher to Brexit: this Tory folly was 40 years in the making	 I d like to have led the Conservative party I d like to have been prime minister confessed a disappointed Conservative politician on Monday It is proving to be that kind of week for the Tory combatants Today it was Rory Stewart s turn to come to terms with the dying of his national leadership dream as Boris Johnson consolidated his grip on the Tory election in advance of today s next rounds  But these words of regret did not come from Dominic Raab Matt Hancock or any of the earlier fallers in this contest Instead they were spoken this week by Michael Heseltine in the final part of the BBC s excellent five part documentary Thatcher a Very British Revolution It is what Heseltine said next that speaks most directly of all to the perhaps unsolvable problems facing today s Tory party If he had become prime minister Heseltine said It would have been a different country He is right about that But he didn t So it isn t And that is the Tory party s problem 
JUN19	Rory Stewart's exit means the Tories have now given up on reality	For a tiny moment this week it seemed as though the Conservatives had allowed a glimmer of reality into the party s bunker Rory Stewart a candidate universally derided when he launched his Tory leadership bid had begun to impress his parliamentary colleagues and on Tuesday night they had chosen him over the far more Brexit friendly candidate Dominic Raab  The intrusion did not last long Stewart finished last in the third round of voting on Wednesday evening and was duly eliminated His momentum had derailed so spectacularly that he actually lost votes even though there was one less candidate in the ring 
JUN19	Society is obsessed with women’s genitals. So why are ads for sex toys still taboo?	Given society s obsession with women s sexual organs how they should look how they should smell it is ironic that they are so intentionally concealed The latest attempt to obscure any mention of women s nether regions comes from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority the company that runs the New York subway which has rejected adverts by women s sexual health startup Dame Products showing sex toys Dame is now suing the MTA over its decision  Although the MTA maintains that the promotion of sexually oriented business has long been prohibited the definition appears to be slippery much to its disgust no doubt Several sexually suggestive tongue in cheek and God knows where else ads have been allowed including ones for condoms and erectile dysfunction medication 
JUN19	My baby’s still learning to crawl. Must he really be taught ‘British values’?	As a recent migrant to this country I got a shock when my husband and I looked for a childminder for our baby The ones we met told us that alongside development goals such as eating solids and saying Mama and Dada our child would be learning British values  One had an official Ofsted approved British values wheel displayed on her wall next to educational posters designed to teach shapes and colours The wheel had a picture of a doe eyed child in the centre with green arrows radiating from the child to the values written on a yellow disc I asked her about this baffling graphic and she rolled her eyes Oh yes she said ruefully The British values Got to have them 
JUN19	Female academics are too scarce. So we’re banning job applications from men	Engineering has a huge impact on society To responsibly advance science and technology a university should be a balanced reflection of society As a top engineering university we believe that diversity and inclusiveness is crucial for the quality of our teaching and research More than that we believe we can turn a fully representative academic workforce into a unique strength This is why from July all our job vacancies will be exclusively open to female candidates for the first six months after they are advertised  This is certainly a radical step as the international headlines about our move attest But we felt it was a necessary step as the more subtle measures we tried over the past years were to no avail The targets we set for female recruitment and the missionary work of our chief diversity officers were certainly useful in making our staff and community aware of inequalities and their own biases As a result at least two women are now on every selection panel And yet the gender imbalance persists with only of our full professors being female one of the lowest percentages in the Netherlands and indeed in Europe 
JUN19	I asked the five candidates about climate in the TV debate. None has a clear plan	Last night I asked the five candidates vying to be our next prime minister whether they would commit to taking the radical and drastic action necessary to tackle climate change You may have realised from my reaction to the answers they gave that I was not impressed  As I listened to them fail to answer my question I kept thinking one of these men is going to be our prime minister the leader of this country in just a few weeks And I reflected on what I have been taught about leadership 
JUN19	Alarming and unnecessary: Facebook’s new cryptocurrency must be resisted	Have you heard about Facebook s new cryptocurrency called Libra Its basic pitch boils down to we messed up your privacy and gave your data to all sorts and let foreign actors screw up your elections now let s see what we can do with banking  That s the quick way to view its announcement of Libra which will be operated by Calibra a new Facebook subsidiary David Marcus the brain behind it at Facebook used the company s typically humble phrasing to explain it thus The mission for Libra is a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people 
JUN19	A US war with Iran looms. Don’t for one second think that it is justified	We know how the story goes The decision for war is made long in advance That becomes the end point and the evidence must be marshalled to achieve that goal A long lasting regime suddenly becomes an imminent threat Exiles with minimal connections to their country of origin but with fat bank balances extensive links with rightwing thinktanks multinational companies and western security services are wheeled out to solemnly declare that war must be waged on their homeland A litany of never ending human rights abuses is endlessly detailed the sort ignored by our elites if they are committed by our allies like the Saudi dictatorship which has plunged Yemen into the world s worst humanitarian crisis Critics of war are demonised as stooges or useful idiots of an enemy that imperils national security and menaces its own people and as haters of their own country  While our Tory overlords committing to another military escapade is predictable Trump s coalition will extend further
JUN19	I had special needs help in school. But the doors that were opened for me are closing	Anyone watch the Tory leadership debate on Tuesday night Miserable spectacle though it might have been something of wider interest did slip through the cracks Amid the verbal jostling to determine who the biggest bounciest Brexit boy in the room was the five leadership candidates were forced to account for cuts to services for vulnerable children including special educational needs and disability Send provision  This is not a new issue Last month parents teachers and pupils held protests across the country decrying what they termed a national crisis in provision for pupils And as someone who personally benefited from Send provision as a child it is a matter of great concern to me 
JUN19	Trying to unite the country over Brexit won’t win Labour a general election	Ahead of today s meeting of Labour s shadow cabinet here is a thought experiment In the latest YouGov poll the party has lost half its vote at the last general election Suppose three quarters of those lost voters had switched to the Brexit parties or the Conservatives while one quarter had switched to strongly remain parties the Liberal Democrats Greens or SNP Pro leave MPs in Labour s heartlands would say told you The case for Labour pivoting to a strongly pro leave stance would be overwhelming  The laudable aim of healing divisions cannot succeed while the issue of Brexit remains unresolved
JUN20	The contest between Johnson and Hunt is about who can win a looming general election	As European leaders gathered in Brussels today they faced a crowded agenda Not least they must decide who gets which plumb European job Believe it or not Brexit will barely feature in their discussions at this summit   But whether they care to admit it or not they will all have been glancing furtively at their phones at about pm local time digesting the news that it will be Jeremy Hunt who will go head to head with Boris Johnson in the battle to get the top British job And doubtless doing so with a justified sense of trepidation Neither of the two candidates left is promising anything remotely acceptable to the EU And what is more whoever wins will confront the same parliamentary dilemmas that ultimately defeated their predecessor 
JUN20	Carmageddon: it’s killing urban life. We must reclaim our cities before it’s too late	What is the best way of wrecking a city Pour cars into it Heavy traffic years of research shows breaks up communities disrupts social life and crushes local cultures Noise drowns out conversation and drives people indoors Pollution makes streets inhospitable Cars take up the space that might have been used for children to play adults to meet and local projects to grow  The fashion for SUVs is one of the two main reasons for rising road deaths among pedestrians
JUN20	Boris Johnson could be prime minister in a month. Is Labour ready to take him on?	The nation watches this strange array of men deranged enough to aspire to run a country in an insoluble crisis of their own making As a despairing and departing chancellor spells out today at Mansion House they all lie through their teeth there will be no new EU deal they will be stopped from leaving with no deal they will not keep their wild tax cutting promises and they know it  Yesterday they ejected the only one who tiptoed closer to these truths but Rory Stewart also swore blind he would Brexit come what may 
JUN20	Labour should support leaving the EU – then it can be truly radical in government	The resignation of Theresa May the rise of Nigel Farage s Brexit party and the Tory leadership election have cast a sharp light on the choices confronting the Labour party It appears that notwithstanding frequent assertions to the contrary the balance between leavers and remainers has not shifted much since the referendum As soon as political leadership became available leave s mass support across England and Wales was reaffirmed including in the working class heartlands of Labour  Farage spoke to popular frustration with the parliamentary shenanigans over May s deal and the associated failure of democracy since It is deeply unfortunate that a rightwing populist has again been able to make inroads into the natural constituency of the left His success makes it vital for the Labour party to offer fresh leadership while maintaining its working class roots For that Labour must not side with remain 
JUN20	Heathrow’s third runway plan beggars belief. So don’t expect Boris Johnson to block it	I will lie down in front of those bulldozers and stop the construction of that third runway Heathrow is just undeliverable and the sooner we face that the sooner our salvation  This was then London mayor Boris Johnson s most famous pledge made in Expanding an airport on the outskirts of a major city he told delighted listeners was the kind of thing that could have happened in China in the s It would be impossible in London he said because of the legal challenges environmental costs and the offence to human rights It is just not going to happen As recently as last June Johnson went awol as foreign secretary to avoid voting for Heathrow 
JUN20	Teach British tourists the truth about empire – they can take it	Over the past few weeks I have realised that I am the worst kind of British tourist My crime is way worse than binge drinking in Benidorm or mortifying locals in Rhodes with sex acts performed in front of their Orthodox chapels I m the party pooper who while on holiday in destinations popular with Britons has the audacity to ask what actually happened here  For example I had the good fortune to find myself in Jamaica last month after a filming stint in Kingston when I realised that my hotel was actually named after a former slave plantation on whose grounds it still stands That history is completely invisible to the predominantly British tourists who stay there unless they go out of their way to visit Rose Hall a museum on the other side of the vast estate where the owners Great House still stands 
JUN20	Europe must stop this disgrace: Viktor Orbán is dismantling democracy	When European Union leaders gather in Brussels on Thursday they will have a guilty secret among them will sit the leader of a member state that is no longer a democracy Viktor Orb n Hungary s prime minister and de facto supreme leader will sit there smiling as a democrat among democrats but in reality he has demolished liberal democracy in his country over the last decade Adding insult to injury he has used EU taxpayers money to consolidate his illiberal regime With a new European parliament and fresh institutional leadership in prospect the EU must show that it will defend democracy in its own member states Otherwise all the fine words of article of its basic treaty will be worth nothing  To say that Hungary is no longer a democracy is a stark claim and I have thought read and looked hard before making it Often people apply the term that Orb n has himself used approvingly illiberal democracy But illiberal democracy is a contradiction in terms That label may usefully describe a transitional phase in the erosion of a liberal democracy such as we see in Poland but Hungary is way beyond that This year the human rights organisation Freedom House downgraded it to the status of partly free country the only EU member state to earn that dishonour The most neutral description I can find is that this is a hybrid regime neither democracy nor dictatorship 
JUN20	Selling arms to the Saudis was always immoral. Now it is unlawful, too	For four years the people of Yemen have endured a Saudi Arabian led bombing campaign Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the bombardment with many more injured or displaced The assault has created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world with more than children dying of preventable causes A recent UN report warned that if things continue as they are then by the end of this year people will have died as a result of the war  Yemen has been troubled by civil wars for decades but the current conflict intensified in March when a Saudi led coalition intervened on behalf of the internationally recognised government against Houthi rebels aligned with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh 
JUN20	The west thinks Putin is Russia's spymaster. But are the spies controlling him?	Vladimir Putin will be hoping that the release of the Russian investigative journalist Ivan Golunov in response to an unprecedented campaign of public protest demonstrates his credentials as a a good tsar willing and able to shield his subjects from the excesses of the Russian security and police services Golunov was arrested in a clumsy frame up after his expos s of corruption among the Moscow elite made him too many enemies  But most Russians understand all too well that such cases are a symptom of the degree to which Putin lets the intelligence services plunder and persecute at will Once seen as his greatest allies the shadowy siloviki a distinctively Russian term for the men of force of the military intelligence and security services increasingly seem like Putin s biggest problem The annual St Petersburg International Economic Forum held earlier this month and meant to showcase investment opportunities in Russia was haunted by the spectre of the American businessman Michael Calvey whose arrest earlier this year caused shockwaves in the international investment community Calvey one of a dwindling band of foreigners who remain committed to the Russian market denies any wrongdoing and has been released but is believed to have been charged after a complaint from a business rival to the Federal Security Service FSB the successor organisation of the KGB 
JUN20	Four reasons why Trump is cruising toward re-election	On Tuesday night Donald Trump launched his re election campaign with a by now classic rally in Orlando Florida It was a greatest hits rally in which he accused the Democrats of undermining democracy by trying to impeach him talked about the many threats to this country as we know it and even railed against Hillary Clinton for old time s sake In short Trump s message for is I made America great again now vote for me so I can Keep America Great  Democrats will dismiss the speech as lacking ideas and just fearmongering while reveling in recent polls that have virtually every major primary candidate defeat Trump in sometimes by a significant margin They believe the president is weakened by a broad range of issues including the Mueller report the treatment of immigrants at the southern border and the various scandals surrounding key cabinet members 
JUN21	Mark Field’s rage acts as a litmus test for our divided times	They came wearing red evening dresses and sashes like something from a bygone age of suffragette protests Or perhaps that should be suffragists the more peaceful wing of the movement For the climate crisis campaigners who set out to disrupt the chancellor s annual Mansion House speech to the City had done all they could to look unthreatening knowing that politicians are understandably jumpy about personal security nowadays The protest was female led Greenpeace explained in the hope of keeping it calm  Some hope The police are investigating precisely what happened when protester Janet Barker walked behind the Conservative MP Mark Field apparently heading towards the top table holding the great and good But film of Field leaping up and grappling with her before frog marching her out with a hand around her neck has gone viral for good reason Whatever the police investigation concludes it is hard to think of a more toxic image of Conservatism than an angry looking man in black tie manhandling a woman away from a fancy banquet Brute male force versus plucky female resistance cosy privileged club versus outsider somewhere she wasn t invited No wonder we can t stop watching and re watching it 
JUN21	To defeat Boris Johnson, learn the lessons of Donald Trump	All we need now is for Boris Johnson to praise Mark Field the government minister cum self appointed close protection officer who thought the best way to deal with a peaceful distributor of leaflets was to ram her into a pillar and grab her by the neck If Johnson lauds Field as my kind of guy then the already long list of similarities between Britain s near certain next prime minister and Donald Trump will get longer still Compiling that list might once have been an amusing parlour game for politics nerds now it is essential preparation for what is to come  For Trump you will recall did not share the public shock at one of his party s lawmakers using physical violence against a citizen exercising a basic democratic right In the US case the offender was Republican congressman Greg Gianforte who bodyslammed a reporter a Guardian reporter as it happens whose desire to ask a question irritated him Trump offered no condemnation Instead the president said Any guy that can do a bodyslam he s my kind of guy 
JUN21	The self-abasement of Johnson’s shameless gofers will not be forgotten	Who is the worst minor character in the Borisverse We have to ask what with the big man himself only allowed out on an electronic tag for around six minutes talking time on the BBC Tory leadership debate Collectors of vignettes displaying Johnson s contempt for the public will have enjoyed the spectacle of a takeaway being delivered to his house while the other candidates debated on Channel Encouraging to see him building on his friend David Cameron s legacy trotters up even before you ve screwed the country instead of only after  The only other sightings of Johnson saw him accompanied by various childminders to vote for himself in a series of progressively apocalypse beckoning votes in Westminster this week Eventually of course Johnson himself will come for us all He s really the Tories Papa Lazarou with his grotesque circus his free form gibberish his expanding collection of wedding rings And the rest AND THE REST 
JUN21	With its links to BP, I can’t stay in the Royal Shakespeare Company	As a teenager disenchanted with religion I turned to Shakespeare for ethical guidance I was inspired by the work of the Royal Shakespeare Company It represented the ultimate company of conscious artists speaking and playing Shakespeare with humour and insight  In my s I was fortunate to join the company play Hamlet and Romeo and become an associate artist I have been delighted ever since to be connected with thousands of artists and audiences who have made the RSC what it is And yet today I feel I must dissociate myself from the RSC not because it is any less of a theatre company but because of the company it keeps 
JUN21	Johnson’s campaign will probably succeed – but he’ll alienate people he needs	When the names of the final two Tory leadership candidates were announced there were celebrations among Boris Johnson s backers Joining the Tory leadership frontrunner in the final was not his old foe Michael Gove but Jeremy Hunt The foreign secretary beat Gove to second place by a mere two votes Hunt was the candidate the Johnson campaign wanted to join him in the final The view is that he poses the least threat as he voted remain and isn t as skilled a debater as Gove  However not everyone was so impressed with the result Tory MPs quickly began to cry foul play and suggest dirty tricks The reason The numbers don t add up After Sajid Javid was knocked out in the first secret ballot of the day at least four of his backers said they would now vote for Boris Johnson Yet despite this Johnson only managed to muster three more votes in total in the final ballot that afternoon The suggestion is that Johnson supporters lent their votes to Hunt in order to secure a weaker opponent 
JUN21	Love Island is a lesson in how language, like, evolves	Love Island is not for everyone You might not appreciate the dating show s rowdiness its relentlessness nearly episodes this season its raunch But even if you re able to tolerate all that you might draw a line at the language I m not talking about swearing because there s something even worse apparently Love Islanders liberality with their discourse particles  This is not an innuendo You can t catch discourse particles No they are little words we use to signpost and structure our speech Sometimes they are just used to maintain fluency or to generate rapport In short they oil the wheels of communication One of the big players is like According to the Sunday Times this week it was used times in under five minutes during one episode of the ITV reality show The paper provided an example from Islander Amy Molly was like oh he s my type and I m like no sorry you ve already got two It s like three out of seven boys Not all of these likes are discourse particles but more of that later 
JUN21	Politicians must find solutions for the climate crisis. Not outsource it to us	 Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard said the American journalist HL Mencken who died years before the EU referendum but nonetheless seems to have known how things might play out  The British people have spoken and said what exactly Last week s BritainThinks survey of today s attitudes found rampant pessimism anxiety and gloom I cannot recall a time when the national mood was more despairing said the research firm s boss Deborah Mattinson Now we learn that the government is going to give this participatory democracy idea another go launching a citizens assembly on the climate emergency later in the year 
JUN21	Like it or not, ‘Generation Snowflake’ has got a raw deal	The idea of generational conflict has come to prominence in the last few years but few seem to agree on its shape and causes Public discussion of young people for instance is so contradictory that they can appear to the casual viewer like a kind of Schr dinger generation simultaneously both Generation Snowflake the most over entitled and coddled generation in history and Generation Screwed the most disadvantaged age cohort in modern times Advocates for the latter can point to trends such as the collapse in home ownership among the under s Proponents of the former argue that young people can t afford a house because they are irresponsible and frivolous spending their money on avocado toast rather than saving for a deposit  The current generational divergence is a consequence of the power the financial sector has held for the past years
JUN21	On trans issues, Iceland has just put Britain to shame	Scotland joined England and Wales on Thursday in delaying a decision about proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act against a backdrop of a bitter culture war Meanwhile Iceland has just passed one of the most progressive laws on trans and intersex rights without any public conflict The law has the potential to make Iceland the world leader on LGBTI rights with the condition that interventions on intersex infants will eventually be banned  As an Icelander I m honoured to have been one of the people drafting the bill and to finally see a big part of it become a reality four years after we started the process The work was led by grassroots LGBTI activists in Iceland and has been both the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life 
JUN21	Summer with the kids … long and costly for parents, but also a joy	The state schools in New York break up for summer next week giving kids almost weeks of holiday The private schools have already been out for a week Like daylight saving this appears to be a historical anomaly pegged to the days when everyone worked on a farm and children were required to work in the fields for two months In Manhattan most kids will go straight into summer camp the cheapest of which not counting subsidised social programmes that are heavily oversubscribed are about per child per week and lets them out at a very uncordial pm The annual grouse about the cost of the city reaches fever pitch at this time of year  Research shows somewhat surprisingly that during the long break parents actually spend more time with their kids
JUN22	Boris Johnson's character should be an issue for the whole nation	 What a non story Couple have row So tweeted security minister Ben Wallace Boris Johnson s campaign manager But it appears he thought better of it and deleted that tweet when even every ardent Johnson backing paper splashed the story of the midnight row between Johnson and his girlfriend The Mail blazons Carrie Symonds cries in red Get off me get out of my flat  Should the police have been called Go out with them of an evening as I did the other day and they assiduously attend all reports of rows when neighbours hear shouts screams crashing crockery and and other indications that a situation may seem to have turned toxic 
JUN22	Sapped by Brexit, it’s little wonder we dream of doing a Nick Clegg	You may not know it but you are about to become Nick Clegg I don t want to become Nick Clegg I hear you protest The idea is not only repellent but ridiculous Facebook won t offer me m plus a year and a Silicon Valley mansion if I sell out I agree that it won t But opting out is far more common than selling out and Clegg is the market leader in both  I called him in October to check a point in a piece I was writing I should have paid more attention to the note of alarm when he realised that a journalist was on the phone He told me he was in Sheffield Ah I said you are preparing to fight Sheffield Hallam again He lost the seat to a mentally troubled Labour candidate who poured out levels of abuse against women gay people and his own constituents that were too much even for Jeremy Corbyn s Labour party Clegg could have retaken the constituency with ease and gone back to Westminster to champion the Remain cause He almost laughed at my quaint suggestion No he wasn t thinking of returning to politics Two days later I learned why when news broke of his new career Technology specialists can describe the awfulness of a Liberal Democrat accepting the position of vice president at a rapacious wannabe monopoly that has facilitated the corruption of liberal democracy by Putin and the super rich and allowed the mass murder of Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims to be incited on its site

JUN22	Richard Ratcliffe’s wife was wrongly jailed and no one will help. What else can he do?	What a frightful pest Richard Ratcliffe is being so thoughtless cluttering up the lovely posh pavement outside the Iranian embassy in Knightsbridge with his protest against his wife Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe s wrongful imprisonment in Iran where she is serving a five year sentence for espionage Another view might be what else is Ratcliffe supposed to do when the right to protest is all he has left  Ratcliffe has joined his wife on a hunger strike demanding among other things her immediate release He s just spent the week stationed outside the embassy and plans to stay until at least this weekend perhaps longer Ratcliffe has been visited by family members and supporters including SNP MPs and Labour s deputy leader Tom Watson One important person Ratcliffe didn t manage to see even on Father s Day was his young daughter Gabrielle who lives in Tehran with her grandparents in order to be able to visit her mum in prison Lovely

JUN22	Don’t stereotype young remainers. We fear for our futures, not our holidays	The current political crisis over Brexit has been a wake up call for my generation the doctrine that our parents and grandparents will leave behind a better world no longer holds But of course not every young person feels this way A significant minority especially those in towns outside London and the south east do not necessarily share the enthusiasm of the of young people who would back remain in a people s vote on Brexit And those that do will often have different reasons for their convictions too We don t want to leave them behind  This summer the campaign I m part of Our Future Our Choice will join a tour of the whole country calling on politicians to let us be heard We will be gathering in Wolverhampton Sunderland Leeds Glasgow Derby Belfast and many more towns and cities over the summer leading up to one more huge rally in London on October 
JUN22	The Mark Field video is chillingly familiar to anyone who recognises male violence	The gut knows The gut processes what the eye sees A woman slammed up against a wall A man eyes bulging with rage his hands on her He pushes her out of the posh dinner his hands gripping her neck She is shocked The gut twists at the familiarity Male violence so everyday that many will have experienced it many will have felt sick watching it and somehow still ashamed to admit that this had happened to them too Elsewhere long ago somewhere more private No one saw  The woman looked stunned What could have been hidden in her red dress Submachine guns harpoons ground to air missiles 
JUN22	Raise the Windrush anchor – and make it a statue to modern Britain	Almost a decade ago I started the campaign for a national Windrush Day alongside a range of individuals and race equality organisations It was conceived as a day to recognise and celebrate the achievements of the postwar migrants who first arrived aboard the Empire Windrush a generation that made a significant contribution to the society we take for granted today After years of lobbying petitions events letter writing debates in parliament and last year s Windrush scandal which put the government on the wrong side of history Theresa May agreed to this annual commemoration  We should commit to realising this dream in four years given that June will be Windrush s th anniversary

JUN23	Boris Johnson’s pitch is all about his character. That’s why the row in his flat matters	Let s begin with the straightforward part any incident in which a woman is heard screaming in her home and shouting Get off me at a man instantly becomes a matter not only of public interest but public responsibility  The precise motives of the neighbours who called the police on Thursday night to report the row between Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds and also alerted the Guardian should be a matter of near total indifference So what if they were remoaners or Tory haters or vacationing ministers in the Venezuelan government Would it really have been better if they had let it be Allowed whatever was happening to run its course on the old deplorable basis that it is intrinsically wrong to intervene in a lovers tiff 
JUN23	I was the victim of race hate crime – but by speaking up I felt empowered	One afternoon last month I boarded a train in Liverpool en route to Newcastle to take part in some writing events I was sitting in a pre booked seat Nearby a man was blaring out loud music A train conductor walked by and told the man to switch his music off but shortly afterwards he turned his music up again I then asked if he could turn the volume down as it was giving me a migraine  The man responded with a torrent of racist abuse Do you have a British passport Get back on the banana boat Paki cunt Fuck off He continued to racially abuse me throughout the journey berating strange people who come over here on banana boats There was a whole carriage of witnesses 
JUN23	Free speech isn’t under threat. It just suits bigots and boors to suggest so	You can t say anything these days Free speech is a thing of the past Young people today can t cope with reality and if you try to tell them about it you ll get arrested You may think we live in a free society but if you cross the PC brigade they ll haul you in for questioning and then they ll disappear you  This sort of argument is everywhere It often seems like the first line of defence when a notable figure has overstepped the mark And just this month the academic Jordan Peterson launched a website Thinkspot to protect users from all the censorship that is around right now 
JUN23	The left is fighting back, even in Republican states, as it attempts to reshape capitalism	Behold the new political yobs The British and American right once keen to engage intellectually with the left and firmly anchored in business and the middle class have now become yobs in their evidence free argument free attitude to trade and foreigners They are guided by noxious prejudice and the simple rule that their flag and interest must rule whatever  Yobs too in their attitudes to all the decent impulses in society tolerance the rule of law that s for suckers a welcome to immigrants fair play respect for truth personal integrity The triumph of the new nativism is the triumph of the yob Our societies let alone our politics have never been so threatened 
JUN23	A growing lack of trust in authority poses a serious danger to our health	Virtually every Bangladeshi and Rwandan believes that vaccines are safe Fewer than half of Japanese or French do so In western Europe almost one in six of those with college education reject vaccines In southern Africa you re twice as likely to do so if you attended university  These are among the often disturbing facts that tumble out of a new study the Wellcome Global Monitor published last week A survey of people from countries it is at heart an exploration of the relationship between science trust and attitudes to vaccination

That doesn’t mean he is right	Gentle Mark Rylance that mercurial British actor has done his bit to haul the ecological record of BP back into the limelight He stepped away from his formal association with the Royal Shakespeare Company this weekend because of its continued receipt of sponsorship from the global oil business   I do not wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer tobacco salesman or anyone who wilfully destroys lives of others alive and unborn Nor I believe would Shakespeare he said

JUN24	I was Boris Johnson’s boss: he is utterly unfit to be prime minister	Six years ago the Cambridge historian Christopher Clark published a study of the outbreak of the first world war titled The Sleepwalkers Though Clark is a fine scholar I was unconvinced by his title which suggested that the great powers stumbled mindlessly to disaster On the contrary the maddest aspect of was that each belligerent government convinced itself that it was acting rationally  It would be fanciful to liken the ascent of Boris Johnson to the outbreak of global war but similar forces are in play There is room for debate about whether he is a scoundrel or mere rogue but not much about his moral bankruptcy rooted in a contempt for truth Nonetheless even before the Conservative national membership cheers him in as our prime minister denied the option of Nigel Farage whom some polls suggest they would prefer Tory MPs have thronged to do just that 
JUN24	The real scandal behind Britain’s falling life expectancy	Given the frenzied speculation about who will be the next leader of the Conservative party and thus prime minister it was understandable that other news would get far less attention Last week it was reported that the infant mortality rate IMR in England and Wales had worsened for the third year in a row  The report from the Office for National Statistics ONS covering said that the infant mortality rate increased to deaths per live births compared with in In it was deaths per The situation had been improving steadily until when it went into reverse This should not be happening especially in one of the largest economies in the world Alarmingly when declines such as this have occurred elsewhere for example in the Soviet Union in the s it has been an early marker of severe problems in society But while these figures are sufficiently concerning in their own right they are national averages and the situation is even worse in some places In the most deprived areas of England babies were more than twice as likely to die within the first year of life deaths per live births than those in the least deprived areas deaths per live births Equally concerning the UK now lags well behind many other European countries with nations achieving better rates out of the with available data for 
JUN24	Medicalising everyday life doesn’t help anyone’s mental health	I have a growing sense of unease about the Americanisation of British society s attitude towards mental health In the s British audiences smiled bemusedly at neurosis laden Woody Allen films and the normality with which American television and cinema treated notions of therapy meds and interventions To a British ear the protagonists of these human melodramas could seem self absorbed foolish and narcissistic figures of fun to be pitied for their inability to maintain a stiff upper lip and their ignorance of the power of a strong cup of tea Yet now these are all concepts that have been normalised in Britain too  Mental health is talked about using the language of epidemics and has been commoditised into something to be ordered over the counter professionals pills and a side of talking therapy The scale of the problem has been supersized exaggerated by extending the reach of healthcare well beyond those with serious diagnosable psychiatric illness to include the worried well Things that are better seen as a part of normal human life the ramifications of choices we have made our personal shortcomings losses bereavements disappointments unfairnesses human frailties are pathologised and these experiences then conceptualised as illnesses to which there are no satisfactory treatments

Three days ago I shared a public statement explaining my withdrawal from the Bradford literature festival By the morning of June others scheduled to speak had also withdrawn Lola Olufemi Waithera Sebatindira Malia Bouattia Sahar Al Faifi Dilly Hussain Hussein Kesvani Charlie Brinkhurst Cuff Paula Akpan Lauren Booth and Madiha Raza We did not do so because we oppose the festival itself I have previously performed poetry there and believe the BLF has done invaluable work for the local community through years of grassroots engagement centred on BME people However I chose not to participate this year when I found out the festival was a beneficiary of a fund called Building a Stronger Britain Together BSBT This fund comes from the government s Counter Extremism Strategy CES and it is this strategy this fund and this connection that I and others oppose  Bradford s predominantly Pakistani Muslim population has long been looked at through a lens of criminality

It won’t stand the test of time	Philosophers and physicists have long debated the reality of time But it has taken the people of the Norwegian island of Sommar y population to reach a final verdict They have sided with Douglas Adams who declared Time is an illusion Lunchtime doubly so They want to declare their island a time free zone  By coincidence the story broke when I was in Skjolden Norway where the solstice sun set at pm and it never got fully dark I m now en route to Kiruna within the Arctic Circle where like Sommar y the midnight sun can be seen from May to July 
JUN24	What has the ‘northern powerhouse’ actually done for the people of the north?	A hundred yards from Newcastle station restored but not particularly well signposted stands the shed where George Stephenson built the world s first commercial train engine Locomotion No in From the trains that revolutionised transport to the steel that mechanised production to the coal that fed the fires the north literally powered the first industrial revolution and the wealth it generated Two centuries on and the northern powerhouse has just turned five Not the north as a powerhouse but George Osborne s ambition for the north  In its birthday assessment IPPR North concludes that the northern powerhouse has been held back by austerity As a northern MP and shadow minister for industrial strategy my assessment would be more critical austerity was the pre eminent political ideology of the Cameron Osborne Clegg government regional renaissance was not and the northern powerhouse proves that 
JUN24	If Facebook or Google create their own currency, they can control our lives	Dystopian fiction from Anthony Burgess s A Clockwork Orange to Russell T Davies s spectacular recent BBC series Years and Years is usually intended to take elements of the present and then imagine a future in which they have become inescapable so as to warn us of what might already be in our midst  But the st century is challenging this technique in one bracing sense the way the world now seems to race beyond the wildest aspects of our collective imagination before we have even started to think about what might come next Consider last week s news about Facebook and the fact that three years of corporate disgrace and rising noise from legislators about bringing the tech giant to heel have yet to slow its terrifying quest to insinuate its workings into every area of our lives Now in a move that could have been taken from a futuristic novel it wants to create nothing less than a new global currency 
JUN24	What would you do if you found a wallet? Really? Then prove it	Statistically people are quite kind The University of Michigan just spent proving this by planting lost wallets in public places in countries around the world and asking strangers to help return them to their owner If the wallet contained a small amount of money of people returned it with the figure rising to if the wallet contained a substantial amount of money  Which is all well and good but how honest are you Obviously I don t trust you with actual money I ve read some of your comments so here s an entirely hypothetical Choose Your Own Adventure stye simulation instead 
JUN24	Ban male comedy writers? Of course not – but do more to give women a chance	Last Monday I spoke for five minutes on a panel in Bradford alongside the head of ITV comedy about diversity in television As a working comedy writer I was well positioned to make the point that comedy is better when it s written by a wide range of voices people of different genders races sexualities everything Mad controversial right Burn the witch I assumed my comments would like most comments ever made on panel discussions be lost in the annals of time Even if I wasn t like most people on panels speaking out of my annals  Quite the shock then when I woke up the next morning to find that my name photo quotes and tweets had been used without my knowledge on multiple news platforms Most under versions of the inaccurate headline ITV bans all male comedy teams I opened story after story to see an old photo of myself looking like a demented elf who just tried ketamine for the first time staring up at the world as the new poster child for keeping men out of comedy GO AWAY MEN TAKE YOUR PENISES TUCK THEM BETWEEN YOUR LEGS AND NEVER BE FUNNY AGAIN The stories mentioned I had recently been hired to write on ITV s CelebAbility a show that had no female writers on its previous two series 
JUN25	Poor Jeremy Hunt. The perfect Tory for a party that no longer exists	Boris Johnson had many motives to dodge a televised debate with Jeremy Hunt on Tuesday night but one factor trumped the rest he didn t do it because he didn t have to If Conservative party rules and our bizarre constitution can combine to let a man like Johnson sidle up to Downing Street answering as few questions as possible it makes sense for him to try  It is also natural that others should try to flush the frontrunner into the open Hunt accused his rival of cowardice and the jibe clearly stung as the truth often does Johnson took to the airwaves blustering ineffective rebuttals to the charge that he had anything to hide 
JUN25	Trump's toadyism to Saudi Arabia: a new moral low	It s that time of a presidency when every incumbent pretends to be what he isn t or to do what he hasn t With a re election year kicking off everyone wants to know if the candidate can fill in the gaping holes in his record to give voters some reason to hope or believe  In the case of Donald Trump that means trying to look like something he hasn t been for the last two and a half years presidential sane and worthy of the world s respect Just for once 
JUN25	Have sperm will travel. But what would an all-female planet look like?	If you re a woman who has despaired over the past week as you ve observed the questionable conduct of jowly white men in positions of power and subsequently seen it defended by both men and women take heart The good news is that when our species eventually abandons this burned out used up planet for a brave new world elsewhere in the universe we can leave the men behind too According to new research by scientists in Barcelona frozen sperm can survive zero gravity conditions without deterioration meaning that it will be far more economical to transport only women and sperm banks to populate our new intergalactic home just as soon as we find a viable alternative planet  The idea of lost or distant worlds inhabited solely by communities of women who can procreate without men has been a staple of sci fi and utopian fiction by women writers since the th century Mary E Bradley Lane s Mizora a serial novel first published in the Cincinnati Commercial in sees Vera a young political exile in Siberia stumble on an all female land which eschews conventional beauty standards narrow waists are considered disgusting On the minus side it wholeheartedly embraces eugenics eliminating any non Aryans along with the men so not perhaps the utopian model for our times 
JUN25	I always suspected BAME NHS workers were treated differently. Now I know it’s true	Although I ve heard the dark whispers the off record conversations throughout my years as a doctor I ve never wanted to believe it But now something I was warned about in my first year is out there in the open and we have to deal with it  Doctors in the NHS are treated differently depending on their ethnicity 
JUN25	Britain is still ruled by a privately educated elite. Let’s end this culture of deference	A new report by the Sutton Trust and the Social Mobility Commission has found that a tiny cohort of privately educated people many of whom went to Oxbridge continue to hold the top jobs in the country The people holding those top jobs in politics the media the judiciary and business are five times more likely to have been to private school than the general population  It is not surprising though it is depressing I have often lamented the deference that so many of us still seem to feel towards those who embody this well established pipeline from prep to parliament who walk the walk and talk the talk of the old aristocratic elite Boris Johnson s continued rise despite little evidence of talent or integrity being the most pertinent recent example There seems to be more than a little bit of Downton ish forelock tugging they were good to us up at the big house feeling of residual inferiority about it Why the continued respect where there should be scorn and suspicion for those who buy themselves advantages in life and then coast through seemingly answerable to no one 
JUN25	An avocado cafe is my worst nightmare. But this is Instagram’s world now – we just live in it	We need to talk about no go zones Enclaves of extremism are popping up around the world and they are ruining neighbourhoods Mobs of lawless social media influencers congregate in these areas terrorising local people as they strive to capture the perfect picture no matter what it takes Sections of Notting Hill in west London for example have been overrun with militant Instagrammers using the picturesque streets as their own open air photography studios In Paris influencers throng the pastel coloured houses on Rue Cr mieux treating private residences like public props A town in California had to ban tourists after thousands of people thronged poppy fields to capture selfies with the superbloom Nowhere is safe  Not all Instagram worshippers are dangerous of course Some integrate seamlessly into society However there is a perilous faction of well organised radicals intent on nothing less than the wholesale Instagramification of our lives Please see as exhibit one a new app called Depalo which promises to lead influencers to the exact latitude and longitude of the most Instagrammable places in a city The app developed by a lifestyle blogger called Rebecca Aneloski covers US cities but aims to expand globally 
JUN25	The politics of neither: how Northern Ireland is shunning unionism and nationalism	Northern Ireland is arguably as polarised as at any time since the IRA hunger strikes of It has been without a Stormont government since the beginning of due to divisions over matters such as the Irish language Brexit and the legacy of the year Troubles  Yet at the same time the cross community Alliance party recently had its biggest ever share of the vote at in the European elections And last week research suggested that more people than ever in the province say they are neither unionist nor nationalist The Northern Ireland Life and Times survey finds that half the population does not identify with the two main tribal groups who want to see sovereignty lie with either London or Dublin 
JUN25	Britain is now a remain nation. We can halt this rush to Brexit	The frontrunner s domestic squall on Thursday night has acted as a lightning flash illumination of the democratic fraud unfolding before our eyes Had this tiff happened on Love Island at least every citizen would get to vote If a despairing lethargy hung over the prime ministerial contest this fracas has electrified the preposterous nature of the non choice and our total exclusion from it Pinch yourself is this really happening in a democracy This is now a remainer nation held hostage by extreme no dealers  Remember this has never happened before It was bad enough when MPs chose the sitting prime minister John Major Theresa May Gordon Brown but for the first time the Tory party s misbegotten rules see our fate fixed by the votes of a tiny self selecting oligarchy This novel experiment in non democracy couldn t come at a worse time with the ruling party seized by no deal Brexit mania forcing all candidates to abandon truth to woo the membership s worst delusions Only one Sam Gyimah represented anything approaching the British remain majority but he couldn t scrape eight nominations to get into the contest that s the nature of the Tory beast 
JUN25	I was Boris Johnson’s boss: he is utterly unfit to be prime minister	Six years ago the Cambridge historian Christopher Clark published a study of the outbreak of the first world war titled The Sleepwalkers Though Clark is a fine scholar I was unconvinced by his title which suggested that the great powers stumbled mindlessly to disaster On the contrary the maddest aspect of was that each belligerent government convinced itself that it was acting rationally  It would be fanciful to liken the ascent of Boris Johnson to the outbreak of global war but similar forces are in play There is room for debate about whether he is a scoundrel or mere rogue but not much about his moral bankruptcy rooted in a contempt for truth Nonetheless even before the Conservative national membership cheers him in as our prime minister denied the option of Nigel Farage whom some polls suggest they would prefer Tory MPs have thronged to do just that 
JUN25	The US’s Middle East ‘peace summit’ is nonsense. Palestinians are right to boycott it	In the toxic history of the enduring conflict between Israel and the Palestinians the Palestinians have often been accused of never missing an opportunity to miss an opportunity This familiar charge has been repeated in the runup to an extraordinary event taking place in the Gulf state of Bahrain convened by the US and starting on Tuesday  The Manama workshop downgraded from conference to lower already rock bottom expectations is designed to discuss the Peace to Prosperity plan unveiled by the White House on Saturday The document the result of two years work by Jared Kushner Donald Trump s son in law has already been subject to a torrent of undiplomatic abuse Palestinians have made clear that they will not attend Manama apart from the odd businessman prepared to defy a broad national consensus that unusually unites Mahmoud Abbas s Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip 
JUN26	Boris Johnson’s full English Brexit could rip the union apart	It is time to wake up but there is barely a moment to smell the coffee If Boris Johnson becomes prime minister Britain will be sleepwalking towards the break up of the United Kingdom The minority who want this to happen are rubbing their hands at the prospect The separate minority who say they don t care if it happens seem beyond reasoned debate at present But the majority who don t want it to happen aren t being much more attentive either Unless this changes they could be in for a shock more lasting than Brexit  Even when the twists and turns of leaving the EU dominated the daily news in the early part of this year it was difficult to get many English politicians or commentators to focus for long on the destructive consequences for the union Now that Brexit has become the defining doctrinal obsession of a Conservative party leadership election conducted in the shadow of the Brexit party even less attention is being paid to those possible consequences especially in England But the forces that are driving Britain towards its break up are not sleeping 
JUN26	This photo is about bodies – migrant bodies, and our body politic. Don't look away	This is a story about bodies  A body of water A river running through mountain bosque desert and city along two pueblos between two states and separating two countries 
JUN26	The two-child benefits limit is a sign of society’s growing inhumanity	Last week a Middlesbrough Conservative councillor apologised after describing benefit claimants as pond life who should be washed and sterilised David Smith said There are so many genuine cases But there is a large portion who are claimants that take the absolute piss Yet they continue to breed Rabbits the lot of them I thought of Smith as I read through a new report by the Child Poverty Action Group into the impact of the two child benefit limit the government policy that from April cut at least a week in support from some of the country s poorest families upon the birth of their third child  Poverty is not so much a mistaken result of the two child limit it is the intended consequence
JUN26	Boris Johnson is self-destructing. How much of Britain will he drag down too?	No one expected the final stage of the Conservative party leadership contest to be a staid and dignified affair The Tories are now more spectacle than party more farcical roadshow than government But barely a week in and it feels like events are escalating at the pace of a crammed last episode of a poorly crafted drama the writers just want to wrap it up because they have already been told there will be no second series  Boris Johnson s much anticipated interviews over the past hours have been a series of how did we end up here moments In an interview on LBC yesterday he petulantly refused to answer questions about an allegedly recent photo of him and his partner looking cosy after the domestic incident reported last week Why should I he sulked The rest of the time he descended into word salads and often just sounds a harrumphing cornered animal In another even more alarming interview we saw Johnson talk about his supposed model bus crafting hobby in slow motion his eyes glazing over It wasn t that it had the air of something made up that was worrying it was that he seemed to be drifting away as he was fabulating Like a chirpy robot running out of batteries and slowing down to a drawl Johnson s whole demeanour during the campaign so far is that of someone who has burned himself out just before destiny called He s tired and irritated and can t keep up His shtick the bumbling posh boy swashbuckling act is getting so old even he is bored of it especially when it doesn t quite cut it when scrutiny is at full on potential prime minister levels 
JUN26	An Islamophobic security agenda shouldn't mix with arts funding	The last few days have seen a furore over the Bradford literature festival s decision to accept funding from the Home Office Some speakers have pulled out of the event so far in protest at the source of the money the government s Building a Stronger Britain Together fund a scheme that supports projects that supposedly counter extremism As a result of the row reputational damage has been done to this award winning festival  Let s be clear why this has happened the government refuses to engage with Muslim communities in a meaningful way unless it is under the auspices of counter extremism or counter terrorism Why does funding offered to Muslim communities so often appear under this guise We ve also seen this in the form of the goverment s terrible Prevent counter terror strategy which is a toxic presence and is already under review 
JUN26	After 40 years of climate activism, I feel a surge of hope	I am now years of age but when I was in my final year at university I became aware of major problems then facing the world war poverty acid rain ozone depletion desertification deforestation species loss civil and military uses and abuses of nuclear power pollution population growth consumerism and the climate crisis I was determined to devote my life to helping solve these problems After spending three years in Cameroon learning about deforestation for timber and cash crops such as palm oil and the exploitation of the rich resources of Africa to the detriment of locals and enrichment of corporations and western societies I returned home to the nuclear weapons crisis of the cold war  I joined the Greenham Common protests founded the Snowball civil disobedience campaign and then later the anti nuclear weapons group Trident Ploughshares I also became involved in work on the climate crisis I learned that everything is connected and that it all has an impact on the climate on biodiversity and on the sustainability of life on Earth I discovered more about how our reliance on fossil fuels was causing the greenhouse effect and soon joined with climate scientists and local environmentalists to start a group in Norwich that tried to educate the public 
JUN26	Shell is not a green saviour. It’s a planetary death machine	It is hard to believe it needs stating but it does The oil industry is not your friend Whatever it might say about its ethical credentials while it continues to invest in fossil fuels it accelerates climate breakdown and the death of the habitable planet You would think this point was obvious to everyone But over the past few weeks I have spoken to dozens of environmentalists who appear to believe that Shell is on their side I ve come to the bizarre conclusion that there is more awareness of the oil industry s agenda within the arts than there is among conservation groups  Last week the actor Mark Rylance brilliantly articulated his reasons for resigning from the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship by BP The oil company had been subsidising cheap tickets for young people It might be trashing the world these young people will inherit but they can watch some great shows This is bread and circuses without the bread 
JUN26	Rape crisis services are at breaking point. Do the Tory leadership candidates care?	In March I launched a petition calling on the government to sustainably fund rape support services after I was turned away from multiple rape crisis centres when I really needed help More than people have already signed the petition I have met ministers at No given evidence in parliament and MPs have signed an early day motion on the issue But support services remain inaccessible What is the future prime minister going to do about it  The crisis centres I approached over a period of eight months had been forced to close their waiting lists due to exceptionally high demand and long term underfunding For years rape counselling centres have been put in the impossible position of turning women like me away because they know that those who are already on their waiting lists may have to wait as long as months before seeing a specialist counsellor 
JUN26	I won’t stand for this dogs-on-train-seats nonsense	Ezra Pound had it mostly right when you reflect on the way dogs behave you re left in no doubt man is the superior animal when you go on to reflect on human behaviour you start to wonder He might have added a coda that the real source of bafflement and disgust is to be found in human behaviour around dogs  Take this week Wanging round the internet has been a photograph of the BBC s Emily Maitlis working on her laptop at a table on a GWR train with her pet whippet curled up peaceably on the seat beside her Newsnight s Emily Maitlis slammed for letting dog sleep on seat of packed train was the Daily Mirror s pretty representative headline 
JUN26	Jeremy Corbyn is wrong about social mobility - it’s all about aspiration	I m often asked what social mobility is in simple terms For me it s about one word Aspiration It s about being able to go as far as your effort talent and hard work can take you in life unimpeded by class the school you went to or your background Social mobility is fundamentally about there being a ladder of opportunity that everyone should have a fair chance of climbing It s about having a common stake in our country through having the same chance to build a life here  I was the first Conservative education secretary to have attended a comprehensive school
JUN27	‘Soft’ Brexit is dead. Now Labour must really embrace a people’s vote	How does class politics survive a full blown culture war This is the crux of Labour s current dilemma The basis of its political vision is that the economic interests of the majority are not only different from those of the elite but on a collision course with it This is pithily summed up by the party s slogan For the many not the few Yet the Brexit culture clash smothers any discussion of the real divide in British society let alone how to overcome it  After the referendum Labour had a strategy to deal with this It accepted that while remain lost the leave triumph was narrow and therefore there should be a close relationship with the EU This positioning granted the party permission to pivot back to talking about domestic issues It prevented Theresa May turning the contest into the Brexit election she sought the party instead could fight on issues like taxing the rich and big business to invest in the economy tackling student debt and public ownership for which there was majority support Had she succeeded the Tories would not have been deprived of their majority and Britain would already have left the EU on the terms May desired 
JUN27	Boris Johnson’s talk of ‘global Britain’ is about to look even more ridiculous	Three years after the United Kingdom s Brexit referendum the UK is no closer to figuring out how to leave the European Union and what comes next than it was when the result was announced And now a Conservative party leadership election to replace the outgoing prime minister Theresa May is in full swing To those of us watching from the outside the debate between the candidates confirms that they have learned nothing whatsoever from the past two years of negotiations with the EU  Sadly this comes as no surprise given that the lead candidate is Boris Johnson the leave campaign s most prominent architect and a man who continues to dissemble exaggerate and disinform the public about Brexit In Johnson and his fellow Brexiteers duped a narrow majority of UK voters into thinking that leaving the EU would somehow furnish the NHS with an additional m per week He also drummed up fears that Britain s EU membership would somehow lead to mass immigration from Turkey which happens to be the homeland of his paternal great grandfather Ali Kemal 
JUN27	The wild race to lead the Democrats could break the gender mould of US politics	It was a strange experience watching the US Democratic candidates debate this week and not having one s eye drawn to the traditional solitary female on stage For the first time more than one woman is standing in the race and in Wednesday s debate there were three in the line up in the follow up debate tonight a further three and what s wild is how wild it was A broad spectrum of backgrounds and experience No one woman carrying the symbolic weight of representing all women It even took the burden off analysing what they were wearing  At the centre of the stage was Elizabeth Warren the frontrunner whose popularity has surged over the past few months and a woman who often carries an air of being the only grownup in the room Unlike Bill de Blasio who spent much of the debate shouting from stage left like a man trying to order lunch in a crowded deli Warren was calm measured disinclined to interrupt Amy Klobuchar the senator from Minnesota was spirited and amused Tulsi Gabbard the congresswoman from Hawaii was slick and to my mind unconvincing although plenty of people thought she won the debate To watch these women perform was to be reminded whatever one thought of her policies of how lonely a figure Hillary Clinton had been 
JUN27	An Australian points-based immigration system? It’s just more Boris Johnson bluster	A tough new Australian style points based system for immigration Boris Johnson s radical new proposal splashed across Thursday s front pages No that was Liam Byrne then the Labour immigration minister In I was a civil servant then and I complained to a special adviser colleague more in sorrow than in anger that what we were proposing had little or no resemblance to the Australian system and wasn t even really a points based system Of course I know that perfectly well he said But the focus groups love it  It is in that light that we should read Johnson s essentially vacuous pronouncements spun in the Telegraph as the restoration of control over our borders and in the Financial Times by contrast as bringing down barriers to skilled overseas workers 
JUN27	Britain’s private rented sector isn’t fit for purpose. It’s unfair and unsafe	Another day another housing crisis story confirming what we already knew things are really bad New research from Citizens Advice has found that not only do half of landlords not know about or understand their legal obligations but that their tenants aren t aware of their rights either and even when they are they don t always feel able to enforce them  Two thirds of tenants said that their landlord has not addressed disrepair in their home said they believed that disrepair was a major threat to their health and safety and said that their home did not have a carbon monoxide alarm despite requiring one This Citizens Advice says leaves hundreds of thousands of renters living in mouldy potentially dangerous homes with some missing smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors 
JUN27	Beijing will not rest until it controls Hong Kong. We must keep fighting	Let s put it in plain words the people of Hong Kong haven t defeated the proposed extradition law to China yet we have only earned a small window to catch our breath And so have the hardliners in the administration and the Chinese government  Last Friday thousands of protesters staged a sit in in front of the police headquarters in Hong Kong Most of the protesters were in their early s many were still high school students They chanted slogans demanding the full withdrawal of the unpopular extradition bill the dropping of riot charges against peaceful protesters and justice for the victims of police brutality 
JUN27	Care for the elderly is a scandal – but don’t expect a solution from Hunt or Johnson	Social care services are in freefall with tens of thousands of people getting no help at all What s new This week s withering assessment from local authority directors of adult social services in England brings yet more evidence of the unfolding disaster hidden behind the lace curtains of million neglected old people home alone More than people have died waiting for care services that never came Lip service is paid nothing is done  There is a fiction that an ever disappearing green paper six times cancelled will solve the problem That s a hollow hope expect no more than a few hazy options though even these are too politically frightening to see the light of day Among the Tory leadership candidates Jeremy Hunt made a token nod that cuts went too far but care doesn t feature in his eye watering list of tax cuts and defence spending plans Boris Johnson hasn t mentioned it he probably doesn t know what it is 
JUN27	A mistake on a betting slip cost a punter £200k. How you react to that is telling	If I had to pick my favourite irrational fear behind falling into open manholes snakes coming out of the toilet and the unshakeable belief that my friends newborn baby secretly hates me and is going to beat me up as soon as he learns how fists work it would probably be filling in forms No matter how long I spend poring over them painstakingly writing out everything in a black fountain pen and BLOCK CAPITALS I m positive I ve made a mistake What if when confronted with one of those do you consent to this company contacting you questions I wrongly ticked the box that allows them to message me via swarms of angry bees What if instead of requesting an aisle seat I ve mistakenly given my consent to be fired out of the plane via ejector seat if they ve overbooked the flight It s a fear I ll never get over especially not after this week when I learned of the horrifying story of David Smith a year old punter from Loughborough who managed to lose on an accumulator by filling out a form wrongly Move over Best Friends Thug Baby this scenario has replaced all of my nightmares now  Two weeks ago Smith picked six outside winners on an accumulator that added up to a truly baffling amount of money When he went to collect his winnings however presumably with a wheelbarrow to take it back to a Scrooge McDuck style vault he realised that instead of writing Bialco a winner in the at Perth he had put down the annoyingly similarly named Bailarico third placed in the at Goodwood Personally I d argue this is proof that horse owners need to come up with more original names Philip Seymour Hoofman Pony Cascarino Chevalerie Singleton Horson Welles anyone According to Smith he had alerted the staff at his local Betfred to his mistake after the but before the race and they had assured him that his bet would count When he checked his winnings however the sixth bet was void meaning that he had lost nearly earning him the paltry sum of just a figure that at least could buy him of the world s smallest violins 
JUN27	There's no duty on UK employers to prevent sexual harassment. That has to change	Most of us understand how our physical wellbeing is protected at work health and safety measures much maligned by the right have made sure of that But what if you re sexually assaulted Shockingly employers currently have no legal duty to prevent harassment a glaring oversight that a new campaign by an alliance of organisations including Time s Up the TUC and Amnesty International is hoping to change The alliance has also launched a petition which has reached nearly signatures in less than hours  When I told friends I was working on the development of the campaign their stories came flooding out Working in bars with colleagues who wouldn t stop touching them threats of rape from managers incessant inappropriate comments on their appearance or sex lives everyone I knew had a handful of discomfiting experiences I had my own tales too The job stacking shelves next to a middle aged shift manager who would constantly ask my colleagues whether or not they d have sex with me the ad man who made constant jokes about raping clients 
JUN27	At 68, my climate activism made me a criminal. But I refuse to give up	I am now years of age but when I was in my final year at university I became aware of major problems then facing the world war poverty acid rain ozone depletion desertification deforestation species loss civil and military uses and abuses of nuclear power pollution population growth consumerism and the climate crisis I was determined to devote my life to helping solve these problems After spending three years in Cameroon learning about deforestation for timber and cash crops such as palm oil and the exploitation of the rich resources of Africa to the detriment of locals and enrichment of corporations and western societies I returned home to the nuclear weapons crisis of the cold war  I joined the Greenham Common protests founded the Snowball civil disobedience campaign and then later the anti nuclear weapons group Trident Ploughshares I also became involved in work on the climate crisis I learned that everything is connected and that it all has an impact on the climate on biodiversity and on the sustainability of life on Earth I discovered more about how our reliance on fossil fuels was causing the greenhouse effect and soon joined with climate scientists and local environmentalists to start a group in Norwich that tried to educate the public 
JUN28	Pictures of dead migrants inspire our sympathy. But what use is that to them?	On the morning of January a humanitarian group No More Deaths released a report showing how over four years US border patrol agents had destroyed gallons of water that had been left for migrants in the desert  That afternoon Scott Warren a No More Deaths volunteer was arrested for bringing food water bedding and clean clothes to two men who had entered the country illegally He found them in an area where bodies had been recovered in the previous year alone 
JUN28	Of all the hills to die on, why on earth has Labour chosen Chris Williamson?	Shortly after this article was published Chris Williamson s suspension was reinstated pending a meeting of Labour s disputes committee  Purely in terms of story I am confused by the stakes in the Labour leadership s vision for the nation If you tell me this is a transformative programme to uplift the many then I expect the movie trailer voiceover to growl something like HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO DEFEND HUMANITY Instead the tagline seems to be HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO DEFEND CHRIS WILLIAMSON 
JUN28	Forget Putin’s ‘liberalism’ jibe. This man runs a war machine	Vladimir Putin is on a high Kicked out of the G in after the start of his military operations in Ukraine he s been making full use of the G summit in Osaka to bask in meetings with world grandees and soak up all the international media attention he possibly can complete with a not very challenging interview with the Financial Times  Ever the opportunist he takes what s on offer he glides he smirks And he watches with glee as we huff and puff at his provocations whose over riding purpose is to keep us on edge and play on our divisions 
JUN28	I felt the fear of abduction by China in Hong Kong. Appeasing Bejing has to stop	When I moved to Hong Kong in after my books had been permanently banned by the Chinese government the territory s distinctive character was immediately obvious The pungent salty air smelt of freedom In China s huge city boulevards and vast deserts and mountains my thoughts always felt imprisoned but in Hong Kong s narrow streets and tiny cramped bookshops they were set free and given infinite space to wander No printed word was banned no thought outlawed For years Hong Kong became a refuge where I could speak write and be published in freedom without fear of arbitrary arrest  These basic civil liberties security and free expression are threatened by the passage of the much reviled extradition bill that would allow suspected criminals to be sent to mainland China where there is no chance of a fair trial 
JUN28	Europe learned from its mistakes in Hungary. It's protecting the law in Poland	Perhaps one day the spring of will be remembered as the moment when the European Union halted the destruction of democratic institutions in its member states Just look at how governments in Poland Hungary and Romania have backtracked on anti democratic measures they were seeking to introduce And this week in a landmark ruling the European court of justice declared that the enforced early retirement of Poland s supreme court judges would be unlawful Could this be a tipping point What s clear is that law money and politics have aligned in ways that now make it more difficult for the Viktor Orb n playbook to be repeated across Europe  The EU s record on this has been problematic It failed to define and enforce red lines on democracy in Hungary as far back as The EU and its institutions watched passively for too long as Hungary s ruling party Fidesz took control of the state Poland s government tried to copy this but because it lacked a two thirds majority in parliament it could not rewrite the country s constitution as Orb n has Some of its measures have been cruder and more obviously unlawful especially when it replaced constitutional tribunal judges in rushed moves after the elections But not all is lost The fight to protect the independence of other parts of the judiciary continues 
JUN28	I'm a civil servant – and we can't make Boris Johnson's no-deal fantasy into reality	I m a career civil servant For years I worked quietly and unsnarkily in a government department under a secretary of state whose name would have stumped your average pub quizzer back in the good old days before Brexit catapulted the UK s political meme industry into the big time Let me recap  In February I was deployed into Operation Yellowhammer a sort of temporary bn sweatshop for civil servants tasked with preparing the country for a no deal Brexit scenario Then at the end of March we coquettishly flirted with the no deal iceberg as the prime minister s deal got rejected for a third time which nudged the deadline down the road a bit to April 
JUN28	Pride has sold its soul to rainbow-branded capitalism	LGBT people worldwide are gearing up to celebrate the th anniversary of the June Stonewall riots which led to the formation of the modern LGBT movement More significant than the riots themselves was what they ignited the formation of the Gay Liberation Front in New York  GLF inspired thousands to come out and join protests for LGBT rights It organised the first Pride march which took place in New York in and its revolutionary ideas and activism soon spread worldwide including to the UK 
JUN28	Islamophobia is rife among Tory members. Johnson and Hunt can't just ignore it	Members of the Conservative party believe in deeply Islamophobic myths taint the entire Muslim community with responsibility for terrorism and among other things say they would prefer not to have a Muslim as Britain s prime minister So what was Theresa May s response at this week s prime minister s questions To flippantly turn a question about this stain on her party s moral standing into a political attack on the Labour party  The Conservative party is facing a crisis as the latest YouGov polling for Hope Not Hate revealed but it is turning its face away from the reality of that crisis hoping against hope that the problem will go away Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson have a stark choice do they go against the grain of members who express quite shocking views potentially harming their chances of winning the leadership or do they keep quiet because they re too scared to say anything or even because they agree with these disgraceful viewpoints 
JUN28	Kamala Harris just changed the direction of the presidential race	As the second round of Democratic presidential debates approached one of the major questions on the minds of voters and political commentators was whether the candidates would focus on trying to differentiate themselves from each other as was done the previous night or whether they would focus on critiquing Donald Trump  Senator Kamala Harris chose to do both and she did so effectively in what turned out to be the breakout performance of the evening 
JUN28	Don’t let the UK’s love of Australia stretch to our barbaric treatment of refugees	When I first moved to the UK from Australia I discovered an odd compulsion that British people had upon meeting me After breaking the ice with a comment about how much I must love Fosters I ve never tried it and dropping a reference I didn t understand to s era Neighbours they d get to the real meat on the barbie of our conversation So they d say cheerfully Australia is really racist right  They weren t wrong Australia is really racist But for a usually white British person to be smug about the racism of a nation that Britain colonised while enacting genocide against the indigenous population seemed a little hypocritical Racism like rabbits and tuberculosis was a pest that Britain dropped on the island before disappearing and letting us sort it out for ourselves And unfortunately we can t just release myxomatosis and hope racism dies frothing at the mouth in public parks 
JUN29	Glastonbury isn’t just a fleeting experience – it’s a mirror of society	Glastonbury is another world At least that s what it feels like when you re there it s so vast so utterly overwhelming The size of Colchester is the latest comparison as though that means anything to anyone At night if you stand at the back of the Green Fields you can see the festival stretching down twinkling filling the valley all the way to the lit up cross  Our tent is small and so are you Teeny tiny you is inside enormous Glastonbury part of it at all times whether you re being teased by drag queens in Block watching the sun come up in the Sacred Space traipsing along the surprisingly quiet main drag in the heat or curled up on your coat in the foetal position somewhere between the Left Field and the Glade wondering if you ll ever stop shaking It s a Narnia of escapism of living in the moment a fantasy break away from the everyday A bubble of joy or at least a hiccup of concentrated sensation in a world of never ending routine In Glastonbury tweeted a friend yesterday my life is perfect and unsustainable 
JUN29	The passions blowing Boris Johnson into No 10 could yet bring him down	Asked by his spin doctor in how a Brexit referendum could backfire David Cameron replied in cod Shakespearian English You could unleash demons of which ye know not Well ye know now  Brexit has pushed the right into a demonic orgy It is throwing off the standards it once pretended to abide by parliamentary sovereignty family values monarchism unionism For all its rage don t underestimate how much it is enjoying the release from its taboos The Brexiters bacchanal is giving Conservatives a rolling revolution which is pushing the country into a crisis no one foresaw 
JUN29	Lucy Bronze, the England player who won me over to the World Cup	I was so excited about England s first match of the Women s World Cup that I trotted off to my local Last summer it had been a regular haunt thanks to the men s World Cup which filled the beer garden for almost every match whether England were playing or not On that first Sunday afternoon two televisions were on cricket on one and rugby on the other I asked the landlady if they were showing the World Cup She hadn t known it was on she said but she gave one of the screens to us and we sat there an audience of two cheering bashfully  That already feels like a long time ago What a delight this tournament has been Support has grown as the games have progressed and England made their way to a semi final once again I m a relative newcomer to enjoying sport and certainly football but the women s game feels welcoming to someone like me I never would have dreamed that I d be talking about starting lineups and reading match reports but I ve begun to have tentative conversations about them the words new and cautious as they form I have never known the names of an entire football team until now The cheering has become less bashful already 
JUN29	Corbyn shuns Glastonbury and no one cares. Remainers have moved on	Why didn t Jeremy Corbyn go to Glastonbury this year Couldn t he find his wellies Was it too late to hire a yurt Or is he hiding from Remain supporters Again  When Corbyn attended the festival in preaching to the euphoric masses it turned into a veritable Glastonbury on the Mount Are members of that crowd a little embarrassed now too much whooping weeping and Jez mania and not enough scrutiny When Corbyn had cancelled appearing at Glastonbury the previous year straight after the referendum result the official line was that he was focusing on the issues No one thought to ask why the rent a protest Labour leader usually never happier than when air punching at a mic stand before uncritical throngs was suddenly too shy to appear before a massive festival crowd of hyper emotional Remain voters needing reassurance 
JUN29	Pictures of dead migrants inspire our sympathy. But what use is that to them?	On the morning of January a humanitarian group No More Deaths released a report showing how over four years US border patrol agents had destroyed gallons of water that had been left for migrants in the desert  That afternoon Scott Warren a No More Deaths volunteer was arrested for bringing food water bedding and clean clothes to two men who had entered the country illegally He found them in an area where bodies had been recovered in the previous year alone 
JUN29	Of all the hills to die on, why on earth has Labour chosen Chris Williamson?	Shortly after this article was published Chris Williamson s suspension was reinstated pending a meeting of Labour s disputes committee  Purely in terms of story I am confused by the stakes in the Labour leadership s vision for the nation If you tell me this is a transformative programme to uplift the many then I expect the movie trailer voiceover to growl something like HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO DEFEND HUMANITY Instead the tagline seems to be HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO DEFEND CHRIS WILLIAMSON 
JUN29	Forget Putin’s ‘liberalism’ jibe. This man runs a war machine	Vladimir Putin is on a high Kicked out of the G in after the start of his military operations in Ukraine he s been making full use of the G summit in Osaka to bask in meetings with world grandees and soak up all the international media attention he possibly can complete with a not very challenging interview with the Financial Times  Ever the opportunist he takes what s on offer he glides he smirks And he watches with glee as we huff and puff at his provocations whose over riding purpose is to keep us on edge and play on our divisions 
JUN29	I felt the fear of abduction by China in Hong Kong. Appeasing Bejing has to stop	When I moved to Hong Kong in after my books had been permanently banned by the Chinese government the territory s distinctive character was immediately obvious The pungent salty air smelt of freedom In China s huge city boulevards and vast deserts and mountains my thoughts always felt imprisoned but in Hong Kong s narrow streets and tiny cramped bookshops they were set free and given infinite space to wander No printed word was banned no thought outlawed For years Hong Kong became a refuge where I could speak write and be published in freedom without fear of arbitrary arrest  These basic civil liberties security and free expression are threatened by the passage of the much reviled extradition bill that would allow suspected criminals to be sent to mainland China where there is no chance of a fair trial 
JUN29	Europe learned from its mistakes in Hungary. It's protecting the law in Poland	Perhaps one day the spring of will be remembered as the moment when the European Union halted the destruction of democratic institutions in its member states Just look at how governments in Poland Hungary and Romania have backtracked on anti democratic measures they were seeking to introduce And this week in a landmark ruling the European court of justice declared that the enforced early retirement of Poland s supreme court judges would be unlawful Could this be a tipping point What s clear is that law money and politics have aligned in ways that now make it more difficult for the Viktor Orb n playbook to be repeated across Europe  The EU s record on this has been problematic It failed to define and enforce red lines on democracy in Hungary as far back as The EU and its institutions watched passively for too long as Hungary s ruling party Fidesz took control of the state Poland s government tried to copy this but because it lacked a two thirds majority in parliament it could not rewrite the country s constitution as Orb n has Some of its measures have been cruder and more obviously unlawful especially when it replaced constitutional tribunal judges in rushed moves after the elections But not all is lost The fight to protect the independence of other parts of the judiciary continues 
JUN30	Feel smug about western democracy? The G20 summit should make us reconsider	Next year an Arab country will host the G summit for the first time Which country has earned this honour Such recognition as a player in this powerful global club Its impressive climb in this regard is even more remarkable given that only a few short months ago this Arab state was supposedly on its way to pariah status  That s right Saudi Arabia is hosting the summit managing to not only overcome the reputational damage of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the country s consulate in Turkey less than a year ago but also doing so just weeks after more grisly details of the killing were revealed Saudi officials were reported to have referred to Khashoggi as the sacrificial animal while discussing how he was to be dismembered Saudi s moment of coming in from the relative cold even had an official photo at last week s G summit All the world leaders lined up looked at the camera and waved apart from Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman lost in mutual adoration who only had eyes for each other 
JUN30	Trying to keep up with the Kardashians is returning women to the Victorian era	Kim Kardashian West is perched on a chair She s not quite sitting instead she s pushing her hands into the armrests then leaning against the cushion Her figure is grotesque above her generous hips rests an already small waist tightened beyond belief thanks to a flesh coloured corset She addresses the camera Anna if I don t sit down for dinner now you know why I ll be walking around mingling talking but I can hardly sit she tries to sit she can t I can only half sit  The Anna in question is Vogue s Wintour and the dinner is the Met Gala s which took place in May The video the quote is from was posted on May and has been watched more than m times since then Perhaps she was right not to sit a few weeks later actor Elle Fanning attended a dinner at Cannes where she fainted and fell off her chair Her dress a vintage Prada gown with a corseted waist was too tight 
JUN30	The Guardian was right to use a graphic image – but lessons have been learned	 It is the visual stories that have staying power a picture editor once wrote From time to time an image condenses a public issue into human form so powerfully that it becomes both messenger and symbol The latest is last week s photograph of the bodies of scar Alberto Mart nez Ram rez and his month old daughter Angie Valeria floating face down near the bank of the Rio Grande on the US Mexico border  The child s arm draped across her father s neck emerges from inside his shirt where presumably he had tried to secure her It gives the image a potent poignancy The tenderness the way he never let her go You can see the way he protected her said Rosa Ram rez his mother in El Salvador from where Mart nez his wife Tania Vanessa valos and their daughter had begun their attempt to reach the US 
JUN30	Boris Johnson says hair-gate is ‘beyond satire’. Here goes…	I had this week s column nailed by Tuesday teatime hours ahead of the deadline Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Haircut Inconclusive Cocaine Event Wall Spaffer Fuck Business Get Off My Fucking Laptop Johnson was the gift that kept on giving Piccaninny s fans had complained that as the neighbours who called the police to his screams and swearing filled flat last Thursday self identified as Remainers as do of the population now their complaint was invalid   As anyone who lives in London knows the Tuesday version of me wrote in misguided haste the fearful cries of women are so commonplace that one soon learns to ignore them and I myself am haunted nightly by the bloody and judgmental apparitions of all those I could have rescued But there s no time to dwell on that now What s done is done You get the drift 
JUN30	How can we lure back all the people who avoid news?	What happens if we produce journalism and nobody reads it This is not an existential worry lurking beyond the keyboard of every reporter and editor but a growing problem of never newsers people who deliberately or accidentally avoid the news  According to the recent Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism s annual digital news report about an average of people regularly avoid the news up from in In the UK news avoidance soared between and by percentage points mainly due to the intractable and polarising nature of Brexit 
JUN30	It’s as exciting as a bowl of tofu, but the Lib Dem leadership contest matters a lot	 You my friends are choosing a future prime minister declares one of the hopefuls to applause from the activists who have come to hear the two contenders to be their party s next leader The audience in a lecture theatre at the London School of Economics asks thoughtful questions The rivals taking it in turn to answer are unfailingly courteous towards each other There is no shouting interrupting or name calling I have heard ruder conversations between nuns When one contestant speaks the other spends a lot of time nodding along in agreement They even smile at each other s tepid jokes  That s enough clues for you to deduce that I am not talking about the gory competition to be chieftain of the rancorous Tory tribe The event I attended one evening last week was a hustings between Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey contenders to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats This contest is being neglected by the media and it is not hard to see why Compared with the gristle and sizzle of the Tory struggle the Lib Dem serving is as exciting as a bowl of tofu Yet it is a mistake not to pay attention The next Lib Dem leader could matter a lot Consider these highly plausible scenarios for the near future an autumn election another hung parliament a minority Corbyn government a minority Tory government a cross party government a second referendum on Brexit In each case the attitudes skills and mettle of the next Lib Dem leader could be critical 
JUN30	Don’t blame parents for wanting the best for their kids. Change the private school system instead	The headmaster of Stowe was greeted with utter incredulity a few weeks ago when he publicly worried that his pupils were victims of social engineering  New figures out last week from the Sutton Trust remind us why his musings were so absurd The tiny cohort of privately educated people is not two or three times more likely than the comprehensively educated to end up in influential jobs the figure is a massive times So defenders of the status quo are arguing that the privately educated are twelvefold more qualified to be ministers news editors and diplomats It s ludicrous and insulting 
JUN30	How Lincoln's disdain for demagogues pricks Trump's Fourth of July pomposity	Donald Trump is orchestrating his Fourth of July extravaganza to be his most spectacular act of self flattery his first appearance on the National Mall since his inauguration but before a certifiably larger crowd and ending with a burst of fireworks  He has always given careful thought to his staging His introduction to The Apprentice driven to the thumping beat of For the Love of Money showed the master of the universe striding from a limousine at Trump Tower riding in a Trump helicopter and climbing the ramp of a Trump airplane Now however he will display himself on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial With the illuminated statue of the th president as his backdrop Trump will highlight the magnitude of his own greatness by standing in reflected glory 
JUN30	The robots are definitely coming and will make the world a more unequal place	So the robots are coming for our jobs are they Yawn That s such an old story Goes back to Elizabeth I and the stocking frame if my memory serves me right Machines have been taking our jobs forever But economists despite their reputation as practitioners of the dismal science have always been upbeat about that Sure machines destroy jobs they say But hey the new industries that new technology enables create even more new jobs Granted there may be a bit of disruption between destruction and creation but that s just capitalist business as usual Besides it s progress innit  We have now lived through what one might call Automation The paradigmatic example is car manufacturing Henry Ford s production line metamorphosed into Toyota s lean machine and thence to the point where few humans if any are visible on an assembly line Once upon a time the car industry employed hundreds of thousands of people We called them blue collar workers Now it employs far fewer The robots did indeed take their jobs In some cases those made redundant found other employment but many didn t And sometimes their communities were devastated as a result But GDP went up nevertheless so economists were happy 
JUN30	Glastonbury isn’t just a fleeting experience – it’s a mirror of society	Glastonbury is another world At least that s what it feels like when you re there it s so vast so utterly overwhelming The size of Colchester is the latest comparison as though that means anything to anyone At night if you stand at the back of the Green Fields you can see the festival stretching down twinkling filling the valley all the way to the lit up cross  Our tent is small and so are you Teeny tiny you is inside enormous Glastonbury part of it at all times whether you re being teased by drag queens in Block watching the sun come up in the Sacred Space traipsing along the surprisingly quiet main drag in the heat or curled up on your coat in the foetal position somewhere between the Left Field and the Glade wondering if you ll ever stop shaking It s a Narnia of escapism of living in the moment a fantasy break away from the everyday A bubble of joy or at least a hiccup of concentrated sensation in a world of never ending routine In Glastonbury tweeted a friend yesterday my life is perfect and unsustainable 
JUL1	Jeremy Hunt seemed the sensible Tory option. No longer	A week ago there was a discernible cigarette paper between them Boris Johnson was the bad character with charisma the sociopath who would do anything say anything lie cheat and swerve his roguishness and proroguing priced in with the populism Jeremy Hunt was dull as hell but more sensible the man who probably wouldn t drive the country off the cliff in a Boris bus  The three quarters of voters who reject a no deal Brexit could only hope against hope that just possibly Hunt might defy the odds and persuade the Brexit crazed old white men of the Tory tribe to think again No longer The only useful role for the inevitable loser in the Conservative leadership contest was to pull the next prime minister back into the realms of reality But in the death throes of this contest Hunt emerges as a swiveller too a turncoat peddler of the same hyper dishonesty just as ready as his opponent to wreck the economy and people s lives 
JUL1	We laugh at Ivanka Trump – because to take her seriously is frightening	We have all been there haven t we Standing at the edge of a conversation pretty in pink perhaps hoping to be taken seriously but side eyed As most of us have some degree of self consciousness we hope the world doesn t see this happening But like her father idiot princess Ivanka Trump doesn t really do embarrassment so the fact everyone saw the handbag entrepreneur being snubbed by world leaders at the G doesn t really matter She does sleeves She does bows And it was her not Melania who has again gone awol who walked into North Korea with her father Surreal she said Indeed although the transgressive poetic power of surrealism is long gone Surrealism can only disrupt the rational and we are way past that  Ivanka the daughter as wife substitute travels the world talking about the empowerment of women I think this means earrings That her fembot ways enable her father to embolden those who will strip women of their rights is disarming but not new Thuggish men have always used women to soften their images Asma al Assad anyone What Ivanka does for the Trump regime is branding Product placement She is both product and placement and no one knows quite how to deal with it World leaders may look awkward when she is placed in the middle of photographs but they are complicit in allowing this to happen 
JUL1	Cliff Richard is right to seek anonymity for those accused of sex crimes	The injustice suffered by Cliff Richard in defied the maxim words can never hurt you Anonymously accused of a sex crime his good name was devastated by a publicity seeking police force in collusion with a scoop seeking BBC Both later admitted fault and the BBC paid damages  Similar calumny was visited on other public figures including the broadcaster Paul Gambaccini former MP Harvey Proctor and assorted VIPs The police thus became judge and jury in effectively punishing people for a crime of which none had been convicted or even charged Both Gambaccini and Proctor subsequently received official apologies 
JUL1	You can expel an MP for fiddling expenses – but not violence or misogyny. Why?	I have never grabbed someone by the neck Nor have I ever groped anyone or looked at porn at work I ve never sent a colleague an inappropriate text message or asked someone I manage to buy sex toys for my partner I have never been accused of rape You would think that I wouldn t need to clarify those things but as a politician I increasingly feel the need to After all there are more than a dozen men sitting in our House of Commons who have been accused of doing at least one of the above  When Mark Field was caught on camera last week shoving a peaceful Greenpeace activist Janet Barker seizing her by the neck and roughly escorting her from a black tie dinner there was public outcry As a result he has been temporarily suspended from his ministerial position and police are investigating third party reports of assault against him I believe he should face recall by his constituents But under current legislation that is impossible 
JUL1	The US right’s concern for the foetus doesn’t survive the trip down the birth canal	In Alabama a woman who was shot in the stomach five times and lost her pregnancy as a result has been charged with the manslaughter of her foetus Marshae Jones allegedly instigated a fight that resulted in the shooting and thus according to a local police source the only true victim was the unborn baby Lieutenant Danny Reid further explained that the foetus is dependent on its mother to keep it from harm and she shouldn t seek out unnecessary physical altercations  If Jones can be tried for manslaughter what other types of pregnancy loss can be treated as serious crimes If a pregnant woman is hit by a car while jaywalking is this manslaughter How about if despite knowing of the tiny risk she chooses to eat soft blue cheese and miscarries due to listeria What if she changes the cat litter and contracts toxoplasmosis 
JUL1	To cure my chronic pain, I had to learn about the links between mind and body	Chronic pain is an ongoing epidemic It debilitates around million adults in the UK alone Yet society seems to have grown comfortable with there being no cure Perhaps this is because we have been searching for the wrong type of answer in the wrong place  I should begin by briefly explaining my own experience of chronic pain and what seemingly against the odds has helped me find relief 
JUL1	All hail the hyperleaders – the bellicose insurgents using the web to seize control	Back in the far off days of Occupy and the Arab spring we were told that the political future would be leaderless horizontal and defined by the egalitarian promise of social networks But more than ever any chance of political success now depends on charismatic one person leadership and the crucial online currency of celebrity  On the left this is the age of Jeremy Corbyn Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez On the right are Donald Trump Matteo Salvini and the other figureheads of reactionary populism whose most grimly fascinating example is probably Narendra Modi of India All of these individuals present themselves as people from outside their countries establishments and draw their energy from vast numbers of devoted supporters who gather online In his own way Boris Johnson clearly fancies his chances of becoming one of them But more of that in a moment 
JUL1	Europe failed to act after the 2003 French heatwave. We cannot ignore this one	Several French temperature records were broken on June during this historic heatwave including the highest temperature ever recorded in the country since records began C The previous high was set during the heatwave which was the most significant episode in France s meteorological history until now  Saharan air has engulfed the country On June while meteorologists were discussing the projections of the American global forecast system model a map with a disturbing resemblance to Munch s painting The Scream came to my attention Within a few days the media spotted this comparison and the image went viral In years of model observation I had never seen such high temperatures predicted for France especially in June The forecast made more than a week in advance proved correct records were not just broken they were smashed 
JUL1	Prevent is stopping free speech on campus and demonising Muslims	Many staff and students at universities across Britain will have welcomed Liberty s condemnation of the chilling effect the government s counter terrorism strategy is having on free speech on campuses Recently published figures from the Office for Students showed that more than events across Britain s or so higher education institutions have been affected by Prevent  While some events were allowed to take place with conditions attached events or speaker requests on campuses were rejected altogether by university authorities The demonisation of Muslims through the Prevent strategy has led to progressive dissent more broadly being curtailed 
JUL1	How Boris Johnson’s Scotland problem could keep the Tories out of power	Usually when a broadcaster airs vox pops on politics they endeavour to make sure that the samples offer a balanced display of public opinion But when Sophy Ridge took to the streets of Edinburgh for Sky News earlier this month to survey local opinion on Boris Johnson there was little in the way of variety on offer  The comments from members of the public ranged from a Johnson premiership looking quite scary to being incredibly divisive The highest praise was from a woman who thought he would get us through Brexit before adding that she thought he was a bit of a clown generally As Ridge summed up I ll be honest here in Edinburgh it s been hard to find anyone with a good word to say about Boris Johnson Perhaps that s unsurprising when Johnson has a negative net approval rating of minus in Scotland the Brexit party s Nigel Farage is more popular on a mere minus That same Panelbase survey found that more than half of Scottish voters could back independence if Johnson became prime minister 
JUL2	Corbynism’s greatest liability is now Jeremy Corbyn himself	The winner of the Conservative leadership contest will be the third prime minister in four years to take on Jeremy Corbyn which is a measure of serial Tory dysfunction and the Labour leader s tenacity Corbyn has held his party s top job for longer than Gordon Brown John Smith Michael Foot or James Callaghan The man obviously has stamina even if gossipy civil servants say it isn t so  Other leadership qualities are more debatable By conventional measures election results and opinion polls Labour s recent record is poor The party lost dozens of seats in May s local council ballot and came third in the European poll three weeks later Corbyn s personal ratings mine depths of unpopularity from which as a rule opposition candidates do not recover The defence used to be that normal rules do not apply that conventional instruments did not detect the unique frequency of Corbyn s appeal Even stalwart supporters struggle to hold that line Diane Abbott admits she is beginning to worry about Labour s Brexit position John McDonnell is reported to have compared the situation to a slow motion car crash 
JUL2	Tennis prodigy Cori Gauff shows why role models still matter	One of the most embarrassing things that ever happened to me played out in Wimbledon Venus and Serena Williams were renting a house on the road where I grew up Like me they were barely out of their teens Venus had just turned but while I had just finished my A levels they were busy tearing up years of tennis history That was the first year Venus won Wimbledon which prompted my mum to insist on baking a cake frogmarching our whole family up the road and handing it over to the bemused Williams sisters declaring that as the mother of two black girls she knew exactly how they felt  I was mortified but in hindsight I rate my mum for this She looked at the Williamses and saw role models for her own daughters And she was right The arrival of Venus and Serena had a profound impact on me and my sense of self Their skill was so exceptional even in an environment that proved repeatedly hostile becoming the best athlete of her generation didn t stop the press trolling Serena They literally changed the game 
JUL2	The fight for democracy in Hong Kong is the defining struggle of our age	By accident or design the eruption of political violence in Hong Kong has opened the way for direct rule from Beijing It is unlikely radical new measures to bring Britain s former colony to heel will be imposed overnight But furious official statements in response to Monday s unprecedented clashes suggest the one country two systems principle that has kept capitalist Hong Kong functioning alongside and within communist China for the past years could be on its last legs  This long simmering crisis of mutual confidence now finding expression through physical confrontation is exactly what the Sino British Joint Declaration in which laid legal grounds for the handover was intended to avoid It states unambiguously that the current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged and so will the lifestyle Rights and freedoms including those of the person of speech of the press of assembly and of religious belief will be ensured by law 
JUL2	Mark Field called homeless people ‘undesirables’. But it’s not just Tories who think this	In the past decade thousands of people have been plunged into homelessness and hundreds of homeless individuals have died on the streets unaccounted for Year on year rises in homelessness have become so bad that now when ministers are asked why they shrug like a petulant teenager asked why she hasn t handed in her homework And things are getting worse  In the past month the Guardian has reported on councils putting up walls to keep homeless people away from the one place they are allowed to be the streets Homelessness minister Heather Wheeler faced calls to step down after using racist language when referring to homeless people And on Tuesday it was reported that the Conservative MP Mark Field called a local homeless charity a magnet for these undesirables to flood into Victoria 
JUL2	Does Boris Johnson believe he can hoodwink the nation on Brexit?	The problem with assessing the intentions of a serial liar is that disbelief becomes second nature So when Boris Johnson stated his Brexit plans in interviews last week and over the weekend it was largely overlooked The media and public preferred to focus Johnson s absurd claim that he enjoys arts and crafts of the vehicular variety Less a dead cat than a dead kitten  What makes Johnson s intentions even harder to assess is his absence of principles He belongs to a vanishingly small group of Britons who believe in neither leave nor remain It is not that he has changed his mind but that he has never much cared either way For Johnson Brexit was a passing bandwagon to the premiership and he was prepared to climb aboard It is testament to his political skill that he has hoodwinked the Brexit zealots into believing he is their man 
JUL2	Civil servants should discuss Corbyn – as long as it’s behind closed doors	Jeremy Corbyn is owed an apology and when he meets Mark Sedwill the head of the civil service he will presumably get one Senior civil servants are not supposed to gossip to journalists which means that whoever supplied Saturday s Times with comments about longstanding rumours of the Labour leader s supposed physical and mental unfitness to become prime minister simply doesn t have a leg to stand on Downing Street s unexpectedly strong intervention in Corbyn s defence with No arguing that it would be inappropriate and unacceptable for comments of this sort to have been made or briefed to the press underlines how seriously the concept of political neutrality or civil service willingness to serve without judgment is taken  But let s clear about what Sedwill should and should not be clamping down on here Rumours have been flying for months not only about Corbyn s physical health which the leader s office categorically denies but more broadly about his intellectual capacity his ability to master an endless series of complex briefs and take timely decisions on difficult issues while simultaneously managing a sometimes fractious party and dealing with whatever unexpected crisis blows up Some of that speculation has centred unfairly on his age but some has more to do with the way he has led his party to date 
JUL2	It’s not that we’ve failed to rein in Facebook and Google. We’ve not even tried	In a BBC interview last week Facebook s vice president Nick Clegg surprised viewers by calling for new rules of the road on privacy data collection and other company practices that have attracted heavy criticism during the past year It s not for private companies to come up with those rules he insisted It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so  Facebook s response would be to adopt a mature role not shunning but advocating the new rules For a company that has fiercely resisted new laws Clegg s message aimed to persuade us that the page had turned Yet his remarks sounded like Newspeak as if to obscure ugly facts 
JUL2	Lil Nas X’s coming out shows why hiding LGBT life from children won’t work	This weekend I took my kids to a community fete in our north London borough of Haringey complete with bouncy castle Turkish dancing tug of war and free curry After a while the younger children present began to drag their heels so the emcee put Lil Nas X s Old Town Road on and surrendered the microphone at which point they all I believe the phrase is popped off Old Town Road was then played sometimes in alternation with Baby Shark a total number of times with children doing the shoot dance and hollering can t tell me nothing into the mic all afternoon  Old Town Road has been in the UK charts for weeks of which two were spent at No In the States the song has been top of the Billboard ranking for weeks straight Part of the song s success as any parent knows is due to sales earned from streaming children love Old Town Road For proof enjoy this viral tweet showing children going wild to the song when Lil Nas X performed at their school 
JUL2	Boys love these Lionesses too. A football revolution is coming	Last Friday morning I woke up to my nine year old son shouting Did you see that Lucy Bronze goal as he burst into the bedroom His six year old brother was right behind him earnestly re enacting the England player s yard thunderbolt with all his might They d followed our usual protocol for evening kickoffs on school nights inaugurated with England s men in the World Cup last summer and honed with Liverpool in the Champions League this season They watch the first half with my husband and me before bed then watch the second half on catch up the next morning  That this time it was women playing rather than men made no discernible difference to their levels of interest or excitement For them it was just football and compelling football at that in which England were doing well 
JUL2	The Handmaid’s Tale comes to life in Alabama. Women must heed the warning	Marshae Jones was five months pregnant when another woman Ebony Jemison shot her in the stomach in an Alabama town called Pleasant Grove The year old Jones survived but the foetus hit by the bullet did not Jemison successfully pleaded self defence since her gun was drawn in the middle of a fight that Jones reportedly started and was winning according to an unnamed police source until the gun was fired  Since the shooter was exonerated it seems odd still to be preoccupied with who started the fight But this is one of two key elements in the extraordinary case against Jones who was indicted for the manslaughter of her unborn child As a pregnant woman Jones s alleged decision to provoke an altercation represented wilful endangerment Since the law in Alabama confers personhood on a foetus Jones was treated as she would have been had she endangered a child Her lawyers have yet to decide whether or not to build a challenge to that idea of personhood into their case 
JUL3	Forget what you think about Corbyn: a partisan civil service is a threat to us all	A firebrand leftwing Labour leader whose radical political prospectus terrifies the establishment a smear campaign alleging ill health fostered by unaccountable figures seeking to oust him from power This is the plot of A Very British Coup a work of fiction by former Labour minister Chris Mullin that centres on the rise to power of plain speaking Harry Perkins Election euphoria has given way to turmoil and crisis With Perkins deemed irretrievably unpopular the media demands he stands aside for a more moderate colleague At this moment agents of the British state supposedly impartial servants of the elected government take the opportunity to strike  A far fetched scenario surely It seems not Last week the Times ran a front page story headlined Jeremy Corbyn too frail to be PM fears civil service Officials were quoted as saying there were worries Corbyn was not up to the job physically or mentally One asked When does someone say he is too ill to carry on as leader of the Labour party let alone prime minister 
JUL3	The EU has nominated new leaders – but there will be no Brexit breakthrough	So the European Union finally has managed to nominate people to fill its top jobs The era of Jean Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk is over And of course the announcements are being interpreted in this country through a Brexit tinted lens  Hasty conclusions have been reached about what this latest revolution of the Brussels merry go round might mean for us After all both men who are being replaced have been key figures in the Brexit story Save yourself the bother though because frankly it doesn t mean all that much 
JUL3	Soho has never been famous for its health-giving properties. Long may that continue	Soho has been ranked as the unhealthiest place to live in Britain shock news that sends bears hurtling into the woods and the pope saying his rosary in other words no shit Sherlock Too many opportunities to get boozed up and fill your belly with calorific takeaways and very few parks and green spaces in which to counter the excess and choking pollution do not a Swiss sanatorium make  Nobody goes to Soho to get healthy despite the recent arrival of the odd green juice bar They go to live the life of the fl neur to soak up the psychic energy that generations of incomers from th century French Huguenots to the proprietors and staff of numerous Italian and Chinese restaurants from music hall artistes to struggling writers and artists have imprinted into this tiny network of streets and alleys 
JUL3	If you care about migrants to the US, don’t call for humane detention – call for its end	It has long been obvious that migrants in the custody of the US Border Patrol were being detained in horrendous conditions But not many cared to look and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez was mocked when she claimed that concentration camps were being run along the border In the past few days however a series of exposures has demonstrated that extreme language is more than justified  First Ocasio Cortez and a congressional delegation visited two detention facilities in Texas where they found detainees who hadn t bathed in weeks were sleeping on concrete floors and had limited access to drinking water Ocasio Cortez met with women crying out of fear of being punished out of sickness out of desperation lack of sleep trauma despair She said women had been encouraged to drink out of toilet bowls and that Border Patrol agents were laughing about the situation in front of the delegation 
JUL3	In turning their backs, Brexit MEPs behaved like attention-seeking toddlers	On Tuesday Brexit party MEPs decided to take a stand against the undemocratic EU they d been elected to democratically Rather than do something frivolous such as returning their wages they decided to turn their backs at the playing of the European anthem during the parliament s opening ceremony a move only slightly classier than mooning  When the Brexiteers were elected to the European parliament many were concerned that they wouldn t represent the UK properly And yet here they were on day one already crapping themselves for attention and as such were representing the UK better than we possibly could have imagined Shortly afterwards Nigel Farage tweeted proudly The Brexit party has already made its presence felt and he s right in the same way that a toddler smearing spaghetti on the walls of a fancy restaurant while repeating every swearword they know will grab the attention of their parents Who knows what the party has in store next but we should probably set our faces to apologetic cringe mode just in case 
JUL3	Boris Johnson’s cynical ‘sin-tax’ freeze is a glimpse of what’s to come	Here s a thing they teach in campaign school If you re about to make a political promise first check the calendar Just to avoid a clash that could make your policy proposal look utterly wrong headed inept and at odds with the available evidence  Boris Johnson must have bunked off that day because he clearly missed that lesson Instead he s issued what he doubtless hoped would be a crowd pleasing promise to halt any new sin taxes on sugary drinks on the very day obesity was named as causing more cases of four common cancers than smoking 
JUL3	After urging land reform I now know the brute power of our billionaire press	All billionaires want the same thing a world that works for them For many this means a world in which they are scarcely taxed and scarcely regulated where labour is cheap and the planet can be used as a dustbin where they can flit between tax havens and secrecy regimes using the Earth s surface as a speculative gaming board extracting profits and dumping costs The world that works for them works against us  So how in nominal democracies do they get what they want They fund political parties and lobby groups set up fake grassroots Astroturf campaigns and finance social media ads But above all they buy newspapers and television stations The widespread hope and expectation a few years ago was that in the internet age news controlled by billionaires would be replaced by news controlled by the people social media would break their grip But social media is instead dominated by stories the billionaire press generates As their crucial role in promoting Nigel Farage Brexit and Boris Johnson suggests the newspapers are as powerful as ever 
JUL3	The fight for fair housing is finally shifting power from landlords to residents	Unless you ve been living under a rock you ll know there is a housing crisis and even if you have been your rent has probably gone up Despite house prices having fallen slightly as a result of diminished consumer confidence housing continues to devour outrageous amounts of income In the UK and elsewhere many poor working class and even some middle class households experience housing as unaffordable exploitative and precarious  Housing has been a site of injustice for so long that it is easy to think this condition is permanent But across the world activists are reinvigorating housing politics Demands that have been marginalised are becoming mainstream There appears to be a new level of awareness today that the residential is political And there are some initial signs that the balance of power may finally be starting to shift away from landlords developers and speculators and towards tenants activists and residents 
JUL3	In too deep: why the seabed should be off-limits to mining companies	When I was filming Blue Planet Live I was struck by just how much of the ocean has been altered by humans From industrial fisheries ensnaring ocean giants in kilometres long lines to finding our trash at some of the deepest parts of the ocean it s clear that however vast the seas are we are causing profound harm  Yet at this point in history when the oceans are facing more pressures than ever before a secretive new industry is seeking to move into the deep sea the largest ecosystem on the planet to start mining for metals and minerals 
JUL3	If we want to help migrants, it's time to move from outrage to action	Having grown up just after the second world war I ve always wondered what I would have done if I d known that Jews were being herded into let s call them mass detention centers What if I d been aware that this was happening in my country  Now that people are being herded into mass detention centers in my country now that children are being kept in cages I have like it or not been given a chance to find out what I would have done If there had been Facebook in the early s I would have posted on Facebook I would have written opinion pieces from the safe distance of my study I would have donated to humanitarian and legal aid organizations I would even have traveled to Texas to hear the stories of asylum seekers and witness a trial in which immigrants some of whom had lived here for years were all deported at once I would have felt haunted continually Haunted and obsessed And none of these things would have stopped the mass incarceration of children 
JUL4	Someone, please tell Jeremy Hunt: Britain no longer rules the waves	It was June and I was standing in the crowd on Hong Kong s waterfront in torrential rain A sad bugle played as the flag was lowered and the royal yacht Britannia carried the Prince of Wales out to sea and Britain out of its last Asian colony We all had one thought Thank goodness that s over Hong Kong s last governor Chris Patten left what China clearly saw as a mess on the carpet an elected assembly under the slogan one country two systems No one expected it to last but Britain left with a certain dignity  So why did Britain s foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt take it on himself this week to revisit the scene He applauded Hong Kong s recent demonstrations and warned Beijing not to crack down on the rioters He said the Chinese regime should not use a few broken windows as a pretext for repression Britain would not stand for it He said there would be serious consequences 
JUL4	Osborne thinks he could run the IMF. Maybe gaslighting a country is a useful skill	Imagine you have been very publicly sacked from your job and the mistakes you made have had dire consequences for society When planning your next steps do you a rethink your career goals and consider doing something different with less responsibility b go for a job you re completely unqualified for or c go for a big promotion with even greater stakes for society I assume most of us would go for a and even if we wanted to we wouldn t have the option of b or c without facing rejection  However that s not the case for our former chancellor George Osborne who after presiding over the worst economic recovery in recorded history with severe and deadly public spending cuts went for option b and managed to become the editor of the Evening Standard a job for which he is totally unqualified And how has that gone Losses of m aren t too shabby So sensing now is the time to cut and run he s in the running for the top job at the International Monetary Fund IMF Yes it s yet another example of a privately educated white male failing upwards But it also shows us how without an ideological change at the top we are stuck with the same pool of arrogant neoliberals 
JUL4	The Tories are there to be demolished. But Labour is too inept to do it	If anyone missed the depth of this national crisis just look at the latest dire economic figures we re plunging towards a recession of our own making with Britain s first quarterly contraction in seven years Meanwhile the two would be prime ministers daily demonstrate their unfitness for office with ever wilder promises and preposterous claims More fox hunting more sugar Both are now fatally boxed into a no deal future with no escape hatch hostages to Nigel Farage and the European Research Group of hardline Tory MPs  Each bids to persuade the Conservative membership that only they can bar Jeremy Corbyn s way to Downing Street Jeremy Hunt claimed on Wednesday to be the best person to stop this clear and present danger with Boris Johnson counter boasting as his lead narrows But does the idea of Corbyn as a bogeyman to petrify all right thinking citizens fly Weakness not red peril is Labour s electoral problem Nothing in Labour s last or next manifesto could be a fraction as radical as the earthquake the Brexiters have caused to Britain s economy its union its internal harmony or its standing in the world The nearest to revolutionary terror is Labour s plan to raise the top level of tax for the richest back to where it was in Popular plans to take back rail and the utilities to public ownership is hardly Venezuelan since they leak as much money to shareholders as the water companies three billion litres leaked daily from broken pipes 
JUL4	What unites Johnson and Hunt in Northern Ireland? An inability to pretend they care	Winston Churchill called the train that smuggled Vladimir Lenin into Russia a sealed truck carrying a plague bacillus By contrast the plane carrying Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson to Belfast this week was a bit more like a Tupperware container filled with norovirus  Conveyed at separate ends of a single private jet Schr dinger s leadership candidates took the roadshow of milky promises and hedged half truths to Northern Ireland for a strange and quietly pointless Conservative party hustings in Belfast 
JUL4	A post-Brexit election is looking like Boris Johnson’s best bet	Boris Johnson seems to have taken Lynton Crosby s advice to deny any intention of calling an autumn general election once he s installed in Downing Street while in fact keeping his options open The Tory frontrunner might also ask his election strategist what are the chances of leading the Conservatives to victory and securing a large enough majority to implement Brexit on his terms  Two polls out this week tell very different stories especially about the threat from the Brexit party 
JUL4	Enough of the climate nightmare. It’s time to paint the dream	Let s talk about the dream not just the nightmare Imagine the cities and towns of the future clean green with decent air quality hospitable to walking and cycling powered by renewables with green space not concrete jungles and rewarding jobs in green industries That isn t just a conceit for the imagination but a tangible vision of the future produced today by Common Wealth the thinktank of which I am a board member  Tackling the climate and ecological crisis requires urgently reimagining how we live and work A Green New Deal conceived of in the UK popularised by US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and now powered by social movements here should not just decarbonise today s economy but build the sustainable and just economy of tomorrow That s why imagining a town transformed by a just transition to a low carbon future isn t just a nice piece of design it is an essential symbol of where the climate movement now needs to take its case That movement has an unprecedented chance to be heard as a result of the spectacular success of Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes in refocusing public attention on the urgency of action But now with people listening once again our duty is to offer a compelling and attractive vision of the future 
JUL4	Want a truly mind-expanding experience? Learn another language	More than half the world s people speak more than one language and I am one of them I speak English Welsh French and Italian and wish that I could speak more  Being able to speak more than one language has opened up whole worlds of experience and understanding so it is particularly saddening then to see reports that Brexit is putting British pupils off studying modern foreign languages at school Some parents have even told teachers that it s useless for their children to learn another language now that the UK is leaving the European Union 
JUL4	What Love Island tells us about the value of kindness	Is there gaslighting on Love Island Maybe From cruel jokes to crueller recouplings commentators have been quick and sometimes astute to notice how patterns of behaviour on the programme can dramatise the more disturbing aspects of dating in the real world These are interesting conversations and as others have noted Love Island s capacity to spark wider discussions around consent relationships and gender is part of what makes it such a fascinating show  Discussing signs of abuse in the abstract is useful too if seeing a TV character s behaviour labelled thus helps one woman recognise that a sustained amplified version of the same has happened in her life and can be addressed seriously then that can only be a good thing But while the debate over whether certain contestants actions constitute abuse or not is a fraught one there is something we can all readily agree on often it isn t very kind 
JUL4	It’s the autumn of 2020 and no-deal Britain is on its knees…	It was Sunday November The helicopter carrying his hush hush VIP visitor was expected soon Staring through the Chequers windows at the lawn where the unmarked Sea King would soon land prime minister Boris Johnson could hardly believe what he was about to do  Even by his standards it had been a year of scrapes of winging it and of close run things that would have destroyed another leader In the summer of he had defeated Jeremy Hunt by an unexpectedly narrow margin A year ago he had led Britain out of the European Union without a deal 
JUL4	How women anxious to have a baby are being exploited for profit	Get A Drip a wellness company offering affordable IV vitamin drips and booster shots has withdrawn a product it called a fertility IV from sale after the British Pregnancy Advisory Service said there was no evidence this treatment could improve fertility  The drip was advertised as costing The only supplements medically recommended for women trying to conceive are folic acid and vitamin D so you wonder what on earth it contained to warrant such a price tag would get you bottles of folic acid from Holland Barrett incidentally More to the point how could the wellness industry have stooped to such a new exploitative low 
JUL5	Ann Widdecombe’s political exhumation adds insult to ignorance in Strasbourg	Wondering vaguely where we ll be in six months time I find myself imagining a scene The BBC s Laura Kuenssberg is doing a live piece to camera from Downing Street when an upper window of No opens behind her As she speaks bin bags full of Boris Johnson s clothes begin to be thrown from it punctuated by various high pitched reflections on his character Like I say it s just a fictional vignette set minutes into a dystopian future But would you honestly rule it out Just over a fortnight before the money shot of the Tory leadership contest very little seems impossible in our increasingly trashy country  After all this is a week in which England and it is always England has once again been embarrassed by the behaviour of travelling fans Fans of Nigel Farage in this case with the spectacle of his Brexit party MEPs turning their backs on a live performance of the European anthem at the opening of the new European parliament session in Strasbourg We have seen it so many times before of course this pack mentality this unprovoked loutishness this excruciatingly entitled sense that it is acceptable even imperative to colonise a public space and behave absurdly rudely in it 
JUL5	Donald Trump wants to be a dictator. It’s not enough just to laugh at him	Maybe we re too busy laughing to see it Perhaps it s the jokes and memes that Donald Trump generates in abundance the gift that keeps on giving that blinds us to a chilling fact that we d rather not face Put simply the leader of the world s most powerful nation is behaving like an authoritarian dictator one who threatens democracy in his own country and far beyond  Here s the latest example of how the comedy can distract On Thursday Donald Trump marked the Fourth of July by praising the US military invoking the heroism of an army that defeated the British in the th century in part because it took over the airports Lol behold the ignoramus president Cue more chuckles as Trump delivered that speech during a downpour the Almighty himself apparently deciding to rain on Trump s parade 
JUL5	Very heterosexual couples and 18th-century airports: it's 4 July, Trump-style	I cannot wait as a global citizen and for obvious reasons constant consumer of news for independence from Donald Trump I will be celebrating every single day Many of us will And if you needed another reason I anticipate that you do not Trump s latest boneheaded episode was to give an Independence Day speech that referenced American takeover of airports in The first ever flight is thought to have taken place in  Trump becoming the first US president to make a July address in almost years stuck to his script for once It s just that the script was mostly wrong As well as confusing the American revolutionary war AKA the war of independence with the war of Trump went on to make further historical errors There was plenty more going on throughout the celebrations let s take a look 
JUL5	Labour’s fight against antisemitism must be far more radical	The Labour party owes the Jewish community an unqualified apology But that is only a starting point in rebuilding the trust that has been shattered  A few months ago I joined hundreds of other non Jewish Labour party members in signing up as an affiliated member of the Jewish Labour Movement JLM Instead of Jewish members leaving Labour Labour members joined the Jewish community 
JUL5	Syriza betrayed its principles – and the Greek people. Its days are numbered	In January progressives the world over hailed Syriza s general election victory as a rejection of EU imposed austerity and the dawn of a new era for Greece Four years on Alexis Tsipras s once radical party goes to the polls on Sunday as a dead man walking it s now a confused political mishmash of leftists social democrats conservatives and rightwing populists that defends the very neoliberal policies Syriza once threatened to destroy the eurozone over  The party s main difference from its rightwing rival New Democracy is a laughable persistence in claiming to be a party of the left Its government record shows greater zeal in implementing the neoliberal programme of the European troika the consortium of the European commission the European Central Bank and the IMF in the years since the financial crisis than any of its conservative predecessors 
JUL5	The Tories’ rift with the police underlines the party’s existential crisis	You used to know where you were with the Conservatives They were the party of big business of the union of the police of the Church of England  The latter can still accurately be described as the Tory party at prayer a large majority of Anglicans plumped for Theresa May s party in the general election But the institution has drastically shrivelled and since the s successive archbishops of Canterbury have savaged unjust Tory policies from Robert Runcie whose condemnations of Thatcherism were labelled pure Marxist theology by a Tory cabinet minister to Rowan Williams fusillades against the Tory Liberal Democrat coalition The lying philandering likely successor to Theresa May is not let us put this gently exactly the embodiment of traditional Christian values 
JUL5	All hail Theresa May, reluctant hero of the Scottish independence movement	The problem with legacies and the obsession of departing leaders to bequeath them is that the wrong sort can breenge in and wreck the place Tony Blair modernised the Labour party repealed section and drove investment in our moribund cities but his tenure will always be disfigured by the Iraq war Theresa May has spent the past month traversing the UK seeking to carve her name into any cause that will have it mental health provision here zero carbon emissions there Rather inadvertently though she is also making a late run to be remembered as the handmaiden of Scottish independence  Nicola Sturgeon Scotland s first minister has her own thoughts on this Scotland is heading inexorably towards independence that will be Theresa May s legacy said Sturgeon ahead of the prime minister s visit to Scotland on Thursday This legacy may even stretch to an essay in a future modern studies exam paper Theresa May was responsible for delivering Scottish independence Discuss 
JUL5	Boorish sex tourists are ruining Amsterdam. It’s time to ship them out	As I battled a pushchair across the unhelpful Amsterdam cobbles three young Englishmen approached Where s the red light district they asked this bleary eyed breastfeeding mother I thought about directing them straight into a cold canal but politely waved in the direction of what the Dutch call De Wallen  A decade ago I had no idea that they were the first drips in a flood of tourists Now million visitors a year stay in Amsterdam many keen to ogle women in red lit brothel windows party and turn the centre into what city ombudsman Arre Zuurmond has called an urban jungle 
JUL5	Britain is run by a self-serving clique. That’s why it’s in crisis	Last week Boris Johnson delivered a speech to a Royal Horticultural Society audience in Wisley Surrey before heading to the affluent village of Oxshott to buy some fennel and tarragon sausages and have a cup of tea in the Munch and Wiggles cafe In a series of interviews later that day he was unwilling to reveal the provenance of the staged photograph of him and his partner Carrie Symonds He was however able to insist that Britain would leave the European Union do or die by the end of October  On the same day the Sutton Trust and the Social Mobility Commission issued a report into elitism in Britain that paints a picture of a country whose power structures are dominated by a narrow section of the population where social mobility is low and not improving Those who went to private school comprise of the country s population but of the elite those who went to Oxford or Cambridge university comprise less than of the population but of the elite Senior judges junior ministers permanent secretaries and diplomats are among the least representative professions But the media and particularly newspaper columnists are right up there too 
JUL5	Social care is a complex, human challenge. No wonder the Tories aren’t up to it	My mother has an informal patchwork of care arrangements most of which she pays for herself Some a woman who perambulates her up the road and back is provided by Age UK and they re all extremely nice but none in the skill region of say giving a person a bath So the other day I asked if we should look into the local authority s domiciliary care arrangements Jesus no she replied operatically but also very quietly she genuinely is pretty ill Just kill me if I get to the point of needing anything like that Obviously I d love to help I replied but I m not allowed to do that She gave me a look like I d refused to break into a building that had a cat stuck in it Where s Harold Shipman when you need him  Was there ever anything easier for a politician to ignore than the subject nobody wants to talk about anyway It s like re evaluating council tax bands so they actually make sense and are fair only local authorities ever bring it up and then everyone ignores them 
JUL6	When ‘respectable’ conservatives bow to the far right it’s always disastrous	The far right does not seize power It is invited in to power by mainstream conservatives who boast of their commitment to free societies They do it for partisan gain They do it because they hate and fear the left more than they hate and fear the far right But most of all they do it because they have run out of ideas The energy and the votes appear to lie with radical rather than respectable conservatives The future is extreme and like prostitutes turning a trick conservatives would rather lose their respectability than their chance of staying in the game  Leftish condemnations of neoliberalism miss that the Thatcher Reagan ideology of the s is over Conservatives rarely admit it in public at any rate but an idea is still dead even if no one turns up for the funeral Who can now pretend hopes that a small state and free markets would bring prosperity to the mass of people are anything more than a hollow joke The s have been the worst decade for wage growth in years The real value of average wages has still not staggered back to its level The web s enabling of fake news gets all the attention But if it had never been invented there would still have been a reaction against the emptiness of the promises of the old ruling order 
JUL6	In accusing all creeps of gaslighting, we dishonour the real victims	All women need the term gaslighting Well all people really Rebecca Humphries didn t even realise that she needed it until she was cheated on by the comedian Seann Walsh in the Strictly Come Dancing scandal  She d had suspicions but as she wrote at the time Walsh aggressively and repeatedly called me psycho nuts mental as he had done countless times when I ve questioned his inappropriate and hurtful behaviour When her friend mentioned gaslighting it was a relief to know that there was a term to describe her experience Humphries who has just spoken at the House of Commons about coercive control says that single word gave her the vindication and courage she needed 
JUL6	Jean Paul Gaultier, challenging those who churn out fast fashion	Jean Paul Gaultier a man of many notable achievements including the perfect and most welcome corruption of the minds of kids who furtively watched late night Channel during the s has spoken about the responsibility of big fashion brands when it comes to waste Big groups are doing more collections new collections with a big amount of clothes It s absolutely ridiculous he told BBC News It s not a question of thinking about what people need It s thinking about being bigger It s only a question of power and politics  We hear over and over again that our addiction to consumption is causing environmental devastation that the incessant need for more quicker bigger is hastening our demise as a planet and that s just the kind of upbeat conversation that I have in the pub when trying to lift the mood after England s semi final defeat to USA Sips tea cries 
JUL6	So the Philistines were not that philistine after all...	 Oh my gawd a none too bright old schoolmate was fond of exclaiming if you said for instance that you didn t like Merchant Ivory films You are SUCH a palestine He meant philistine of course and we all sniggered at him But now it turns out three decades on that he is semi vindicated  Whatever it was he did mean it wasn t philistine As Satan Judas Iscariot and Potiphar s wife will testify once you ve got a bad press in the Bible it tends to stick But far from being culturally challenged dunderheads well deserving of a good smiting with the jawbone of an ass the historical Philistines were the experts say great traders master builders and one of the most civilised peoples of their time 
JUL6	Once it was lonely being a female football fanatic. Not any more	On Tuesday night England played the USA in the semi final of the Women s World Cup BBC viewing figures showed that it was the most watched TV programme this year with a peak of million people tuning in far more than Britain s Got Talent Another million watched online What I love most about this is the normalisation of the women s game the normalisation of women reporting and commentating on it the normalisation of men watching it Of course there have been those dark corners of Football Twitter where the dinosaurs and losers huddle together for warmth making jokes about women getting back into the kitchen The ones who are still stuck in the s  Let s rewind right back to there When I was in my teens the manager of West Ham United Ron Greenwood was friendly with my parents He knew I liked football I kept quiet about my love of Spurs so as not to cause offence and was a source of tickets for matches at Upton Park One Saturday the whole family was invited My father was whisked off to the boardroom while my mother and I were ushered into the purdah of the ladies lounge with the players and directors wives They might as well have shut us away in a drawer out of sight 
JUL6	Britain’s story of empire is based on myth. We need to know the truth	These days we ve become wearily accustomed to depictions of Brexit Britain as oppressed by a villainously imperial Europe Annexed without permission Nigel Farage claimed melodramatically defending Brexit party MEPs against charges of disrespecting the European Parliament In a particularly far fetched comparison Ann Widdecombe MEP has compared Brexit with the resistance of slaves against their owners and colonies against empires Prime ministerial frontrunner Boris Johnson too has spoken of Britain s supposed colony status in the EU though with a familiar double standard he also believes that it would be good if Britain was still in charge of Africa  These bizarre comparisons can be made and go unchallenged because the stark fact remains that most Britons know very little about the history of the empire itself still less the way in which its long afterlife profoundly shapes both Britain and the wider world today

JUL7	Want to know what a Boris Johnson government would look like? I have just the book	Seven years ago a group of Conservative MPs who had taken their parliamentary seats in brought out a slim manifesto for the future of Britain titled Britannia Unchained Kwasi Kwarteng Priti Patel Dominic Raab Chris Skidmore and Liz Truss appeared to speak with one voice that of unabashed Thatcherites convinced that hacking back tax and regulation and fixating on the demands of business was as appropriate for the st century UK as it supposedly had been for the crisis plagued Britain of the s  Some of the text was so provocative that it read like trolling The British are among the worst idlers in the world read one passage We work among the lowest hours we retire early and our productivity is poor Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen the British are more interested in football and pop music To even start to compete with the rising economies of India China and Brazil said the authors we need to avenge the dependency culture and stop indulging in irrelevant debates about sharing the pie between manufacturing and services the north and the south women and men They advised fellow Conservatives to double down on austerity and maintain their faith in old fashioned laissez faire economics 
JUL7	Cori Gauff is an inspiration – like teenagers everywhere	At Wimbledon year old Cori Gauff in her first grand slam match dismisses her role model Venus Williams Then she pulls off an astonishing comeback against Polona Hercog Another year old Alex Mann wows Glastonbury with his star turn plucked from the crowds by rapper Dave And of course Greta Thunberg still just continues in her astonishing quest to push the climate crisis to the top of all our agendas this week squaring up to Opec chiefs who branded her campaign the greatest threat to the oil industry Teens are definitely having a moment  We adults can fall into the trap of being too judgmental forgetting it s teenagers job to make our lives difficult
JUL7	Iran didn’t ask for this crisis, but it won’t stand for Trump’s bullying	In May the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA which was designed to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and had been agreed on after years of exhaustive negotiations  The US began to impose new economic and political sanctions targeting not just various sectors of the Iranian economy but the state s most influential entities and actors The imposition of these sanctions has virtually killed off the possibility of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and will have political consequences for not just Iran and the US but the whole region The current situation is extremely fraught with Iran responding to aggressive actions by increasing its level of uranium enrichment 
JUL7	We’re told that too much screen time hurts our kids. Where’s the evidence?	If you had attended the Royal College of Psychiatrists international congress in London last week you could have been forgiven for coming away with the following thoughts Addiction to Fortnite the online game is a real disorder social media is depleting our neurotransmitter deposits and excess screen time has reduced our attention span to eight seconds one less than that of a goldfish  Scary stuff Only problem is none of these claims is supported by facts or a drop of scientific evidence 
JUL7	Jeremy Hunt was meant to be the competent one. But a messy campaign did for him	 Vote early and vote often is such a tired joke in political circles that perhaps Jeremy Hunt felt he had to invent his own Instead of telling Conservative members to rush back to the postbox with their ballots this weekend the Tory leadership contender has been asking them to take a week or so to consider their decision His vote slowly slogan is try before you buy if Tory members want to see what he d be like as prime minister then they should wait to watch this week s TV debates  It s a lot of faith to put in just two television programmes especially given the latest polling shows Boris Johnson to have a commanding lead over Hunt But it s also in keeping with Hunt s main strategy throughout this campaign which is to say yes to every single media bid in order to get as much exposure as possible Johnson he claims is dodging scrutiny by operating a submarine campaign And yet all the TV interviews and newspaper profiles don t seem to be working What s to say that this week s programmes will change all of that 
JUL7	They’ve got Ivanka, we’ve got Stanley Johnson. When did politics become a family affair?	In the debate over Trump and Johnson as to which man constitutes the more severe national embarrassment the entry of Ivanka on to the world stage arguably gives the US monster an edge  For their achievements in lying racism conceit incompetence rudeness jingoism greed crotch length ties laziness fiscal opacity diplomatic offences hair choices sexual incontinence and infantile fantasies featuring bridges walls and tanks the men are surely taking into account that Johnson has yet to enjoy the enhanced misconduct opportunities that come with national leadership well matched 
JUL7	Here’s how to make the media fit for modern Britain	The Britain of is very different from the Britain of the year I started my journalistic career Among the most obvious changes are those of social class and ethnicity A country in which the largest social group was both working class and white has been transformed  Naturally enough these developments have affected the makeup of our media but in different ways Journalism has become an almost uniformly middle class trade in which entrants are usually expected to have enjoyed a degree level education By contrast running counter to the rise in the BAME black Asian and minority ethnic population media recruitment has not kept pace with that increase It is assumed that the lack of working class and BAME media representation distorts output I concede it may be unproven or possibly unprovable but I am convinced it is so In their heyday popular newspapers which were overwhelmingly staffed by white working class journalists reflected the concerns and yes the prejudices of the communities from which they sprang 
JUL7	Whatever we call them, wherever they are, detention centres are a disgrace	They are held in wire cages with standing room only sometimes for months Adults have to wear the same clothes for weeks Children have no washing facilities and sleep on bare concrete floors Babies are fed from the same unwashed bottle for days Children as young as four months are separated from their parents Some are never reunited  The detention centres to hold undocumented migrants on America s southern border are a moral abomination But are they concentration camps 
JUL7	Behold, the new nanny-free state. Cheap pop for all and no one to say it’s bad for us	We are all children sometimes desperate to ignore the fact that what we want is not always what we need Our adult selves retain a fascination with excess falling off the wagons of healthy eating and safe units of alcohol and steps a day with for some too great a frequency for comfort  Weight loss programmes falter not because we can t educate our palates to enjoy grilled salmon and steamed green beans but because sometimes out of tiredness or boredom or excitement we just really want a biscuit I write as a woman who last week went to the very back of the kitchen cupboard in search of a small box of chocolate truffles I remembered having been given for Christmas Reader they turned out to be miniature bath bombs It was a heartbreaking moment 
JUL7	When ‘respectable’ conservatives bow to the far right it’s always disastrous	The far right does not seize power It is invited in to power by mainstream conservatives who boast of their commitment to free societies They do it for partisan gain They do it because they hate and fear the left more than they hate and fear the far right But most of all they do it because they have run out of ideas The energy and the votes appear to lie with radical rather than respectable conservatives The future is extreme and like prostitutes turning a trick conservatives would rather lose their respectability than their chance of staying in the game  Leftish condemnations of neoliberalism miss that the Thatcher Reagan ideology of the s is over Conservatives rarely admit it in public at any rate but an idea is still dead even if no one turns up for the funeral Who can now pretend hopes that a small state and free markets would bring prosperity to the mass of people are anything more than a hollow joke The s have been the worst decade for wage growth in years The real value of average wages has still not staggered back to its level The web s enabling of fake news gets all the attention But if it had never been invented there would still have been a reaction against the emptiness of the promises of the old ruling order 
JUL8	The embassy leak will damage far more than the special relationship	Under the Vienna convention the diplomatic bag is inviolable That s because states have long accepted that ambassadors need to be able to report home in frank terms without the prying eyes of the host nation reading what they write The principle still applies even though sealing wax and Queen s messengers have been replaced by encrypted emails But all the effort to keep diplomatic communications secure counts for nothing if they are leaked by the home side  The scandal surrounding the reporting from British ambassador Kim Darroch in Washington is not that he was sending home his unvarnished analysis that s what good ambassadors have done for centuries It s that someone inside the British system deliberately amassed a stash of his assessments then chose the moment of maximum impact to leak it This was not a spontaneous decision to make public a single document it required premeditation and therefore an agenda Can it be a coincidence that the material appeared in the middle of the Conservative party s leadership election 
JUL8	Not washing your clothes is fine, Stella – if you’re beautiful	Stella McCartney doesn t dry clean her clothes Nor does she wash her clothes I ve really drilled into this to find out what she does when her clothes are dirty The rule on a bespoke suit is you do not clean it You do not touch it You let the dirt dry and you brush it off Basically in life rule of thumb if you don t absolutely have to clean anything don t clean it  There is in the intersection of beauty fashion feminism and sustainability a subtle variant to the concept of the humblebrag ideas that sound woke but which only work if you re an incredibly beautiful person with incredibly expensive clothes Don t wear makeup don t throw anything away throw away all face creams and merely splash yourself in vinegar don t go to the dry cleaner It reached its apex with a suggestion from Vivienne Westwood that you never had to buy a new T shirt you should merely print out a slogan or photograph and affix it with a safety pin to your existing T shirt And all these ideas work magnificently well on a model but miss the point of adornment which is to distract people from what you actually look like not bloody draw attention to it 
JUL8	The three mistakes behind Syriza’s demise in Greece	In January Alexis Tspiras stormed to power as a firebrand of the radical left He vowed to wage war against the Greek oligarchy stand up to the EU technocracy and strike fear into the hearts of investors around the world   Greece leaves behind catastrophic austerity it leaves behind fear and authoritarianism it leaves behind five years of humiliation and anguish he proclaimed to a throng of supporters on election day in 
JUL8	Farewell Kate Hoey, the wild Brexiteer who never let the facts get in the way	So long Kate Hoey It s been a blast In the way that being hit by shrapnel might be Labour s MP for Vauxhall has finally announced she will not stand as a candidate for the party in the next election Hoey is an ardent Brexiteer and has voted consistently with the government on Europe Vauxhall constituents voted almost remain Thank you for the memories Kate We will do our best to forget them  I do feel that with the name Hoey it isn t particularly prudent to put yourself about a lot but she made a hobby of hanging out in random parties She especially liked socialising with Nigel Farage I really don t think Nigel Farage is a racist she has said of a man who literally once blamed traffic on immigrants Perhaps the nadir was when she joined him on that infamous Brexit flotilla which at the time I thought was the most absurd thing we would ever see in British politics but which since seems the equivalent of looking through a pinhole camera ie we actually only glimpsed a snippet of the full damaging fury of it all 
JUL8	I ran a bookies for 12 years – they deserve no sympathy for these store closures	Since the introduction of fixed odds betting terminals FOBTs in UK bookmakers have contributed towards increasing social degradation in our communities I ve seen it happen during my years as a bookmaker branch manager Gambling has always been a vice for people with either enough disposable income that only the winning counts or for those drawn in by the promise of quick financial gain But there is something sinister about FOBTs in that they have increased access to quick winnings or losses on the high street creating an environment more like a miniature casino  More training time was given to the launch of a new FOBT product than to social responsibility awareness
JUL8	Want to know what a Boris Johnson government would look like? I have just the book	Seven years ago a group of Conservative MPs who had taken their parliamentary seats in brought out a slim manifesto for the future of Britain titled Britannia Unchained Kwasi Kwarteng Priti Patel Dominic Raab Chris Skidmore and Liz Truss appeared to speak with one voice that of unabashed Thatcherites convinced that hacking back tax and regulation and fixating on the demands of business was as appropriate for the st century UK as it supposedly had been for the crisis plagued Britain of the s  Some of the text was so provocative that it read like trolling The British are among the worst idlers in the world read one passage We work among the lowest hours we retire early and our productivity is poor Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen the British are more interested in football and pop music To even start to compete with the rising economies of India China and Brazil said the authors we need to avenge the dependency culture and stop indulging in irrelevant debates about sharing the pie between manufacturing and services the north and the south women and men They advised fellow Conservatives to double down on austerity and maintain their faith in old fashioned laissez faire economics 
JUL8	How can Kim Darroch represent Britain in Trump’s Washington now?	Uniquely dysfunctional incompetent unpredictable faction riven diplomatically clumsy inept That is Donald Trump s Washington according to Britain s ambassador Sir Kim Darroch Or is it perhaps Theresa May s London according to the US s ambassador to London Woody Johnson The difference is that we know the first but not the second  Leak inquiries like that now ordered into the Darroch memorandum are Whitehall s most fatuous blood sport They seldom find culprits and serve merely to magnify the original embarrassment Usually the damage has been done Diplomacy is about appearances and not much else It is hard to see how Darroch can continue to lobby effectively on Britain s behalf in Trump s Washington not least for highly implausible trade concessions post Brexit 
JUL8	No wonder UK universities are failing on racism – most don’t value diversity at all	A frequent complaint levelled at universities is that they are ivory towers disconnected from the challenges of day to day life For a particular constituency within those respected walls black and minority ethnic BME students and staff it s a label that is no doubt more than a little ironic  White men continue to hold the majority of senior positions within universities What is a more apt encapsulation of the stubborn resolve to maintain the status quo than the phallic symbol of an ivory tower 
JUL8	Amazon is 25 – let’s burst its birthday balloon	As any hormonal Catholic teenage boy knows it s perfectly possible to believe something is a grievous sin and yet repeatedly almost compulsively do it anyway Almost of the UK population should know the feeling with the main difference that any guilt is more justly deserved That s how many of us knowingly and willingly buy from a company that has a terrible record on employee terms and working conditions avoids paying tax as much as possible and shares responsibility for boarded up shops in decimated high streets across the country  That company Amazon is years old I m not sorry for pooping its party Nor will Amazon be worried about the dearth of warm birthday wishes It s always the winner in its year round game of pass the parcel and every day it gets a bigger and bigger slice of the world s wealth cake 
JUL8	In Somalia, the climate emergency is already here. The world cannot ignore it	The climate emergency is wreaking havoc across the world and it is the poorest countries that bear the brunt of the crisis In Somalia where I am acting country director for the aid agency Islamic Relief the population is currently experiencing a drought that could threatenthe lives or livelihoods of more than two million people by the end of the summer according to the UN  The climate has been wreaking havoc on Somalia s seasons Ordinarily there are four the main rainy season between April and June gu the second rainy season between October and December deyr and the dry seasons that follow each of them Two thirds of the country s population live in rural areas and are completely dependent on the rains for their crops and livestock Last year these people were set back when the deyr season produced less rain than usual And again this year the gu rains almost failed eventually arriving in tiny pockets of the country too little too late This has led to widespread crop failure and a decline in livestock production rapidly pushing communities in the worst affected areas into food insecurity 
JUL9	Boris Johnson shows he'll be most ill-qualified PM of modern times	Tuesday night s televised debate on ITV between Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson is the only chance the public will get to see the two candidates to succeed Theresa May argue their points head to head But it won t change anything  It had been delayed by Johnson s team until the ballot papers had already gone out and in many cases already been filled in There is plenty of evidence that the Conservative members a tiny proportion of the whole UK electorate have long ago decided to put Johnson in No some of them joined the party specifically for that purpose 
JUL9	Britain is heading for a general election reboot, but it’s not going to fix Brexit	Have you tried turning it off and on again The technique that IT engineers always advise for reviving an unresponsive computer might soon be applied to the problem of impasse in Westminster  In constitutional terms that means an election Few MPs like the idea and none are sure what the trigger might be But most struggle to imagine things carrying on much longer in the current deadlocked parliament The next Tory leader let s roll with the polling and presume it is Boris Johnson will not have a reliable majority on any matter of substance If he tries to pursue a no deal Brexit he could lose a confidence vote 
JUL9	Labour urgently needs an independent process to root out antisemitism	The ugliness of the Labour party resorting to the tactics of non disclosure agreements NDAs akin to those seeking to cover up wrongdoing in big business or sexual harassment by the powerful is the stark new element in this ongoing story  The recent Williamson Willsman and Campbell cases demonstrate that the party s disciplinary process is shot to pieces
JUL9	The secret of a happy summer with your children? Know when to cave in	Yesterday was a good day I caved on the Gatorade one blue one red when really they should have shared a single bottle but held the line on the Skittles After the park we went for pizza at the usual place and I stayed firm on water at the table no fruit punch in spite of my deal with the waitress to secretly dilute it  And then this small triumph ice cream from the van on the way home yes But two bites in when one of them changed her mind about which ice cream she wanted and the other predictably dropped hers on the ground and wanted a replacement Fight gentlemen of England Fight bold yeomen I did not give way 
JUL9	Don’t blame senior doctors. The NHS pensions standoff is politicians’ fault	Everyone loves to hate a fat cat And so in when former chancellor George Osborne decided to reduce pension tax relief for very high earners he must have thought he was on to a sure thing After all with a UK average household income of only who would ever complain about the fate of people so indecently well paid they could afford to set aside up to a year in pension contributions  Three years on Osborne s slam dunk strategy for bolstering the exchequer s coffers is wreaking havoc on the NHS Something as arcane and tedious as pension tax law is threatening to increase waiting lists lengthen delays in starting cancer treatment and endanger the lives of NHS patients 
JUL9	Planting trees can help save the planet – but only if governments put people first	A new study extols the mindblowing potential of widespread tree planting as a solution to climate breakdown The scientists claim that bn hectares of treeless land could be forested an area equivalent to the size of the US and the study s authors say restoration of such areas could remove two thirds gigatonnes of all the carbon dioxide emissions pumped into the atmosphere by human activities since the s  A number of organisations and scientists are investigating these nature based climate solutions While studies show different levels of ambition and potential all are clear that carefully restored ecosystems can help solve three interlinked crises the climate crisis biodiversity loss and poverty For climate the most urgent priority to meet the goal of keeping global heating below C is decarbonising the economy but restoring our forests grasslands and wetlands plus enhancing soil health could provide part of the solution to the climate crisis Land restoration and stewardship can both help stabilise the Earth s climate by storing carbon and provide ecosystems critical for wildlife forests mangroves wetlands and coral reefs This can also benefit local communities particularly in emerging regions of the global south least responsible for this crisis and already suffering most severely from the impacts 
JUL9	I didn’t ring a bell at the end of my cancer treatment. But I get those who do	No one offered me the chance to ring a bell on the final day of my cancer treatment but if they had I d have declined All I wanted to do after three operations and six weeks of radiotherapy was walk out of that hospital door and head off up the street to the life I d had on hold and even at times felt might be in the balance Now I had it back my sole ambition was to return to what I d had as unobtrusively as possible  You have to find a way to cope and since we re all different each of us finds our own way of doing that
JUL9	Casual racism is a fact of life for international students – they deserve better	 The international students never mingle Their English is terrible I hate walking behind international students because they walk so slow These are just a few of the phrases I ve heard while I have been at university I was surprised by the amount of subtle racism I encountered when I arrived three years ago to a place that I thought was going to be liberal inclusive and universal Yet racism towards international students is rarely acknowledged  As a British Chinese person at university I quickly realised that people always assumed me to be an international student even though I grew up in Rugby Warwickshire 
JUL9	A mental health diagnosis is only a start. It can never tell a patient's story	Who decides whether you re clinically depressed or anxious suffering from schizophrenia or living with a trauma related disorder In the UK GPs diagnose milder forms of depression and anxiety but psychiatrists make the call when it comes to more severe and protracted forms of mental ill health In the US the handbook that sets out the criteria for diagnosis is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders now in its fifth incarnation DSM In Europe the broadly similar WHO International Classification of Diseases ICD is more commonly used  But a new study from the University of Liverpool has analysed five key chapters of the DSM on schizophrenia bipolar disorder and depressive anxiety and trauma related disorders and found so much scope for variation that the authors question whether diagnosing distinct mental health disorders such as schizophrenia is valid or helpful at all 
JUL9	In jumping in with Boris Johnson, even moderate Tories have lost all credibility	Look how they do it The Tory party its fellow travellers its mighty backers all with a deep financial interest in keeping Conservatives in power gather round as their new leader emerges from that tiny group of elderly white male selectors See the wagons circling Forget any alarm they ever expressed about a Boris Johnson prime ministership Come the day watch them pay homage to their latest protector from the red peril  Even though none not one during the referendum mentioned the remotest possibility of a no deal Brexit almost all the Tory tribe are ready to pretend this is now the true will of the people singing in blue harmony Any doubters are whipped in by the great British press foghorn Tory backing 
JUL10	Kim Darroch has resigned. Now Britain risks becoming a vassal of the US	The chief of Britain s Foreign Office does nothing casually He is a past master at saying nothing unintended in public So when the Foreign Office permanent secretary Simon McDonald went before MPs this lunchtime after the devastating resignation of Britain s Washington ambassador Kim Darroch his incisive directness was a revelation It was the most eloquent evidence possible that the Darroch affair is not just a diplomatic storm but an existential challenge to Britain s entire foreign policy  What precedent was there the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat asked McDonald straight off for the head of state of a friendly government to do what Donald Trump has done this week and make it impossible for Britain s senior representative in that country to do his job McDonald s answer was monosyllabic crisp and explosive None he said 
JUL10	My partner, Lyra Mckee, would be overjoyed about the same-sex marriage bill	It won t always be like this It s going to get better My incredible partner Lyra McKee wrote these words years before we crossed paths I remember reading her letter to my year old self and being blown away by her bravery Lyra opened up about the deep hurt so many of us felt as teenagers and showed that families can be incredibly loving supportive and accepting particularly important in a place like Northern Ireland where religious divides and conservatism still play a huge role  Lyra was terrified anxious and in a weird way lucky She knew her mind from a young age was surrounded by friends from her area who mostly turned out to be LGBT themselves and had a family for whom her sexuality was not an issue Some of us me take a lot longer to realise their true self When Lyra wrote her letter in the idea of same sex marriage in Northern Ireland was almost preposterous 
JUL10	John Major’s threat to take Boris Johnson to court is a true act of public service	Twenty six years after he was caught by a hot mic denouncing the Eurosceptic bastards in his own cabinet John Major has proved that he has not lost his knack for making news and this time he very much knew the microphone was on  The former Tory prime minister told the Today programme that any move to prorogue or suspend parliament in order to drive through a no deal crash out from the European Union a move Boris Johnson has pointedly refused to rule out would be completely and utterly against parliamentary tradition adding that I for one would be prepared to go and seek judicial review to prevent parliament being bypassed In other words a former Tory PM just threatened to take the next Tory PM to court to stop a no deal Brexit 
JUL10	The tyranny of the schoolgirl skirt still haunts me	With gender reveals ostentatious events to announce the sex of an unborn baby with a burst of pink or blue becoming increasingly popular while at the same time unisex clothing is on the rise on the high street it is difficult to tell how far we have got in terms of dismantling the gender binary This week it feels as if we may be making gains by September new statutory guidance will make school uniforms in Wales gender neutral meaning that items such as trousers for example will not be described as for boys  Gender specific school uniforms are one of the earliest most tangible ways in which gender inequality is entrenched There is a reason girls are permitted to wear shorts for PE skirts and summer dresses inhibit young girls in the playground and restrict their freedom to play in the same way as their male peers It is an unconscious marker of limitation if you climb the monkey bars in these clothes you ll flash your knickers to the class so don t climb them 
JUL10	Where is the outrage about the Tory party’s Islamophobia?	What Tory members think matters Their party is in government They select parliamentary candidates who go on to vote on legislation and become ministers and they exert pressure on them through local Conservative associations They are now electing the nation s prime minister So when evidence of racism is uncovered among their ranks it should be regarded as a national scandal  Recent polls conducted for Hope Not Hate by YouGov which has a solid record when looking at party members is horrifying It found that of Tory members believe Islam is generally a threat to western civilisation with less than one in five dissenting that hold it to be generally a threat to the British way of life and do not want a Muslim as prime minister Two thirds believe the lie that parts of Britain are under sharia law another believe in the racist nonsense that there are no go areas for non Muslims and want to limit Britain s Muslim population Among the most chilling findings was that believe having people from a wide variety of racial and cultural backgrounds has damaged British society with just dissenting 
JUL10	Workplace flexibility has its limits – bend too far and something breaks	Now that the election has been won suddenly employer groups and the government are talking up the need for industrial relations reform It is a push that inevitably is for more flexibility But as the latest annual data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on labour force participation mobility and job search reveals this increased flexibility is a major driver of the current historically high levels of underemployment and the associated low wages growth  One of the things that is often forgotten amid the monthly unemployment rates is that for the most part people who are in work stay in work and also mostly stay working at the same place In the months to February this year fewer than of all people employed changed employers well below the record highs of the late s early s 
JUL10	We need to redefine what ‘working class’ really means	What makes a person working class Being northern Working in a factory Being a plumber Being white Voting Brexit If you watch TV or read a newspaper you will probably think all of the above Unless you re actually working class that is From David Dimbleby declaring on the night of the EU referendum result that working class votes were the decisive factor in the Brexit referendum wrong to TV dramas depicting the lazy and criminal the mythology built about working class people is wide ranging and often damaging This is important because if we see class as purely about culture we ignore the role of the economy the state or community  New research on low income Londoners from the Centre for Labour and Social Studies and the Runnymede Trust found that while just over half identified as working class almost all shared what could be described as a working class experience On the negative side this included feelings of being dehumanised by impersonal public services and excluded by gentrification Social mobility didn t work for many in a system rigged for privilege However there are signs of community led solidarity 
JUL10	Individuals can’t solve the climate crisis. Governments need to step up	From climate change to child labour the responsibility for solving major societal problems is increasingly being shifted to the individual People feel in order to save the world they have to be good Yet that is bad because it paralyses change Global challenges must be tackled by institutions That s why the UK s Committee on Climate Change was absolutely right to criticise the government in the strongest terms today for failing to take more action against the climate crisis   Personal sacrifice alone cannot be the solution to tackling the climate crisis There s no other area in which the individual is held so responsible for what s going wrong And it s true people drive too much eat too much meat and fly too often 
JUL10	It's not just tennis players – grunters are everywhere. And they're not to be trusted	When the umpire at Wimbledon calls out quiet please a religious hush falls over the court The only things that break the silence are the gentle pop of a bouncing tennis ball the faint murmur of the crowd and the passionate grunting of the players  Grunting is a strange quirk of professional tennis but it s also quite common among the rest of us Visit your local gym and you will find people groaning during their workout Many have shared an office with a person who groans as they hammer away at their keyboard One friend complained about how her husband would grunt as he struggled with boxes she would lift in silence Perhaps the strangest story I heard was about archaeologists who would habitually grunt in the midst of over enthusiastic soil clearing 
JUL10	Ethnic diversity makes Britain’s culture great. It would be a disaster if we lost it	A couple of weeks ago a young black man from south London stood up in front of tens of thousands of people and delivered one of the most celebrated performances in the history of Glastonbury A few days later an England cricket squad almost half of whom were born abroad or are from an ethnic minority background made it into the semi finals of the World Cup Meanwhile over at Tate Modern a British artist of Nigerian origin is displaying an artwork made up of thousands of books imprinted with the names of migrants who have made significant contributions to British culture  Today some of our most brilliant prospects in art and culture are from minority ethnic or migrant backgrounds We present a gloriously multicultural face to the world And that is important not just for the story we tell to others but for the stories we tell ourselves Think of the cultural power of the first Asian families on EastEnders the breakthrough of Soul II Soul in the s or the nation defining literary output of Zadie Smith 
JUL11	Trump created a storm over Kim Darroch. Boris Johnson will bring a hurricane	Imagine chaos Dream disruption Think of a hundred Kim Darrochs as the Boris Johnson moment approaches Tear up the script Shout no deal Laugh with Johnson cry with him Welcome to anarchy hall  Even as a stubborn Eurosceptic I can see no conceivable benefit in Britain leaving Europe s economic area on October least of all without any sort of customs deal For a nation to initiate controls on border movement and trade with its adjacent continent is mindless self harm in this case driven by populist machismo Yet that is what both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have agreed to countenance after this week s leadership debate 
JUL11	Parliamentarians shouldn’t need CCTV in Westminster ‘groping hotspots’ to behave	Perhaps until this week you d forgotten that Westminster has been plagued by questions about its working culture It would be understandable between Brexit Trump and the implosion of the Labour party it takes something exceptional for news editors to care again about gropy MPs or bullying lords It s too much of a story an editor friend sighed to me about a harassment case her boss chose not to cover  This week two more major reports about harassment in Westminster have been published one by Naomi Ellenbogen QC into bullying and harassment of House of Lords staff the other by Gemma White QC into that of MPs staff Perhaps some of the content will still shock you of Lords staff have been bullied in the past year before you even add sexual harassment into the stat MPs staff repeatedly use the word career suicide when discussing why they don t make complaints But to those of us who have made complaints it is all too familiar 
JUL11	I know from painful experience how poisonous the debate around obesity is	The debate around obesity has been rekindled recently following proclamations by Tory leadership candidates but many commentators who speak on the subject seem to have no sensitivity to how the language or imagery they use fuels hurtful perceptions that obese people are lazy inhuman or a burden The mass of statistics being thrown around dehumanises individuals many of whom already know what to do and are trying their best to do it  Should foods with high sugar content be taxed more Boris Johnson who looks certain to be our next prime minister doesn t seem to think so And he has boldly called for a review even though there is already one under way 
JUL11	A progressive, united Ireland seems more likely than ever – thanks to the DUP	It s an odd time for the DUP Having spent the past two years backing the government on a Brexit that a majority of Northern Irish citizens voted against it now finds support for Irish reunification at its highest ever level in Northern Ireland the Irish Republic and crucially among their supposed ideological fellow travellers in the Conservative party More pressingly still MPs this week voted to extend crucial human rights to Northern Ireland direct from Westminster paving the way for the decriminalisation of abortion and the implementation of marriage equality in line with the rest of the UK  How did a party as frothingly opposed to liberal social change as it is to Irish reunification end up presiding over a reality in which both are more likely than they have been in decades 
JUL11	Goats get emotional? Humans shouldn't be surprised – all mammals are amazing	Wicksteed Park in Kettering is not known for its miracles but on that day it was if a holy statue was weeping blood Within minutes of the incredible event beginning a great crowd coalesced The elderly and infirm got out of their chairs Children were put on shoulders There were gasps There was awe I can tell you what happened but you may prefer to sit down first Because two weeks ago almost to the day a goat in this small town theme park climbed a tree in its enclosure But goats can t climb trees came the murmurs from the crowd What is it doing they asked with confused astonishment I watched with great delight These people clearly had an idea of what a goat is and what a goat does and were being met with a new reality where goats could also happily climb trees a behaviour goats regularly employ in the wild to find the juiciest leaves To the people of Kettering who were not aware of tree climbing goats it was as if they were looking at a flying monkey  I was reminded of this incredible scene when hearing of this week s news that goats have been shown capable of distinguishing emotions in one another s bleating calls If you haven t yet heard it s a neatly designed experiment Researchers recorded goat calls when goats were at their happiest feeding and being reunited with other goats and recorded calls when goats were at their most fraught watching others eat but having to go without food temporarily They then played back these calls to other goats to see if happy or sad goat sounds caused physiological responses in the listening goat specifically by measuring the listener s heart rates And hey presto the results proved the link When listening to happy calls for instance a goat s heart rate increases with apparent excitement Not only can it climb trees a goat can listen and learn about its surroundings by tuning into the bleating of other goats 
JUL11	I'm supposed to be a mentor but I am jealous of his perfect chakras	My colleague Michael Safi was finishing his stint as the Guardian s India correspondent having covered the world s biggest election the Sri Lankan mosque attacks the Delhi climate emergency and the plight of members of the country s lowest caste the Dalits  Yet in his three years as south Asia correspondent he had never discovered his dosha 
JUL11	The US-UK 'special relationship' isn't broken – it's just entering a dangerous new phase	The dumpster fires of US and UK politics have converged and the special relationship is going up in flames  The resignation of Kim Darroch UK ambassador to the US and a longtime British civil servant because of a temper tantrum by Donald Trump is an illustration of the toxic politics of both countries and the real damage it is doing to the US UK alliance 
JUL11	For the sake of cinema, Disney needs to be broken up	It s the kind of commercial supremacy about which Walt Disney and his brother Roy probably fantasised when they founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in just past the midway mark of the year s four top grossing films in US cinemas are all Disney releases The same would apply globally but for the disruption of Chinese sci fi blockbuster The Wandering Earth  The four films in question Avengers Endgame Captain Marvel Aladdin and Toy Story have collectively grossed more than bn worldwide with the studio s noisily hyped remake of The Lion King set to join their ranks and substantially boost that number next week More money spinning sequels Frozen Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker and Maleficent Mistress of Evil lie in wait for autumn and winter 
JUL11	Labour won’t just end austerity, it will enrich people’s lives	As the Conservative party s leadership election descends into an ugly no deal Brexit competition it is fair to say that there hasn t been much serious discussion about what the Tories want a post Brexit Britain to look like There has been the usual s style obsession with swingeing tax cuts and some back of a cigarette packet attempts to reverse some of the cuts that both of the contenders voted for but it s been left to others to talk about the harsh realities faced by millions  A report There is an Alternative which was published last week by the IPPR thinktank brought a welcome blast of cold air to anyone who thought austerity had come to an end as Theresa May promised it had last year The authors lay bare the deficit in care which has terrible consequences for those who need it and their loved ones who are often having to fill the gap themselves 
JUL11	The BBC’s Panorama set out claims of antisemitism in the Labour party. Our panel responds	Those who Labour s high command refers to as outriders have been out and about on Twitter busily doing precisely what a memo of guidance suggested they should seeking to counter the BBC Panorama investigation of Labour antisemitism Most viewers though may well have a very different reaction to what they saw on the programme which was a group of young committed servants of the Labour party so distressed by what they witnessed being done by the top brass of the party they loved that they were driven to despair depression and in the case of the onetime head of disputes Sam Matthews contemplation of suicide  Perhaps at last Labour party members will find this too much to stomach Perhaps those who were not moved by the testimony of Jews who dismissed Jewish anxieties about antisemitism within Labour as lies as smears as mood music as attempts to weaken Jeremy Corbyn who believed Jews uniquely among ethnic minorities could not be trusted when pointing out the racism they faced perhaps those people will listen instead to the voices of the whistleblowers who showing great courage spoke to Panorama 
JUL12	Ruining a country near you soon: the beta males who think they’re alphas	If the Tory leadership election unfolds as widely expected the UK will basically be ruled by a Fathers Injustice activist Boris Johnson is the kind of guy who d don Spider Man pyjamas and scale a building in order to see less of his kids Sorry fewer Even so he remains a remarkably typical hero of our political times There are two kinds of women Harry explains at one point in When Harry Met Sally High maintenance and low maintenance Which one am I Sally asks You re the worst kind he says You re high maintenance but you think you re low maintenance  In many ways there can be no greater therapist s case study than Trump
JUL12	The roots of Labour’s antisemitism lie deep within the populist left	In Britain we sometimes imagine that populism lurks in our future or over there in Donald Trump s America or Viktor Orb n s Hungary Even those who are alarmed by the prospect of populist politics and all it entails take comfort that we re not there yet that it s still some time or distance away But what if that s wrong What if it s already here  If populism is a politics that pits the virtuous mass of ordinary people against a wicked corrupt elite then Britain was an early adopter The leave campaign won in by suggesting the noble British people had been cheated of their democratic birthright by the evil bureaucrats of Brussels Now the Brexit party offers textbook populism railing against an establishment bent on thwarting the will of the people 
JUL12	The angry chef or the Michelin guide: which giant ego are you rooting for?	Marc Veyrat a French chef and Bob Dylan lookalike he s as famous for his Michelin starred cooking as he is for his wide rimmed black hat has been in the news this week Or rather to do him justice he s gone full tilt Gordon Ramsay in the news this week  In January the Michelin Guide demoted his Haute Savoie restaurant La Maison des Bois in Manigod He became as he put it the only chef in history to get a third star one year and lose it the very next And the six months since have been a living hell A few weeks ago he texted texted the French weekly Le Point saying Hello call me back please it s urgent And when they did he proceeded to relay in great indeed in operatic detail quite how awful the fallout has been 
JUL12	Megan Rapinoe’s ‘egotism’ is the perfect antidote to Donald Trump	This week it has been gratifying to watch Americans specifically American men grapple on social media with a concept long cherished by the British as a thing we love to hate If our characters are organised as much around that which we despise as revere it is safe to say that the ancient British revulsion for Being Up Oneself is a central force in national life that until this week many Americans claimed to find mystifying And then along came Megan Rapinoe  Traditionally in the United States being up oneself has been a default attitude practically enshrined in the constitution As an American you are obliged to at least pay lip service to the idea that anything is possible and all that stands between you and your dreams is your own winning hustle Self deprecation that sly old song of Europe is neither appreciated nor understood There is no integrity in the US in hiding one s light 
JUL12	The UK must stand up to Trump over Iran	Not for the first time nor certainly the last the Gulf is a veritable tinderbox The immediate reason for the increase in tensions is the Royal Marines seizure of an Iranian tanker that was allegedly en route to Syria in violation of EU sanctions Rather than defuse the situation the Tory leadership contender and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt was quick to resort to sabre rattling and a reassertion of British militarism on the high seas For some Iranians this reawakens bitter memories of the UK s infamous oil blockade in the early s culminating in the overthrow of the popular prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh The very same prime minister who dared to nationalise the Anglo Iranian Oil Company better known today as BP In any case what with seized ships in the Mediterranean and trouble in the Strait of Hormuz there is a danger of missing the wood for the trees in explaining what has brought about this crisis  The nature of Trump s endgame is anyone s guess He most likely has little idea himself
JUL12	Of course Boris Johnson wants a royal yacht. He’s the king of fake-it-till-you-make-it	Boris Johnson has no policies it appears beyond tax cuts for the rich and oh optimism Act happy Act big He wants the Queen to have a great big yacht At a hustings last night he burbled on about the royal yacht One of the things that all wings of the Labour party can agree on is that it was a good thing to decommission HMY Britannia in If the royal family wants a yacht it has more than enough dosh to buy its own  Johnson of course doesn t see it that way Nor does the newspaper that pays him a quarter of a million pounds a year The Telegraph has campaigned for a new royal yacht and Johnson has argued in the Commons before about it It was regretful he said in that this was not a priority for Theresa May s government 
JUL12	Syriza’s defeat shows the left needs a plan to hold on to power, not just win it	The day after Jeremy Corbyn scraped together the parliamentarians names he needed to get on the Labour leadership ballot in he headed off in search of voters We didn t have a campaign We didn t have an organisation We didn t have any money he told me All we had was my credit card and that lasted for about a week  He stood so that at least one candidate would make the argument that Labour should oppose austerity and shift to the left No one ever expected him to win that argument least of all him But as the rallies grew unions came on board and his polling numbers soared the implausible started to look inevitable 
JUL12	Britain needs a calm and assured prime minister. It needs Jeremy Hunt	It wasn t supposed to be like this Like most Conservatives I wanted Brexit wrapped up and out of the way under Theresa May s stewardship allowing a new leader to begin a new chapter reinvigorate the party and at long last change the subject  So much for that Far from drawing a line under the unhappy recent history of British politics the new prime minister will face exactly the same problem as his predecessor He will also face the same parliamentary maths and apparently despite the personnel changes in Brussels the same stance from the EU The first question on the minds of many Conservative party members as they ponder over their ballot papers then will be who is finally going to get Brexit signed sealed and delivered 
JUL12	Amber Rudd is further proof that the idea of compassionate Tories is a myth	Oh Amber Rudd how could you A paragon of Tory moderation a solid bulwark against the rampaging Tory right a torchbearer for Remainia and one nation Toryism and one of our saviours against the self inflicted disaster of no deal now a champion of a hard Brexit Surely these are malicious rumours just weeks ago you were described as the cabinet s leading pro European and were apparently leading the battle against a drunk and disorderly exit from the EU  Sure you ve always had your foibles consistently voting for all Brexit legislation slashing and decimating public services and the welfare state deporting refugees but let he who has not stripped disabled people of benefits cast the first stone 
JUL12	Trump’s summit shows he needs the tech giants as much as they need him	Yesterday Donald Trump convened a summit at the White House its remit a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today s online environment But of course it was Trump It was never going to be a dry sober policy event  Joining him was a constellation of people from the world of the alt right alternative media and conspiracy theorising 
JUL13	Narcissists and cliques control the main parties and threaten democracy	Party democracy is the enemy of representative democracy Party democracy stops MPs speaking out against racism and warning of the perils facing their country Party democracy makes politicians put their members ahead of their constituents Party democracy makes them flatter coteries of arrogant obsessives Party democracy is the enemy of conscience and judgment To borrow a phrase the party has become the enemy of the people  Who does your MP represent Who are they frightened of You and your neighbours What creaking haycart brought you and the rest of your yokel friends into town Control of politics has passed to unelected and irresponsible members says the historian Robert Saunders one of the best analysts of British democracy s decay Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt needs the support of about Tory members to become prime minister That s roughly the size of one parliamentary constituency 
JUL13	So, guys, you reckon you could take a point off Serena Williams?	Let us for a minute extend the benefit of the doubt to the of men who believe they could take a point from Serena Williams in a tennis match no doubt further emboldened by her defeat in the Wimbledon final  For who can say what manner of fugue state they fell into as they answered a simple polling question Could they have collectively imagined as they pictured the holder of grand slam titles shaping up to serve a freak calamity overtaking her A sinkhole opening up on her side of the net perhaps or a thunderbolt sent by a jealous athletic god or in more sinister fashion a tripwire rigged up by an incel saboteur to fell her as she rushed in for the volley 
JUL13	Johnson failed Kim Darroch abysmally. He doesn’t deserve to choose his replacement	I can think of no previous occasion where an ambassador or for that matter a minister has had to resign because he has told the truth rather than because he has told a lie in the performance of his public duties That has been the fate of Kim Darroch There are three people responsible for the loss to the UK of a hugely competent professional and honourable public servant  The first person who should hang his or her head in shame is whoever was responsible for the leak in the first place Whatever the motive it was a treacherous and indefensible act of disloyalty 
JUL13	How can you accept gay people, but find it distasteful that they have sex?	The number of people believing there is nothing wrong with gay sex has fallen for the first time since the Aids crisis The British Social Attitudes survey puts it at dipping from in to in leaving a third of the population in some way opposed NatCen who conducted the survey said that while further polling was advisable liberalisation of attitudes does seem to be slowing down  The findings coincide with the first decrease in more than a decade of people comfortable with pre marital sex On the plus side last week also saw the Commons victory for gay legislation in Northern Ireland Still what a hammering same sex couples have had recently everything from attacks on buses to Ann Widdecombe the Aunt Lydia of Brexit anyone pondering how science could produce an answer to gayness In this context is the NatCen survey indicative of new attitudes or yet more evidence that people are feeling bolder about expressing previously veiled prejudices 
JUL13	Would any woman want to be alone with Robert Foster now?	It was a decision said Mississippi state representative Robert Foster made out of respect for my wife The politician and gubernatorial candidate had said that a female journalist who had interviewed him many times before would be allowed to spend the day on a campaign trail ride along with him only if she brought along a male chaperone His own campaign director acknowledged that it was a weird thing to ask The journalist Mississippi Today s Larrison Campbell refused and called it sexist The ride along did not happen  The inevitable outrage dissolved into an inevitable liberal left and religious right bunfight No wonder everything about this story bar Campbell s ability to argue with an articulate conviction that Foster s decision barely deserved is terrible During his many interviews Foster tried various methods of justifying his refusal to be alone with a professional woman doing her job It made me wonder if he has the same stringent policy when it comes to dentists doctors plumbers even Does he ask for a new cab if it arrives with a female driver Manufacturers take note religious extremists may now be an untapped market for driverless vehicles 
JUL13	Spider-Man is showing our boys that normal guys can be heroes too	Not all superheroes wear capes But if they come in many guises what they tend to have in common is a desire to save the world And that s what makes the new Spider Man movie so interesting here is a superhero who would rather do almost anything else He has the godlike powers the suit the crowds gasping in adoration He has a monster to fight and this being a Marvel movie a standing invitation to join the Avengers and turn the gig into a full time job  But what he really wants is to have a life instead The teenage Peter Parker just wants to hang out in Europe on a school trip spend time with the girl he awkwardly admires from afar and be a normal guy doing normal stuff rather than carrying the world on his shoulders 
JUL13	Ruining a country near you soon: the beta males who think they’re alphas	If the Tory leadership election unfolds as widely expected the UK will basically be ruled by a Fathers Injustice activist Boris Johnson is the kind of guy who d don Spider Man pyjamas and scale a building in order to see less of his kids Sorry fewer Even so he remains a remarkably typical hero of our political times There are two kinds of women Harry explains at one point in When Harry Met Sally High maintenance and low maintenance Which one am I Sally asks You re the worst kind he says You re high maintenance but you think you re low maintenance  In many ways there can be no greater therapist s case study than Trump
JUL13	What Love Island teaches us about 'himpathy'	You might be surprised to learn that Love Island is shedding light on contemporary developments in feminist philosophy You might also be surprised that philosophers are avid watchers of reality television  But the ITV show gives us a unique opportunity to observe the relationships of somethings from their beginnings to the point where they flourish and often break apart With these glimpses of human behaviour albeit in the context of a television show we can get an insight into how many women act particularly at the end of a relationship 
JUL13	The roots of Labour’s antisemitism lie deep within the populist left	In Britain we sometimes imagine that populism lurks in our future or over there in Donald Trump s America or Viktor Orb n s Hungary Even those who are alarmed by the prospect of populist politics and all it entails take comfort that we re not there yet that it s still some time or distance away But what if that s wrong What if it s already here  If populism is a politics that pits the virtuous mass of ordinary people against a wicked corrupt elite then Britain was an early adopter The leave campaign won in by suggesting the noble British people had been cheated of their democratic birthright by the evil bureaucrats of Brussels Now the Brexit party offers textbook populism railing against an establishment bent on thwarting the will of the people

JUL14	Labour can effect positive change, but not while its internal politics are so toxic	After a long tumble into disgrace and confusion that dates back well over a year the story playing out at the top of the Labour party increasingly seems to be so dreadful that it defies belief Jeremy Corbyn is doing a very good impression of someone who would rather be anywhere else The party s supposed leap forward on Brexit policy seems to have resulted in a stance not quite as bamboozling as the one it replaced but it is still surrounded by unanswered questions the leadership s dearth of collective energy as the agenda of a Boris Johnson government takes shape is miserable to behold Obviously the people at the top have other things on their minds Woven into everything is the ever widening story about antisemitism which now includes signifiers for almost every aspect of the party s malaise from the presence in the party of hateful attitudes towards Jewish people through allegations of the awful treatment of young party staffers by powerful people at the top to the sense of any sensitivity and seriousness now being drowned out by the familiar sound of belligerence and faction fighting  All too often anti imperialists seem to keep the company of very rum people indeed
JUL14	A decade after my mother’s murder, fear still reigns in Chechnya	Aged eight I have a nightmare Russian soldiers are breaking down the door of our flat Mum and I run into the sunlit living room A hand grabs me roughly and yanks me away from my mother causing a sharp pain in my elbow Her screams echo in my ears but I can t utter a word Then I hear a cry so heart rending that it turns into a hoarse rattle Lana I m forced on to my knees in the dark corridor Please please spare her I beg before hearing a shot No more screams I slowly look up at a soldier but I can t see his face Just kill me I whisper and hear another shot There is a sharp pain in my chest and I feel myself going Then I wake up  My home was in Chechnya and my mother was Natalya Estemirova a human rights activist and we were at war with Russia The reason the war started always confused me The general consensus was that it was a war for independence but even as a child I felt that it was more complicated than that Listening to Mum s conversations was no good it was like tuning into a TV series halfway through Dudaev Raduev Udugov Lebed Maskhadov Shamanov those names jumped out of her mouth like secret spells Some of them were more familiar than others 
JUL14	The cult of optimism got us into this mess. It’s time to embrace pessimism	When historians write the last pages of their books and the producers of history documentaries sit down to edit the final minutes of their programmes there is often a strong urge to look to the future and emphasise the positive That impulse is at its most acute when the subject of the book or documentary in question is British history  The classic formulation is something along the lines of Britain and her institutions are remarkably adaptable the nation has survived two world wars and endured the loss of empire we will surely cope with whatever the future has in store roll credits press send everyone down the pub 
JUL14	Where are the politicians with principles they would stand down for?	In her swansong appearances at the dispatch box Theresa May is endeavouring to get in touch with her funny side She recently tried mocking Jeremy Corbyn by quoting Groucho Marx Those are my principles and if you don t like them well I have others  I expect most of the public take the Groucho view of politicians In my experience though it is not true to say that their principles are endlessly mutable Rather what most politicians have is a hierarchy of convictions of varying degrees of flexibility 
JUL14	Spoiler alert: it’s getting harder to keep plot lines from readers	 I can t be the only one in the boat on this complained a reader about separate newspaper interviews in which actors discussed the fates of characters they had played in two immensely popular television series Game of Thrones and Line of Duty Don t click the hyperlinks in this article if you are in the same boat In the reader s view There s now an explosion of content and not everyone gets to watch on the day of broadcast I can t afford HBO and I don t download illegally so I haven t seen GoT season yet And it s only been a few weeks since it was shown  I sympathise especially as premium sporting events move from free to air to pay TV But it is precisely because communications have changed so much that the main responsibility for avoiding information that discloses a plot line the fate of a character or the result of a sports contest is shifting from media professionals to individual audience members 
JUL14	The misogynists might finally learn to behave if their actions are outlawed	A n exceptionally abundant glut of sexual harassment news may have overshadowed a significant victory for students at Warwick University which thanks to its administration s complacency over sexist abuse has come to occupy a prominent place in the misogyny league tables  As any female undergraduate can tell you this is a highly competitive field but only Warwick has excelled to the point of getting its concern for the perpetrators broadcast across social media as shameonyouWarwick Student protests then national headlines provoked by the feeble official response to the discovery of rape chat by some male students led to the university commissioning an independent review by Dr Sharon Persaud and now to an apology to the victims from Warwick s vice chancellor Prof Stuart Croft We are genuinely sorry he said Pity about the genuinely but moving on I should have been quicker I should have reached out

JUL14	Working class versus minorities? That’s looking at it the wrong way	Officials eyeing you with contempt Police treating you as scum A sense of being constantly watched and judged by professionals Living in fear of benefit sanctions A lack of community facilities Such is likely to be your experience if you are working class Such is also likely to be your experience if you are of black or minority ethnic origin  But here s the odd thing people from the working class and minorities are rarely seen as facing the same kinds of issues Instead in political debates from Brexit to welfare benefits minorities and the working class are seen as having conflicting interests and often set against each other We are Ghosts Race Class and Institutional Prejudice a report published last week by the thinktanks Class and the Runnymede Trust attempts to address this Based on interviews and focus groups almost entirely in
JUL14	So, guys, you reckon you could take a point off Serena Williams?	Let us for a minute extend the benefit of the doubt to the of men who believe they could take a point from Serena Williams in a tennis match no doubt further emboldened by her defeat in the Wimbledon final  For who can say what manner of fugue state they fell into as they answered a simple polling question Could they have collectively imagined as they pictured the holder of grand slam titles shaping up to serve a freak calamity overtaking her A sinkhole opening up on her side of the net perhaps or a thunderbolt sent by a jealous athletic god or in more sinister fashion a tripwire rigged up by an incel saboteur to fell her as she rushed in for the volley 
JUL14	Money’s no object for Facebook, so hit it where it hurts	If you want a measure of the problem society will have in controlling the tech giants then ponder this as it has become clear that the US Federal Trade Commission is about to impose a fine of bn bn on Facebook for violating a decree governing privacy breaches the company s share price went up  This is a landmark moment It s the biggest ever fine imposed by the FTC the body set up to police American capitalism And bn is a lot of money in anybody s language Anybody s but Facebook s It represents just a month of revenues and the stock market knew it Facebook s capitalisation went up bn with the news This was a fine that actually increased Mark Zuckerberg s personal wealth 
JUL15	It’s folly for Jeremy Hunt to think Britain can solve the Iran crisis without the EU	Jeremy Hunt s well publicised dash to Brussels to save the world from war with Iran will be seen by his more cynical opponents as a last minute bid to save his Conservative leadership hopes Before attending an EU foreign ministers meeting on Monday Hunt declared portentously that the prospect of Middle Eastern states acquiring nuclear weapons posed an existential threat to mankind That s scary stuff certainly deserving of a seasoned statesman s full attention  Showboating aside what the foreign secretary s Brussels mission really demonstrates is that unilateral British efforts to defuse the Iran crisis have failed miserably In particular this failure has cruelly exposed the hollowness of Britain s claims to wield special influence in Washington s corridors of power Donald Trump could not give a fig what Britain thinks All efforts to change his mind including two Boris Johnson trips to Washington as foreign secretary have flopped 
JUL15	From Trump to Boris Johnson, we’re moving from post-truth to post-shame	A confession I tend not to read the online comments about anything I write for the Guardian But as I am about to embark on a short politics of mental health speaking tour down under I made an exception for the comments section beneath an interview I did for Guardian Australia I am glad I did For there were two comments so good they left me wishing I had written them myself I shall certainly be using them in future  I have no idea who sleuthfortruth is but someone should find them and hire them as a speechwriter Voting for a populist party is like diving headfirst into an empty swimming pool because you re angry that there s no water in it Brilliant Trump and Brexit to a tee 
JUL15	Trump’s race fantasy is clear: the US as home for whites fleeing Europe	 Why don t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came Donald Trump wondered of four progressive his punctuation Democrat congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio Cortez born in New York Rashida Tlaib born in Michigan Ayanna Pressley born in Ohio and Ilhan Omar born in Somalia raised in the US and a naturalised American  Impossible to tell why he chose these women rather than say Mike Pence also born in the US but of Irish ancestry Or for that matter why Trump himself doesn t return to the Outer Hebrides birthplace of his mother which is riddled with crime against knitwear Imagine how incredibly full Scottish politics would be if everyone whose parents were born there went back and tried to govern it We d be seeking independence from them 
JUL15	Don’t let nationalism win – we can create a better Europe from within	If you have ever had a close meaningful relationship you will know just how important honest and open communication is all the more so when that relationship is in jeopardy However scary it seems we know deep down that at such fraught moments the unadulterated truth must be spoken out loud without it there is no real chance of growing closer  The same goes for the European Union I absolutely love the EU but if we Brits get a chance for a second referendum in the UK we will need to argue for remain in different terms than we did last time We will need to articulate the value of our continuing relationship to the EU in an honest and grownup conversation We have learned from that simply cheerleading will not defeat the elaborate lies we know our opponents will concoct and the disinformation they have already propagated 
JUL15	My own list of hideous men: from a dodgy driving instructor to Boris Johnson	E Jean Carroll s list of hideous men is a magnificent essay that ends with her detailed allegations about being raped by Donald Trump People seem not to care much about such accusations or the racism made explicit by his tweets over the weekend  Her list reminded me of incidents in my own life often involving harassment and assault but made me also want to start another list of hideous men who have undermined me not sexually but in every other possible way 
JUL15	Christine Lagarde will have to confront Berlin if she’s to save the euro	Christine Lagarde was a key member of the infamous troika Greece s official creditors who crushed our people s resistance to perpetual debt bondage The other key figure alongside the International Monetary Fund s then managing director was Mario Draghi president of the European Central Bank who played a central role in that drama by engineering the closure of Greece s banks Now four years later Lagarde has been anointed to succeed Draghi at the helm of the ECB  Despite her role and the dealings we had when I was Greece s finance minister not once did I feel animosity towards her I found her intelligent cordial respectful She even acknowledged in private at least that Greece had been given a raw deal and that my campaign to cut our public debt was right and proper Lagarde s priority was holding the troika s line and minimising any challenge to its collective authority 
JUL15	If there is an 'immigrant' who has failed to integrate in America, it's Donald Trump	Why does Donald Trump hate America so much What is it about this German American that makes him think he can tell native born citizens what to say and how to behave   So interesting to see Progressive Democrat Congresswomen who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe the worst most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world if they even have a functioning government at all now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth how our government is to be run Trump tweeted 
JUL15	Meghan and Harry can't cut out the media completely	Shamefully perhaps I d never heard of mum shaming until I read that Meghan Duchess of Sussex was being trolled on Instagram for not holding her new baby correctly When I Googled it the top stories were all of Meghan holding baby Archie in the Sun the Express and the Daily Mirror  Although these cruel trolls were largely anonymous they were widely quoted by the papers One according to the Mirror wrote Why can t she hold the baby properly after two months Clearly the nanny looks after him most of the time 
JUL15	Boris Johnson is about to inherit a crisis his EU-bashing helped spawn	It was not just the persistently overcast skies a weather pattern once dubbed the Brabant gloom by Roy Jenkins a former European commission president that made working in Brussels for the Daily Telegraph in the early s a joyless experience It was my role as deputy to Boris Johnson then bureau chief in name but solo performer in practice that ensured my first job as a foreign correspondent was a trial of endurance  There were just the two of us in the Telegraph office and we were working long hard hours reporting on the political and economic convulsions of the Maastricht treaty negotiations The story itself of negotiations that played out in meeting rooms of Brussels was full of political intrigue and drama And whatever happened was likely to shape Europe for years to come 
JUL15	European governments are fuelling Euroscepticism	After days of drama and late night meetings EU heads of government recently nominated their candidate to replace the Luxembourger Jean Claude Juncker when he steps down as president of the European commission in October As expected the name to emerge was a German but not the German who was expected Rather than Manfred Weber the lead candidate or Spitzenkandidat of the biggest political group in the European parliament the centre right European People s Party EPP Ursula von der Leyen the German minister of defence was announced as the nominee As some celebrated finally the promotion of a woman to the most powerful EU position others rightly criticised her nomination for rendering the European electorate irrelevant in the process  In political science European elections are referred to as second order elections as opposed to first order elections which determine national governments In fact European elections don t even determine the EU s government which is constituted by the executive body the European commission and the European council where the member governments make new laws 
JUL16	Pro-Europe Tories must locate their rebel spirit – and make the case for remain	If hardline Brexiteers were free to shop around for beatable enemies they probably wouldn t change much about the current state of British politics Their preferred candidate is well ahead in the final straight of a Tory leadership contest and his rival doesn t dare to contradict him on the issue that matters most  In hustings on Monday night Boris Johnson ruled out any Brexit compromise based on revision of the Northern Irish backstop And that is the only route to a negotiated orderly resolution visible from Brussels No backstop no deal Jeremy Hunt might have inserted some practical reality into the conversation if only for the sake of his intellectual credibility but instead he endorsed the central tenet of Johnsonism the only Brexit deal worth aiming for is one that doesn t exist 
JUL16	Trump’s ‘go back’ racism is crude, but may be dangerously effective	Pity Donald Trump Even his racism is the most unsophisticated kind Every black and brown person knows a go back to where you came from racist For many of us who have never been migrants to have this muttered at us was the first signal that to be a visible minority means to be forever perceived as an immigrant And that being perceived as an immigrant is bad   Go back racists are rarely intellectually capable of engaging with the question of whether the destination they deem so suitable for us actually exists Trump s latest outburst in which he said four congresswomen should go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came is a case in point For the US president to say of Ayanna Pressley Ilhan Omar Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Rashida Tlaib if they re not happy here they can leave makes no sense because the women in question are Americans Yet it makes perfect sense because they are not white 
JUL16	Scarlett Johansson could ideally play ‘any person’. But our world is far from ideal	 As an actor I should be allowed to play any person or any tree or any animal because that is my job and the requirements of my job the actress Scarlett Johansson told As If magazine in an interview obtained by the Daily Mail that has since gone viral she later said her comments had been taken out of context and used as clickbait  Not exactly surprising coming from a woman who has played a cyborg Ghost in the Shell an alien Under the Skin and the disembodied voice of an artificially intelligent virtual assistant Her but it s offensive nevertheless to hear a cisgender white woman assert her unassailable right to play whomever or whatever she pleases Or as Vanity Fair s film critic K Austin Collins put it in a tweet you cant just go around likening playing a tree to playing an asian woman lmao come on 
JUL16	Liam Fox wants children to learn about global trade. But it’s Brexiters who need the lessons	International trade secretary Liam Fox has shown us what happens when one of the leaders of the revolution spends three subsequent years looking at paperwork The fantasy lives just but must now inhabit a lever arch file outlining everything the UK still doesn t understand about global trade  In recent weeks dyed in the wool Brexiter Fox has warned against no deal explained why Boris Johnson cannot use Gatt article to unilaterally implement a deal with the EU and pointed out that we cannot negotiate a new package with the US before Brexit has taken place The reason for his newfound pragmatism was perhaps revealed by Monday s announcement that the government is seeking to train new professional trade negotiators and Fox s declaration that trade should be taught on the national curriculum So there we have it the government has discovered that trade depends on rules and almost nobody in Britain knows what they are 
JUL16	No, Boris Johnson, working harder is not a solution for poor mental health	Boris Johnson is quite the renaissance man He builds buses He writes columns He dabbles in politics And now it would appear he fancies himself a mental health expert On Sunday Johnson used his Telegraph column to share his brilliant solution to Britain s mental health crisis drown out your inner demons with work Yep according to the sentient shock of hair that will probably be Britain s next prime minister you can rid yourself of depression by working harder  Johnson s views on mental health largely seem to be influenced by that famous wellness guru Winston Churchill It was with work that Churchill pitchforked off his depression BJ informs us in his column A nd what was true for Churchill is basically true for all of us that to a very large extent we derive our self esteem from what we do It is often from our jobs that we get that all important sense of satisfaction 
JUL16	School textbooks are on the way out – and pupils will lose so much with them	The world s largest publisher of textbooks is preparing to throw in the towel on print and paper Pearson has announced a digital first strategy for its US market New books will be published in electronic rather than print form and Pearson will update its physical textbooks much less often from here on in The UK is expected to follow in due course  Students in the US who increasingly opt to rent secondhand textbooks rather than buy them new are eating into Pearson s profits so it has decided to cut the problem off at the source Or as it puts it It is time to flick the switch in how we primarily make and create our products 
JUL16	Hong Kong showed China is a threat to democracy. Now Europe must defend Taiwan	Hong Kong s administration has backed down over the controversial extradition bill but the canary in the coalmine of China s tacit acceptance of democracy is already dead  Under China s one country two systems model Hong Kong was given the guarantee that the freedoms of its citizens would be preserved and respected Meanwhile for a long time in the west the consensus was that as its economy grew China would start to look more like Hong Kong Regrettably in recent years the opposite has happened and Hong Kong looks more like China by the year Perhaps we were naive to believe that this erosion of Hong Kong s democracy was not inevitable Beijing makes no secret of its view that democracy and Chinese civilisation are incompatible The protesters in the streets of Hong Kong would beg to differ and I hope they succeed through peaceful means 
JUL16	This genetic breakthrough on anorexia should transform how the disease is seen	Once upon a time disease was thought to have been sent by God as a punishment for sin  If not then it must surely be the work of demons witches or groups regarded as social outcasts Thankfully medicine has moved on from the days when Jews were blamed for outbreaks of the plague across medieval Europe yet with psychiatric illnesses something of the old accusatory myths seem to linger Until relatively recently autism was still wrongly blamed on so called refrigerator mothers who supposedly damaged their children by being cold and unloving The discovery that autism has a genetic component turned our understanding of the role it plays in families upside down and now something similar may be happening with anorexia 
JUL16	Putting Alan Turing on the £50 note is a triumph for British science – and for equality	Over Christmas I had the unusual delight of reading short biographies of dead scientists As a member of the Bank of England s banknote character advisory committee I was sifting through potential nominees to be included on the new note the sheer volume of UK scientists put forward by more than members of the public reflected the enormous contribution our small island has made to international scientific progress over the past few centuries  The advisory committee finally arrived at a list of which we duly presented to the bank s governor Mark Carney All were outstanding scientists in their own right universally agreed to have made a significant and enduring contribution not just to the world of science but to society as a whole They ranged from Stephen Hawking and Rosalind Franklin to Dorothy Hodgkin and Srivanasa Ramanujan It was a list to challenge the outdated stereotype of the socially awkward old white man working diligently alone in his laboratory A damaging trope that still prevents many young people today from seeing a place for themselves in science 
JUL16	Bullies told me to 'go home'. Now, Trump is making me relive those moments	Being an American born US citizen and hearing go back to your country repeatedly as a child and an adult so shook up my sense of self I had to write a whole novel about it pushed by that kind of naive artist s insistence I need you to know how this feels  I grew up in northern Minnesota where our family was the only family of color in a small mining town It was a town rich with immigration its ethnic days boasted more than nationalities but always somehow forgot us all European I still subscribe to our hometown paper and see that now as then a Finnish club continues to meet at the public library every week the Sons of Norway yes still sons club is so active it has won national awards from its main organization 
JUL17	Democrats are right to condemn Trump’s racism, but they risk walking into his trap	You d think it would happen all the time Given how often they re drawn from different parties it should be routine for the US House of Representatives to condemn the president In fact it s rare Until last night the House had not made that formal move since it admonished William Howard Taft more than a century ago So Donald Trump has earned himself yet another place in the history books rebuked by the House late Tuesday night for telling four members of that body all women of colour three of them born in the US and all American citizens to go back to where they came from  For anyone opposed to prejudice and bigotry the moral argument for the resolution is unassailable Not many would want to dispute the text s contention that President Donald Trump s racist comments have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color That is little more than a statement of the truth Proof came swiftly when presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway referred to the four Congresswomen as the dark underbelly of America and following a question about the issue during a press huddle immediately asked the Jewish reporter who had asked it What s your ethnicity 
JUL17	We shouldn’t have to live in a world where women are afraid to say no	Some years ago I worked for a man several decades older than me who consistently made oleaginous and sexualised comments to me and the other young women in our workplace He was completely oblivious to the fact that our disgust towards him was a shared point of bonding and that we would wince every time he was in the building I expect because every time he said something we would force a smile entrenching his delusion that we actually enjoyed his behaviour  I thought about him again this week when I read that the Manchester teenager Gabrielle Walsh had been knocked unconscious after she told a man who followed her from a nightclub I m sorry I m not interested Although Walsh s experience is much more extreme and frightening than mine both examples reveal the reluctance women feel to rebut a man s unwanted advances when he holds some sort of power be it physical or economic In the wee small hours when alcohol is flowing perhaps a man will just be crazy enough to physically harm you if you tell him no If that man is your boss maybe you ll find your work life becoming that little bit harder after you inform him that what he regards as swashbuckling charm is actually sexual harassment 
JUL17	Radical change is needed to ensure farms produce healthy food. MPs must act now	A profound ecological transformation of food and farming is achievable desirable and urgently needed That s a message that comes across loud and clear from the RSA Food Farming and Countryside Commission FFCC at the culmination of an innovative and independent two year inquiry  It provides a clear diagnosis of the causes of the current environmental and health crisis linked to how we produce and consume food It describes how over the last years agriculture has been about specialisation consolidation and control over nature with many farmers simply raw material suppliers to a processing industry This model of agriculture has driven deforestation wildlife loss soil degradation and diet related ill health 
JUL17	Poor tenants pay for landlords to live like kings. It doesn’t have to be this way	I have a friend who works almost every waking hour mainly to pay the rent Her landlord lives on a beach miles away He seldom responds to her requests and grudgingly pays for the minimum of maintenance But every so often he writes to inform her that he is raising the rent He does not have to work because she and other tenants work on his behalf He is able to live the life of his choice because they give their time to him As there is a shortage of accessible housing they have no choice but to pay his exorbitant fees  People say I work for Tesco or I work for Deliveroo but the reality for many is that they work for their landlord
JUL17	The military has recognised its harassment problem. Now it must talk about it	Recently I had coffee with a fellow veteran She recalled her experience of going to sea with the Royal Navy for the first time On being shown which compartments she could use to dry laundry she had her attention drawn to special cages for her underwear so it wouldn t get stolen by men on board She thought at the time this was thoughtful treatment of women at sea She and I have together come to see these sorts of behaviours very differently  I experienced being told explicitly I wasn t welcome as a woman in a new role it wasn t a problem that I was a woman in another more senior role the former comment openly hostile but the latter more subtly demeaning These comments came from men ranked above me at different points in my career I felt at the time I had to suck it up and I like my friend struggled with recognising unacceptable behaviour for what it was This I believe is part of the problem identified by the Ministry of Defence in its Report on Inappropriate Behaviours 
JUL17	Revealed: the three-word question consuming the world’s biggest brains	What is preoccupying the world s leading minds It is an audacious question for sure Some might say leading physicists will be concentrating on physics leading philosophers on philosophy historians on history and so on  And yet when we look back on different eras we can sometimes spot a thread the preoccupation with truth in ancient Athens with beauty in Renaissance Europe with political reason during the Enlightenment with scientific progress during the industrial age There is I believe likewise a new preoccupation lurking in the biggest brains of our time and that theme is summed up in one word identity 
JUL17	I challenged Corbyn on antisemitism a year ago. Things have only got worse	Today marks one year since my face to face encounter with Jeremy Corbyn in the lobby of parliament in which I called him a racist and an antisemite  Afterwards I went out for the evening and switched off my phone It was late that night when I switched it back on again and realised our confrontation had hit the headlines 
JUL17	Millennials won’t let go of children’s toys and films – and kids are paying the price	Last week Mattel announced the launch of a Ziggy Stardust inspired Barbie Yet the number of seven year olds saving up their weekly pocket money to splurge on worth of David Bowie inspired plastic is probably limited The intended demographic is more likely to be the current darlings of the marketing world millennials  A few weeks ago I took my nine year old daughter Maisie to see Toy Story Some of the audience sniggered and guffawed at actors Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peele s fluffy comedy duo Ducky and Bunny and nodded sagely at Forky finding himself But what I didn t hear were any children laughing odd when you consider the supposed target audience for a Disney film When we left the theatre Maisie pithily commented Well that was trash 
JUL17	Boris Johnson could hide as a columnist and at City Hall. He can’t in No 10	Ahead of the London mayoral election of May I was invited to chair a hustings at St James s Church in Piccadilly The main attractions were Boris Johnson seeking his second term and his doughty detractor Ken Livingstone alongside their good natured warm up acts of Jenny Jones for the Green party and Brian Paddick for the Lib Dems  Before we took the stage there was a drinks reception in the rectory Boris Johnson was holding court but greeted me to listen to my proposed rules of engagement and graciously remembered that we shared a comment page at the Daily Telegraph at the time What struck me was that he was softly spoken genial and engaging 
JUL17	Pro-Europe Tories must locate their rebel spirit – and make the case for remain	If hardline Brexiteers were free to shop around for beatable enemies they probably wouldn t change much about the current state of British politics Their preferred candidate is well ahead in the final straight of a Tory leadership contest and his rival doesn t dare to contradict him on the issue that matters most  In hustings on Monday night Boris Johnson ruled out any Brexit compromise based on revision of the Northern Irish backstop And that is the only route to a negotiated orderly resolution visible from Brussels No backstop no deal Jeremy Hunt might have inserted some practical reality into the conversation if only for the sake of his intellectual credibility but instead he endorsed the central tenet of Johnsonism the only Brexit deal worth aiming for is one that doesn t exist 
JUL18	This Commons vote shows how weak a Boris Johnson government would be	It is a measure of how far British politics has passed through the looking glass that MPs feel compelled to put in law that prime ministers should govern with the consent of parliament There was a time not too long ago when that sort of thing was understood as a convention underpinning democracy The imminent arrival of Boris Johnson in Downing Street has made it prudent to get implicit constitutional principles down in writing  The amendment that passed today would not forbid Johnson from dissolving the House in order to get Britain out of the EU without a negotiated deal It is a more convoluted device attached tenuously to a passing bill pertaining to Northern Ireland It instructs the government to report to the Commons on a timetable that would preclude prorogation Crudely speaking it wedges the parliamentary door open in the run up to the October Brexit deadline in case Johnson plans on shutting the legislature down to facilitate a desperate dash for no deal 
JUL18	Jeremy Corbyn’s weak leadership betrays those Labour would lift from poverty	With dexterity decisiveness and a thwack of firm leadership Jeremy Corbyn sacked Dianne Hayter last night as shadow Brexit minister She can t be fired from her elected role as deputy leader of the Lords With just that same speed he expelled Alastair Campbell from the Labour party in May as a dead cat distraction following Labour s disastrous European election results  What had Hayter done She had deployed a somewhat tired old political metaphor the bunker mentality comparing Corbyn s inner circle to the paranoid denial of disastrous reality that defined Hitler s last days The same was said of Thatcher s final hours in power in denial over her poll tax calamity It was said of Gordon Brown in his telephone hurling phase of Tony Blair s secretive sofa government and of Harold Wilson s kitchen cabinet It s never a good idea to use Hitler as a metaphor for anything else but the claim by Corbyn s spokesman that her words were grossly insensitive to Jewish staff would be laughable if it didn t look like such a pathetic attempt to divert criticism from the party s failure to deal with antisemitism which Corbyn should have scotched more than a year ago 
JUL18	The lesson from the ruins of Notre Dame: don’t rely on billionaires	You remember the story of course you do One of the most ancient and holy buildings on Earth Notre Dame cathedral in Paris goes up in flames As pictures of the inferno are beamed around the world adjectives rain down it is atrocious disastrous diabolical  Barely has the fire been put out before some of the richest people in France rush to help rebuild it From Fran ois Henri Pinault the ultimate owner of Gucci comes m m Not to be outdone the Arnault family at Louis Vuitton put up m More of the wealthy join the bidding as if a Damien Hirst is going under the hammer Within just three days France s billionaire class has coughed up nearly m Or so their press releases state 
JUL18	Trump and the Squad both want the same thing – and Pelosi is in the way	American politics makes some extremely odd bedfellows That s worth keeping in mind when trying to understand why Donald Trump Twitter trolled four progressive first term congresswomen of color Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York Ilhan Omar of Minnesota Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan in his now infamous go back tweet Although Trump and the Squad the collective nickname for the congresswomen have venomously denounced each other the reality is that they both want the same thing to make the women the public face of the Democratic party And their greatest obstacle is the Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi  The Squad have welcomed and sought out public attention because they want to use their celebrity to push the party to the left just as the conservative movement pushed the Republican party to the right in decades past They believe that this transformation not only will lead to progressive legislative victories it will also win elections As Ocasio Cortez s chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti recently told the Washington Post 
JUL18	I reported on misogyny in parliament 29 years ago – shockingly little has changed	Twenty nine years ago this week I carried out an investigation for the Guardian about the endemic levels of sexism in parliament A generation later although much has been done it is shocking to discover that so little has changed  Last week s reports on bullying and harassment in the Commons and Lords by the QCs Gemma White and Naomi Ellenbogen reveal a parliament that is still chauvinistic lecherous and patriarchal 
JUL18	Sadiq Khan has rejected the Tulip. But that won’t save London’s skyline	Tulipmania is no more London s mayor Sadiq Khan has rejected Norman Foster s ft Tulip for the City of London crowning an unhappy week for the architect On the same day his obsession with iconic edifices hit a wall in Paris where his gigantic twin towers at La D fense were rejected Khan for once agreed with Historic England and others that the Tulip was just a lift shaft with a bulge on top a bulge with unpleasant blisters on its side He did not like it at all  For London this was something of a surprise Khan even deplored the Tulip s poorly designed public space at street level This makes his approval of Renzo Piano s bleak glass cube now rising next to Paddington station the more bizarre situated as it is in a conservation area The mayor has previously been as meek as Boris Johnson was in the presence of London s all powerful developer lobby Speculators knew that if they just offered him a handful of affordable flats usually a mere off asking price they could get any height they wanted He is even said to favour taller towers looming over conservation areas in Notting Hill and South Kensington 
JUL18	The political gaffe is dead, as bigots and liars triumph by spouting guff	There was a time when the things our political leaders said and did carried with them the threat of censure or rebuke The slightest misstep could presage disaster while a proper world ending gaffe was like political kryptonite something that could down even a seasoned heavyweight in seconds  They seemed to come less often back then and the sillier ones we rejoiced in most of all It s widely accepted that Neil Kinnock s time as Labour leader never recovered from the accidental dip in the sea he took on his first day in When Howard Dean tanked his bid to become Democratic nominee by yelling in a slightly weird way we held street parties to celebrate his misfortune and he was launched into space to think about what he d done We all remember Ed Miliband losing the respect of the entire political class when in he ate a bacon sandwich in approximately the only way it is possible to eat a bacon sandwich Swallowing huge handfuls of popcorn we pulled a giant red lever that exiled him to Twitter where a sad sarcastic squad of young interns soon reduced him to being a sort of plush doll mascot version of himself doomed to tweet self deprecating comments about his own calamitous misfortune which we now mostly ignore 
JUL18	Africans arriving here are all assumed to be fleeing – but it's the UK that risks losing out	An African passport is the most egalitarian of documents in that if you have one then class employment status and professional invitations from the country you are visiting all count for nothing From university professors to unskilled labourers anyone holding a passport issued by a country in Africa will be treated the same by UK border officers They will also show no compassion for or recognition of the need for people to be reunited with family or to see friends  In fact it s not too far fetched to say an African passport is a no travel document Even countries within Africa are miserly with each other I am a veteran visa applicant and I can tell you there is no respite A European visa is as prohibitively hard to secure as one to a neighbouring African country My Sudanese passport meant that I had to become an Olympian visa applier in order to visit study and settle in the UK You can t slouch with a passport from a country on a terror watchlist 
JUL18	The government is rubbish at social media. And no, a new PM won’t change that	In unsure political times one has to cling to particular certainties Mark Francois s face will grow redder and angrier the longer we delay Brexit By January he should be visible from space Chuka Umunna will at some point leave the Lib Dems to create a party called Alternative Change Politics which he will leave within minutes of registering it Jeremy Corbyn will keep finding new and exciting ways to disappoint you And regardless of who the new prime minister is the government will continue to be absolutely rubbish at social media  Last week the government announced it was setting up the adorably pathetic Office for Tackling Injustices a new department that will use data and statistics to combat inequality across the country It should be able to do a great deal of good in the four weeks it exists before Boris Johnson duly scraps it To accompany the launch Downing Street s official Twitter account a set of words that feel as incongruous and nauseating together as fizzy cheese and Andrew Neil s muscular thighs showed it was down with the kids by releasing a bafflingly crummy video 
JUL18	Is FaceApp an evil plot by 'the Russians' to steal your data? Not quite	Over the last few days the faceappchallenge has taken over social media This challenge involves downloading a selfie editing tool called FaceApp and using one of its filters to digitally age your face You then post the photo of your wizened old self on the internet and everyone laughs uproariously You get a small surge of dopamine from gathering a few online likes before existential ennui sets in once again Challenge completed  On Monday as the faceappchallenge went viral Joshua Nozzi a software developer warned people to BE CAREFUL WITH FACEAPP it immediately uploads your photos without asking whether you chose one or not Some media outlets picked this claim up and privacy concerns about the app began to mount 
JUL19	Held captive by his carers for four weeks … let’s look at Boris Johnson’s best bits	T minus five days off a likely Boris Johnson premiership I would like to thank all the Conservatives who explained exactly why putting us through the stone cold shitshow of a campaign was so essential It was important these red trousered political scientists all told us because the process allowed the candidates to be properly tested It didn t happen last time and look how that turned out  Preach Had we gone through the whole rigmarole in we might have found out about teenage Theresa May s Betamax crop circle habit before it was too late Or that if asked to state a preference between Midsomer Murders and Sherlock May would one day simply reply I ve watched both Instead what happened happened I guess you don t make that magnitude of mistake twice 
JUL19	I tried to find an upside to no deal. I couldn’t	Think of it as a coping strategy Just as supporters of a team knocked out of the cup console themselves that Now we can concentrate on the league so I have tried to reassure myself that a no deal crash out from the EU might not be such a disaster That you never know it might even be a good thing  Such a strategy remains necessary because no deal still waits for us on the other side of summer It is as the Brexiter ultras delight in pointing out the legal default It remains the law of the land unless and until MPs vote for something else True on Thursday MPs placed an obstacle in the path of the likely next prime minister preventing Boris Johnson from simply suspending parliament which would have been a dictator s move as well as a dick move by requiring the Commons to sit through October But that only makes no deal harder it does not make it impossible All it will take is MPs who were once staunch in their opposition to leaving the EU without a deal to fold Amber Rudd has done it This week Labour s Sarah Champion did it More could follow For that reason remainers need to gird ourselves for Halloween to have a comfort blanket in the drawer ready to cling to if the worst happens Which is why I ve been busy knitting these past few weeks coming up with the arguments that might help us self soothe Here goes 
JUL19	As your old friend, Boris, I’m asking you to stop Brexit	Dear Boris  You and I are friends despite being on the opposite sides of the great political divide of our generation But what does our friendship mean 
JUL19	EU officials don’t relish the idea of no deal – but they are prepared to play hardball	The top EU officials working on Brexit believe that the most likely outcome is for Britain to leave without a deal at the end of October Last Monday s debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in which both said that the withdrawal agreement s Irish backstop would have to be excised altogether rather than just modified reinforced the gloom in Brussels EU officials do not want no deal but think they are powerless to prevent it They see the Conservative party driving the UK towards the cliff edge and fear MPs are incapable of grabbing the steering wheel to avert disaster  For many months EU officials have thought that Johnson the likely next prime minister had only two options either to put lipstick on the pig and dress up Theresa May s deal to make it prettier with extra protocols and interpretations or to seek a fundamental change such as insisting on a time limit for the Irish backstop The EU would have been happy to collaborate over the first option but Johnson has now explicitly ruled that out He has even rejected a time limit on the backstop 
JUL19	How dare a woman breastfeed her baby on a plane! She might offend the bigots	Well I for one welcome the news as of this week anybody asked to cover up while breastfeeding on a KLM flight can now walk bare breasted across the plane milk firing into the air their baby howling at their shoulder and immediately hand that screaming hungry suffering child to the person who made the complaint who must then look after that baby for the entirety of the journey while the previously breastfeeding passenger lies back watches a film reads their book has a glass of wine or enjoys a much needed nap  Because my friends that is precisely what I would do if someone asked me to cover myself while breastfeeding This week the Dutch airline KLM garnered a lactic tonne of deserved criticism after it put out a tweet stating that to ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding should other passengers be offended by this This was itself a response to one customer s complaint posted on Facebook that she had been asked by a flight attendant to cover herself with a blanket you know like an actual fire while breastfeeding her baby because someone else on the plane had complained 
JUL19	No deal would be disastrous. Labour must lead a national campaign to stop it	Off a cliff they march bowler hat wearing besuited Englishmen left leg raised theatrically la Ministry of Silly Walks over the precipice before they topple into the abyss This was the front cover image of the New Yorker sketched in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum result but it surely even better captures our current predicament Sing it gently It s Beginning to Look a Lot Like No Deal  Under Theresa May this was always an empty threat even though she paved its way with her inflammatory declaration that no deal is better than a bad deal Under the clownish charlatan due to succeed her drunk on rightwing populism English nationalism messianic delusion and Conservative existential angst it is now a tangible possibility 
JUL19	Extinction Rebellion protesters aren’t anarchists – we just want to save our world	I am a retired doctor a husband a father and grandfather I am also one of more than Extinction Rebellion protesters who have been arrested by police During the April demonstrations in London I sat on Waterloo Bridge with many others and refused to move in full acceptance that this nonviolent action would lead to my arrest  For many years I have been aware of the growing threat to life on Earth due to our overconsumption of the planet s finite resources our pollution of land air and sea our disregard for other forms of life and in particular our reckless burning of fossil fuels It s now clear that global heating and biodiversity loss are proceeding even faster than predicted just a few years ago and we are reaching a tipping point beyond which it will soon be too late to avoid the extinction of life as we know it Like most of my generation living in the wealthy parts of the world I must accept the guilt and responsibility of my own contribution to this situation 
JUL19	Donald Trump is the archetypal far-right charismatic leader. But his magic won’t last	First Lock her up and Build that wall now Send her back Donald Trump s record of using such slogans to normalise misogyny and stoke prejudice has become exhaustive and ever more overtly racist His Twitter feeds have even recycled content from extreme right groups that historians of fascism like me consider deeply worrying Yet this all proves tremulously popular Academics who study fascism are well placed to see that Trump s shoot from the hip public persona is a carefully constructed device designed to consciously and deliberately break liberal taboos setting an example to others that they can do likewise  The most recent ratcheting up of his endorsement of racist language came this week displaying once again the powerful relationship between the leader who seeks to embody prejudice in the pursuit of power and followers who convey this power on him in their millions True to form it started with a tweet He told four congresswomen of colour to go home fuelling outrage from many who were rightly incensed by this latest attack on decency in public discourse Then during a rally in North Carolina a few days later he focused on one of these congresswomen Somali born US citizen Ilhan Omar 
JUL19	Farewell, Theresa May. Your best was far from good enough	On Wednesday in her last major speech Theresa May lamented a growing culture of absolutism in politics Introspection was never her strong suit and this speech to the Chatham House thinktank was no exception In a scarcely veiled swipe at the populist right at home and abroad she bemoaned an inability to combine principles with pragmatism from those who believe that if you simply assert your view loud enough and long enough you will get your way in the end  This from the leader who produced a deal without consulting other parties refused to compromise on it put it to parliament three times and lost every time and would have tabled it for a fourth time if she d been able 
JUL19	What’s really behind the spread of Lyme disease? Clue: it’s not the Pentagon	The first indication I d picked up a tick borne disease three years ago was the excruciating arthritic pain in my feet as I hobbled to a dinner party at a neighbour s house in Jerusalem  Later that night I experienced flu like symptoms including a raging fever that even with antibiotics would last for more than a week 
JUL20	New PM, take note: the Iran crisis could escalate into war	The boarding and holding of the tanker Grace off Gibraltar while allegedly carrying Iranian crude oil to Syria in breach of European Union sanctions regime was clearly going to provoke a response Indeed the Tehran regime clearly articulated the fact that they would do something in retaliation  Having already carried out a number of attacks on international tankers in and around the strait of Hormuz a week ago an attempt was made to take a British flag registered ship the BP British Heritage It was only thwarted by the close presence of HMS Montrose 
JUL20	Trump revives the idea of a ‘white man’s country’, America’s original sin	The idea that some US inhabitants deserve the land deserve to stay and to occupy it and that others must go to be exterminated Native Americans to be exiled black people to be driven out Chinese and Japanese people to be barred from immigrating Italians Jews and other southern and eastern Europeans to be removed Mexicans and briefly challenged as citizens Irish Catholics has changed shape over time in terms of the permitted stayers and the non permitted exiles  But the conviction that only some people that is white people however defined deserved US citizenship based on race held on for a very long time After all the initial US Congress began its work in by limiting eligibility for naturalisation to the free and the white 
JUL20	Our next PM needs to become an Iran expert. And fast	An incoming prime minister could be forgiven for feeling that the fates have been a touch unkind As well as no majority in parliament an uncertain domestic agenda and the vortex of Brexit now a fully formed international crisis sits in the in tray marked Iran It will be an early test of diplomatic dexterity  We should not be here As always it helps to see the world as others see it without compromise or acceptance of another s perceptions Iran has long and complex relationships all round A Shia state surrounded by Sunni states it sees its history as one requiring constant vigilance to survive in a world that stood by when it was attacked by Iraq and lost perhaps up to a million people and one where economic sanctions threaten its people and government stability 
JUL20	Condemning poor children to a life without culture is a form of cruelty	Disadvantaged children in England are being priced out of a cultural hinterland A Social Mobility Commission study from the University of Bath reports that children aged from low income families are three times less likely than wealthier peers to engage in out of school musical activities such as learning an instrument or joining a choir or orchestra  There were also differences according to race of British Pakistani children took part in music classes compared with of Indian children and of white children and regional divides of children in north east England played a musical instrument compared with in the south east 
JUL20	Gwendoline Christie: let’s hear it for all the underdogs at the Emmys	It cost Gwendoline Christie Alfie Allen and Carice van Houten each to submit themselves for consideration to the Emmys which given that all three were announced as nominees last week sounds retrospectively like a bit of a bargain The Game of Thrones actors were not put forward by makers HBO which is fair enough I suppose since the show had roughly actors in every episode and not playing favourites would have been a budget busting exercise in diplomacy After all they spent all their money on dragons  Apparently it is common practice for people to submit themselves if their network does not but it is less common for them to actually win the nod having done so The internet seemed impressed by the go get em attitude of the trio and to show its approval allowed the meme of Brienne of Tarth writing in the Book of Brothers to graduate from a Sex and the City Mean Girls spoof to a symbol of knowing one s own value and pushing for what you want 
JUL20	The moon was once a frontier. But new worlds now beckon	My favourite childhood reading in the s included the Eagle comic especially the adventures of Dan Dare Pilot of the Future where the brilliant artwork depicted orbiting cities jet packs and alien invaders When spaceflight became real the suits worn by the Soviet cosmonauts and their US astronaut counterparts were already familiar as were the routines of launching and docking My generation avidly followed the succession of heroic pioneering exploits such as Yuri Gagarin s first orbital flight and Alexei Leonov s first spacewalk  But of course the day most etched in our memories is July when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted the first human footprints on the moon s dusty surface The exploit seems even more heroic in retrospect given how primitive and untested the technology was Nasa s entire suite of computers was less powerful than a single smartphone today 
JUL20	Boris Johnson’s take on Islam is historically illiterate	 You mustn t let facts get in the way of a good story Boris Johnson was reported to have once told the French journalist Jean Quatremer in the early s It is a claim that defined much of his journalistic career and also appears to shape his pronouncements on the Muslim faith In an essay written by Johnson in and unearthed by the Guardian this week he claims that the Muslim world is centuries behind the west because of a fatal religious conservatism that prevented the development of liberal capitalism and democracy According to Johnson virtually every global flashpoint you can think of from Bosnia to Palestine to Iraq and Kashmir is defined by some sense of Muslim grievance Echoing his hero Winston Churchill s view that there was no stronger retrograde force than Islam Johnson believes that the real problem with the Islamic world is Islam  Johnson has been here before with his attacks last year on the Muslim faith as bizarre and unattractive and likening women in burqas to letterboxes and bank robbers This clearly played well with the Tory grassroots a recent poll of party members found that believe Islam is a threat to the British way of life whatever that is But Johnson s essay an appendix to a later edition of his book praising the Roman empire reveals a level of historical ignorance shocking even for such a political opportunist

JUL20	The government is fuelling homelessness by freezing benefits as rents soar	I left the job I loved at John Lewis to run to be the Conservative mayor for the West Midlands because I believed I could help restore pride in the region That meant expanding the economy and two years later business growth is strong However alongside the cranes and new offices rough sleepers are to be found in doorways and at mobile soup kitchens Behind closed doors there are thousands of people sleeping on sofas at the homes of friends or family families in B Bs and vulnerable people living in some of the worst quality shared housing  No one can take pride in that We have made some progress in tackling homelessness securing around m from the government to roll out Housing First a model of homeless support developed in Helsinki Finland Some homeless people have been given accommodation and support through the scheme since it was launched in the autumn It s a good start but we need to go much further 
JUL21	MPs must find the courage to stop a mindless no-deal Brexit	There can be no better illustration of the disconnect between the people and the Tory leadership than its wilful ignorance of the sheer scale of the growing countrywide opposition to its mindless stampede towards a no deal Brexit A poll by Hope Not Hate released on Monday will show that by a margin of two to one British people think that the economy their families economic prospects inward investment into the UK and even their exposure to terrorism will take a turn for the worse if we crash out of the European Union on October Only of women think no deal would be good for Britain  They are right to be worried the no deal Brexit we are now being offered is not the Brexit promised before and during the referendum What most people in this country want is the single market the common market Boris Johnson is on record as saying along with Personally I would like to stay in the single market Wouldn t it be terrible if we were really like Norway and Switzerland Really said Nigel Farage They re rich They re happy They re self governing

The UK must not take the bait	It was like something out of a movie To shouts of Allahu Akbar masked soldiers drop down ropes from a military helicopter on to a British oil tanker while Iranian navy speedboats surround the vessel By radio a voice warns the ship s captain in English If you obey you will be safe There is no doubt that the Friday seizure by Iranian Revolutionary Guards of a British flagged tanker the Stena Impero was in part a piece of theatre intended to appease domestic clamour for Tehran to assert itself It came in response to the UK military s July detention of an Iranian tanker the Grace in Gibraltar allegedly for shipping oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions But the tit for tat response should also be evaluated as part of the Iranian attempt to push back against Donald Trump s unilateral abandonment of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action the nuclear deal with Iran and his reimposition of economic sanctions  It is not clear if this strategy will do much to convince an exasperated Iranian public suffering under sanctions It is also fraught with risks of escalation threatening to further complicate UK Iran bilateral relations and endanger wider European efforts to save the JCPOA the international deal that committed Iran to strict curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions The risks are at the moment seen by Tehran as a necessary gamble to improve its international leverage if dipomatic negotiations resume Two weeks of fruitless mediation efforts to release the Grace prompted Iran s supreme leader Ali Khamenei to state The Islamic Republic and its committed forces will not leave this evil without a response It seems the Stena Impero is a pawn in a bigger game 
JUL21	Boris Johnson’s braggadocio will soon come back to haunt him at Number 10	For Theresa May the worst has been saved for last After taking her final prime minister s questions she will be driven to Buckingham Palace on Wednesday afternoon to perform the most personally disagreeable task of her time at the top After tendering her resignation which will be painful enough she will have the even more hateful duty of recommending that the Queen invites Boris Johnson to become the new prime minister  Her failings have been a major contributory factor to his ascent Tory activists think he will deliver them the Brexit that she couldn t and cheer them up after the torture of the May years Tory MPs believe that he has the campaign skills to scupper Nigel Farage and squash Jeremy Corbyn None of which is going to be much use to him in the critical opening weeks of a premiership that will inherit all the problems that defeated Mrs May and with some extra challenges of his own 
JUL21	We must talk about Palestine – without being antisemitic	It s hard to write or talk about antisemitism and the Labour party s handling of it without descending into deep despair and not just at the mirror the sorry tale is holding up to the whole of our society which seems to be becoming less tolerant more racist and less safe for minorities This is having greater consequences than the Labour leadership can imagine In particular it is stifling the ability of commentators and decision makers to talk sensibly about the real issues in Palestine  My mother is Palestinian These issues are deeply personal we still have family in the West Bank I am very worried that at this critical juncture in the history of the region activists parliamentarians and journalists feel that they cannot speak out for fear of being branded as antisemitic My plea is that we must speak more about Palestine not less and in this current climate it is something members of both houses of parliament have confided that they are more fearful than ever to do 
JUL21	The diary of Carrie Symonds, aged 31¾	Downing Street minus seven Usual mad dash to get in before lunch but enough time to see my Sun debate strategy was a game changer Long to tell B but he said he s got lifesaving surgery first thing so I m not on any account to worry he s met someone younger and stayed out all night 
JUL21	New PM, take note: the Iran crisis could escalate into war	The boarding and holding of the tanker Grace off Gibraltar while allegedly carrying Iranian crude oil to Syria in breach of European Union sanctions regime was clearly going to provoke a response Indeed the Tehran regime clearly articulated the fact that they would do something in retaliation  Having already carried out a number of attacks on international tankers in and around the strait of Hormuz a week ago an attempt was made to take a British flag registered ship the BP British Heritage It was only thwarted by the close presence of HMS Montrose 
JUL21	Guinness World Records is on a slippery slope	The world has a new steepest street But it s more than years old So did something happen to the previous steepest street Is this an off colour attempt to look on the bright side of a horrendous natural disaster No the previous steepest street is still there  So has the old one somehow got less steep perhaps because of a horrendous natural disaster No it s as steep as ever There is no horrendous natural disaster involved with this story So what s happened 
JUL21	The press frenzy for Brexit is ushering Boris Johnson into No 10	How do you explain the Boris Johnson phenomenon Is it the mainstream media s fault or should we lay the blame on the people On this the eve of his anointment as leader of the Conservative party and therefore as British prime minister it is fitting to ask why the unbelievable has become a reality  His sins both political and personal were recorded in detail in last week s Guardian Together they painted a portrait of a man who should never have come close to inhabiting No Downing Street But the blathering bumbling bluffer will be there all the same 
JUL21	Do you dream of a shorter working week? Reality might soon catch up...	Summer holiday season is upon us and one of the little sun lounger fantasies I like to indulge undoubtedly along with millions of others is the idea of jacking it all in and buying a one way ticket to somewhere drenched in sunshine all year round but so cheap you can make your savings stretch Then I get back to the and the September drizzle and file it away until next summer  But what if there s a bit more substance to this daydream at least to the notion of working less if not giving it up altogether The idea of a shorter working week may sound fantastical but it s gaining traction on the left last year the TUC backed a four day week and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell has commissioned a review into it 
JUL21	Cats looks mighty weird, but that’s why TS Eliot would have approved	Cats rule the internet Not since ancient Egypt have feline gods held such sway and given how many desperate office workers have been rescued by their online antics it should come as no surprise to learn that if there s one topic capable of distracting us from the grim realities of the news cycle it s those neurotic songbird slayers Except that it s not actually cats it s Cats  Since the trailer for Universal Studios star studded adaptation of the musical dropped on Thursday it s become the cynosure of baffled scrutiny For a brief moment Brexit Trump even Love Island might as well have ceased to exist Had it been a hit of course it would already have been forgotten but the unnerving weirdness or badness some might simply argue of Oscar winning director Tom Hooper s vision successfully united the internet in rapt revulsion as millions of eyeballs hate watched the likes of Jennifer Hudson and Rebel Wilson cavort bewhiskered through a neon lit netherworld 
JUL22	The fightback for liberal Britain begins here. Jo Swinson can lead it	While we all obsess about Britain s new Brexiteer Conservative government don t lose sight of this under Jo Swinson the new leader they have just elected by a clear majority the Liberal Democrats have a chance of leading a fightback for liberal Britain The great unrepresented liberal Britain that is that people around the world admire and miss To achieve this the Lib Dems must dramatically raise their game reaching parts of a troubled country that they have not touched for a century   The Strange Death of Liberal England is one of the most memorable book titles in British political history so I am tempted to conjure up The Strange Rebirth of Liberal England But liberal England never died and nor did liberal Scotland whence Swinson comes and liberal Wales Indeed the British Social Attitudes survey shows that in attitudes to sexual orientation and ethnicity British society has become more liberal in recent decades 
JUL22	By punishing Iran, Trump risks a full-scale war between our two countries	Twenty one years ago on my recommendation the UN general assembly named the year of dialogue among civilisations and signalled its commitment to peace and its rejection of war and violence The Iranian people despite their own historic grievances and troubled history opened a hopeful new chapter of engagement and dialogue with the Great Powers US UK and Russia These hopes however were dashed by the terrorist atrocities of September and their tragic aftermath in devastating wars in west Asia The catastrophic wars of Iraq and Afghanistan and other interventions in the region exacerbated already extant problems and paved the way for the growth of international terrorism civil wars in Syria and Iraq and the depredations and war crimes still unfolding in Yemen These conflicts have made the region unsafe and have impinged on security around the world  The Middle East once again faces a crisis not of its own making a crisis which was both unnecessary and avoidable
JUL22	I’m a Jewish woman. And, finally, I feel hopeful about Labour	As someone who is both black and Jewish Labour s antisemitism crisis has been uniquely distressing Traditionally the anti racist party in British politics Labour has always made me feel safe and secure as a black woman But as a Jewish woman I have felt increasingly alienated unwanted and threatened resulting in me cancelling my party membership in After years of failure in rooting out antisemitism a recent example being Chris Williamson s re admission to the party when I heard of Jeremy Corbyn s No Place for Antisemitism initiative this weekend I immediately felt cynicism and distrust It was to my surprise then that after exploring the website I found a renewed sense of hope For the first time since I had been given a reason to think that Labour can be better  Labour has now released statements and materials that actually feel sincere measured and compassionate
JUL22	Boris Johnson is as likely to avoid an Irish backstop as fly to the moon	Build that wall Build that wall So Donald Trump s fans roared their support for his xenophobic rants So scream fans of Boris Johnson s no deal Brexit He wants walls against the EU in place by October But he has no more idea than Trump about how to erect them This is despite having been foreign secretary and with a former Brexit negotiator Dominic Raab at his side  You cannot be outside a customs union and not have a border You cannot have friction and no friction A bureaucratic mountain of technology may withdraw the border some miles back but somewhere there must be tariffs payments forms regulation and inspection A tariff on a shipment of lamb is a barrier wherever it gets levied A chlorinated chicken inspection is a wall wherever it is done 
JUL22	Labour still doesn’t take the threat of Boris Johnson seriously	Jeremy Corbyn s support among Labour members has collapsed according to polling for the Times nearly two fifths of them would like to see the leader step down before the next general election say he s doing a bad job more than see antisemitism as a genuine problem and want the leader to stand down immediately  But one man s collapse is another s resounding mandate and the leadership is apparently taking solace from the fact that three fifths of the members are still supportive The continuing to back Corbyn into the next battle is not a vast reduction from the who supported him against Owen Smith s challenge in From this perspective the leader retains the force field he s had since his first election a year before that The parliamentary party can rebel and the mainstream media cavil all they like but with the members on his side Corbyn is unassailable 
JUL22	America's red scare is back. And it's racially tinged	The Republican party has come out swinging against socialism a strategy sure to be a mainstay of its campaigns Our opposition to our socialist colleagues the Wyoming senator Liz Cheney claimed referring to the congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Rashida Tlaib Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley has absolutely nothing to do with their gender with their religion or with their race It has to do with the content of their policies They are wrong when they attempt to impose the fraud of socialism on the American people They are wrong when they pursue policies that would steal power from the American people and give that power to the government  It s a bold line coming from the daughter of a man the former vice president Dick Cheney who did more to centralize power in the executive branch than perhaps any other public official in living memory It s also a bald faced lie Cheney s diatribe against socialism like Trump s racist railing against the same group of progressive freshman congresswomen to go back to where they originally came from has a long legacy in American history it s called red baiting 
JUL22	Boris Johnson, the prime minister? I’m sorry to say that I’m partly to blame	How can this be happening I have lost count of the number of times I have been asked this question in the past few weeks  What people want to know and I mean people from across the political spectrum is how Boris Johnson barring a serious upset is about to become prime minister first lord of the Treasury and generally in charge of everything How 
JUL22	I am a woman in my 60s – that doesn’t make me a granny	I am a year old woman and I am many things a writer poet editor dancer gardener but one thing I am not is a grandmother Despite how the world often chooses to represent me  Every other day you will probably see granny used in reference to older women on the BBC in broadsheets and tabloids in the local press on YouTube and other social media It s a veritable granny fest 
JUL22	I was hired to sell ice-cream for the summer – instead I got to read the classics	It was the summer after my first year of university and I was back in uniform for the first time since school The blue baseball cap and polo shirt combination was not glamorous and I hated wearing my hair up but the ice cream parlour in the Snowdonian village of my childhood was hiring and I needed the work  These sorts of summer jobs are on the decline among young people with technology at their disposal but I didn t have the option to become an influencer or an internet millionaire Back home everyone I knew worked a summer job but my distinctly posher university friends were off on adventures backpacking around South America repairing to their families houses in the south of France Interrailing I had already wasted a substantial wodge of cash on a quixotic attempt at a law degree that had me begging fervently to transfer courses before the tedium of property law actually killed me Back in the village I had worked so hard to leave I was doubting whether I could afford university at all 
JUL22	Why you don’t hear Trump or Farage talking about the tech revolution	This week s nightmare is the arrival of Boris Johnson the autumn brings the Brexit watershed Soon after the US election takes shape compounding the sense that politics everywhere is in a state of complete unpredictability All that is clear perhaps is that the forces gathered around Brexit Donald Trump and the various brands of European populism still think things are going their way  For some people everything comes down to the failures of neoliberalism and its inbuilt globalisation and the long aftershocks from the crash of Others with very good reason focus on racism and bigotry and the spectacle of white men who are apparently convinced that their time at the top is about to come to a close and therefore lashing out There are also people who seem to think that any sober cause and effect explanations of a global crisis are impossible amid the mess they tend to take refuge in rather specious ideas about collective derangement and national nervous breakdowns 
JUL23	Brace yourself, Britain, for a long stint of bad government under Boris Johnson	If Boris Johnson is the answer what was the question To the party members who voted for him the new Conservative leader offers a remedy to two ailments persistent membership of the EU and shrunken Tory popularity Applying generous doses of Boris branded tonic is meant to clear up both problems at once  About a third of Conservative members were unconvinced by this plan and with good reason Johnson s promise to deliver Brexit by October cannot be kept The UK might cancel its European treaty obligations on that date but there is no closure while the future relationship is unsettled The less amicable the separation the harder the negotiations that follow There are people who believe that Johnson is the best person for that job and there are people who have worked with him and understand what is involved There is no overlap between the two groups 
JUL23	Boris Johnson: the clown is crowned as the country burns in hell	Well here we are then Someone who could easily be rejected as a Guess Who character for looking too ridiculous is now to lead the country A man whose DNA profile is the exact same as a Bernard Manning joke A man who mentioned the hustings he had taken part in approximately seconds after Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis talked of the hustings held  With members of the Johnson family watching on and Jeremy Hunt looking for all the world like a sub who s never gonna get off the bench and knows it Boris Johnson was announced as the new leader of the Conservative party and in short order the new prime minister Elected by a staggering of the nation we can t say it isn t the will of the people 
JUL23	In believing Carl Beech, the Metropolitan police put the public at risk	Many months before the Panorama investigation into Operation Midland was broadcast in October I sat in a cafe in central London with a very senior officer who had just left the Metropolitan police He was there as a go between doing a favour to ex colleagues an unofficial channel trying to convey the Met s new thinking about investigations into historic sexual abuse in light of their failings over Jimmy Savile I asked him about his general approach when he came across allegations like the ones being made by the man we knew then as Nick and now as Carl Beech The officer spoke plainly as a principle he told me he tended to assume in cases like this that there was no smoke without fire  There ought to be a general rule that a celestial alarm bell will ring every time a police officer says that But none rang neither in Scotland Yard nor in enough newsrooms around the country Operation Midland continued for more than another year 
JUL23	The Lib Dems are deeply stained by austerity. Don’t trust them	The Liberal Democrats are back or so we re told with Jo Swinson s leadership victory being pitched as the rebirth of the party The unique conditions of Brexit have given the Lib Dems not only a reason to exist but the opportunity to detoxify their brand after their fatal coalition with the Conservatives and to cast themselves as a reforming progressive party in troubled times  And yet remarkably little has changed since the days when Nick Clegg stood laughing in the Downing Street rose garden next to David Cameron as he signed Britain up to years of sweeping public spending cuts When asked throughout this summer s leadership campaign Swinson and her opponent Ed Davey consistently defended her party s role in austerity measures In an interview with Channel News Swinson said she had no regrets about the coalition stating it was the right move to get our country back on track This is despite the fact it has been shown that austerity shrunk the British economy by bn and has even been linked to preventable deaths Swinson acknowledged there were policies we let through in coalition that we shouldn t have done naming the bedroom tax but remained unrepentant on a whole host of others 
JUL23	Brexit highlights Ireland’s divisions. But sport shows how united we can be	Depressed about Brexit There s always golf As Brexit threatens the economic and actual security of Ireland north and south maybe what we can lean into a little more on this island is the unifying power of sport Sport in Ireland overlaps with identities in curious ways but there are many moments when perceived divisions can fade into the green distance like a man from Offaly being cheered on at a course in Northern Ireland about to win the Open Tricolours being waved at Royal Portrush a chorus of ol s videos of Shane Lowry grinning as the Fields of Athenry is sung  Meanwhile Lowry s grandmother Emily Scanlon offered the most Irish of all anecdotes regarding sports nutrition on the Irish station RT I remember I minded him while the mother was working she said I had a turf box in the corner beside the range and when I d go up to the clothesline I d put him into it and he d have all the turf mould ate whether it worked his immune system or what I don t know He got there anyway Great gossoon young boy he was Turf mould may not be the next carrageen moss but the moments sport can offer up on their day are some tonic 
JUL23	How social media echo chambers fuelled the rise of Boris Johnson	Lots of people tell me they don t read the news any more Lots of people tell me they can t believe what is happening that Donald Trump may get another term that Boris Johnson will almost certainly soon be prime minister that we may crash out of Europe They tell me earnestly that someone they know who voted leave now wishes they hadn t so a second referendum will be a remain landslide Or they tell me Jeremy Corbyn will make it all better Or that they have never met an antisemite Or that white working class people who all live up north are to blame for everything Or that it is the fault of Eton s spawn or the mainstream media which of course is me I am actually related to some of the people telling me these things  Often I suck it up After all journalism is listening the rest is just showing off Then gratefully I return to my bubble and wonder what it will take to burst theirs 
JUL23	The world is literally on fire – so why is it business as usual for politicians?	Do you remember when the weather was a reliable source of innocuous small talk Hot today isn t it you would observe to a colleague as you stood awkwardly in the lift together They would reply with something about the garden needing rain then you would go back to ignoring each other Talking about the weather was uncontroversial It was safe It was oddly soothing  Sadly there is nothing soothing about the weather any more every day seems to bring new record breaking temperatures or extreme conditions June was the hottest month recorded on Earth July is on course to break that record The Arctic is having a sweltering summer that has sparked unprecedented wildfires According to the World Meteorological Organization these fires emitted as much carbon dioxide in one month as the whole of Sweden does in a year 
JUL23	The government wants to deport rough sleepers. We must resist this immoral act	In the diocese of Liverpool we see the struggle for a just society as a direct outworking of our faith in Jesus Christ who fed the hungry and cared for the poor That s why we say we re asking God for a bigger church so we can make a bigger difference  For me then the health of a just society is measured by the way it treats the poorest those on the edge of things That s why I support the mayor of Liverpool his colleagues and other councils across the country who are refusing to share sensitive personal data on non UK rough sleepers with the Home Office 
JUL23	The fightback for liberal Britain begins here. Jo Swinson can lead it	While we all obsess about Britain s new Brexiteer Conservative government don t lose sight of this under Jo Swinson the new leader they have just elected by a clear majority the Liberal Democrats have a chance of leading a fightback for liberal Britain The great unrepresented liberal Britain that is that people around the world admire and miss To achieve this the Lib Dems must dramatically raise their game reaching parts of a troubled country that they have not touched for a century   The Strange Death of Liberal England is one of the most memorable book titles in British political history so I am tempted to conjure up The Strange Rebirth of Liberal England But liberal England never died and nor did liberal Scotland whence Swinson comes and liberal Wales Indeed the British Social Attitudes survey shows that in attitudes to sexual orientation and ethnicity British society has become more liberal in recent decades 
JUL24	Think Johnson's 'blue terror' reshuffle means a no-deal exit? Think again	With the number of cabinet sackings far exceeding the Tory majority in the Commons Boris Johnson has started his reign as prime minister by unleashing a blue terror With Dominic Raab as his deputy and foreign secretary and Priti Patel as home secretary Johnson s cabinet is the quintessence of remainer nightmares  Some will say this means an immediate general election is likely interpreting a sharp pivot to the right as an attempt to outflank Nigel Farage and his Brexit party These appointments sound the no deal klaxon so loudly that it will be heard unequivocally in Brussels 
JUL24	This is a Vote Leave government now. There will be no one else to blame	The Queen s first prime minister was Winston Churchill Her th is a Winston Churchill tribute act So perhaps it s no surprise that Boris Johnson s debut performance as prime minister included a sub Churchillian riff extolling Britain s readiness not to fight the Nazi menace but to cope with a no deal exit from the European Union The ports will be ready and the banks will be ready and the factories will be ready and business will be ready and the hospitals will be ready he said until one half expected him to declare that we shall be ready on the beaches we shall be ready on the landing grounds we shall be ready in the fields and in the streets and in the hills  But if Johnson has always wanted to be Churchill the address he delivered on the steps of Downing Street and his first exercise of raw prime ministerial power suggest he wants to be two other people too Throughout his six week campaign for the Conservative leadership friends and enemies alike wondered which Johnson would prevail would it be the twice elected mayor of London who won over a Labour voting progressive city or would it be the leader of the Vote Leave campaign whose lies and insults have led the US president himself to hail him as the British Trump The complexion of his first cabinet suggests victory for the latter But there are also signs that he wants to be both that not for the first time he wants to have his cake and eat it 
JUL24	Boris Johnson’s optimism is a sales pitch that can only disappoint	It is clear now that Boris Johnson has a straightforward and easily understood plan to solve the hitherto intractable problem of Brexit In fact he has the same solution for most if not all of the problems that assail this country The answer is optimism or optimism on steroids the medicine his colleague Jacob Rees Mogg recently prescribed for his soon to be leader  This is a peculiarly American solution to a very British problem and raises yet another parallel between Johnson and his American partner in coiffure rhetoric and political style Donald Trump Much has been written about the similarities between the two leaders the trimming of reality to convenience the highly malleable indeed reversible points of principle the charisma and appeal to the mob But somehow it is the repeated sanctifying of optimism I find most disturbing 
JUL24	Britain is boiling, and ditching the duvet won't solve the problem	Buckle in Britain it might have been late getting started but it looks like we re set for another sweltering summer with record breaking highs of C forecast for Thursday By this point you know the drill swap the duvet for a sheet and a shared bed for a single wear shorts if your employer allows carry water with you on the train and get off at the next stop if you re feeling unwell The temperature will drop eventually in the meantime the spirit is broadly one of keep calm and carry on  We ve been here before Last year was marked not just by England s rocket fuelled run through the football World Cup but the concurrent six week spell from late June to mid August when daytime temperatures in parts of Britain consistently topped C F Even climate deniers were perturbed That summer was the joint hottest on record But then the mercury dropped bringing with it relief from the discomfort of the sweltering heat yes but also having to confront the visceral threat of climate crisis 
JUL24	As co-working spaces colonise cities, are workers paying the price?	Co working isn t just booming it s taking over our cities The co working space provider WeWork is the biggest occupier of office space in London after the government It has surpassed JP Morgan as the top commercial real estate holder in New York This week we learned it is being paid m in inducements to fill Brexit related office vacancies in Canary Wharf  It s not just WeWork Amsterdam based Spaces Regus s answer to WeWork just unveiled sq ft of co working spaces in New York s Chrysler building and is speedily adding new locations across Eastern Europe and Asia and the Pacific to its already impressive arsenal 
JUL24	Looking at naturists can be life threatening – as I found out to my cost	Parisian naturists in the Bois de Vincennes have complained about voyeurs ruining things for them Nudists have been allowed to do their thing in the park for two years but it seems they are being spied upon I sympathise but also wonder in the spirit of an age old conundrum if nudists in a forest are actually nudists at all if no one is watching them If you are hidden away in your own special area you kind of invite fascination How much better if there were nudists everywhere  In I cycled from Hamburg to Zagreb passing through both Germanys though united by then they felt very different the Czech Republic Austria Slovakia and Hungary I saw many wondrous things along the way none more so than a small urban park I pedalled past in the middle of Berlin It was a sunny autumn lunchtime and the park was busy with office workers taking a break Doing a comedy double take I saw that many of these people had removed all their clothes and were sunbathing quite naked All sizes and shapes of birthday suits were on display 
JUL24	Boris Johnson can use his affinity with Trump to calm the crisis over Iran	Boris Johnson is taking the helm with an urgent crisis brewing in the Gulf where Iran s seizure of a British oil tanker threatens to pull the UK and the international community into the escalating friction between Washington and Tehran But in crisis there is opportunity and the new prime minister should use his affinity with Donald Trump to de escalate responsibly while reinforcing the battered transatlantic relationship around Iran  Tehran has accused the tanker the Stena Impero of colliding with a fishing boat and violating international regulations However the seizure came shortly after Iranian leaders threatened to retaliate for the British seizure of an Iranian flagged vessel in Gibraltar over suspicions that the ship had violated European Union sanctions on Syria 
JUL24	Boris Johnson: the clown is crowned as the country burns in hell	Well here we are then Someone who could easily be rejected as a Guess Who character for looking too ridiculous is now to lead the country A man whose DNA profile is the exact same as a Bernard Manning joke A man who mentioned the hustings he had taken part in approximately seconds after Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis talked of the hustings held  With members of the Johnson family watching on and Jeremy Hunt looking for all the world like a sub who s never gonna get off the bench and knows it Boris Johnson was announced as the new leader of the Conservative party and in short order the new prime minister Elected by a staggering of the nation we can t say it isn t the will of the people 
JUL24	Who’s Matt Hancock? The health secretary’s only legacy will be how quickly he’s forgotten	I have never seen such an empty vessel as a cabinet minister This is one NHS chief executive s verdict on Matt Hancock s stint as health and social care secretary It is a harsh judgment but it reflects a widespread view among NHS bosses that if Boris Johnson s imminent formation of his first government leads to Hancock leaving for another job few will miss him Whether he stays or leaves history will judge his first possibly only year running the Department of Health and Social Care DHSC as something odd in ministerial tenures an irrelevance  Hancock is neither liked nor respected by those running NHS trusts They disliked Andrew Lansley and hated his health and social care bill but acknowledged his deep thinking about the health service and intense preparation for being the health secretary They had misgivings about Jeremy Hunt for his alienation of staff in pursuit of the government s ambition of a seven day NHS but belatedly respected him for him getting to grips with diffcult issues and ending the NHS s austerity funding 
JUL24	Only when we laugh: now even dad jokes can be funny	There are few things more likely to raise the hackles of a comedy snob than the notion of canned laughter A sitcom with a laugh track not so much canned these days as a recorded live audience reaction implies that it will be an old fashioned sort of comedy We are living in an era that rewards a more naturalistic approach  Gag soaked sitcoms such as Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt which barely give you time to honk before moving on to the next one liner do not feel the need to guide you to the punchline 
JUL25	This is no normal transition of power. It’s a hard Brexit coup	The passing of Theresa May and the ascension of Boris Johnson may have appeared to the casual observer as a colourful but nevertheless essentially conventional piece of British political continuity The public decencies insofar as such words can ever be used in connection with Johnson were in place The dignified but hapless former prime minister departed to the echo of the now traditional round of applause from MPs The outgoing leader s car entered Buckingham Palace to the solemn lilt of Huw Edwards s commentary as her successor waited in the wings to kiss hands On the face of things these were the familiar rituals of peaceful transition in British politics  Yet no one should have been taken in by the show this time For this is a political transition unlike any other It is a massive rupture not a seamless progression Its outcome is dark clouded in uncertainty Any idea that the events of July embody the same timeless magic of the peaceful passing of parliamentary power that constitutional experts like to celebrate is for the birds For this is an unprecedented partisan seizure of power by the radical part of the Conservative party that seeks Brexit whatever the cost It is a hard Brexit coup dressed up as politics as usual 
JUL25	Snakes, stupidity and sycophants: the horror of the Johnson cabinet	Another day another horror The new cabinet has met for the first time Oh and Boris Johnson has made his Commons debut as prime minister Horrors plural then We re living in a Hammer film my friends but one looped over and over where the protagonist enunciates only using vowel sounds and stuttering and the plot is him wreaking revenge on a nation because he once lost a game of fives and has never gotten over it  Here is all the action from the day I am so so sorry 
JUL25	We’ve yet to work out how to oppose Boris Johnson. It won’t be easy	Who wants to be a doomster Or a gloomster Get some pluck Get in a spitfire Be a king Buck up Make Britain Great Again Boris Johnson s stream of consciousness speech outside No followed by the night of the long knives was actually a manifesto followed by some swift stabs to the heart of those who possibly possess a modicum of talent  I have read the character assassinations God knows I have written many myself but they never really do the trick as character implies something solid and this prime minister is a shapeshifter His personality is whatever it needs to be I christened him Borisconi years ago for his absolute grip on both politics and the media and the endless affairs Of course he recognised in Italy s Silvio Berlusconi what he himself would ape Raw power He once wrote of Berlusconi s fantastic volcanic American self propulsion and of how he stands for optimism and confidence How is that in itself a political position Somehow it now is There is no point in denying it 
JUL25	This is a Vote Leave government now. There will be no one else to blame	The Queen s first prime minister was Winston Churchill Her th is a Winston Churchill tribute act So perhaps it s no surprise that Boris Johnson s debut performance as prime minister included a sub Churchillian riff extolling Britain s readiness not to fight the Nazi menace but to cope with a no deal exit from the European Union The ports will be ready and the banks will be ready and the factories will be ready and business will be ready and the hospitals will be ready he said until one half expected him to declare that we shall be ready on the beaches we shall be ready on the landing grounds we shall be ready in the fields and in the streets and in the hills  But if Johnson has always wanted to be Churchill the address he delivered on the steps of Downing Street and his first exercise of raw prime ministerial power suggest he wants to be two other people too Throughout his six week campaign for the Conservative leadership friends and enemies alike wondered which Johnson would prevail would it be the twice elected mayor of London who won over a Labour voting progressive city or would it be the leader of the Vote Leave campaign whose lies and insults have led the US president himself to hail him as the British Trump The complexion of his first cabinet suggests victory for the latter But there are also signs that he wants to be both that not for the first time he wants to have his cake and eat it 
JUL25	Don’t be fooled by Johnson’s ‘diverse’ cabinet. Tory racism hasn’t changed	Boris Johnson s new team has been labelled a cabinet for modern Britain a euphemism for non white with figures such as Priti Patel Sajid Javid James Cleverly and Alok Sharma appointed and Munira Mirza made head of the No policy unit While all this diversity may well make cabinet look more representative of the UK population it should not divert attention from the serious issues of racism within the party and with Johnson himself  Lest we forget the new prime minister has described African people as piccaninnies with watermelon smiles and compared Muslim women wearing the burqa to letterboxes and bank robbers Surrounding himself with a few black and brown cabinet ministers may be good for optics but it should be easy enough to see through the mirage 
JUL25	Boris Johnson is mere bluster. It’s Labour that is offering real optimism for the UK	It was a typical Boris Johnson performance in the Commons today all waving arms and blustering rhetoric  It s nothing new we re used to him offering us dead cats or even kippers But it shouldn t disguise the fact that he is committed to a dangerous hard right agenda 
JUL25	Our writers give their verdict on Boris Johnson’s new cabinet	Is he serious You could almost hear the country asking the question as Boris Johnson doled out his big cabinet jobs As home secretary we now have Priti Patel who broadcast her logic free support for the death penalty on primetime TV Our new foreign secretary is Dominic Raab the intrepid soul who apparently only recently discovered the existence of Calais In charge of the Treasury is Sajid Javid the ex investment banker who went off on a jolly to Australia while steelworkers at Port Talbot were facing the dole  In this government of none of the talents these gaffe prone substance free caricatures will have free rein As trade secretary Liz Truss will finally be able to introduce import substitution for British cheese Priti will doubtless cover Dominic s job in her family holidays 
JUL25	Will Dominic Cummings turn No 10 into a Nasa-style control centre?	Might one of Boris Johnson s first acts as prime minister be to renovate the offices in No According to his new senior adviser Dominic Cummings one simple way to improve the UK government is changing the spaces where decisions are made If Cummings gets his way out would go the polished wood tables fireplace and ticking antique clocks In would come banks of screens predictive computer models and untested cognitive tools Downing Street could look like more like a Nasa control centre than a stately home  And that s not all he would change Cummings has gone so far as to suggest one of his primary motivations for involving himself in Brexit was the once in a half century opportunity it would allow to fundamentally reform the British state Over the years he has repeatedly criticised Whitehall as achingly slow blindly driven by the news cycle staffed by ineffective conformists oblivious to evidence and out of touch with advances in technology He thinks the civil service is staffed by hollow men who are incapable of thinking wisely about big problems and acting on them 
JUL25	I flipped burgers at McDonald’s – and discovered the joys of insubordination	There was I discovered on obtaining a holiday job at McDonald s before embarking on A levels an immediate benefit and a simultaneous disbenefit The benefit was that on joining and becoming a crew member you were given free of charge a uniform The disbenefit was that on each shift you had to wear it The trousers were capacious the top deep blue and white with a stripy pattern This according to HR magazine was Ronald McD s attempt to utilise primary colours and pin stripes in line with the tailored feel of the power suit But even with the boat shaped hat that made you look like one of the Tracy family in Thunderbirds there really wasn t much power in that outfit And it wasn t much of a suit No wonder people dressed at work or arrived in outsized overcoats  I did hot and gruelling shifts cooking the burgers required for hamburgers cheeseburgers and Big Macs
JUL25	Don't despair over Boris Johnson – it's time for hope	Sterling slipped just a little on confirmation of Boris Johnson s ascent but another currency plunged optimism His was a triumph of self belief buoyed by privilege and untethered to ability or vision magical thinking without any magic or any thinking We are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self doubt and negativity he declared in his victory speech with better education better infrastructure more police fantastic full fibre broadband sprouting in every household It s hard to say which aspect of this list was more revealing its lack of ambition or the scepticism it prompted over his capacity to deliver even minor improvements to the nation s broadband Who even among his newly minted cabinet truly believes the central pledge of his premiership a Brexit deal or no deal that boosts anything apart from the Conservative party or its new leader In peddling Brexit lies in place of genuine aspiration Johnson has devalued hope itself  Enthusiasm among a rump of musty old Marxists for a no deal Brexit to speed the revolution amplifies this effect by ignoring the inevitable toll it would exact on everyone especially the most vulnerable Yet hope grounded in reality remains the best and only antidote to the regressive rightwing populism now flourishing on both sides of the Atlantic Switching off the news may feel like self care but the surest way to feel better is to make things better Optimism is a political choice that anyone with the time and resources to be active must take right now You ll find this surprisingly easy once you stop thinking in terms of what can t be done and focus on what you can do 
JUL26	Boris Johnson is uniting leave. Labour must do the same for remain	Take paces back and ask yourself what just happened Only when you appreciate what the Conservative party has just done can you begin to consider how Labour and the other opposition parties should respond Indeed the clearer the Tory move becomes the more obvious the duty of the opposition  Two months ago the Tories were crushed in the European elections their vote share reduced to just Their problem was that a rival had emerged making a much clearer pitch on the great question of the age namely Brexit Beaten by Nigel Farage s Brexit party the Conservatives reacted swiftly They dumped a leader deemed insufficiently full throated on Brexit replacing her with one whose message is unambiguous Boris Johnson has now taken office and appointed a new cabinet that leaves no doubt on Brexit the new government is fully committed not only to leaving the European Union but to leaving on October with or without a deal do or die 
JUL26	An election looms – and Labour must act now to puncture Johnson’s hubris	A general election is coming and Boris Johnson s ruthlessness in preparing for it has provoked private pangs of jealous admiration among prominent leftwingers There s no messing around here opponents and critics have been purged and an unapologetic hard right ultra Brexit administration has been formed Where Jeremy Corbyn would be denounced for Stalinist authoritarianism Johnson is applauded for strong decisive leadership Life is easier I suppose when you have most of the press and your own MPs enthusiastically on side Today s Sun newspaper splashes with Johnson s face superimposed on an image of the sun with the headline JOHNSUN Rodong Sinmun the official newspaper of North Korea s ruling party would have been too embarrassed to print something so fawning  The funeral rites for Corbynism are being read by those who seem to have forgotten that just over two years ago the election campaign began with Theresa May enjoying higher approval ratings than Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher at their peak and with Labour points behind the Tories In some current polls Labour is still ahead 
JUL26	Inside and outside cabinet, there are Tories worrying if they’ve done the right thing	Who is in the most turmoil in the Tory party Is it the moderate Tory MPs who decided to leave government this week in protest at Boris Johnson s policies or their colleagues who thought it better to accept a ministerial job Talking privately to both groups it s clear that neither side really knows who made the right decision   I m so up and down at the moment says one former minister I m not sure if I ve done the right thing But I ve done something and I suppose I had better live with it Others are celebrating publicly by going to the cricket while another has been joking that they now have the freedom to spend all weekend having sex though it s not clear whether this would have been prohibited in a Johnson government 
JUL26	The Spice Girls really do have a positive message. It just took me 20 years to get it	I was when the Spice Girls first single came out and already outside the upper age limit of their target market I remember seeing the video for Wannabe and being a bit sniffy about it Girl power was a bogus PR ploy Geri s espousal of Thatcherism was absurd and all that cavorting with Nelson Mandela at the famous press call was just the bloody end  The push up bras and belly rings are as cartoonish in their way as any made for kids TV
JUL26	How Russia spreads disinformation via RT is more nuanced than we realise	The fine handed out by Ofcom to the TV network RT formerly Russia Today for repeatedly breaching impartiality rules over its coverage of the Skripal poisoning is a powerful reminder of the tactics Russia employs to manipulate public opinion in the west The daily deluge of disinformation produced by RT and Sputnik is a vital component of the tactics that other authoritarian regimes are seeking to replicate  Monitoring and measuring the output of these state controlled broadcasters is vital to understand how hostile nations are attempting to influence audiences around the world by utilising fake news disinformation and propaganda A detailed analysis of the output of state controlled media often reveals a fundamental disparity between Russian owned outlets in the UK and the rest of Europe when comparing them to established news organisations The volume of coverage framing of coverage and average engagement with that coverage is at times widely disparate 
JUL26	This hard-Brexit cabinet could spell disaster for British farmers	As Boris Johnson takes the spotlight in the umpteenth act of the tragicomic farce that is Brexit one its most important plot lines remains dangerously offstage None of the protagonists have articulated a compelling narrative about how we are going to feed ourselves in the future Unnoticed however Johnson s reshuffle has manoeuvred those with the most destructive pernicious vision into the strongest positions Should they make their move it could soon be checkmate for British agriculture  Ever since Britain voted to leave the EU three long ago those involved in farming have been aware that we are facing a fork in the road One path offers the opportunity to build on our country s comparatively high standards and compete on quality sustainability and animal welfare The other road requires us to sign up to free trade agreements on terms that suit our competitors opening our borders to the worst horrors of industrial farming symbolised perhaps unfairly by the spectre of chlorine washed chicken This would push British farmers either to lower their standards to compete or drive them out of business altogether 
JUL26	If you can’t stand the heat … stop being a climate emergency denier	Since Monday Britain has felt like a sun bloated packet of supermarket pasta salad sweating and smelly abandoned at the bottom of a dog waste bin by turns greasy hot unpleasant swollen and revolting I have seen topless men resting beaded armpits on bus poles teenagers dipping their feet in bright green canals that are so choked with weed they seem hardly wet parks turned to hay parents wiping screaming and heat exhausted children with flannels outside long queues for swimming pools and car parks littered with ice cube bags and fizzy drink cans I have smelled other people s arse cracks and seen carrier bags of used cat litter create a fiesta of bluebottles around our communal bins I have left imprints on other people s furniture  In the words of my mother who lived through the heatwave with my newborn sister It s pretty hard to deny climate change in this But my friends if this week has taught us anything at all other than that strange slippery silvery feel of under breast condensation it is that Britain is not ready to live at C we are ill prepared for our changing climate 
JUL26	This cabinet signals the death of David Cameron’s Tory modernisation project	When David Cameron took over as Tory leader in he inherited a party that was downhearted after three electoral defeats It looked and felt out of touch with the nation symbolised by having just female MPs and two from ethnic minorities backgrounds He proclaimed the need for modernisation of both party and policies pledging to move back to the centre and give the parliamentary group a makeover This was resisted by his foes on the hard right some of whom even attacked the proclaimed pursuit of environmental reform  Cameron s modernisation worked on one level Look at Boris Johnson s cabinet and it is heartening to see four cabinet ministers from ethnic minorities sitting round the table He succeeds the second female prime minister a politician who once rightly questioned if her party was really at ease with st century Britain while women hold several key posts in the new government More than one in five Tory MPs are now female still far too few but a big advance along with from ethnic minorities and the same number saying they are gay or lesbian 
JUL26	Classical music is overwhelmingly white and male. My orchestra shows that can change	Across the cultural landscape the light of truth is working its way through the past Historical inaccuracies unattributed contributions and long lost gems all victims of male whitewashing are being restored and reinstated  Hidden Figures an Oscar nominated film of shows the incredible contribution of three pioneering black women Rosalind Franklin s work which enabled James Watson and Francis Crick to uncover DNA and claim a Nobel prize has only recently been fully recognised many years after her death From art to science and beyond the work of historically marginalised groups is being gloriously shared Except within classical music that is And to compound matters the errors of the past are being repeated today 
JUL26	Boris Johnson, tough on the economic causes of Brexit? Not likely	So farewell then Project Fear Out go the predictions of imminent economic catastrophe in comes Mr Brightside and his vision of the sunny uplands that lie ahead Before he became prime minister Harold Wilson talked of how the Britain of the future would be forged in the white heat of the technological revolution For Boris Johnson it is full fibre broadband  Little has changed since Then as now Britain was strong in science and rich in new ideas Then as now it was less good than other countries at exploiting them Wilson s optimism drained away after he arrived in office as Johnson s may well also and for the same reason a sterling crisis But for now the country will be love bombed with the new prime minister s can do spirit 
JUL27	Is Boris Johnson really ready to take an enormous electoral gamble?	Boris Johnson s appointment of a cabinet dominated by hardline Brexiters suggests he will adopt an uncompromising approach to Brexit one that will be hard to deliver given the current composition of the House of Commons But what if the goal is to change the Commons arithmetic via an early election Could a delivering Brexit campaign win him a parliamentary majority and if so where would he need to win and what would the risks be  The balance of power in the polls is far more fragmented now than when Theresa May called an early election in June Both the Conservatives and Labour have fallen sharply and now find themselves in a four way competition with the Brexit party which rose to support within months of its foundation and the Liberal Democrats whose anti Brexit stance has become more popular as opinion has polarised The Greens another strongly anti Brexit party have also gained substantial ground 
JUL27	Carl Beech – the plausibility of liars and the paucity of proof	Carl Beech s QC Collingwood Thompson was faced with a monumentally difficult task when just before lunch on Friday he rose to mitigate for the recently convicted serial child abuse accuser One point he made was that the Metropolitan police policy that complainants will be believed has had an influence on this whole case With another approach Mr Beech s allegations would have been dismissed  There is no harder task in advocacy than mitigating after a jury has convicted your client of every count on the indictment and I am reluctant to criticise Mr Thompson but the argument that the police should not have been so stupid as to take Beech seriously was probably best left to others 
JUL27	Female desire is all the rage. But are the stories still too driven by men?	What women want is a supposedly elusive mystery that has preoccupied writers for centuries It s the question posed to the rapist knight in Chaucer s The Wife of Bath s Tale whose life depends on finding the correct answer In the film What Women Want knowing that was a telepathic gift magically bestowed on Mel Gibson s sleazy ad executive by a freak accident a sly suggestion that this is the only way a man could hope to understand the complexity of a woman s desires  Nancy Friday s s books My Secret Garden and its successors supposedly lifted the lid on women s fantasies sold millions of copies and were received as either groundbreakingly feminist or damagingly anti feminist depending on who you asked EL James s astronomically successful Fifty Shades trilogy was credited with opening up a conversation about sexual power dynamics while reinforcing the most depressingly traditional and reactionary of them 
JUL27	Tessa Thompson: Valkyrie’s real superpower is coming out on screen	For the past couple of years Tessa Thompson has been explaining that as she is in the comic books her Marvel Cinematic Universe character Valkyrie is a bisexual woman She s bi And yes she cares very little about what men think of her What a joy to play Thompson tweeted in In Thor Ragnarok arguably the best Marvel movie especially if you enjoy Evil Cate Blanchett and humour They even shot a scene that showed a woman leaving Valkyrie s bedroom Watch out censors Cover your eyes prudes though it was cut from the final edit  When Marvel rolled out its fourth phase of superhero movies at San Diego Comic Con last weekend Thor Love and Thunder sounded like an embarrassment of riches Ragnarok director Taika Waititi remains at the helm which is promising enough Natalie Portman s character Dr Jane Foster ends up with Thor s powers becoming Mighty Thor And Valkyrie is back as King of Asgard 
JUL27	Boris Johnson plans to frighten Europe then charm it. Here’s why he’ll fail	The new prime minister insists blind ambition is enough Like Peter Pan if we do believe we do we do then it will come true We can have a new exit deal with the European Union within days without the undemocratic Irish backstop because he wills it so This Tinkerbell delusion is about to be tested on the wheel of harsh reality when Boris Johnson goes to meet his European colleagues But even his first step has backfired When he unwisely upped the ante by making refusal of the Irish border backstop a precondition for talks the EU negotiator Michel Barnier immediately rejected the move Now Johnson will have to back down even to get a meeting  The prime minister s strategy however remains clear he will combine public threats and private charm First he will frighten Europe by giving every impression of going hell for leather for a no deal Brexit He has certainly appointed the right team to frighten them Dominic Raab Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings Like us EU leaders have seen the movie And then he hopes the leaders will melt in the face of his personal charm when he comes to visit them 
JUL27	The prime minister has a bust of his Greek hero in No 10. But Johnson is no Pericles	The bust that will sit on Boris Johnson s Downing Street desk we are told is not one of Winston Churchill but that of his true hero Pericles As the Brexit dawn breaks over the horizon is this good news  The champion of Athenian democracy in the fourth century BC came to power through valour in battle and the gift of the gab carefully spun by the historian Thucydides

JUL28	Boris Johnson is channelling a punk ethos to force through Brexit. It could work	 How can wealth persuade poverty to use its political freedom to keep wealth in power Here lies the whole art of Conservative politics in the th century  Those words were written by the Labour hero Aneurin Bevan seven years after the end of the second world war and a decade before the arrival of the Beatles but their power endures Indeed the imminence of Brexit and the entry into Downing Street of yet another moneyed Old Etonian prompts much the same question though Britain s current circumstances demand that it should be slightly rephrased So let us turn to the Irish writer Fintan O Toole s book Heroic Failure which updates Bevan s point 
JUL28	A British honours system rooted in empire is not fit for purpose	How should our society reward those who serve it well In times past it was simple The monarch not just a symbol of society but then its embodiment proffered wealth land and title In these halcyon days of democracy neither the Queen nor the prime minister can give chums and lackeys pots of gold and tracts of Lincolnshire but some things stay the same on our behalf they still distribute preferment in the form of honours  It is truly an anachronism and by tinkering with its flaws those who control the system yearly seek to make it more reflective of a modern age But they delude themselves for even on its own terms as a rough and ready mechanism for giving all sections of society the chance to be recognised for outstanding service and contribution the system does not work 
JUL28	Spoof or truth? The plucky local reporters who took on the tsar of Russia	A few columns ago I cited a story often told among journalists for fun and to caution against self importance usually in vain Variously attributed to small newspapers in remote locations at some time in the th century an editorial discussing Russian foreign policy is said to have thundered We warn the Tsar  The source is sometimes said to have been a newspaper in Tasmania the Mercury and sometimes a paper in Nelson New Zealand In the column I said the story might be apocryphal As often happens readers and researchers mobilised so here is an update 
JUL28	Corbyn must choose: lead the alliance against the Brexit right. Or step aside	Britain is not a rightwing country There is no appetite to go on a national war footing with an accompanying recession in order to leave the EU without a deal No appetite either for relishing the resulting decades of distrust and animosity with the rest of our continent  There remains overwhelming attachment to the idea of the United Kingdom still substantial attachment to the idea of the European Union and wide distrust of Donald Trump s US The great majority do not believe our major institutions the civil service the Bank of England the judicial system are broken because they will not blindly sign up to a no deal Brexit 
JUL28	Mr Johnson swears off an early election, but his sweaty aroma says otherwise	Britain s briefest prime minister was George Canning in the early th century who lasted just days He had the excuse that he died A new record will be set if Boris Johnson is impelled to call an autumn election and the voters put the boot to his backside The May premiership will have been followed by the mayfly premiership He will be deposited in the dustbin of history as the fool who clawed all the way up to the pinnacle of the greasy pole only then to almost instantly plunge off it He has sufficient self knowledge to grasp that this ignominy would be hugely satisfying not just to the great swaths of the country who would think that fate richly deserved but to many of his colleagues as well So when he swears that he has no intention of calling an election before the end of October I almost believe him My hunch is that he is extremely scared by the idea Like many of his kind outward bravado is the bluffer s mask on a pulsating mass of insecurities  Most of Westminster is increasingly convinced nevertheless that an election is coming and it is not hard to see why The speeches introducing himself to the country as its prime minister have not been those of a man settling in for a long slog to They exude the sweaty aroma of a leader warming up for a dash to the country He seeks to frame the argument as a contest between his blustery vision of a golden age for the greatest place on Earth and the negativity of opponents whom he casts as the doubters the doomsters the gloomsters Deploying optimism can be effective as a campaign device and flamboyant pledges can seduce the gullible but only during the shortish interval before reality catches up with the rhetoric 
JUL28	Europe’s Greens are on fire... and it’s not just because of the sweltering heat	As Europe suffers another summer of record breaking heatwaves it is worth reflecting on the group perhaps least happy to benefit from the soaring temperatures Green parties across the continent which are however in a better electoral position than ever  In May s European parliament elections the Greens won more seats and more of the vote than in Domestically the German Greens participate in a majority of state governments and top national polling the president of Austria is a Green Independent and Greens have secured record vote shares in recent elections in Finland Belgium and the Netherlands They are also poised to pick up votes in forthcoming Swiss and Austrian elections Although setbacks in Denmark and Sweden highlight the importance of national context Greens have been gaining footholds outside their historical strongholds and are surging in polls in Ireland and the UK 
JUL28	Nigel Farage is the malign spectre haunting Boris Johnson’s new government	 We in this government will work flat out to give this country the leadership it deserves announced Boris Johnson in Downing Street His would be a government of pluck and nerve An authentically Conservative government whose powers of organisation and determination no one should underestimate  His government certainly should not be underestimated but not for reasons Johnson can ever admit It has no pluck but what a nerve 
JUL28	Twitter won’t ruin the world. But constraining democracy would	Has the retweet ruined the world Chris Wetherell the software developer who built Twitter s retweet button thinks so Introduced in retweeting transformed the social media landscape he suggests by allowing people to pass on information without having bothered to digest it The result has been the incentivising of extreme polarising and outrage inducing content Jack Dorsey Twitter s CEO is considering adopting incentives to encourage more consideration before spread  The debate over the retweet button may seem arcane and geeky It is though a fascinating lens through which to understand many contemporary social issues It reveals how social anxieties are often played out in debates about technology and how such debates reflect and exacerbate broader social prejudices

JUL29	Boris Johnson’s crew will repel voters – there’s no need to fear him	He goes nuclear Standing in Faslane Trident submarine base finger on the button our prime minister s Brexit strategy is MAD mutually assured destruction His preposterously nicknamed Brexit war cabinet met for the first time on Monday Every minister has been turbocharged to prepare for the great no deal blitz in three months time The idea is to terrify the enemy the effect will be to petrify ourselves shocking and awing us into understanding the full implications of no deal   There are no areas of relevance to the economy where the UK EU and the business community are prepared well enough for no deal a CBI report said on Monday No one is ready nor can they ever be was the warning A few sandbags will only hold back the flood waters briefly In response the government announced a m public awareness information bombardment nine out businesses and exporters are unprepared for no deal obstacles the road haulage licences phyto sanitary vet checks pages of manifests and customs dockets to be stamped and authorised delaying them at borders 
JUL29	Jeremy Corbyn, I no longer want to be a member of your Labour party	Dear Jeremy  Britain is in a moment of peril the UK facing an existential crisis a combination of Brexit and Boris Johnson reducing our country to a global laughing stock I see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it Whatever the denials Johnson has embarked on a crash and burn strategy deliberately aimed at creating the circumstances for a general election setting up the EU parliament and the civil service in a grotesque perversion of the truth as the reasons he has no option but to call one 
JUL29	Boris Johnson doesn’t really care about Scotland – he’s pushing it away	Like Theresa May before him in Boris Johnson has made the journey to Scotland very early in his prime ministership Johnson went north this week to try to show how much he cares about what May called our beloved union and what he characteristically calls the awesome foursome Like May Johnson did this not because Scotland is inscribed on his heart but because Brexit is threatening to revive the clamour for Scottish independence If ever there was a case of trying to shut the political stable door after the horse has bolted this is it  It is conceivable that in a more flexible politician than May might have managed to reach some kind of accommodation with the Scottish parliament in the aftermath of the Brexit vote It would of course have been a very tall order to persuade the nationalist led government of a country that had voted strongly to remain to weaken its commitment to the EU But if May had offered to devolve some powers direct from Brussels to Holyrood had pursued a soft Brexit that kept Britain in the EU single market and had not made an end to free movement a non negotiable part of her stance it is possible no more than that that the mood in Scotland might not have shifted towards independence in the way it has now begun to do 
JUL29	The Vote Leave gang now running Britain do not want to govern. They want to win	Life moves pretty fast as the philosopher Ferris Bueller observed A week ago the question was how come Tory members were about to choose the next prime minister Today the question is how come we are suddenly being governed by a rightwing populist single issue campaign group  In the past few days it has become quite clear that at heart Boris Johnson s new government is essentially a reunion party for the Vote Leave gang that triumphed in the EU referendum 
JUL29	Putin’s treatment of protesters and rivals shows weakness, not strength	Vladimir Putin is no ordinary two faced politician For Russia s Janus like president double speak disingenuousness and duplicity are a way of life For years he has shown himself the master of having it both ways But is he about to be found out As riots shake Moscow with the promise of more to come is an end to the long dark night of the Putin supremacy a dawning possibility  On the infrequent occasions when Putin openly presents himself to the Russian public he cultivates the persona of a caring fatherly figure not unlike a tsar valiant in the cause of people and nation Kremlin publicists project images of a bare chested no nonsense tough guy and stern stalwart patriot as was the case on Sunday when he was pictured reviewing a St Petersburg naval parade 
JUL29	From Brexit hoarding to Iran’s uranium stores: why stockpiling is a heap of trouble	These days our fears being spoilt for choice can take many shapes and sizes Mine have settled on a vague image of an ill fated stash a giant heap of trouble Is the age of the terrible stockpile upon us  The stockpile exudes foreboding Recently Iran confirmed that its uranium stockpile had exceeded the limit originally set by the nuclear deal You ll also remember this concept as mundane as a store cupboard as frightening as a cache of semi automatics from the many news stories about Brexit no deal preparations carmakers gathering parts supermarkets amassing nonperishable goods 
JUL29	How can the Tories' moralising report on prostitution completely ignore austerity?	When Conservative MP Fiona Bruce chairs an inquiry into sex work you don t hold your breath for a triumph of progressiveness This is a politician who is anti abortion and has repeatedly voted against equal marriage And yet the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission report The Limits of Consent Prostitution in the UK published last week still shocked in its lack of impartiality  At least the authors were upfront about their commitment to ideology over evidence claiming decisions around public policy cannot be resolved with reference to evidence alone and instead undertaking a deep dive into the ethical questions around prostitution 
JUL29	What Jacob Rees-Mogg's language rules reveal about him	Jacob Rees Mogg must be in seventh heaven right now His obsession with anachronistic rules and rituals finally has a professional justification Boris Johnson has made him leader of the House of Commons a British institution more steeped in arcane ritual than almost any other He even has a bonus title Lord President of the Council complete no doubt with complicated modes of address I m sure he s checked the entry in Debrett s and will be correcting anyone who gets it wrong  Because he s a stickler for that kind of thing it emerged at the end of last week that he has a list of banned words and style rules that he asks members of staff to apply in written communication How he polices oral communication is unknown One thing I would say it s probably best to avoid asking him where the toilet is 
JUL29	Not one of the Fortnite World Cup's 100 finalists was a woman. Why?	This weekend the best Fortnite players in the world gathered at Flushing Meadows in New York to compete in the game s first ever World Cup Finals for m m in prize money Tens of thousands of spectators packed the famed Arthur Ashe stadium to watch the action live and many millions more viewed on Twitch and YouTube Fortnite is after all one of the biggest entertainment brands on the planet played by hundreds of millions Amid all the hype and fanfare around the finals however one depressing fact remained unavoidable not a single one of the finalists was female  Despite the growing popularity of professional gaming throughout the world the audience figures for competitive gaming have reached m this year female competitors remain scarce There certainly are high profile examples of female pros trans woman Sasha Scarlett Hostyn is one of the most successful Starcraft II players in the world Katherine Mystik Gunn is the industry s highest paid female pro gamer and won the SyFy channel s reality TV show WCG Ultimate Gamer and Fortnite has stars such as One Shot Gurl and Loeya But you could watch a year of big tournaments whether it s Call of Duty League of Legends or Hearthstone and count the number of female competitors on the fingers of one hand 
JUL29	It’s time for business to show some spine and come out against a no-deal Brexit	Boris Johnson Brexit and no deal are now ingrained in the national psyche The government is to launch a mass advertising campaign aiming to prepare us for crashing out of Europe Blitz spirit Tin hats Nothing that a bit of optimism won t solve  In the EU referendum result was seen by many as the worst UK foreign policy calamity since Suez an egregious act of economic self harm It would cause irreparable damage to Britain s place in the world Business groups went into emergency session expressing their dismay and trying to work out what to do for their members I was then running the UK s creative industries body of which had backed remain What would happen to Britain s much vaunted openness How would we continue to attract global talent 
JUL30	Whenever Trump says ‘infested’, we know he’s talking about people of colour	I ve never accused anyone of being prone to infestations But if I were inclined to sink that low I suspect my attention would be directed towards the th president of the United States It s not all Donald Trump s fault Who can blame anyone for spending most of their life in New York a city I love despite the fact that it harbours one rodent for every four people  Trump hardly had a choice about moving to the White House in home for two centuries reportedly to an unwanted population of rats ants and even raccoons Yet it s hard to avoid holding Trump directly responsible for the wider range of public health hazards reported at his luxury Mar a Lago resort were reported in the three years to including soiled kitchen utensils and potentially parasite affected smoked salmon Hard too to ignore the fact that his son in law Jared Kushner has been described as a slum landlord for the multiple health and safety violations reported in his family firm s Baltimore properties including mice maggots and mould 
JUL30	Boris Johnson dropping the Mark Field investigation is an insult to women	When I watched the video of Mark Field s actions against the Greenpeace protester Janet Barker I had a visceral reaction Tears rushed into my eyes when confronted with the rage in his expression the shock on her face I wasn t alone Many women I spoke to saw the assertion of a brutal kind of male dominance Some knew all too well the moment when a man aggressively decides that an outspoken woman must be put in her place  For those of us who know the reality of male violence against women this looked like a moment when a pervasive culture of male entitlement escaped into the open 
JUL30	I could not be in a government that advocated a no-deal Brexit	A new prime minister enters Downing Street promising to help the less advantaged bring prosperity and opportunity to every area of the country and make a success of Brexit Conservative MPs cheer a new era begins and there is a bounce in the polls Three years ago that was Theresa May and the rest as they say is history Our new prime minister is well versed in history so undoubtedly he will know the famous quote that history repeats itself first as tragedy then as farce  Last week I left the government I would not have signed up to Boris Johnson s pledge to leave the European Union on October with no deal if necessary Initially he said leaving without a deal was a million to one possibility However the rhetoric soon changed to the more confrontational tone of do or die He has even rejected negotiations over a time limit to the Irish backstop Now only a completely new withdrawal agreement would be acceptable New red lines have been introduced for the political declaration that will shape our ongoing relationship with our former partners There is talk of no deal preparations being ramped up but in reality these are mitigations 
JUL30	When I joined my father on the building site, I saw a different side to him	Sitting on a bag of sharp sand I watched a group of three men pull out plastic boxes of sandwiches packets of rolling tobacco small newspapers and bars of chocolate This was years before smartphones and so during our mid morning tea break as my father squeezed the lukewarm bag of PG Tips between fat dust encrusted fingers wringing out the last drops of caffeine the group of builders around me chatted idly about traffic the cost of petrol a new one way system pubs music trips to the woodyard and their morning s work  During my school holidays or if I ever wanted some quick money for a haircut holiday or new dress I would spend a day or two working on a building site with my father As a former labourer turned surveyor he had been made redundant during the s recession and gone back to labouring His jobs tended to be small local and fairly eclectic putting in a new fireplace laying a floor building a kitchen extension converting an attic From about April to September he worked in bare feet as much as he could he listened to Radio or compilation tapes of west African blues Pacific guitar reggae rock and roots music he would take on several jobs at once and never once wore a hi vis shirt 
JUL30	Leo Varadkar looks like an adult because the UK is acting like a spoilt toddler	In June Leo Varadkar entered his third year as taoiseach he s now on his second British prime minister and seemingly his th border impasse Boris Johnson says the backstop Theresa May negotiated with the EU has to go while the pro Brexit ranks of ministers backbenchers and press can t decide whether Ireland s leader is a bluffer an EU stooge or a tin pot hardman drunk on power  What none of them has considered is the obvious truth in a time when faith in politicians is collapsing in the UK the rumblings mumblings and bumblings of Brexit have strengthened Varadkar s political position to a degree they can t comprehend 
JUL30	#UnfollowTrump: why we should stop engaging with the US president on Twitter	Ohmygod you are never going to believe what Donald Trump said on Twitter this morning It sounded like it was written by an extremely racist and unusually stupid seven year old nevertheless it has already had a million retweets and gazillion replies and inspired approximately bn thinkpieces  That my friends is what you call an evergreen story Every single day the president of the US tweets bigoted and factually incorrect nonsense and every single day his tweets seem to constitute of the news we are stuck in a hellish groundhog day that rotates around Trump s verbal diarrhoea Important issues get shoved to the sidelines as we argue about whether Trump s latest racist comment means he is a racist spoiler yes hypothesise about what covfefe signifies or cackle over typos such as Prince of Whales 
JUL30	What’s in Boris Johnson’s £100m no-deal preparation leaflets? Here’s a taster	A few weeks ago Boris Johnson insisted in one of the Conservative leadership hustings that the chances of o deal were a million to one against Smash cut to him assembling a war cabinet to step up no deal Brexit plans and work round the clock under the assumption that no deal is definitely going to happen  At this news the pound fell at an alarming rate pretty much acting in the opposite manner to Johnson on a zipline and hit a new month low On the bright side we will soon hit parity with the euro essentially finally joining to the currency by the back door and it s all thanks to Brexiteers 
JUL30	Hey Siri! Stop recording and sharing my private conversations	A news story in the Guardian last week confirmed what many Apple users likely already suspected Siri Apple s voice assistant has the power to record private conversations and these audio clips aren t always just stored on a server a number of samples are passed along to third party human contractors who are paid to listen to them  This isn t as simple as a voice assistant spying on its users the report revealed that Apple s contractors listen to the clips as part of the company s quality control measures working out whether Siri was triggered accidentally or on purpose and whether its response was entirely correct This practice is not explicit in Apple s customer facing privacy documentation and due to errors in triggering Siri the sound of a zip the whistleblower said can often set Siri off contractors end up overhearing private conversations including drug deals business meetings sex and private medical appointments 
JUL30	Boris Johnson’s crew will repel voters – there’s no need to fear him	He goes nuclear Standing in Faslane Trident submarine base finger on the button our prime minister s Brexit strategy is MAD mutually assured destruction His preposterously nicknamed Brexit war cabinet met for the first time on Monday Every minister has been turbocharged to prepare for the great no deal blitz in three months time The idea is to terrify the enemy the effect will be to petrify ourselves shocking and awing us into understanding the full implications of no deal   There are no areas of relevance to the economy where the UK EU and the business community are prepared well enough for no deal a CBI report said on Monday No one is ready nor can they ever be was the warning A few sandbags will only hold back the flood waters briefly In response the government announced a m public awareness information bombardment nine out businesses and exporters are unprepared for no deal obstacles the road haulage licences phyto sanitary vet checks pages of manifests and customs dockets to be stamped and authorised delaying them at borders 
JUL30	Jeremy Corbyn, I no longer want to be a member of your Labour party	Dear Jeremy  Britain is in a moment of peril the UK facing an existential crisis a combination of Brexit and Boris Johnson reducing our country to a global laughing stock I see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it Whatever the denials Johnson has embarked on a crash and burn strategy deliberately aimed at creating the circumstances for a general election setting up the EU parliament and the civil service in a grotesque perversion of the truth as the reasons he has no option but to call one 
JUL31	Boris Johnson’s threat of a no-deal Brexit will not break EU unity	No matter what Boris Johnson or his new Vote Leave cabinet threaten and the expectation in Brussels is that no deal planning will be ramped up in an attempt to intimidate other EU countries be in no doubt there isn t time to limit the damage of a sudden severance from the world s largest trading bloc this Halloween  Unless a further extension is requested or article is revoked by October when the current extension of UK membership expires a dramatic shock awaits the global economy and we all stand to lose The few who may prosper are the wealthy bankers and hedge fund managers who have already bet on chaos 
JUL31	My sexual assault case was dropped because I wouldn’t hand over my phone	Vera Baird QC the newly appointed victims commissioner for England and Wales has been making headlines for her support of a civil liberties campaign which argues that rape case phone search requests amount to an illegal digital strip search Police and prosecutors have warned that in some cases if victims do not allow the contents of their phones to be downloaded their investigations may be abandoned Just of rape cases lead to a charge or summons  Today the London rape review has said more must be done to end the excessive intrusion into personal data through the criminal justice service in rape cases I reported my own sexual assault to the police with the intention of stopping a dangerous and sadistic predator from ever hurting another woman again As part of my healing process I needed to take power back but I ended up feeling more powerless after a two and a half year investigation that I can only describe as torture The crown would make requests for deeply personal information such as counselling notes with the ultimatum that if I refused they wouldn t pursue my case any more This caused panic attacks and crippling anxiety and my previously successful career began to suffer Eventually my case was dropped because I refused to give the government access to the entire contents of my mobile phone Many victims talk about their experiences with the criminal justice system being more traumatic than the assault itself I share those sentiments because I was left feeling I could be raped with impunity 
JUL31	Blaming Leo Varadkar for no deal is bizarre – even for Britain’s media	Leo Varadkar Ireland s prime minister is being demonised by the Brexit supporting section of the British press His determination to stick by the backstop provision in the EU withdrawal agreement has particularly outraged the Daily Telegraph and the Sun  Both papers with tacit support from the Daily Express are engaged in a tactic familiar to those who down the years witnessed the treatment that has been handed out to homegrown politicians such as Tony Benn Michael Foot Neil Kinnock and of course Jeremy Corbyn 
JUL31	Should people without children be banned from Disney World?	If you re not a fan of unbridled capitalism please brace yourself I am sorry to report that an EXTREMELY EMPHATIC Facebook post is going viral The post in question is from an anonymous mother who is outraged people without kids have the temerity to holiday at Disney World   It pisses me off TO NO END When I see CHILDLESS COUPLES AT DISNEY WORLD she explains DW is a FAMILY amusement park Yet these IMMATURE millennials THROW AWAY THEIR MONEY ON USELESS CRAP The outburst appears to have been prompted by a woman in some very SLUTTY shorts buying a pretzel This contributed to a very long pretzel queue meaning our protagonist s kid could not get their hands on a salty snack I fucking hate childless women with a BURNING PASSION the post ends There are several angry emoji faces for emphasis Just in case you know the exclamation marks didn t do the trick

JUL31	I was only going to give up alcohol for a month but I wasn’t prepared for the impact it had	Now what I have given up alcohol for a month That s nothing special Thousands of people do Dry July or Feb Fast or some random month But it is a big thing I hadn t had days off alcohol my entire adult life  The reason I thought it was a good idea isn t unique either It s boringly familiar I m middle aged and after drinking modestly for decades it had crept up One glass of wine a night became two and then three and no point in skirting around the facts here too often it was a bottle sometimes more Occasionally if I was particularly anxious I d buy a bottle of wine during the day and drink the lot 
JUL31	Is this fascism? No. Could it become fascism? Yes	Amid the global rise of rightwing populism fascist has become a common indeed over used epithet The F word is convenient for critics of the new wave of populism seeking as it does to tie their opponents to historical movements which nearly all of mainstream society regards as deplorable But the word is convenient for the right too allowing them to wave away their critics as overwrought and deranged while avoiding serious discussion of the substance of their policies and rhetoric  Even the Trumpified Republican party is not a fascist movement and Trump is certainly no Hitler Full blown fascism usually emerges under the pressure of economic collapse or existential war but it is constructed from pre existing social and political raw materials But while the Trump era hasn t seen the rise of a true fascism in the United States it has given us sharp and painful insights into the raw materials out of which a future American fascism might be constructed 
JUL31	Police and the private security industry are too cosy for comfort	Two recent news stories have shone a light on the revolving door between the police and the security industry  The Guardian has revealed that Crossrail employed the security company Control Risks to keep tabs on union members who were campaigning to reinstate a sacked colleague Emails released to the electrician Frank Morris show that this monitoring involved weekly briefings on the efforts by the Blacklist Support Group and Unite the union to win Morris his job back Both Control Risks and Crossrail have denied this was anything more than using publicly available information from social media accounts

AUG1	£2.1bn on no-deal preparations? It will seem like peanuts if Britain crashes out	The bn for no deal planning announced by the government this morning is at once a sum that is obscenely big and hopelessly small The shadow chancellor John McDonnell was right to label it an appalling waste of taxpayers cash  It beggars belief that the government is spending billions bn so far this year on contingency planning in case it decides to take us into a self imposed economic disaster that is entirely avoidable On the other hand if Boris Johnson is deluded enough to proceed with crashing Britain out of the EU without a deal and many of his actions as prime minister suggest that he is the couple of billion announced this morning will feel like small change compared with what the government and businesses will have to spend to mitigate the long term economic pain of no deal 
AUG1	A Brighton drag artist in Bayreuth would not have fazed Wagner	Picture this A black British drag artist all decked out in a blond wig high heels pink tights and a tutu takes a curtain call at the Bayreuth festival and is vigorously booed and later horribly trolled by the so called Wagnerian ultras in an exclusive black tie audience that includes the German chancellor Angela Merkel herself  This is not fake news or some invented nightmare hallucination On the contrary such an event actually took place last week at Richard Wagner s own theatre in Bavaria where lovers of the composer flock each summer to hear his works at what is without question the most written about opera festival of them all 
AUG1	No one should have to pay to pee: it’s time for a toilet fightback	You re running late you need to pee but arriving at the toilet turnstiles you realise that the lack of a shiny p piece prevents you from carrying out a basic bodily function You join the cash machine queue staring daggers at the guy who is in no rush to find his bank card With a note finally in the palm of your hand you join another queue to buy a KitKat a Mars bar whatever After minutes of this palaver you re through the barrier finally able to find relief Annoying sure but what if you were a pensioner or disabled and caught short According to a report by the Royal Society for Public Health RSPH appropriately titled Taking the P a fifth of Britons don t leave their home as often as they d like because they know they ll struggle to find facilities a phenomenon known as loo leash For those with medical conditions this affects more than four in Ever found yourself deliberately not drinking in case you get caught short Over half the public intentionally dehydrate themselves for fear of not finding a loo according to the report  By next year of government funding for local authority services will have vanished compared with 
AUG1	How antisemites hijacked my work with vulnerable Palestinian children	Earlier this year I travelled to Palestine working as a doctor to investigate access to healthcare for Palestinians While there I was struck by the number of children undergoing some of the most invasive difficult and painful procedures without their parents I met a little girl having to undergo chemotherapy for months while her parents were left behind in Gaza the only way to communicate with them via tablets which have been put on the ward there specifically to deal with this widespread problem There are premature babies in neonatal units who have never been held by their mothers as they had to return to Gaza because their permits did not allow them to stay When the worst happens parents have to be told over the phone that their children have taken their last breath without them present  We must not abandon diplomacy at a time when Donald Trump is in the White House and Boris Johnson resides in No 
AUG1	To understand violent men, talk to the women who know them	So what s the plan Has rape effectively been decriminalised in Britain I think we should be told because that s what it looks like to me and no one in authority is prepared to do anything except order another bloody review  How many reviews do we need We all know the chances of any rapist being sent to prison are now vanishingly small The mayor of London s victims commissioner Claire Waxman has just published a report on the rapes reported to the Metropolitan police during a single month April There were in all and only led to a conviction and even they on average took months 
AUG1	Here's how Britain's broken housing system can be fixed in a decade	New figures released on Wednesday confirmed what we already knew homeownership is becoming increasingly out of reach for young people A survey by Santander found of to year olds now believe that homeownership is over for their generation Our housing system has been allowed to degenerate to such an extent that secure and affordable housing is increasingly unavailable to working class people and in many places middle class people too But it s not for a lack of ideas that this has happened What we are lacking is the political will  Fifty years ago the country had a fairly stable housing system The need for secure affordable housing of the middle class was largely met through homeownership and that of the working class through widely available social housing But a reliance on the private market to deliver homes since the s and the loss of millions of social homes over recent decades has destroyed this system 
AUG1	Dominic Cummings' war on the British civil service will undermine democracy	I ve worked in the civil service for most of my adult life including a stint working in the no deal Brexit planning bunker Operation Yellowhammer back when we thought we d crash out of the EU in March But with a so called war cabinet turbo charging preparations in the days before we all lurch into a Halloween no deal meltdown the UK body politic is in something of a state of shock And there are no grownups in sight  After the night of the blond knives funereal is the best word to describe the atmosphere in my patch of Whitehall Boris Johnson has constructed his cabinet out of the most radioactive remnants of the leave campaign starting with the installation of the leave campaign witch doctor Dominic Cummings at the heart of the No policy machine What happened Was Moriarty unavailable Had the burning Eye of Sauron already turned down the job because it wanted to spend more time with the family It s difficult to imagine a more alarming appointment but it shouldn t have been a surprise 
AUG1	Expecting Ireland to be servile is part of a long British tradition	Boris Johnson s approach to Ireland is part of an ignoble tradition in British politics At its heart is the false assumption that superiority in resources and military prowess equates to a superiority in intellectual power and moral rectitude In short the idea that might is right and that ultimately Paddy should know his place This assumption shaped and even at times dominated policy on Ireland for centuries before independence  It runs through th century British depictions of the Irish as incapable of self government unreliable lazy and inferior For Benjamin Disraeli a British prime minister who shares some personal characteristics with the current incumbent the Irish were wild reckless indolent uncertain and superstitious Most obviously this sense of superiority and a refined moral stance was clearly manifest in government policy during the Great Famine of which caused the deaths of more than one million people on the island of Ireland 
AUG1	Millions are in deep poverty. Meanwhile, Johnson splurges £100m on advertising	You can tell a lot about a person by their priorities It s true with friends say the mate who ditches your birthday drinks for a date but take a look at British politics and it s increasingly the case with ministers or even the country  This week the Social Metrics Commission released findings that reveal a national poverty crisis More than million people in the UK are trapped in what the researchers describe as deep poverty meaning their income is at least below the official breadline locking them into a weekly struggle to afford the basics of life Seven million people including million children are affected by what it termed persistent poverty people who are not only enduring poverty now but who have lived in poverty for at least two of the previous three years 
AUG1	Should we worry about the robots and mind-reading apps remaking our world?	Technology changes so fast that our lives are radically different from even a decade ago yet slowly enough that sometimes we don t even notice the changes  We live in the future in other words and sometimes it takes a moment to realise what an odd and perhaps unsettling future it is So I m going to try laying it out for you in plain English 
AUG2	Labour’s best tactic to beat Boris Johnson? A popular front	Britain s current political dynamics have been made crystal clear by the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection result The Liberal Democrats won because Plaid Cymru and the Greens stood down in an explicit electoral pact The Tories could have inched it had the Brexit party also stood down Labour which never had a chance in this rural constituency saw its vote share slump from two years ago to just over  With a majority of just one it is now inevitable that Britain faces a snap general election either because Boris Johnson s government is defeated in the Commons or because having achieved some shabby Brexit deal he will seize the moment to look for an electoral mandate 
AUG2	This byelection result has narrowed the Tories’ route to election victory	The Brecon and Radnorshire byelection result was a surprise for many Tory MPs but not because they lost Instead it s because of how close they came to holding on to the seat Ahead of the vote the Conservatives had appeared to be following a beginner s guide on how to lose byelections and alienate voters The vote had been triggered by a recall petition after the incumbent Tory MP Chris Davies was found guilty of submitting fake expenses claims The Conservative response To reselect him as a candidate rather than opt for a baggage free contender  As for the campaign it s not as though the Tories went all out MPs complain of a defeatist attitude in Conservative campaign headquarters Boris Johnson made a perfunctory visit to the seat on his first trip to Wales as prime minister A handful of Tory MPs tweeted that they would be out campaigning The general mood was that the Liberal Democrats were on an unstoppable path to victory and the Tory working majority in parliament would be reduced to one It followed that it was beneficial to have a candidate they could blame the loss on rather than a defeat that could be cast as the new leader falling short 
AUG2	Yes, a no-deal Brexit will hurt the economy. But nobody knows just how much	Predictions matter not least because they feed directly into the political debate We saw this all too clearly in And apocalyptic predictions matter even more when they don t come true The Treasury s gloom ridden short term forecast in May of the impact of Brexit not to mention its hysterical portrayal by the Treasury website became the Brexiters best friend And George Osborne s promised punishment budget was rightly derided for being both bad economics and bad politics  Dire predictions of immediate job losses and indeed recession proved simply to be false Even when the pound fell precipitately immediately after the referendum it was easy for proponents of Brexit to point out that things were nowhere near as bad as some had predicted 
AUG2	As a 14-year-old chambermaid apart from my family, I had to grow up fast	I was years old and had just received a long letter from my mother miles away saying that our authoritarian president back in Guyana had introduced stricter currency controls This meant the family would not be able to get any money out to my elder brother and I for a while I knew my parents had sacrificed and saved so much to give us the opportunity of safety and a good education in Britain so I had to help  Along the seafront in Eastbourne East Sussex stood hotel after hotel I was determined to get whatever job I could but being only I had to make myself look at least I planned the job mission with precision First I went to a second hand shop to buy more adult smart looking clothes the choice was a white lacy blouse and a black and white skirt Shoes smart black courts with a heel to make me look taller I found a suitable pair but struggled to walk in them at all so over the next few days I practised walking around the flat and down the road outside to get used to them The result is that today I can practically run in high heels 
AUG2	The Lib Dems’ byelection victory offers a route to their resurgence	Over interpreting byelection results is one of the things people in Westminster are best at We know that these events exist in their own microclimate where national issues often play second fiddle to local concerns and where voters feel free to act in a different way than at general elections but still we can t help ourselves Liberal Democrats know this better than most Paddy Ashdown s byelection triumphs didn t signal his inevitable rise to prime minister and the Lib Dem victory in Eastleigh in was not an omen that the general election two years later wouldn t be that bad for the party after all  In Brecon and Radnorshire there needs to be an extra note of caution added I don t know what god Lib Dem HQ was praying to in order to get a contest against a Conservative candidate who had just lost a recall petition after admitting fiddling his expenses but I d suggest they build it a bigger shrine Throw in other remain parties not standing and we shouldn t pretend that anything other than a Lib Dem victory here would have been a shock 
AUG2	Saudi women can now travel without consent – but this progress is fragile	After the lifting of the ban on women driving last year the Saudi feminist movement can now celebrate its second victory the authorities have announced that women can be granted passports and travel abroad without the consent of their male guardians They can also register a birth marriage or divorce But they still cannot marry or leave prison or a domestic violence shelter without the consent of their male guardians often a father brother or other male relative  The bizarre guardianship system is pervasive in Saudi Arabia It stipulates that women are not legal persons and consequently they have to be represented by male relatives to work marry study travel and seek medical care 
AUG2	Victoria’s Secret was never female-friendly – its shtick was about pleasing men	Lingerie brand Victoria s Secret seems to be having an identity crisis For the first time since its launch in its runway show has been cancelled with model Shanina Shaik telling reporters that the company is trying to work on its branding This comes in the wake of falling sales and controversy surrounding the show s lack of diversity  Furthermore the show s whole shtick a parade of almost naked models each a perfect mix of skinny curvy decked in angel wings an accessory the historians of the future will undoubtedly view with bafflement if not complete derision being ogled by men looks dated after MeToo Donald Trump used to be a frequent guest at the shows Les Wexner CEO of Victoria s Secret s parent brand L Brands owned Jeffrey Epstein s New York mansion and was one of his former financial clients the brand has distanced itself from Epstein 
AUG2	Irish peace is too precious to be squandered by the Brexit ultras	In The Ultras the brutal brilliant novel by Eoin McNamee set during the Troubles the protagonist based on the real life undercover British intelligence officer Robert Nairac finds himself in the company of dangerous men like himself The Ultras plot terrible events and create dark polities while forcing everyone else to live with their consequences Ultra meaning beyond wrote McNamee Ultra meaning extreme  The so called war cabinet formed by the new British prime minister Boris Johnson and whose course the maverick arch Brexiteer Dominic Cummings now charts of course bears no resemblance to the characters in the war of the Ultras imagined by McNamee But the sheer velocity and ferocity of their opening salvoes about crashing out of the EU with no deal on October unless the backstop the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland is abolished raise the kind of alarm that we in Ireland have not felt since the dark years of the Troubles 
AUG2	Labour shouldn’t worry so much about the Lib Dems, they hurt the Tories more	No prime minister has lost a seat as swiftly as Boris Johnson in over a century In the Tories won nearly half the vote in Brecon and Radnorshire and secured an majority over the Liberal Democrats To lose just two years later is very bad indeed Labour slumped badly leaving the party with a derisory vote share but this is a seat the party hasn t won since and in which it came third even in the landslide  In any case whether Labour is polling well or badly nationally it often performs poorly in byelections which are straight fights between the Lib Dems and Tories In when Tony Blair was enjoying a seemingly never ending honeymoon Labour s vote plummeted by points in the Romsey byelection because of tactical voting which enabled the Lib Dems to wrest the seat from the Tories It feels a bit unseemly to watch Lib Dems who appealed for the votes of Labour supporters to stop the Tories now crowing about Labour s collapsed support 
AUG2	Britain’s towns and cities will never flourish if ‘local’ is a dirty word	Some people think Britain s greatest challenge is the impending Brexit They are wrong Britain s greatest challenge is the impending collapse in its local public services I recently travelled to cities in France Belgium the Netherlands and Germany The contrast to Britain was stark Of course surface impressions can be deceptive but I was struck by the absence of piles of litter potholed streets screaming police cars tacky ads on roundabouts and graffiti There were also fewer desperate people pleading for money I felt I was briefly in a civilised continent The difference is that in continental Europe these matters are at the discretion of local people the mayor and electors As they get richer they reasonably expect vote for and pay locally for better services In Britain they are not allowed to do this So they get worse  Over the austerity decade since British government has stripped localities of a great chunk of their centrally supplied resources What is left is spent on statutory services such as social care schools and roads Local government has become an instrument of the centre Money has steadily dried up for discretionary activities such as youth clubs old people s homes children s agencies drug treatment centres homeless shelters libraries cleaner streets and public gardens Successive chancellors have treated impoverished councils pleas with contempt and cavalier disregard 
AUG3	Behind the Tory claims of bold Brexit action is nothing but empty bravado	Like an enraged bull charging a matador the British right is putting its head down and stampeding towards a no deal Brexit It has to keep moving Were it to stop and consider where it was heading it would never take the risks it is taking with Britain s future  The left fails so often because it thinks it is enough to hate Conservatives and say they are wicked rather than understand Conservatives and show them to be dangerous I cannot emphasise strongly enough that on its own terms the right ought to know that a no deal Brexit is an act of epic folly and that Boris Johnson s talk of a new golden age for merrie England is as much bullshit as bullish the drivel of a man and a movement that have nothing but empty bravado to sustain them 
AUG3	It’s easy to mock eco-celebs. Better to give them the benefit of the doubt	It s turning into the greatest environmental challenge of our age how do we transport celebrities safely and responsibly to global eco summits so that they can do a better job of lecturing the rest of us about carbon emissions  The world has been agog at Camp Google the three day mass gathering at the luxury Verdura resort in Sicily of or so celebrity environmental activists including Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg Leonardo DiCaprio Bradley Cooper Katy Perry Orlando Bloom Bono Chris Martin and more too many to list even a rumoured but unseen Barack Obama Not forgetting Prince Harry who reportedly gave a stirring speech about the environment barefoot A startling image springs to mind of a Google aide shrugging off the carbon footprint of Harry s journey private jet and helicopter but saying Uh prince dude you need to lose the offensive shoes 
AUG3	Vox pop superstar is a social media darling decades on	Unexpectedly last week a year old BBC Two vox pop featuring an East End woman in a red raincoat broke the internet We don t know her name but this unassuming star has been watched by millions decades after stopping to talk to a reporter on a London street She trounced all the social media competition including Kylie Minogue performing Do The Locomotion on a miniature railway in Scarborough  The clip was filmed for a BBC Two series of programmes marking the Queen s silver jubilee It was intended for a show called Thanks for the Memory then billed as the BBC s biggest vox pop to date that would ask citizens from crofters to judges for their views on TV of the previous years Tweeted by the BBC Archive last week for a contemporary audience there was one standout star 
AUG3	It’s a woman’s choice: falling fertility rates are not the business of government	How many children should a woman have and when It s a trick question of course because the answer is nearly always none of your damn business There is no one perfect solution to this most personal and intimate of dilemmas no iron rule for getting it right and yet that doesn t stop the world and its aunt seemingly having an opinion  Young women who steadfastly insist they don t want children are knowingly told that they ll change their minds when they re older even as they re begging doctors for sterilisations Mothers of only children can look forward to years of nosy questions about when they plan to try for another to the eternal distress of those who for whatever reason can t or won t get pregnant again Even sticking to the conventional two children doesn t make you immune to criticism judging by the reaction when Prince Harry let it slip that baby Archie might only be getting one sibling although the Duchess of Sussex clearly can t win with some people no matter what she does the idea of a couple deliberately holding back for the sake of the planet seems to trigger some kind of broader kneejerk hostility 
AUG3	Jeremy Corbyn’s stance on Brexit could yet pay off, even for remainers. Here’s why	I ve always hated Irish jokes Having an Irish mother I ve always been aware how they were used to denigrate Irish people and undermine the cause of Irish nationalism There s one joke though I ve always enjoyed It s the one where the guy asks the Irishman for directions to which he replies Well if I were you I wouldn t be starting from here It s stuck with me because it offers a real life lesson that I find myself regularly referring to  Back in the s and s it s a lesson I should have heeded as I argued and canvassed for a socialist Labour government when in hindsight it was clear that British voters had been wowed by Margaret Thatcher s strong leadership and populist policies For my arguments to get through I shouldn t have been starting from there People such as Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell recognised this and modified Labour s message to resonate with these same voters to spectacular effect 
AUG3	Labour’s best tactic to beat Boris Johnson? A popular front	Britain s current political dynamics have been made crystal clear by the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection result The Liberal Democrats won because Plaid Cymru and the Greens stood down in an explicit electoral pact The Tories could have inched it had the Brexit party also stood down Labour which never had a chance in this rural constituency saw its vote share slump from two years ago to just over  With a majority of just one it is now inevitable that Britain faces a snap general election either because Boris Johnson s government is defeated in the Commons or because having achieved some shabby Brexit deal he will seize the moment to look for an electoral mandate 
AUG3	Economics is a failing discipline doing great harm – so let's rethink it	Something is killing conventional economics and it s probably an inside job Reliance on abstract mathematics and absurd assumptions has brought the discipline into disrepute even if politics and policy are guided by the ghosts of its teaching  Nobody was surprised recently to learn that the price of the overdue and over budget HS high speed rail project could rise by another bn People were surprised to learn however that in the cost benefit analysis used to justify the original project planners assumed that no passengers work while on a train That made the times savings on the new line look more valuable than they really were 
AUG3	Boris Johnson is the last person young Brits would vote for	The Daily Express is calling it the Boris effect Johnson s election has reportedly caused a record jump in the polls for the Conservative party with the Telegraph gleefully reporting that its prized former columnist has received the largest bounce of any Conservative leader in the past two decades  Though Tory hopes were dented by the party s defeat in Thursday s Brecon and Radnorshire by election supporters still believe Johnson is capable of winning a general election which could happen within months 
AUG3	Karaoke inside Tina Turner’s giant head? Monstrous but brilliant	What I d give to know what was said at the commissioning meeting that led to the new sculpture at the Dreamland theme park in Margate The piece is planned as a tribute to the town s autumn hosting of the Turner prize exhibition  Did a young creative during a working breakfast muse So the prize is named after Turner the artist who did the landscapes But that s just boring right So how about we go with a different Turner instead Kathleen Lana Anthea Or how about a massive inflatable Tina Turner Too expensive If the budget won t stretch to a whole body let s just go with her head If we can raise a bit of extra cash maybe we can throw in a hand too 
AUG3	This byelection result has narrowed the Tories’ route to election victory	The Brecon and Radnorshire byelection result was a surprise for many Tory MPs but not because they lost Instead it s because of how close they came to holding on to the seat Ahead of the vote the Conservatives had appeared to be following a beginner s guide on how to lose byelections and alienate voters The vote had been triggered by a recall petition after the incumbent Tory MP Chris Davies was found guilty of submitting fake expenses claims The Conservative response To reselect him as a candidate rather than opt for a baggage free contender  As for the campaign it s not as though the Tories went all out MPs complain of a defeatist attitude in Conservative campaign headquarters Boris Johnson made a perfunctory visit to the seat on his first trip to Wales as prime minister A handful of Tory MPs tweeted that they would be out campaigning The general mood was that the Liberal Democrats were on an unstoppable path to victory and the Tory working majority in parliament would be reduced to one It followed that it was beneficial to have a candidate they could blame the loss on rather than a defeat that could be cast as the new leader falling short 
AUG4	A no-deal Brexit even after a no-confidence vote: how could it happen?	Do you remember when the prospect of a no deal Brexit was supposedly so remote that it was scarcely worth discussing in advance of the referendum The day after we vote to leave Michael Gove said in April we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want  As Theresa May began her negotiations with the European Union no deal next became a theoretical possibility that had to be kept on the table as part of the poker game As Boris Johnson told the Commons in July There is no plan for no deal because we re going to get a great deal 
AUG4	Whatever they say about Brexit, sterling’s nosedive tells us the truth	If you are reading this and earn your living in UK currency you are already poorer today than you were before June And you will be poorer by the end of the year if a no deal EU exit comes to pass If you have savings in sterling then you re in even more trouble  In the post truth world we have been living in for the past three years there s one thing that cannot be blagged away cannot be accused of bias cannot be propped up by a gust of groundless optimism the British pound It is quite literally a sovereign bowing to no ideology or political pressure As elegantly and neutrally as a force of nature it rises and falls as it divines the direction of the country s economy That direction according to the pound s nosedive over the past few weeks is downwards 
AUG4	Jacob Rees-Mogg: tough on grammar, relaxed on social misery	What more can we ask of Jacob Rees Mogg I mean bravo His list of language rules was absolutely classic In the soap opera of the news he s becoming as reliable a performer as the much missed Silvio Berlusconi who must surely be overdue a saucy Christmas special return Maybe involving some of the newer characters Perhaps Silvio starts stalking Meghan Markle and is discovered in a hedge in Windsor Great Park binoculars held steadily in his non masturbating hand  I m just throwing ideas out there it s fan fiction really because it s been such a tempestuous patch for the soap opera of the news What with Brexit and Trump and Boris some people are saying that the soap opera of the news has jumped the shark After all it s not a cliffhanger if the character always falls off the cliff It s no good if every new episode begins with plummeting and screaming and smashing and more screaming As the literalist didn t complain at the public hanging where s the suspense 
AUG4	Cherish those occasions when tribal division yields to collective joy	You don t often hear booing in a cricket ground But a wall of jeers greeted the Australian pantomime villain David Warner as he walked out to the crease in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston on Thursday The reception for the opening batsman was even louder as he walked back to the pavilion a few short minutes later the first of England bowler Stuart Broad s five wickets  Warner Aussie sporting belligerence personified was never the most popular cricketer among rival nations supporters but having masterminded last year s sandpapergate ball tampering scandal that saw him and teammates Cameron Bancroft and Steve Smith banned from the game in disgrace for months his reputation is lower than ever 
AUG4	Boris Johnson’s Armageddon Clock: what is it really counting down to?	Those familiar with the jeopardy TV series in which Kiefer Sutherland as Agent Jack Bauer is tasked with saving the world by any means necessary will have had flashbacks An Armageddon Clock has been installed at Conservative campaign headquarters counting down the time to Brexit by day hour minute and second Another digital timepiece is to be installed in the prime minister s office  This is one of several theatrical props intended to supercharge the atmosphere As if the stakes were not already vertiginous they are being raised further as a conscious act of government policy After a rummage down the back of the Treasury s sofa Sajid Javid declares that he has found another bn to add to the bn plus already committed to contingency planning for a crash out Brexit It is very doubtful whether that extra money can be sensibly deployed in the short time left before the end of October To the government announcing the money was the most important thing making it one of the most expensive press releases in the history of political propagandising We are told that Michael Gove is chairing daily meetings of the XS committee the war cabinet to supposedly turbocharge preparations for no deal And more than m will be consumed by one of the country s biggest ever public information campaigns to warn everyone what they have to do to prepare for the worst 
AUG4	No longer does al-Qaida grab the headlines. That might be the plan	Do you remember al Qaida Not the al Qaida of today that no one pays any attention to but the one of a decade or so ago with its sinister mastermind leader hidden in the deep cave complexes of the Hindu Kush the sleeper cells all over North America or more realistically its ideology that inspired young men in the UK to travel to Pakistan to be trained in the terrorist techniques used to kill more than people on tube trains and a bus in London  Probably not If you ve given much thought to the organisation in the past year or so you re a member of a fairly select group 
AUG4	Meghan seems to mix with all the ‘wrong’ people. So unlike the other royals ...	Since it s a good few weeks since Meghan Duchess of Sussex has worn jeans to Wimbledon carried her baby the wrong way or used a shawl made by impoverished workers her mentors have been on the alert for further evidence that their continual inspection of this member of the royal family is not racist bullying but a series of pedagogic opportunities They wish only to help her improve  But her worst enemies with which the UK press is strangely well supplied could not have anticipated that Meghan s next gift to them would be something so lavish so rich in opportunities for point by point demolition as an entire edition of Vogue guest edited while she was on maternity leave That s around the same time Piers Morgan has pointed out as she was not meeting his racist and sexist friend Donald Trump A learning moment then see how the other royals dressed up for Trump and what a boon that has proved for Anglo US relations 
AUG4	Political ads are all over Facebook. But voters are in the dark about where they come from	On the day Boris Johnson took over as prime minister hundreds of Facebook ads dropped like confetti into thousands of UK voters news feeds Many were virtually identical featuring a black and white photograph of Johnson gazing towards an unseen audience These are my priorities one version of the ad read What are yours  Quickly the ads were interpreted as the start of Johnson s election campaign and the splurge drew immediate parallels with the Facebook driven Vote Leave campaign especially since the director of that campaign the Svengali like Dominic Cummings walked into Downing Street as Johnson s most senior adviser on the same day Then on Friday we learned through reports in the Guardian that the political campaigning firm CTF Partners one of whose heads ran Johnson s leadership campaign was running a network of unbranded news pages on Facebook on behalf of its clients 
AUG4	Yes, children are great, but they can leave you skint	There is a point in parenting where you ask yourself whether it s all worth it In crude financial terms the answer is probably no The most well paid of women aside it s routine for couples to find that a mother s return to work costs almost as much in nursery fees as her wages are worth and sometimes more Childcare becomes a patchwork thing as many sessions in the creche as you can stretch to hasty parental handovers between shifts a willing grandparent to pick up the slack if you re lucky Always the low hum of panic that this is the day it all falls to pieces  When this was my choice to make my partner and I stretched and strained to make it work because hanging on until school started would have put a five year hole in a career that I hadn t even begun But there was another option or there would have been if I d weighed this all up pre pregnancy Like many of my friends I could have just not No babies No payslip turning to dust in your hand No begging your childminder for lates when your office needs you just a bit longer No joy of parenting either but how can you miss people who haven t been born 
AUG4	Behind the Tory claims of bold Brexit action is nothing but empty bravado	Like an enraged bull charging a matador the British right is putting its head down and stampeding towards a no deal Brexit It has to keep moving Were it to stop and consider where it was heading it would never take the risks it is taking with Britain s future  The left fails so often because it thinks it is enough to hate Conservatives and say they are wicked rather than understand Conservatives and show them to be dangerous I cannot emphasise strongly enough that on its own terms the right ought to know that a no deal Brexit is an act of epic folly and that Boris Johnson s talk of a new golden age for merrie England is as much bullshit as bullish the drivel of a man and a movement that have nothing but empty bravado to sustain them 
AUG5	Only a government of national unity can deliver us from no deal	Be not afraid There s hope that the constitutional atrocities planned by the prime minister and Downing Street s dark lord Dominic Cummings can and will be prevented by good MPs who will put saving the country ahead of their party  Most of these will be Labour Scottish National party Plaid Cymru Green Change UK and stray independents But noblest of all will be Conservative MPs who like the burghers of Calais whose memorial they pass every day will sacrifice their careers for the good of all No golden age awaits Johnson he will be hoist on his own outrageous hubris 
AUG5	It’s not a crisis of masculinity that’s responsible for mass shootings. It’s male power	You didn t have to ask did you when you heard about the latest shootings in the US You didn t think Well there are a hell of a lot of women out there who are utterly alienated possibly with mental health issues who have very screwed up attitudes about migrants in the US so the shooter in each case will clearly be one of them You just knew  Before you get into the not all men groove let me just say no not all men are murderous for which I suppose I must be thankful But I am not actually Not at all Not all men rape either but in this country we have watched rape become virtually decriminalised because the justice system is so poor 
AUG5	The Hong Kong protests are putting China on a collision course with the west	As pro democracy protests in Hong Kong escalate so does China s fury The unrest is now in its ninth week It has evolved from limited student led opposition to a proposed extradition law into a broad based fully fledged challenge to Beijing s rule It is threatening to undermine China s control of the former British colony and President Xi Jinping s control of China His quasi dictatorial authority is on the line A critical tipping point is in sight  How long before China s tough guy leader accustomed to getting his way and not averse to using force loses patience 
AUG5	We must call the El Paso shooting what it is: Trump-inspired terrorism	Last year when a rabid anti immigrant antisemite murdered people in a Pittsburgh synagogue I called it an act of domestic terrorism inspired by the ideology of Trumpism The shooting took place during the height of the midterm campaign when Trump was inciting fear of an immigrant caravan from Central America The shooter got the message Hours before his bloody rampage he accused a Jewish refugee support agency of bringing invaders in that kill our people  Saturday in El Paso it was deja vu all over again 
AUG5	Boris Johnson’s £1.8bn for the NHS isn’t what it seems – just ask the trusts	Boris Johnson successfully captured the weekend headlines with his announcement of a bn cash injection for the NHS capital budget which covers buildings and equipment But the prime minister quickly became bogged down in allegations that the bn pledged upfront this year wasn t quite the boost it appeared The truth is that NHS leaders across the country won t see this billion as extra funding but rather the removal of a freeze on cash they already have  That s because it matches a pot of cash that NHS trusts already earned last year in return for stretching their efficiency to breaking point on a subsequently broken promise that they could invest it 
AUG5	I love cheering on my team live, but being a disabled football fan can be nightmare	After the summer break many football fans will be looking forward to the start of the new Premier League season But for some disabled supporters like me it s a reminder that there is still a long way to go towards making the sport inclusive  I love football and held a season ticket at West Ham United from But I didn t renew it last season and I won t this year because I don t believe disabled football fans are treated as they deserve to be 
AUG5	We need a Brexit deal – so why is Johnson indulging in cynical electioneering?	There is only one place the British prime minister Boris Johnson should be right now That is in Dublin the city that holds the key to somehow resolving the Irish backstop and averting a no deal Brexit  Instead Johnson is blatantly campaigning in marginal seats and promising one off election bribes to the NHS in confident expectation of what he pledged to avoid a no deal Brexit and or a general election The bribes are trivial compared with what a no deal Brexit would cost This grotesque act of national self harm was invented purely to win Johnson leadership of the Conservative party He has won it He has weasled out of pledges before It is time he weasled out of this one 
AUG5	Centrist MPs cannot delay any longer – with an election likely, they must act now	Early election rumours are again rippling through Westminster The truth is of course that no general election can be called during recess without a recall of parliament There is no motivation for the prime minister to take such a step not while the novelty of that title still chirrups in Boris Johnson s own ears and tolls in those of his foes But after recess all bets are off Johnson s announcement on Sunday of a bn cash bonus for the NHS was a pre election cookie if ever we saw one  Where Labour moderates lead Tory waverers may take longer to follow
AUG5	The warnings about a no-deal Brexit aren’t being heard. This is what we need to do	According to a poll last week of respondents said the British public don t know what will happen in the event of a no deal Brexit That is an abject failure of all those groups campaigning against no deal Many of the same personalities involved also failed to win the referendum campaign itself and have now reassembled around a second referendum campaign which has hitherto failed to take off Yet still they persist   What s going on here they say Why don t people know what no deal means they complain Aren t they watching Newsnight Are they stupid 
AUG5	Blame the scroungers. Blame the migrants. How Britain fell for austerity	In January this year I went on a Brexit trip to Dover The main aim was to get a sense of what a no deal exit from the EU would mean for the haulage trade but while I was there I spent a long and cold afternoon wandering the seafront and town centre Just near the white cliffs on a jetty that seemed to form the last British land before the Channel there was a dome tent seemingly the property of someone who was homeless an awful symbol of this country as a land of want and wilful neglect  Later in the centre of town I met a woman who had been living on the streets for four years having been repeatedly sanctioned and had her benefits stopped The last time this had happened she had been in hospital and failed to make it to the jobcentre which caused her payments to be suspended for three months 
AUG6	Humiliating Kashmir is part of Modi’s plan to remake India	On Valentine s Day this year Narendra Modi went on a date with Bear Grylls As the two men set off on an adventure of a lifetime in India s Corbett national park miles to the north in the valley of Kashmir a suicide bomber drove a truck laden with explosives into a convoy of vehicles carrying Indian paramilitary forces Forty troops were blown to bits in the blast It was the bloodiest single atrocity suffered by Indian security personnel in the savage history of the Kashmir conflict   A trailer for Grylls programme Man vs Wild released last week by Discovery shows the duo wandering the wilderness that afternoon sniffing animal excrement and sharing laughs and survival techniques Opposition politicians have seized on the film to accuse the Indian prime minister of not interrupting his escapade with Grylls immediately on news of the atrocity a charge the government has denied 
AUG6	Toni Morrison’s genius was the inspiration of my youth	Toni Morrison was part of an extraordinary generation of African American women writers But she was the most special She was the queen To understand the impact she had on me you have to appreciate that I came of age in an era when there were very few black female role models  Prominent black women tended to be entertainers British popular music pianist Winifred Atwell British jazz singer Cleo Laine or the host of American jazz singers such as Ella Fitzgerald So Toni Morrison was a complete revelation Black male writers were rare enough But a black female writer was for me a genuine sensation She and her peer group Alice Walker Gloria Naylor and Ntozake Shange burned into my consciousness Toni Morrison did so much to shape my understanding of life and politics and my world as a black woman 
AUG6	The super-rich have made Britain into a nation of losers	Think of a football stadium Not one of the vast caverns like Old Trafford or Wembley but somewhere rather smaller and more bijou Somewhere like Fulham s Craven Cottage which once its new stand is completed will pack in only about fans Now imagine this stadium of souls rising up into the air and hovering unnoticed over central London Thirty thousand men in late middle age living the high life with the capital at their feet and there stuck way below on terra firma are their million fellow Britons tearing lumps out of each other  Congratulations you ve just pictured the central problem stalking the UK today Not Brexit Not the breakdown in civil debate Not the dark money contaminating Westminster These are urgent and vitally important but there is one big factor that forms a large part of the backdrop to all of them It can be summed up by that gulf between a mid sized football stadium of super rich men in their s and the rest of us spread out across our suburbs our towns our unpretty stretches of urban sprawl 
AUG6	No deal may be a Boris Johnson bluff, but the consequences will be real	If you don t like the way Britain is going move to Scotland  Nicola Sturgeon s advice might sound tongue in cheek but she is she insists more than half serious after all Scotland could use the population boost and plenty of English remainers now find themselves looking for a lifeboat The hint is that for those not lucky enough to have European born parents capable of swinging them a second passport moving north of the border and crossing your fingers for an independent and pro European Scotland in the near future might be the next best option 
AUG6	I served pork rolls to horsey Tories and conquered the chip on my shoulder	A hot pork roll stand in Peterborough isn t the most obvious place to find out you re a natural despot but it s where my inner dictator first emerged in the working world I was benevolent yet damning I ruled with an iron fist and fork In essence I was the Catherine the Great of country shows in the s And I loved it  I didn t start off that way The world of work terrified me I wasn t remotely practical I found other humans largely terrifying and an onslaught of hungry strangers pressed a lot of anxiety buttons in my brain But in front of a spit I discovered the full force of my naturally loud voice my instinctive girl boss spirit and the fact I adored being in charge of just about anything 
AUG6	Why children born of rape must be recognised as victims	We have all heard the cliche that whatever doesn t kill you makes you stronger but in the case of women and girls who survive male violence nothing could be truer In today s climate where rape and sexual assault has almost been decriminalised with only around of those reported to police in London ending in a conviction reporting rape takes stamina and courage  But what about those who are born of rape What about justice for them One woman who was conceived of rape is campaigning for a change in the law which would give those born as a result of rape victim status so they can prosecute the men who raped their mothers 
AUG6	If the El Paso shooter had been Muslim ...	If the El Paso shooter had been a Muslim the entire Muslim American community would be blamed for the actions of this one person  If the El Paso shooter had been a Muslim the president would be lobbing accusations such as Islam hates us in the direction of Muslims and not lecturing the public about video games 
AUG6	If trigger ballots are to work British democracy needs fundamental reform	It doesn t take a seasoned political pundit to understand why MPs might be hostile to any change to our democratic process that puts their job security at risk That s not because taking a seat in parliament is an easy option there s the online abuse and late night sessions the regular cross country travel and the responsibility inherent to the position And apart from the very safest of seats you could be out of a job whenever the next election may come Nonetheless serving your country while attempting to put your beliefs into practice is a privilege The pay the perks and future job prospects are not to be sniffed at either  Since Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader back in few issues have caused as much division within the parliamentary party as the question of trigger ballots Or is it deselections Mandatory reselection It s impossible to keep up with the terminology Whatever it s called the fundamental question remains the same should local Labour party members be able to replace their current representative ahead of an election if they believe there s someone better for the job 
AUG6	The secret to being a good stepmother? Here’s my handy guide …	In New York beleaguered stepmothers are paying per hour to receive stepmother coaching Presumably rich beleaguered stepmothers As a stepmother I know from experience it s a tough gig but recent studies have also revealed that statistically stepmothers are the most vulnerable member of a blended family The stepmother s opinion is considered the least important Which is why I love doing standup comedy because it s all my opinion and it is VERY important  Important but not expensive an hour of my advice will set you back just for my aptly titled show Mother and here I offer the wisdom built up over years to you for free You should feel very privileged to read it as I ve had to take time away from my castle talking to my enchanted mirror 
AUG6	From Trump to Fox News to 8chan: the web of white supremacist rhetoric is wide	 How do you stop these people You can t Donald Trump said at a rally in Florida in May The response from someone in the crowd came immediately Shoot them The audience laughed and cheered Trump smirked and made a joke about it   Them meant Latino immigrants and refugees that day Them to those who take Trump s permission to spread hatred boldly and openly has at times in the past two years meant Jews Muslims Sikhs Hindus and anyone who stands against the white nationalist agenda 
AUG7	Deal or no deal? It’s not really up to Dominic Cummings	Media obsession with powerful advisers is not new The influence of Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson was the stuff of hysteria in the Tony Blair years Bernard Ingham and Marcia Williams were accused of having undue power during the eras of Margaret Thatcher and Harold Wilson Right back to the original minence grise in th century France P re Joseph and probably beyond the mystique of the all seeing adviser behind the throne has been a constant theme  But how well grounded is this in reality What we do know is that those who work in the shadows are catnip to journalists who know less than they pretend about the workings of government This is especially true in an embittered political era with a taste for conspiracy theories that seem to offer partisan observers simple explanations of complicated events Sometimes the credulity can be abject 
AUG7	How the world’s dirtiest industries have learned to pollute our politics	The tragedy of our times is that the gathering collapse of our life support systems has coincided with the age of public disservice Just as we need to rise above self interest and short termism governments around the world now represent the meanest and dirtiest of special interests In the United Kingdom the US Brazil Australia and many other nations pollutocrats rule  The Earth s systems are breaking down at astonishing speed Wildfires roar across Siberia and Alaska biting in many places deep into peat soils releasing plumes of carbon dioxide and methane that cause more global heating In July alone Arctic wildfires are reckoned to have released as much carbon into the atmosphere as Austria does in a year already the vicious twister of climate feedbacks has begun to turn 
AUG7	Michael Buerk's fat-shaming is 'weak' – not the obese people he targets	 Freedom to make bad choices is what personal autonomy indeed democracy is all about writes Michael Buerk in his latest column for the Radio Times And wow has the former star of I m a Celebrity made a bad choice this week In a piece entitled Leave couch potatoes alone Buerk takes aim at people he deems to be weak the obese  Picking apart the common argument that obesity is the biggest danger to the NHS in terms of cost appears to be the raison d tre of the piece along with a plea to leave overweight people to make their own mistakes It s as cruel and vitriol soaked as debates about obesity generally are the joy Buerk takes in littering the column with pejoratives is obvious if the results are not particularly creative There s the perennial porky and references to guzzling and being out waddled There s originality though in his choice to reframe the societal cost of obesity in a positive way with a reminder that the obese will die a decade earlier than the rest of us 
AUG7	The only way to stop the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit? Revoke article 50	A run on the pound was once the kind of event that troubled a prime minister If it was shown to be the direct result of a policy the prime minister refused to change it might even have unseated them No longer Now a Conservative government s central policy will not just crash the pound but also end Britain s manufacturing and agriculture overnight and block half the country s transportation of food and medicines and it shows no shame whatsoever  Extraordinary and radical times demand a similar response It may no longer be sufficient for parliament to tinker around the edges with Brexit Because the no deal trajectory is both real and unthinkable politicians may finally decide it is time to challenge key orthodoxies Brexit in its current form is not the will of the people and it can be stopped The outright revocation of article is looking more likely and more justified than ever 
AUG7	John McDonnell has offered the SNP more than he had to on independence	In politics it s possible to have logic and even principle on your side and still get it badly wrong John McDonnell s change of Labour policy declaring on Tuesday night that the party would not block a second referendum on independence for Scotland is a case in point  McDonnell made the argument that any new vote should be for the people of Scotland and their parliament to determine We would not block something like that We would let the Scottish people decide That s democracy The notion of Holyrood voting for a referendum only for a future Labour government in Westminster to stand in its way is indeed hard if not impossible for any democrat to defend Sure some will argue that Scotland had its once in a generation chance to decide in But that s tricky to sustain when Labour is sort of committed to holding a second referendum on Brexit even though that decision was supposedly settled just three years ago Surely democratic consistency demands precisely the stance McDonnell has now taken 
AUG7	Toni Morrison’s stories shaped me, and made me tell my own	Just over a decade ago Toni Morrison sat down on a steel bench in Charleston Harbor South Carolina Her writing had inspired this simple memorial at the waterway through which so many enslaved people were trafficked One in two African Americans is descended from someone who passed through that harbour As the end of the slave trade loomed and South Carolinians binge imported black bodies so many Africans died there that they were thrown into the water their floating corpses markers of a mass grave Morrison wanted people to remember It s never too late to honour the dead she said It s never too late to applaud the living who do them honour  I realised parts of my emotional architecture that I thought innate had in fact been planted by Morrison s words
AUG7	My wait for NHS surgery has caused me further pain	My weekend was spent at the Edinburgh fringe watching standup comedians that I love while sitting curled up in my seat with heat pads stuck to my skin This isn t ideal in summer but I needed the heat pressed against my left side to drown out the agonising pain I often experience The only way I can describe it is that it feels like my organs are being squeezed as tightly as possible  In February I learned that my left kidney is damaged I have a pelvic ureteric junction obstruction meaning that one kidney doesn t filter properly Instead it fills up like a balloon ready to explode inside me In some cases this can be treated with a stent Unfortunately for me I ve unknowingly had it for so long that it has caused the kidney to swell to the point where it is now badly damaged and needs surgery I met my surgeon at the beginning of June and was put on the NHS surgery waiting list 
AUG7	Hard Brexiters’ stance on the Irish border is nonsense – I can tell you, I grew up there	One consequence of the brain s incredible ability to make sense of the world is that it sometimes sees things that aren t there Most people have experienced pareidolia that pleasing effect of interpreting a face from a random assortment of objects or shapes so that a paperclip and two blobs of adhesive putty look like a happy little man or the watermarks behind Auntie Maureen s radiator strike her as a dead ringer for the Virgin Mary Our brain has spent so many millions of years geared toward facial recognition it takes even the most random nonsense and attempts to construct it into something meaningful  My brain it turns out does a similar thing when I read the tweets of Brexit MEP Ben Habib I am on the border between NI and ROI he tweeted last week above a video that depicted him and some colleagues wisely playing in the middle of the road Travelling in a straight line one enters and exits the ROI a number of times There could never be a hard border here The UK has declared it would never seek to impose one The whole thing is a red herring 
AUG7	I never thought I’d see the royal family as a beacon of hope	I ve been asking strangers random questions for years in the name of journalism but I d never been vox popped myself until last Friday when I was approached on Oxford Street by someone from a Japanese television station What did I think of Meghan Markle  I said I thought she was great Furthermore warming to my theme I thought the reaction against her in the British media was symptomatic of a deeply disturbing moment of racist hegemony that has crashed over us like sewage following the dam burst of Brexit 
AUG7	How do we beat 8chan and other far-right sites? The same way we beat Isis	Copycat terrorism is on the rise again this time from the far right  Over the past few months we have witnessed a series of lethal terrorist attacks against minorities in places of worship and other public spaces that are said to have been carried out by white supremacists There was the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October then two mosque attacks in New Zealand in March another synagogue assault in California a month later and an attack at a Walmart store in El Paso Texas on Saturday 
AUG8	The dramatic drop in sterling is only a taste of what is to come	As our currency plummeted last week politicians were remarkably quiet In normal times a catastrophic slide in the pound would send a shockwave through Westminster An emergency cabinet meeting might have been called The chancellor might have made an announcement calming markets and reassuring the public  But these aren t normal times Over the past three years politics has been increasingly blind to the concerns of ordinary people The Brexit debate is stuck on abstract constitutional issues such as the backstop While they are important matters the relentless focus of public discourse on them means that we are in danger of forgetting about the lives of real people Westminster is gripped by a fanatical race towards a cliff edge Brexit and nobody is stopping to think about the impact it would have on the everyday lives of the people we serve as politicians 
AUG8	We can’t keep eating as we are – why isn’t the IPCC shouting this from the rooftops?	It s a tragic missed opportunity The new report on land by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC shies away from the big issues and fails to properly represent the science As a result it gives us few clues about how we might survive the century Has it been nobbled Was the fear of taking on the farming industry alongside the oil and coal companies whose paid shills have attacked it so fiercely too much to bear At the moment I have no idea But what the panel has produced is pathetic  The problem is that it concentrates on just one of the two ways of counting the carbon costs of farming The first way the IPCC s approach could be described as farming s current account How much greenhouse gas does driving tractors spreading fertiliser and raising livestock produce every year According to the panel s report the answer is around of the planet heating gases we currently produce But this fails miserably to capture the overall impact of food production 
AUG8	After El Paso and Dayton, the left needs to reach out to men, not condemn them	A horrific act of violence takes several innocent lives a frantic live stream details the events terrifying mobile footage spreads rapidly online Then come the tweets of condemnation from world leaders followed by an onslaught of outrage split down partisan lines  The way that shootings or suicide bombings or knife attacks are politicised depending on the backgrounds of the perpetrators and the victims shows how successful these acts are in deepening the divisions in society And that is one of the intentions that the perpetrators share no matter their race or politics 
AUG8	Globalisation as we know it will not survive Trump. And that’s a good thing	The significance of the trade war between China and the US goes well beyond the impact of tit for tat tariffs or which of two self styled strongmen wins the bragging rights As was the case in the s the seemingly inexorable drift towards protectionism is part of a deeper crisis of the international status quo When Beijing this week accused the US of deliberately destroying the international order it was really saying that US hegemony will no longer go unchallenged Globalisation as we have known it is coming to an end and that s by no means unwelcome  Hailed as the ultimate in human progress a model based on loosening the controls on capital and the construction of global supply chains has spawned recurrent financial crises fostered corrosive inequality and worsened the climate emergency True millions of people have been lifted out of poverty in the past years but most of them live in a country China that has kept the market at arm s length 
AUG8	Good for you, Monica Lewinsky, for finally taking control of your story	We thought we knew Monica Lewinsky didn t we back in the late s But all we knew was who the press told us she was  With headlines blaring about scandal and seduction and sex the news media rolled out all of their best misogynist tropes to make us believe that Lewinsky was a calculating seductress a hilarious punchline or maybe even an evil co conspirator within a grand Republican conspiracy to bring down the then president 
AUG8	It’s last orders for sexist beer names. We can all drink to that	It takes a certain kind of person to walk up to a bar and order a pint of Old Legover a bottle of Piddle in the Hole and half an Old Growler  We all know the sort of person tweed jacket worn over a Led Zeppelin T shirt combat shorts all year round the sort of beard that s stiff with flecks of sausage roll and stained at the corners with nicotine Scratches their belly button while trying to do any sort of mental arithmetic Reads books about netherworlds and supernatural portals and giant battles Goes home after one too many Bushy Beaver beers or pints of Leg Warmer and watches The World at War on DVD as they fall asleep on the sofa farting like the Large Hadron Collider Or so the stereotype goes 
AUG8	Ignore Boris Johnson’s empty ‘optimism’. The real cheer lies on the left	Last Saturday afternoon in a union office in central London I got thinking about optimism I was speaking at an event put on by disabled activists to discuss the impact of a decade of disability cuts I spent an hour listening to people who in recent years have by any definition been wilfully neglected one disabled man sleeping rough and battling with the broken benefits system another an unpaid carer trying to keep her head above water and help others as social care packages around the country are gutted  You wouldn t typically think this was a recipe for optimism But I came out feeling more hopeful than I had in weeks 
AUG8	So what if more young British people are living at home into their 30s?	The self styled jilted generation have a new argument to boost their case against their elders According to figures from the Office for National Statistics a quarter of those between the ages of and were still living in the family home in That is million more than years ago million people compared with million in  And the reason is obvious is it not Soaring prices and an acute housing shortage factors not unconnected have locked young people out of the housing market leaving high priced private renting or the parental home as the unpalatable only options A whole generation is being infantilised by the failure of successive governments to build enough homes 
AUG8	Makeup for children isn’t harmful – but the assumptions adults make about it can be	John Lewis and Mac Cosmetics have come under fire for advertising a back to school makeup masterclass on Facebook in which school age pupils were promised tips on achieving good looking skin and eyebrows on fleek at the Mac counter in John Lewis s Bluewater branch Both the brand which asserts that staff were acting independently and the store which says it knew nothing of the event apologised and quickly cancelled the workshop after parents complained  Few would disagree with the decision An eyebrow pencil or foundation is incongruous and inappropriate in this context and should not be billed as essential back to school kit like some new lunchbox or protractor Makeup is against uniform code in most schools and even where it s not it s very dubious to suggest that pupils should aspire to look a certain way on their return to an environment that should be about learning and away from the real and escalating pressures to look good 
AUG8	How can a man be too straight to recycle?	So that s how the world s going to die is it because straight men are scared people might think they are gay According to new research by Penn State University men may be avoiding environmentally friendly activities because they fear that anyone who catches them recycling or carrying a reusable shopping bag may think they re seeking romantic trysts with other guys So when men are scrabbling around in the sun scorched dirt for food or swimming their way through Covent Garden or sheltering their family from Mad Max style societal breakdown they can at least comfort themselves that their precious heterosexuality remains intact  Of course climate emergency won t be solved purely by more recycling or fewer plastic bags but the study is revealing Both men and women see caring about the environment as feminine and men associate feminine behaviour by men with being gay 
AUG9	Cummings the new Rasputin is outshining Johnson as antihero-in-chief	How did you enjoy Thursday night s Downing Street address by Prime Minister Smirky McSmirkface Boris Johnson began by describing his morning I was at the nuclear fusion labs in Culham Please say a freak accident befell you there causing you to emerge if not with superpowers then at least as tenuously adequate  Alas not Johnson s tight framed air jabbing fist banging weirdly emphasised delivery is still like that of a Bloomberg pundit trying to make the currency markets sound scandalously interesting Soon he won t have to 
AUG9	A no-deal Brexit won’t be a clean break: this nightmare will go on for ever	The myths of a no deal Brexit are about to collide with reality Those myths are many and they flourish on both sides of the great divide For remainers the greatest is that no deal could never happen They look at the polls that show far more Britons oppose a crash out from the EU than support it to according to Ipsos Mori and they can t quite believe that any government would defy the public will on so grave a matter  They look at the sensible majority of MPs who have voted to thwart it and they assume that for all the bluster from Boris Johnson and his team when it comes to the crunch reason will prevail That in the ultimate battle of the Dominics Grieve will triumph over Cummings 
AUG9	Boris Johnson’s no-deal election plot is an assault on democracy	The Conservatives are plotting to overturn Britain s constitutional order to stop them haemorrhaging votes to the Brexit party in key marginal seats The most absurd aspect about this sentence is that it s entirely true  The country s current turmoil has two proximate causes the Tories decision to make the majority pay for a crisis caused by their donors the financial sector breeding mass disillusionment and anger and the Tory addiction to making calamitous decisions driven by their own perceived partisan interests That s why David Cameron called the Brexit referendum why Theresa May bungled the negotiations polarised the nation and mainstreamed the idea of no deal and it is why Boris Johnson intends to engineer a disorderly Brexit during an election campaign 
AUG9	Despite Brexit, my trip back to Britain filled me with pride	August is a dangerous time to be back in London when the city smells so much better than New York For the past week my children and I have been enjoying the F drop in temperature with zero humidity while playing a game of Better in England The bread is better Ditto the cheese Clearly the weather is better and since a version of Paw Patrol has been dubbed by English accented children everyone s interest in the show has revived The only hard call is the news Brexit v Trump which is the more depressing background condition  It was hard to watch the rusty carousel go round and stop oneself muttering about EU safety regulations
AUG9	To stop women and girls carrying knives, tackle the abuse and violence they face	Figures released this week reported a increase in the number of knife possession cases involving women and girls in England This was accompanied by commentary about how the police and Home Office are responding to this hidden issue  To say I was frustrated would be an understatement First the problem isn t as hidden as it used to be Women and girls are being arrested for these offences at increasing rates so clearly they are being identified Back in when I first started to interview women and girls about their experiences of serious violence various services struggled to find people for me to interview On some occasions I was simply told that girls weren t affected by these issues and I was wasting my time More than years on most local authorities police forces youth offending teams and community organisations can identify women and girls affected by or involved in weapon enabled crime and violence We really have no idea if more women and girls are carrying knives than they used to we just know that more are being apprehended for such offences 
AUG9	My disabilities are invisible. I shouldn’t have to prove them to strangers	I was recently on a packed Central line train into London Luckily I managed to take the last priority disabled seat My osteoporosis and the fatigue I experience meant it would be hard for me to stand for the minute journey to Oxford Circus I felt a sense of relief that I had managed to find a space That was until I was approached by a middle aged woman who quite confidently asked me to move in order to give up my seat for an elderly passenger  Of course I thought the elderly passenger deserves a seat But I do too although it s not immediately obvious why With other passengers shaking their heads and murmuring comments of disapproval and me too embarrassed to make a claim for the seat I moved It s true that I appear well but standing for a prolonged period of time left me feeling weak and in pain That said I am used to keeping quiet 
AUG9	Pop reggae and racism: what failing on a factory floor taught me about life	Here s how bad it was even the jobcentre told me not to do it  The woman on the other side of the desk looked at my r sum paused for what felt an age and made clear the position I wanted was not a good match It was in a factory I was at university It was hard dirty work didn t I want something better It would be well a waste 
AUG9	Independence for Scotland is inevitable – we need a plan for it	I hope Scotland and Nicola Sturgeon realise how much they may yet owe Boris Johnson If I were a Scot I would vote for independence tomorrow I would want nothing more to do with the shambles of today s Westminster parliament which goes on holiday for a month during the worst political crisis in a generation Labour s John McDonnell is entirely correct to reassure the Scots of their right to secede from the United Kingdom The supreme civil right is that to self government and the inferior tier of a federation is entitled to claim it not the superior one to permit  Scotland has now voted itself a separatist Scottish National party local government unchallenged for years The party is points ahead in the polls while support for independence has topped the same percentage that voted for Brexit across the UK in 
AUG9	Racism harms black people most. It’s time to recognise ‘anti-blackness’	There is a tendency to classify all victims of racism under the label people of colour or black Asian and minority ethnic people shortened to BAME However this generalist approach fails to account for the varied ways that racism affects different races There is anti black racism anti Asian racism which affects east Asians and south Asians differently anti Arab racism even sometimes anti white racism To be clear all these strands of racism are significant and we need to work to eradicate them all Yet historically it s black people who have most often found themselves at the bottom of the pile  In Brazil black people are still treated as second class citizens in India students of African origin are persecuted
AUG9	Does Mark Zuckerberg’s summer reading betray his desire for world domination?	Who would imagine that Mark Zuckerberg s recommendation for a book to take on holiday might plunge the reader into a world of cut throat technological competition and the pursuit of monopoly Apparently not those who have seized on the Facebook co founder s choice of The Last Days of Night by Graham Moore which describes the race to bring electricity to the US and the consequent riches up for grabs Indeed it has been taken as a manifestation of Zuckerberg s inability to conceal his true drive to world domination an inadvertent drop of the mask  To which one might reply did you think he was sitting on his sunlounger reading through the works of Barbara Pym 
AUG10	The very idea of a united kingdom is being torn apart by toxic nationalism	The first step to solving a problem is to see it clearly And if we are to understand why we are facing not only our most serious constitutional crisis since the th century but an unprecedented economic calamity precipitated by a no deal exit from the EU we must recognise that nationalism is now driving British politics  Having set almost impossible terms for any negotiation with Europe and preparing to renege on legal obligations to pay our debts to the EU the economic equivalent of a declaration of war Boris Johnson s government is hell bent on conjuring up the absurd and mendacious image of the patriotic British valiantly defying an intransigent Europe determined to turn us into a vassal state 
AUG10	The system lifted me from poverty. Today, Danielle John is not so lucky	Last week a woman s sanction letter from the Department for Work and Pensions went viral on Twitter Danielle John from Cardiff simply wrote Was told to put this up on Twitter this was because I had a miscarriage and missed appointment  These stories are fairly common now We are used to seeing reports about people being sanctioned because of attending a funeral cancer treatment their child being in hospital But this one struck me in particular because the language was so coldly efficient Brief to the point of cruelty I didn t know it was possible even in a business letter to say We re about to ruin your whole life without a shred of empathy 
AUG10	Toni Morrison’s gift was to make black people feel seen	It is impossible to fully encapsulate the magnitude and influence of Toni Morrison a writer of such power gravitas and ingenuity the rhapsodic praise almost seems inadequate anti climactic But we must do so We must celebrate her If the act of writing makes the human experience that much more knowable then we must mark this moment  Morrison s greatest gifts a virtuosic feel for language and an eye for bringing the lived experiences of black Americans to the centre to me seem inextricably linked Never has a writer been so clear about her intention These are lives that matter Here are worlds possessing a will of their own Hers are characters facing structural inequalities but they have agency a mesmerising pull beyond the page 
AUG10	Jeremy Corbyn should be pressing for a referendum, not an election	Jeremy Corbyn shouldn t fall into the trap of giving Boris Johnson an election Unless that is he is pretty confident of winning it and on the basis of the latest polls Labour needs an election like a hole in the head  Instead the leader of the opposition should try everything else to foil the prime minister s devilish plot to crash out of the EU without a deal With the help of a cross party group of MPs he can probably succeed 
AUG10	Angela Merkel: you’re on hols, so less of the despotism please	One of the reasons I tend not to mind the tinny hiss of other people s headphones on public transport is that I am a horribly nosey person Recently I sat next to a middle aged man in a work suit who played that ubiquitous Lewis Capaldi got dumped song not once not twice but on a loop that lasted as long as my train journey I should have asked him if he was OK  The same nosiness applies to what people are reading Getting lost in a good book should never be a self conscious act but it is hard not to wonder what brought that particular person to The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F ck

AUG11	Is the Queen remainers’ secret weapon? Don’t bet on it	In the preface to The Audience his play about the Queen s meetings with her many prime ministers Peter Morgan reflects that these encounters lie at the very heart of the British constitution the bone structure of our establishment in its most elemental form As apposite as this metaphor is it should also remind us that even the strongest bones can be bruised or fractured And according to reports in the Sunday Times Her Majesty has indeed had it up to here with our politicians  According to one source I think she s really dismayed I ve heard her talking about her disappointment in the current political class and its inability to govern correctly At a private event held shortly after David Cameron s resignation in she reportedly expressed her resignation and frustration about the quality of our political leadership and that frustration will only have grown 
AUG11	I’m calling for a cabinet of women to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit	It is hard to remember a moment in my lifetime when Britain faced a greater crisis A coup led by a small group of rightwing libertarians is all but complete as the Vote Leave team has been reassembled and taken control of Downing Street They are set upon implementing the most extreme no deal version of Brexit and most terrifyingly we are running out of time to stop them  At times of national crises political leaders need to bring a country together But that is not happening The government is hellbent on creating more divisions scapegoating our friends and neighbours and ignoring the inequality and democratic deficit that fuelled the Brexit vote 
AUG11	For a clear view of Trumpism, step outside the news cycle	In journalism you can sometimes feel trapped in one of the smaller faster spinning cogs of an information machine that never slows Readers might experience this phenomenon through its palliatives as for example a book by a leader writer or political editor who steps from frenetic years in the inner wheels on to a larger slower moving part of the contraption and tries to make sense of its cycles Or through a foreign correspondent who after a long posting in which he or she has witnessed intensively the daily life of a country or region offers a spacious survey of the people and place across time trying to put recent events into history s weave  The little agile cogs are necessary to the machine but unless journalists seek out and point the rest of us towards those who labour on the bigger belts with less speed but often richer findings the academics the scientists the public sector planners we miss much 
AUG11	The very idea of a united kingdom is being torn apart by toxic nationalism	The first step to solving a problem is to see it clearly And if we are to understand why we are facing not only our most serious constitutional crisis since the th century but an unprecedented economic calamity precipitated by a no deal exit from the EU we must recognise that nationalism is now driving British politics  Having set almost impossible terms for any negotiation with Europe and preparing to renege on legal obligations to pay our debts to the EU the economic equivalent of a declaration of war Boris Johnson s government is hell bent on conjuring up the absurd and mendacious image of the patriotic British valiantly defying an intransigent Europe determined to turn us into a vassal state 
AUG11	It’s not extreme to want to leave the EU on 31 October, come what may	The paths we have chosen in the past three years are ones no one would have anticipated Neither quite frankly are they ones anyone would have wished for Mistakes were made But let s be clear about one thing the voters decision to leave the European Union and how politicians have gone about implementing the result are two distinct issues Criticising the process of leaving is not the same as questioning the referendum outcome Leave had a clear majority on a high turnout  Whichever way anyone voted we can probably agree that the paralysis of indecision of this period has been corrosive and damaging It has entrenched divisions and undermined confidence 
AUG11	It’s no time to play parliamentary poker. Let the people decide on Brexit	When he became prime minister Boris Johnson had a huge opportunity and responsibility to reunite our divided country As the figurehead of the Leave campaign in the Brexit referendum he was uniquely positioned to reach out to the of us who voted to remain in the European Union and who have been ignored by the government ever since  Johnson could have persuaded the most extreme Brexiters in his party that they should compromise with those who voted to remain There are many young urban and ethnic minority communities across Britain who are terrified about the future Johnson could have chosen to use his position as the new prime minister to heal the divisions that have gripped us rather than widen them 
AUG11	I’ll crack black jokes about my own ills, but when it comes to my daughter…	When faced with tribulation Glaswegian males often feel compelled to reach for humour This can seem inappropriate brutal even but it s not intended as such It s a psychological reflex and one to which we have become genetically predisposed  I feel that much of this stems from decades of fighting adversity when death and sickness were the most persistent neighbourhood pests To make light of them was to make a statement to your community that you wouldn t be defeated by them Besides if these twin impostors were intent on becoming a part of the local fabric for a while then best to apply some emotional cosmetics rather than make everyone else miserable In time all of them would be expected to take their turn 
AUG11	Mr Johnson’s plot to subvert democracy is more dangerous than Brexit itself	Only once since has a British prime minister been evicted as a result of a successful no confidence vote in parliament That was on March one of the most dramatic nights in modern parliamentary history After many months of struggling for its life Jim Callaghan s battered minority Labour government faced a confidence vote brought by the Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher It was nerve shreddingly close The Callaghan government lost by just one vote Once the tellers for each side had marched up in front of the Speaker and read the result there was uproar during which Tories cheered with delight and some Labour leftwingers sang The Red Flag Callaghan then got up to the dispatch box to make a brief and dignified statement in which he declared we shall take our case to the country at an election that he promised to hold as soon as possible This would be an election that Callaghan had concluded rightly that he was going to lose  In strict law he didn t have to do that The requirement that an election must be called by a government that has lost a confidence vote was a firm convention rather than solid legislation as are the understandings that a government won t unreasonably delay an election and will not do anything contentious once a campaign is under way When people refer to the British constitution they are talking about a hotch potch of such conventions combined with ancient charters precedents international agreements legislative bolt ons and unwritten understandings The fabric of this messy tapestry is held together by a crucial thread That is an underlying assumption that everyone can be trusted to behave in a proper way In the absence of a formal constitution British democracy is heavily reliant on politicians acting with honour and playing fair 
AUG11	Boris Johnson has a problem with women… and it’s not the one you think	Boris Johnson has a woman problem No not the rascally lady killer stuff he probably loves people talking about This problem is that female voters don t like him A YouGov poll shows that while men give him a net favourability of with women he scores lower with Even Tory female Leavers aren t as keen on Johnson as the Conservative Leave men  This isn t about women disapproving of Johnson s personal life A Survation poll revealed that people didn t care that Johnson was getting divorced but they would still be less likely to vote for the Conservatives if he were leader debunking the myth that only prudes and killjoys object to him Similarly the new poll doesn t mean that women are having a fit of the vapours over Johnson s personal life however revealing it is for a grown man to drunkenly shout and swear at his much younger partner 
AUG11	The good old days? Look deeper and the myth of ideal communities fades	In the countdown to a possible no deal exit from the EU there are some who cling to an optimistic narrative that our community spirit will get us through Indeed recent experiences in Whaley Bridge lend some support to the idea that in a crisis community is revealed The irony is that in part the whole Brexit project has been fed by an inchoate but powerful sense of nostalgia for community lost  There is nothing new about this longing for a past golden age of community For at least two centuries writers such as Coleridge Ruskin and TS Eliot have compared their own fragmented hedonistic and selfish times with an imagined earlier age of social harmony and community indeed a medievalist colleague assures me that in the early eighth century the ageing Bede took a similar view of developments in Anglo Saxon England 
AUG12	Boris Johnson talks tough but still hasn’t said what he’s doing to get a Brexit deal	When our nation s economic performance slumps our politicians should dig deep to deliver real answers to the problems at hand and make a superhuman effort to bring everyone on side But under our new prime minister the administration has mistaken posturing and trash talk for compromise and hard work  There appear to be two camps under Boris Johnson s command those who definitely don t want a withdrawal deal with the European Union and are working to avoid one and those who do but aren t working to secure one Either way the prospect of no deal looms larger than ever at a time when we can least afford it 
AUG12	Nigel Farage attacking Prince Harry is like the angry man ranting on a bus	The sociologist Will Davies describing the lesser remarked conundrum of the Boris Johnson prime ministership would the hardliners who anointed him ever be satisfied with any Brexit borrowed a phrase from American politics asymmetric polarisation It is an elegant economical way of saying the other side has gone bananas which is funny because it s true  Let s park the litany of examples for a second to concentrate on Nigel Farage He appeared at a rightwing gathering in Australia on Saturday night you could tell it was alternative because journalists were barred and laid into Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a way that was somewhat astonishing but mainly completely bats 
AUG12	Boris Johnson’s ‘crime fighting’ crusade is mere posturing	The most pressing issue facing Britain this month is not its falling crime rate Yes that reads falling crime rate it has indeed been falling since The trouble is that it is not falling faster than Boris Johnson s electoral prospects  Hence a month long blitz of headline seeking announcements on fighting crime We have had more police more prison places enhanced powers of stop and search and convicts to get the sentences they deserve a concept of Trumpian fatuity The much trumpeted idea that Johnson is some sort of Tory liberal in disguise is ridiculous 
AUG12	Labour politicians should know better than to buy into Johnson’s ‘Boris’ shtick	Is Labour really prepared for government I ask not because the party seems more concerned about grouse hunting and the glorious th than a no deal Brexit and an impending election No what really disturbs me is that the shadow cabinet is not showing sufficient animosity towards Boris Johnson  Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott was interviewed this morning on the Today programme It may be the silly season but she was there talking about serious issues Johnson s promised extra police officers and the effect increased stop and search would have on community relations When asked by Sarah Smith about Johnson s latest populist policing stunt she replied Boris doesn t quite explain how he will pay for it 
AUG12	With prospects in the gutter, who can blame millennials for turning to the stars?	Like many people with Indian family or white people with hippy parents I had my Jyotish chart drawn up when I was still in nappies I can therefore tell you that I was born into Venus making me a lustful infatuated child albeit one with Meatloaf s old hairline and a surprisingly large collection of hamsters I can also tell you that I spent my s in Moon susceptible to illusion depression and deception while living in a red brick back to back in Leeds and listening to an unhealthy amount of Leonard Cohen  For many years horoscopes held a place in my heart that was part secrecy part shame part hope and part entertainment
AUG12	Police in Hong Kong are brutally repressing democracy – and Britain is arming them	This weekend there was a further intensification of police violence against campaigners in Hong Kong Over the past two months police officers have attacked pro democracy protesters using teargas CS grenades batons and small arms More than rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets have been used since June with human rights monitors accusing the authorities of beating protesters and applying excessive and unnecessary force  It is likely that many of the weapons being used were made in the UK the Omega Research Foundation has published photos of UK made CS grenades deployed by Hong Kong police against crowds Since the UK government has licensed m worth of arms to the Hong Kong administration This includes licences for teargas anti riot shields pyrotechnic ammunition spying technology and other equipment that could be used in the crackdown 
AUG12	A rock, the sea and a battle for meaning	The rock rises out of the water about a kilometre from Tel Aviv beach It is sharp and serrated and only desperate hands the hands of a drowning man would dare to grasp it From an outsider s perspective my perspective the perspective of a woman standing on dry land what happened on this rock is simply impossible How on earth could it have supported not one but two men for long endless minutes in a life or death battle  The year is The Mediterranean is deep and blue Tel Aviv s shores are under the control of the British mandate and British law has forbidden Jews from entering the country Those who manage to escape Europe find Palestine s borders closed to them Ships are sent back to the continent only for some of their passengers to find themselves in the Nazi death camps 
AUG12	Putin began by embracing the west. Now, he wants revenge	When Boris Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin prime minister on August few Russians knew much about him In early television appearances he came across as mousy shy and awkward a man unaccustomed to the limelight from which his previous career in the KGB had shielded him  But within weeks he revealed a character trait that would become the defining feature of his rule ruthlessness His first memorable phrase was his threat to wipe out terrorists even if they re in the shithouse and within weeks he had launched a terrifying war against separatists in Chechnya that would leave tens of thousands of civilians dead 
AUG12	Do you know which 2020 Democratic frontrunners are hawks, and which doves?	In a world where the United States is fighting forever wars engaging with rising powers and belatedly realizing the existential threat of climate change the American people need to hear a coherent foreign policy That explains why four out of the five major contenders for the Democratic nomination have recently given speeches focused on foreign policy This is especially important given the fact that foreign policy is one of the areas where the modern president has relative autonomy to act  Unfortunately though the policy substance of the first two Democratic debates in Miami last month was shallow whip rounds of hand raising and arguments between also rans As the field winnows Democrats need to have a foreign policy focused debate to show what would differentiate the major contenders all we have to guess from right now are the candidates voting records speeches and campaign hires 
AUG12	Is the Queen remainers’ secret weapon? Don’t bet on it	In the preface to The Audience his play about the Queen s meetings with her many prime ministers Peter Morgan reflects that these encounters lie at the very heart of the British constitution the bone structure of our establishment in its most elemental form As apposite as this metaphor is it should also remind us that even the strongest bones can be bruised or fractured And according to reports in the Sunday Times Her Majesty has indeed had it up to here with our politicians  According to one source I think she s really dismayed I ve heard her talking about her disappointment in the current political class and its inability to govern correctly At a private event held shortly after David Cameron s resignation in she reportedly expressed her resignation and frustration about the quality of our political leadership and that frustration will only have grown

Now a country mourns their loss	How do you write a eulogy for a glacier Think about it How would you go about that having grown up with glaciers as a geological given a symbol of eternity How do you say goodbye  When academics at Rice University in Houston Texas called and asked me to write the text for a plaque to commemorate the first dead glacier in Iceland I found myself confronted with this problem I was reminded of one of my favourite passages from Kurt Vonnegut in Slaughterhouse Five 
AUG13	Britain’s infrastructure is breaking down. And here’s why no one’s fixing it	Whole swaths of Britain experience a blackout and the country lights up with fury Cabinet minsters the press members of the public rightly demand answers why was Newcastle airport plunged into darkness Who is responsible for rail services being halted for hours Threats are issued of a whopping fine an official inquiry heads rolling Days of rage for a power cut of less than an hour  When it works infrastructure is invisible Point out the crumbliness by all means and lament the dangerous compromises but as long as the wretched system judders on voters shrug and politicians look the other way Until the day the bridges collapse the trains seize up and the lights no longer come on By which time it is too late for anything but blame in point headlines 
AUG13	Art needs protection: it belongs in public galleries, not private vaults	I fell in love with a picture at the Royal Academy summer exhibition I ve long been fascinated by the Tom Phillips project A Humument which began in when he bought an obscure Victorian novel for threepence in a junk shop and began painting on the pages The picture was a page from that painted in blues alongside text that speaks of windows and dreams I gasped when I saw it Although I cannot afford this piece of art it s at least I got to go to a gallery and look at it and that was a privilege  Art belongs to us all Not literally more often than not it belongs to some billionaire but philosophically and spiritually The Isleworth Mona Lisa a painting of the same woman Lisa Gherardini as its namesake is purportedly by Leonardo da Vinci It is majority owned by an anonymous consortium and spends most of its time in their Swiss bank vault Recently it was allowed out briefly for a public exhibition in Florence and a custody battle has ensued with a lawyer Giovanni Battista Protti arguing on behalf of its other part owners that it should not be returned to the vault Whoever owns it has a responsibility towards humanity It s important it should travel the world for the benefit of everyone he said 
AUG13	Labour will scrap predicted grades to make university admissions fairer	Hundreds of thousands of students will receive their A level results on Thursday It is the end product of two years of hard work and many will be hoping it is also the start of their next educational journey  Unfortunately not all of them will have a fair chance to take that next step Our higher education admissions process is neither fair nor effective 
AUG13	After the Brexit storm, a new political alliance could emerge	When boxers go into a clinch it looks more like a tender embrace than a fight The same is true of the clash between Labour and the Tories There is no affection between England s heavyweight parties but there is a kind of intimacy about the way they lean into their antagonism for tactical comfort  Boris Johnson is glad to have Jeremy Corbyn to campaign against and the feeling is mutual Fear of installing a radical socialist in Downing Street imposes discipline on Tory ranks while the Conservative leader presents Labour with a caricature of its arch enemy careless heartless and posh 
AUG13	John Bolton doesn’t want a trade deal with the UK – he wants to colonise us	John Bolton doesn t do free trade He does regime change in countries such as North Korea Venezuela and Cuba He does military interventions notoriously in Afghanistan in Iraq in and Libya in He does punitive sanctions and embargoes He does spite  Bolton s speciality is tearing up multilateral agreements such as the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord which he claims undermine US national sovereignty For the same reason he reviles the very idea of the UN international law and the international criminal court ICC 
AUG13	How do you know whether you can trust poll results? Here’s what to watch out for	With the science of opinion polling under greater scrutiny than ever and a somewhat misleading headline spreading in an instant how can you know which insights count Perhaps counter intuitively it s less about sample size let s avoid a poor joke than about quality You will rarely get less than interviews reported in the UK media but twice the sample size does not mean double the quality If there are issues with your sample then making it bigger doesn t necessarily improve it  You should probably dismiss anything from social media retweet for larger sample or a website which can be gamed 
AUG13	Pulling out of EU meetings is a reckless PR stunt that will backfire on Britain	News that the British government is planning to withdraw from participation in EU meetings in the coming days is another ruse by Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson to send a message to Europe that the UK is leaving with or without a deal Pulling out from day to day EU business in this way only serves to further diminish what remains of British influence But such a reckless PR stunt will have minimal impact on the Brexit outcome Brussels negotiators are waiting instead to see if members of the UK parliament can get their act together and stop a no deal exit in September  Meanwhile however I can see at first hand how step by step Johnson is reducing the UK s influence making us less able to shape the policies that affect British people from fisheries policies to the climate crisis 
AUG13	A new slavery museum will have no impact on racism in Britain	Sadiq Khan has given his backing to a proposal from the Fabian Society to establish a British slavery museum in London in order to deepen our understanding of the past and strengthen our commitment to fight racism and hatred in all its forms Britain s role in transatlantic slavery is one of the most misrepresented in the national memory a tale littered with lies told to hide the dark side of the island s story  When David Cameron declared Britain should be proud to be the country that abolished slavery he was merely indulging the national myth As the celebrations of the act that abolished the slave trade demonstrated little attention is paid to much other than white saviours such as William Wilberforce Truly understanding how Britain s dominant role in slavery built the nation is essential for any progressive understanding of the present 
AUG13	Of course the US supports a no deal – it makes a minnow out of Britain	If you thought it was bad enough when Donald Trump held a reluctant Theresa May s hand then look away now For things are about to get sweatier  The president s clammy embrace of the British right continued this week with the arrival of his national security adviser John Bolton in London to declare the most isolationist US regime in living memory would enthusiastically support a no deal Brexit 
AUG14	The UK faces a nation-defining battle that will split the Tory party	Throughout his nine years in Conservative led British cabinets Philip Hammond was regularly compared to AA Milne s Eeyore But what the lugubrious former chancellor did today was almost Tiggerish By warning that Boris Johnson s government is set on driving through a no deal Brexit that parliament will oppose he gave the UK s indolent August politics a much needed wake up call  In the three weeks since a hard Brexit Tory coup put Johnson into Downing Street politics has drifted into La La land An accumulated combination of long parliamentary stalemate public weariness an ineffectual Labour opposition a compliant press and the well executed strategy of the new Tory leader has made the Johnson government s Brexit policy seem more inevitable than it actually is By breaking cover Hammond has provided an overdue reminder that the facts are still the facts 
AUG14	India’s illegal power grab is turning Kashmir into a colony	I haven t been able to hear the voices of my parents for more than a week now We usually talk or exchange messages a few times during the day mostly about their creeping health issues or about my children s latest antics here in London But now not a peep It s because like all Kashmiris they re under siege experiencing the worst crackdown in three decades imposed by the Indian government as it revoked the region s autonomy by abrogating article of the constitution  The article dating back to guaranteed Kashmir s special status within the larger Indian union and enshrined the conditions of the state s accession to India soon after partition in The newly created states of India and Pakistan had gone to war over Muslim majority Kashmir an independent kingdom at the time After mediation from the United Nations all parties agreed that the future of Kashmir was to be decided later via a referendum something India and Pakistan have failed to honour The provisions of the article meant that pending the final resolution via a plebiscite the state had its own constitution its own national flag a prime minister and a president even as successive Indian regimes starting in the early s diluted the article in order to diminish Kashmir s autonomy 
AUG14	Johnson’s government doesn’t care about no-deal sceptics like Philip Hammond	Well that didn t last long When Boris Johnson entered Downing Street last month there had been a hope among his supporters that internal Tory critics would give him the summer to get settled in before airing any differences when parliament returns in September That was not to be Philip Hammond has today concluded that three weeks was plenty of time for the summer Brexit truce The former chancellor has used an op ed in the Times to voice his concerns about the new prime minister s strategy arguing that a no deal Brexit would be as much of a betrayal as remaining in the EU  If an election does occur Hammond and other anti no deal MPs will need to consider how they plan to position themselves
AUG14	Britain’s infrastructure is breaking down. And here’s why no one’s fixing it	Whole swaths of Britain experience a blackout and the country lights up with fury Cabinet minsters the press members of the public rightly demand answers why was Newcastle airport plunged into darkness Who is responsible for rail services being halted for hours Threats are issued of a whopping fine an official inquiry heads rolling Days of rage for a power cut of less than an hour  When it works infrastructure is invisible Point out the crumbliness by all means and lament the dangerous compromises but as long as the wretched system judders on voters shrug and politicians look the other way Until the day the bridges collapse the trains seize up and the lights no longer come on By which time it is too late for anything but blame in point headlines 
AUG14	Ex-porn star Mia Khalifa wants to move on with her life. Why won't we let her?	It s hard to get a clear picture of how many adults are watching porn on the internet A study by the Observer back in suggested of us had done so in American researchers found of women and of men had done so in the last six months I would put money on the real numbers being even higher That s what makes listening to social media personality Mia Khalifa talk about her struggle to move on from her time in the porn industry so uncomfortable  Speaking in an interview published on YouTube the year old opens up about how appearing in porn over a period of just three months in continues to affect her life today People think I m racking in millions from porn Completely untrue she tweeted alongside a clip of the video I made a TOTAL of around in the industry and never saw a penny again after that Difficulty finding a normal job after quitting porn was scary 
AUG14	How the far right in Spain has seized on bullfighting to make its point	Last Friday after a brief prohibition bullfighting returned to Mallorca The bullfight was well attended and it was met with a demonstration by a large group of animal rights protesters To drown out the demonstrators Cara al Sol Facing the Sun the anthem of the Spanish fascist party the Falange was played over the loudspeakers What exactly is going on here  The cult of the bull on the Iberian peninsula goes back millennia but bullfights are a more recent phenomenon They date to the th century when Felipe V the first of the Bourbon kings banned and disparaged bullfighting by the aristocracy Old style bullfighting nobles on horseback fighting bulls with lances died out giving rise to a new type of bullfighting on foot and practised by the common people

Now a country mourns their loss	How do you write a eulogy for a glacier Think about it How would you go about that having grown up with glaciers as a geological given a symbol of eternity How do you say goodbye  When academics at Rice University in Houston Texas called and asked me to write the text for a plaque to commemorate the first dead glacier in Iceland I found myself confronted with this problem I was reminded of one of my favourite passages from Kurt Vonnegut in Slaughterhouse Five 
AUG14	Invisibility cloaks and 3D masks: how to thwart the facial recognition cameras	Picture the scene You and your kids are sporting in the fountains in the square behind London s King s Cross station Your phone beeps A news alert tells you that the owners of this pseudo public space Argent are using facial recognition software in security cameras You look up from your phone and see a camera pointed right at you It s not just the police who are photographing and identifying you on the street now but private security operatives too Not only do you worry that your boss might thereby acquire data to undermine your claim to be working from home but you are furious at this violation of your privacy not to mention feeling quite stupid for forgetting a towel  Your fears are not allayed by this statement from Argent These cameras use a number of detection and tracking methods including facial recognition but also have sophisticated systems in place to protect the privacy of the general public particularly when they didn t disclose what these systems are 
AUG14	Drug companies are putting a price on the lives of those with cystic fibrosis	At am I wake up and while most people are starting their days having breakfast and making their way to work I like the people in the UK with cystic fibrosis am beginning my daily treatment regime For me this involves a concoction of tablets to fuel my morning each with their own variety of debilitating side effects from sickness to dizziness and fatigue The morning calm is disturbed by my noisy inhalation machine as I breathe in medications while a positive pressure machine helps me cough up thick sticky mucus from my lungs which takes another hour All in all it s a glamorous way to start the day  And it doesn t stop there Every time I eat I have to take enzymes to help me digest my food and I take a regular dose of painkillers to help me get through the aches and pains It s a constant reminder of my disability and all the limitations it has on me living a normal life After a long and exhausting day my medication routine is repeated in the evening with more oral antibiotics and the same gruelling therapy process I do this every day morning and evening in order to try to stay as healthy as possible and in an attempt to maintain my lung function 
AUG14	Art needs protection: it belongs in public galleries, not private vaults	I fell in love with a picture at the Royal Academy summer exhibition I ve long been fascinated by the Tom Phillips project A Humument which began in when he bought an obscure Victorian novel for threepence in a junk shop and began painting on the pages The picture was a page from that painted in blues alongside text that speaks of windows and dreams I gasped when I saw it Although I cannot afford this piece of art it s at least I got to go to a gallery and look at it and that was a privilege  Art belongs to us all Not literally more often than not it belongs to some billionaire but philosophically and spiritually The Isleworth Mona Lisa a painting of the same woman Lisa Gherardini as its namesake is purportedly by Leonardo da Vinci It is majority owned by an anonymous consortium and spends most of its time in their Swiss bank vault Recently it was allowed out briefly for a public exhibition in Florence and a custody battle has ensued with a lawyer Giovanni Battista Protti arguing on behalf of its other part owners that it should not be returned to the vault Whoever owns it has a responsibility towards humanity It s important it should travel the world for the benefit of everyone he said 
AUG15	If Jo Swinson is serious about stopping a no-deal Brexit, she must support Corbyn	Jeremy Corbyn has always been more of a politician than either his most fervent supporters or detractors have wanted to admit Last night he again demonstrated why In a move unprecedented in modern times the leader of the opposition has offered to form a government with the express proviso of not implementing any of his party s policies  Corbyn s offer in a letter to other party leaders and moderate Tories involves setting up a strictly time limited temporary government with the sole intention of extending article and holding a general election In that election Corbyn will commit to a new referendum with the option of remaining in the EU 
AUG15	Boris Johnson’s crackdown on crime is just the latest ruse in the Tories’ class war	Our so called justice system exists to crack down on the misdemeanours of the poor while ignoring the crimes committed by the rich When Boris Johnson proposes a law and order clampdown driven by cynical electioneering rather than actual evidence he s talking about locking up the people you step over in the street as Frances Crook the CEO of the Howard League for Penal Reform puts it not reckless bankers or white collar fraudsters  Lock em up throw away the key such demagoguery always has an innate emotional appeal not least among a public enraged by increased violent crime which is itself fuelled by a decade of slash and burn Tory economic policies But further brutalising those already roughed up by a social order rigged in favour of yacht owners financiers and the residents of Mayfair will satisfy the bloodlust of the Daily Mail and achieve little else 
AUG15	Corbyn has taken a brave step. Now he must rule out any ‘Labour Brexit’	Jeremy Corbyn just got inside everyone else s decision cycles The Labour leader s offer to lead a strictly time limited government to prevent a no deal Brexit and to call a general election has forced all political factions to react and led the news bulletins  Amid the initial responses which ranged from cautious to churlish the bigger point has been missed Corbyn s gambit crossed numerous significant lines both political and psychological 
AUG15	Remainers will do anything to stop Brexit, except install Corbyn as PM. Why?	Brexiters stop at nothing to get what they want and remainers stop at everything The laws of political motion then dictate which direction things move  Jeremy Corbyn has written to MPs inviting them to install him in Downing Street having deposed Boris Johnson with a vote of no confidence His tenure would he promises be strictly time limited long enough to call a general election and seek the necessary article extension to conduct a ballot 
AUG15	Social class still stops too many pupils from fulfilling their A-level potential	As A level students across England Wales and Northern Ireland open their results today it is fascinating to see how the public broadcasting of success is reaching ever wider audiences through news streaming and social media where constant posting and comments will dominate news for the next few days  Images of young people literally jumping for joy dominate the headlines and the exam results data is closely interrogated Data analysis usually rests on pass rates and concern about whether these have risen or fallen each year there are questions that challenge our trust in the so called gold standard examination because A levels have the potential to open doors for some young people 
AUG15	In Reykjavik I found I couldn’t write. But then I started to notice small things	In the summer of I moved to Reykjavik with my young family I stopped writing Not writing didn t matter phases of silence are good for writers the way winter is good for trees but it was uncomfortable Iceland is a deeply literary country its national identity founded in the sagas which recount the first centuries of settlement beginning a thousand years ago Icelanders read more books than anyone else and writing and storytelling are highly valued Writers with no particular connection to Iceland often feel called to visit in order to research and write novels set there and before we moved I imagined that I might too A family of medieval outlaws I thought or something experimental about extreme weather and the human condition or maybe just a novel about a family who move to Iceland How could a story fail to turn up  Courtesy here is like the plants everything is close to the ground and slow growing
AUG15	Brexiteers promised a new dawn for UK farming, not agricultural Armageddon	A small flock of sheep is trotting down Whitehall today to join a meeting of farmers who are coming together to mark the launch of a devastating report on the impact of a no deal Brexit The report rings the death knell for upland hill farming but sheep are only the first in the line of fire it also warns that half of Britain s farms would go out of business and calls for a public vote before any Brexit  Today s report written by S an Rickard the former chief economist of the National Farmers Union and launched by Farmers for a People s Vote is a forensic analysis of the effect of a crash out Brexit which the government will struggle to refute The high proportion of UK farm exports to the EU would stop barred by regulatory barriers and deterred by tariffs on chickens on lamb and on beef Cereals would be hit too The government says it will remove or sharply lower all tariffs on imported food to keep prices down as the pound plunges But this report shows how that import surge would wreck British farming 
AUG15	The UK faces a nation-defining battle that will split the Tory party	Throughout his nine years in Conservative led British cabinets Philip Hammond was regularly compared to AA Milne s Eeyore But what the lugubrious former chancellor did today was almost Tiggerish By warning that Boris Johnson s government is set on driving through a no deal Brexit that parliament will oppose he gave the UK s indolent August politics a much needed wake up call  In the three weeks since a hard Brexit Tory coup put Johnson into Downing Street politics has drifted into La La land An accumulated combination of long parliamentary stalemate public weariness an ineffectual Labour opposition a compliant press and the well executed strategy of the new Tory leader has made the Johnson government s Brexit policy seem more inevitable than it actually is By breaking cover Hammond has provided an overdue reminder that the facts are still the facts 
AUG15	Dementia is our collective responsibility. We can’t ignore it any longer	There s a silent crisis in our midst Often cunning and stealthy like Grandmother s Footsteps sometimes swift and brutal dementia is all around us One in eight people die of it In the UK a person is diagnosed with it every three minutes Yet we are still collectively failing to acknowledge this self demolishing illness which is now the largest cause of death in England and Wales and the one we most fear Why  I ve recently been doing talks around the country as part of John s Campaign named after my late father who lived for years with the disease which I co founded to encourage the NHS to collaborate more with families in the care of dementia patients There is always time given to questions from the audience at the end Often these turn out not to be questions at all but confessions or acts of bearing witness or simply pleas to be heard understood recognised In a hall in London a young woman puts up her hand stands opens her mouth then instead of asking a question she bursts into tears In a church in the north of England an old woman speaks of how for years she cared for her husband with a particularly savage form of early onset dementia until he died and how she was now the sole carer for her son who has the same illness She speaks with a terrifying calmness it s only when those around her offer help that her face crumples in grief A man with white hair asks What shall I do What A daughter asks How do we tell him what is wrong with him A son asks How long can it last He also means How long can I bear it 
AUG15	What Dominic Cummings said is true – the Tories don’t care about the NHS	Dominic Cummings the mastermind behind the Vote Leave campaign and now the prime minister s top political adviser wrote after the referendum Would we have won without m NHS All our research and the close result strongly suggests no Cummings also said in that Tory MPs don t care about the NHS Cummings who was found to be in contempt of parliament earlier this year is now leading the prime minister s attempts to take the UK out of the EU without a deal So with the leavers now in charge will their infamous m a week cash injection for the NHS come to fruition Of course not we are instead looking at a potential crisis that could cost lives  Matt Hancock the health secretary refuses to rule out deaths from medicine shortages if the UK crashes out saying No deal is not pretty It s very difficult for the economy and for lots of other areas like healthcare But still he serves in the government And his department is even trying to stop the truth from getting out Through freedom of information requests to all NHS trusts in England and Wales I have learned that the Department of Health and Social Care DHSC has essentially imposed a gagging order to prevent trusts from publishing their own impact studies about what a no deal Brexit would mean for hospitals staff and patients Hospital chiefs have been told that releasing the information could cause trusts premature financial harm and so possibly put public wellbeing at risk 
AUG16	‘National Unity’: the fantasy flick that will never make it out of development	Three years on from the Brexit vote what best crystallises where we are Perhaps that nowhere even close to politicians can unify on what would constitute a government of national unity The Liberal Democrats will do anything to stop Brexit except for the things they won t Labour would love to stop the Tories version of Brexit but first they just want to look busy and set this quick trap for the Lib Dems the Greens want the headlines for a day and they ve got a plan just batshit enough to secure them and so on Dominic Cummings must be cackling The only worse form of unity was a Mitford  So while it s positive to have had leadership of the prospective government of national unity whittled down to just under million candidates it does feel a little bit near the business end of things for politicians to be indulging in the weapons grade wankery we ve seen this week 
AUG16	There’s an idea that could transform Britain – but Brexit won’t let it be heard	Against some stiff competition one of the worst things about Brexit is the way it sucks up all the oxygen consuming whatever political energy is available until there s none left for anything else Just think what we might have achieved these past three years if the bureaucratic and intellectual resources we ve devoted to the business of leaving the European Union had been directed elsewhere  Instead there s barely been time to think about let alone deal with the climate crisis or even some of the issues that led to the Brexit vote from precarious work to the shortage of affordable housing There is perhaps no more concrete example of this attention squeeze than in relation to an idea that would utterly transform the public services we rely on from cradle to grave an idea so bold and innovative it is winning admirers all over the world its author summoned to address governments from Scandinavia to Latin America its approach hailed on the opinion page of the New York Times as the fix for a broken welfare state and yet all but ignored by the national government of the author s home country whose bandwidth is consumed entirely by Brexit 
AUG16	By dismissing Corbyn’s overtures, the Lib Dems are showing their true colours	If your signature policy indeed only visible political position is to stop Brexit and you claim that you will do absolutely everything within your power to prevent no deal then it s something of an error to suddenly introduce an exception And yet this is the fatal mistake the Liberal Democrats have made  When Jeremy Corbyn wrote a letter putting himself forward as a transitional prime minister purely to block no deal extend article and call an election Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson could have welcomed the move as constructive as the SNP Greens Plaid Cymru have done with several Tory backbenchers prepared to talk too Instead Swinson revealed that while the Lib Dems had been willing to prop David Cameron up for five years implementing massive cuts and trebling tuition fees she s not prepared to countenance supporting Corbyn for five weeks solely to stop a disorderly exit from the EU Her plan to do a backroom deal to put Harriet Harman or Ken Clarke in No smacks not only of establishment stitch up it is also a constitutional nonsense given it falls to the leader of the opposition who has twice won a democratic mandate from his party membership and whose party won of the vote just two years ago to construct an alternative government But constitutional nonsense otherwise known as the Fixed term Parliaments Act which is itself another Lib Dem gift to the nation is why we re in this mess in the first place 
AUG16	Of course millennials are saying ‘I don’t’ to wedding invites. We’re completely broke	I adore being a wedding guest In fairness I realise we re not allowed to admit otherwise If you don t toe the party line you don t get to go to the buffet Claiming that you don t like attending weddings is worse than saying that you hate Christmas or that the sound of children laughing and playing makes you want to remove your own ears with nail scissors  Weddings can be challenging if you don t like bunting or you wish to have full jurisdiction over your bank holidays But every single person who attends a wedding has the chance to appear in the final scenes of a romantic comedy You can write your own silly jokes choose your own special headgear and escape from reality with the help of lukewarm white wine and overcooked chicken In wedding venues are the only places left in the UK where you know that you can turn up and most people will be in a good mood 
AUG16	Forget a 2008 Lehman Bros-style crash – this is how a ‘normal’ recession could start	There s a hoary old proverb in the financial markets that a crisis happens precisely when the institutional memory of the last crisis has faded when all the key chairs are occupied by people who aren t scared any more the same mistakes get repeated  On that basis in the face of grim economic news around the world we ought to be reasonably safe from another Lehman Brothers type meltdown or even a repeat of the eurozone crisis But what might be a little bit more worrying is that there are surprisingly few people left who remember how the normal kind of recession happens 
AUG16	Peterloo was the massacre that led to a new democratic era	Two hundred years ago on August the event we ve come to know as the Peterloo massacre took place as a public meeting on St Peter s Fields in Manchester was violently broken up by troops acting on the orders of the local magistrates The meeting had been called as part of a wider movement to demand parliamentary representation for the rapidly growing industrial city of Manchester which had no MP at the time  The economic depression that followed the end of the Napoleonic wars made worse by a series of poor harvests had led to widespread unemployment wage cuts and desperate poverty in the area and people had no means of making their wishes known to parliament except by extra parliamentary means 
AUG16	Social media must not rob us of the right to change our minds	It could all have been so different In some parallel dimension social media is being used to shape our political discourse for the better as an arena where views and beliefs are expressed generously and listened to eagerly where we allow our prejudices to be challenged where we welcome opposing opinions where we learn from those who see the world differently from us  Alas we are in this dimension and we are human beings so what could have had a beneficial effect on public life instead threatens its viability And at a time when compromise is needed more than ever not least to help ease a political impasse that endangers the social fabric of Britain social media gives every appearance of having been devised solely to guarantee tribalism and intransigence It is time for us first to acknowledge and then to resist its calculated manipulation of our psychological weaknesses and assert afresh one of our greatest freedoms the freedom to change our minds 
AUG16	Packing Christmas cards knocked the pseudo-intellectual snob out of me	I finished my A levels in July of the summer of the eclipse the Matrix and legally the start of my adult life The one thing these things had in common was that none of them was visible from the Leicestershire village of Earl Shilton It s a place you might describe as picturesque or rural as long as you were standing on the outskirts and facing the surrounding countryside At the time I was more likely to use words like bleak small and decaying isolated shithole but that s because I was a teenage Manic Street Preachers fan and we said that sort of thing a lot  Going to university was something of an unknown quantity in my family but my parents unbelievably proud of my offer to study sociology at Loughborough knew one thing for sure and hammered it home you got a job in the holidays It s just what you did And I was going to need the money For the first time since there was to be no mandatory grant for students thanks New Labour and though I qualified for support to cover my tuition fees and a student loan would just about cover the rent for my self catered shared room in halls if I didn t save any cash I wasn t going to have any I knew the student union did pound a pint nights but I d probably have to eat too 
AUG16	Omar al-Bashir’s trial will be a sham, but Sudan’s revolution is alive and well	For such a young revolution the Sudanese uprising already has many potential anniversaries On April it deposed the Sudanese president Omar al Bashir after almost years of rule Twenty four hours later on the th it dispatched his successor Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf And then came June a day marked in blood on the uprising s calendar when the army and the Janjaweed militia launched a dawn massacre across the country targeting peaceful protesters  Bashir is not really gone He has only been replaced by those who stood in the shadows behind him
AUG16	The chicken shop knife-crime campaign would be funny if it wasn’t so tragic	After their Go Home vans a campaign so ill conceived and prejudicial it had to be withdrawn after public outcry you d think the Home Office would have learned its lesson But alas This is a stand back chaps and hold my drink kind of government its spirit animal is a bull in a china shop and like a demented Tinkerbell it truly believes that anything is possible with a little faith trust and pixie dust sorry I mean racism  The latest debacle unfurled on Wednesday when the Home Office proudly tweeted about the launch of its chicken shop focused anti knife initiative in which thousands of takeaway boxes will be repackaged with the stories of young people who successfully went knifefree 
AUG17	The Philadelphia story couldn’t be told today…	Many years ago a friend s mother asked her if her husband was going to accompany them to the playground No Mum my pal replied with what the cynical might assume was false brightness He s seen the kids go down a slide before  Now in these times when as enraged libertarians like to point out one can hardly crack a common or garden joke without being sent to the stocks she d probably be fined for perpetuating a negative gender stereotype 
AUG17	Last week, I gazed on a truly wild land... and saw art reflected back	Achmore is a nondescript hamlet on the A that cuts across the isle of Lewis and Harris in the Outer Hebrides This is a gnarled fractured landscape swaddled in wind and rain and built out of some of the oldest rocks on Earth Lewisian gneiss the bedrock of the island is some bn years old two thirds the age of Earth itself  We had gone to Achmore to search out an ancient stone circle There are dozens of these including the most famous one at Calanais scattered across Lewis s melancholic moorland The Achmore stone circle was disappointing with little to catch the eye But then we turned to look south And almost gasped For Lewis s forbidding landscape caught in a delicate light suffused through the late afternoon cloud had been transformed becoming draped in an ethereal almost unreal beauty Dozens of lochans small lochs dappled the foreground Behind them where the hills of Harris rose were layer upon soft layer of pastel colours from gold through green to blue laid like chiffon scarves across the horizon 
AUG17	Oh I do like to be beside the seaside, but many of our coastal towns need more love	My summer holiday of choice involves no passport minimal cultural outings and as much time as possible spent immersed in C water When I tell people that I am spending my break swimming in the North Sea off Yorkshire reactions tend to run from you re brave to why would you do that Which I imagine is similar to the comments I d get if I announced I was taking a week to visit prisoners with whole life orders But I maintain that true pleasure requires not much more than an RNLI supervised beach a tide table and a novel to read between dips  The British seaside is tragically underappreciated and disastrously underfunded A lack of year round jobs and lousy transport links are driving its residents away four in coastal towns are forecast to suffer a decline in their population of under s with those in the north worst affected Even the south west which attracts nearly half of the visitors to Britain s coast is struggling Places that are a hive of cute tearooms and sun dappled tourists in the summer pull down their shutters at the end of the season the holidaymakers leave and a bleak and empty winter sets in 
AUG17	Greta Gerwig: why Little Women still generates a big buzz	You have to be super confident to release a film without Will Ferrell at Christmas But then eagerly anticipated doesn t quite cover the release of Greta Gerwig s Little Women In case you haven t been ticking off the days in an analogue fabric covered diary with lock like a genuine Louisa May Alcott nut the release date is Christmas Day Boxing Day in the UK And on the basis of just a trailer Little Women has been tipped for all Oscars by everyone  Overhyped Absolutely not This confidence is correctly placed Despite the diminutive title Little Women is a ratings behemoth It always has been Written in the midst of the American civil war the novel has spent the intervening years as the stand out star of novels for young women The saga of the four sisters of the March family of Massachusetts their conflicting ambitions and achievements has proved to be intergenerational catnip It is also one of those library A listers that works super well on screen There have been at least eight TV versions a silent film a version in Technicolor and the version starring Susan Sarandon and Winona Ryder 
AUG17	How Greta Thunberg became the new front in the Brexit culture war	She looks both younger than her age and old enough to have the cares of the world on her shoulders Face scrubbed clean dressed in a severe black jacket Greta Thunberg stares unsmiling from the cover of this month s GQ magazine It s an arresting even unsettling image her outstretched finger points accusingly at the reader in the manner of a wartime recruitment poster Your planet needs you millennials  Back in the s posing for men s magazines in your knickers was a rite of passage for young actors and pop stars not so much older than Greta but that feels a very long time ago now Here is a cover girl designed not to titillate male readers but to nudge their consciences and very successfully too Successfully enough to make her some powerful enemies 
AUG17	‘Do black people read?’ What my years in publishing have taught me about diversity in books	My daughter like me is of mixed heritage She has wildly curly hair as have I When she was born four years ago I was given five copies of the same kids picture book by well meaning friends and relatives It was called Guess How Much I Love You This book whose lead characters are rabbits was a bestseller in the s Back then it flew off the shelves What I did not expect when I was pregnant with my daughter was that it would be far easier to find her a rabbit picture book than one featuring a child like her with brown skin and curls  This week Malorie Blackman author of Noughts and Crosses told Channel News that of the many books she read as a child not one of them featured a black child like me adding that it made me feel invisible in the world of literature And when in her mid s she noticed in a children s bookshop that little had changed that s when I decided that I wanted to write for children for the child in me really for all the books I wish I could have read as a child 
AUG17	‘National Unity’: the fantasy flick that will never make it out of development	Three years on from the Brexit vote what best crystallises where we are Perhaps that nowhere even close to politicians can unify on what would constitute a government of national unity The Liberal Democrats will do anything to stop Brexit except for the things they won t Labour would love to stop the Tories version of Brexit but first they just want to look busy and set this quick trap for the Lib Dems the Greens want the headlines for a day and they ve got a plan just batshit enough to secure them and so on Dominic Cummings must be cackling The only worse form of unity was a Mitford  So while it s positive to have had leadership of the prospective government of national unity whittled down to just under million candidates it does feel a little bit near the business end of things for politicians to be indulging in the weapons grade wankery we ve seen this week 
AUG17	Switch off the phone, turn on the radio and tune into Proust	Might Marcel Proust on finding that BBC Radio is to broadcast a hour adaptation of In Search of Lost Time across the August bank holiday weekend stretch his dictum that the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes so that it also includes ears Or might a st century version of him simply mutter meh and start streaming episodes of Euphoria or Glow while tweeting about something completely different  I d like to think the former though Proust like Isaac Hayes s Shaft was a complicated man and not amenable to second guessing Either way though the broadcast is good news for devotees of the author and of French literature and to anyone wary of the often toxic brew of over excitement overindulgence and ennui that a long weekend brings Under a Labour government which would be committed to even more of the damn things let s hope for lengthy adaptations of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists and Germinal 
AUG17	There’s an idea that could transform Britain – but Brexit won’t let it be heard	Against some stiff competition one of the worst things about Brexit is the way it sucks up all the oxygen consuming whatever political energy is available until there s none left for anything else Just think what we might have achieved these past three years if the bureaucratic and intellectual resources we ve devoted to the business of leaving the European Union had been directed elsewhere  Instead there s barely been time to think about let alone deal with the climate crisis or even some of the issues that led to the Brexit vote from precarious work to the shortage of affordable housing There is perhaps no more concrete example of this attention squeeze than in relation to an idea that would utterly transform the public services we rely on from cradle to grave an idea so bold and innovative it is winning admirers all over the world its author summoned to address governments from Scandinavia to Latin America its approach hailed on the opinion page of the New York Times as the fix for a broken welfare state and yet all but ignored by the national government of the author s home country whose bandwidth is consumed entirely by Brexit 
AUG17	By dismissing Corbyn’s overtures, the Lib Dems are showing their true colours	If your signature policy indeed only visible political position is to stop Brexit and you claim that you will do absolutely everything within your power to prevent no deal then it s something of an error to suddenly introduce an exception And yet this is the fatal mistake the Liberal Democrats have made  When Jeremy Corbyn wrote a letter putting himself forward as a transitional prime minister purely to block no deal extend article and call an election Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson could have welcomed the move as constructive as the SNP Greens Plaid Cymru have done with several Tory backbenchers prepared to talk too Instead Swinson revealed that while the Lib Dems had been willing to prop David Cameron up for five years implementing massive cuts and trebling tuition fees she s not prepared to countenance supporting Corbyn for five weeks solely to stop a disorderly exit from the EU Her plan to do a backroom deal to put Harriet Harman or Ken Clarke in No smacks not only of establishment stitch up it is also a constitutional nonsense given it falls to the leader of the opposition who has twice won a democratic mandate from his party membership and whose party won of the vote just two years ago to construct an alternative government But constitutional nonsense otherwise known as the Fixed term Parliaments Act which is itself another Lib Dem gift to the nation is why we re in this mess in the first place 
AUG18	Now we know the cost of no deal, MPs must do whatever it takes	The term Project Fear must be expunged from the respectable political lexicon Now that we know the full detail of the government s Operation Yellowhammer assumptions about a no deal Brexit these two words scornfully applied for three years to all warnings about Brexit have no meaningful place in the present political emergency   There s a lot of scaremongering around declared the energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng on Sky s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show in dismissive response to the Sunday Times reports on the leaked Yellowhammer document Really These after all are the government s own assessments not the panicked assertions of ultra remainers 
AUG18	Jeremy Corbyn wants a general election, but is his party ready to fight one?	Be careful what you ask for Labour relentlessly demands a general election and may attempt to bring one about in the autumn but is the party in good shape to fight what will be one of the most critical campaigns in our modern history When I put this important yet neglected question to one senior figure in the party he responded with blunt candour No we re not ready Not remotely ready  Let s break it down into five components candidates leadership messages mobilisation and money In each category Labour faces difficulties Some are relatively mild Other handicaps are severe and hard even impossible to address in the very little time that may be left before an election is upon us 
AUG18	Salvini wants to lead Italy. He may be about to get the chance	We are witnessing the beginning of act two in the drama of Italian populism and it is a showdown between the protagonists who made phase one happen Since the election of Matteo Salvini s League has grown stronger and it has had enough of its coalition partner the Five Star Movement It now feels it can claim sole leadership of the country with Salvini as prime minister  It s a development that Steve Bannon the theoretician of the US populist wave that elected Trump in foresaw The day after the coalition was formed Bannon said of Salvini and the Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio They will govern together but Salvini is the real leader because Di Maio resembles Emmanuel Macron This was always a tactical alliance because in the end populism is based on there being only one leader 
AUG18	It’s the moral panic de rigueur – but they can’t make me feel bad about being trans	There s a strange dissonance inherent in being a living breathing three dimensional trans person at a time when the concept of your existence is framed as an abstract topic for debate one you re forced to reluctantly show up for despite never agreeing to  As trans people become the moral panic de rigueur as a narrative emerges so deliberately sensationalised it remains obvious that those who would seek to erase trans people from public life have never spoken to a trans person in their lives 
AUG18	Peter Fonda, the easy rider who tested the hippy dream	Add today high up the list of those iconic images of the s that of Peter Fonda in floral shirt and outrageous sideburns riding free on his Harley to a soundtrack of Steppenwolf s Born to be Wild  John Kay s growl was a battle hymn for those looking for adventure along the open road down which Wyatt Billy and George Fonda Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson unleashed themselves And they Fonda above all represented the quintessence of that era its creative tumult idealism loss and self absorption on screen 
AUG18	Revealed: Boris Johnson's secret weapon for a no-deal Brexit	How many small plastic toy egg casings could be hidden in for example a Michael Gove And if we knew this figure and had an accurate idea of potential volunteer multiple plastic toy egg couriers could we extrapolate from it the volume of goods that might be secretly transported in this fashion both in and out of our ring fenced island nation And why is knowing this number an important part of planning for the no deal Brexit that our uncooperative friends in George Soros s Europe and the traitorous MPs who collaborate with them are cruelly forcing on us through no fault of our own  A civil servant I was in Woodcraft Folk with years ago regularly texts me about bizarre developments in the National Centre For No Deal Planning despite risking her job to do so They ve got us hard at work finding out how we get components and medicines and essential items into the country if or when the supply lines break down Don t forget to stockpile toilet roll Stewey It may end up being the only viable form of currency LOL 
AUG18	Facial recognition is now rampant. The implications for our freedom are chilling	Last week all of us who live in the UK and all who visit us discovered that our faces were being scanned secretly by private companies and have been for some time We don t know what these companies are doing with our faces or how long they ve been doing it because they refused to share this with the Financial Times which reported on Monday that facial recognition technology is being used in King s Cross and may be deployed in Canary Wharf two areas that cover more than acres of London  We are just as ignorant about what has been happening to our faces when they re scanned by the property developers shopping centres museums conference centres and casinos that have also been secretly using facial recognition technology on us according to the civil liberties group Big Brother Watch 
AUG18	Spinning conspiracy theories won’t help us prevent another Chernobyl	Did it really happen Was it really so bad Is it true that they were so unprepared These are the questions I have heard the past few months in connection with the stunning success of the miniseries Chernobyl It brought to life the tragedy of people who lived through were affected by and yes caused the world s worst nuclear disaster  My book Chernobyl History of a Tragedy published in May one year before the broadcast of the miniseries tells the story of the disaster on the basis of recently released archival documents which I checked against people s diaries memoirs and interviews Thus on the factual level I can provide some answers to the accuracy of the miniseries But inquiries I ve received in the past few months also made me think about the bigger question of what is true in our current understanding of the Chernobyl disaster its causes development and consequences 
AUG18	The Philadelphia story couldn’t be told today…	Many years ago a friend s mother asked her if her husband was going to accompany them to the playground No Mum my pal replied with what the cynical might assume was false brightness He s seen the kids go down a slide before  Now in these times when as enraged libertarians like to point out one can hardly crack a common or garden joke without being sent to the stocks she d probably be fined for perpetuating a negative gender stereotype 
AUG18	Last week, I gazed on a truly wild land... and saw art reflected back	Achmore is a nondescript hamlet on the A that cuts across the isle of Lewis and Harris in the Outer Hebrides This is a gnarled fractured landscape swaddled in wind and rain and built out of some of the oldest rocks on Earth Lewisian gneiss the bedrock of the island is some bn years old two thirds the age of Earth itself  We had gone to Achmore to search out an ancient stone circle There are dozens of these including the most famous one at Calanais scattered across Lewis s melancholic moorland The Achmore stone circle was disappointing with little to catch the eye But then we turned to look south And almost gasped For Lewis s forbidding landscape caught in a delicate light suffused through the late afternoon cloud had been transformed becoming draped in an ethereal almost unreal beauty Dozens of lochans small lochs dappled the foreground Behind them where the hills of Harris rose were layer upon soft layer of pastel colours from gold through green to blue laid like chiffon scarves across the horizon 
AUG19	A no-deal Brexit is disastrous. But are MPs brave enough to stop it?	In the cloudy realms of unreality befogging this cabinet of fanatics the approaching Brexit cataclysm is only some bumps in the road So says Michael Gove the minister in charge of national preparedness True austerity has inured the country to bumps there are officially million unfilled potholes a bn backlog of repairs But the earthshaking Operation Yellowhammer report is likely to cause something more like a seismic shock to public opinion on Brexit  Corbyn s finest hour as the moderate compromiser would send his chances of winning the election soaring
AUG19	Donald Trump’s ‘peace agreement’ is a betrayal of Afghanistan and its people	If Donald Trump has his way a peace agreement in Afghanistan will be finalised in the coming days It s a sure bet the US president will claim noisy personal credit for ending one of America s longest wars Knowing him he may even hail it as the deal of the century despite having already accorded that boastful accolade to his failed North Korea summitry But the world as always should beware a Trump bearing gifts  It will deliver what candidate Trump most wants a path home for American troops before next year s US election
AUG19	Corbyn could have been the nation’s saviour. But he’s just too tribal	History is offering Jeremy Corbyn the gift of his dreams and he is rejecting it He has said he will do everything necessary to save Britain from the bizarre self harm of no deal Brexit personally crafted by Boris Johnson He will not  Corbyn will not lay aside partisan rhetoric and muster the parliamentary coalition that alone might bar no deal in the coming weeks nor will he give way to other potential and less abrasive leaders of such a coalition Every word Corbyn utters makes it ever more impossible for Liberal Democrats nationalists or dissident Tories to lend him support however temporary Corbyn does not want to stop Brexit He just wants a general election 
AUG19	We were promised change – but corruption and brutality still rule in Zimbabwe	In the Shona language Nyamavhuvhu August signals the end of winter The strong winds carry away the frost as they usher in the warmth of summer With the silent strength of a new season public discontent towards President Emmerson Mnangagwa s failing socio economic policies sweeps across Zimbabwe manifesting itself through mounting displeasure and the growing threat of civil unrest  On the streets of the capital Harare a middle aged woman lies unconscious on the asphalt An uncanny silence hangs in the air punctuated only by the sound of water cannons patrolling the street and a sea of riot police conversing in hushed tones with each other The blue helmeted police a signature of the Robert Mugabe era march in straight lines through the central business district Businesses are closed Thick clouds of off white teargas fill the sky An old grey haired man who is left behind by the fleeing crowd is kicked in the ribs by two police officers and dragged by his side A young man who tries to assist the stricken woman is arrested and bundled into a police truck Elsewhere Red Cross volunteers attend to an old woman who has suffered injuries to her head after being beaten 
AUG19	Want to see the future? Take a trip on Wales’ model railway	As the first hints of an autumnal chill chime with a revived sense of Brexit dread this may not seem the best time to talk about hopeful glimmers of the future To do so with reference to Britain s railways moreover might look like lunacy given the summer s run of headlines about power cuts the apparently awful new sleeper service from London to Scotland and last week the announcement of yet another round of fare rises But a fortnight ago the experience of travelling through spectacular countryside on single carriage trains filled me with an optimism I have not felt for some time and a sense of the possibilities that still lurk beneath our national nightmare  With my dad and my year old daughter I was on the Heart of Wales line a mile mostly single track route that runs between Shrewsbury and Swansea As well as six tunnels and two glorious viaducts there are stops of which are so called request stations meaning that passengers who want to use them must either tell the conductor or if they are getting on make themselves visible as the train comes into view you basically just have to stand on the platform though jumping up and down adds to the fun 
AUG19	Virtual reality headsets to distract women from the pain of labour? Dream on	There was a point during labour when I would quite happily have ripped off every scrap of clothing hunkered down into a squat and moaned like a pilot whale in the middle of a busy Frankie Benny s to deliver that baby You could have thrown inch four cheese pizzas at my face and served cajun cheese fries off my head and I would hardly have noticed Forty hours in I was so beyond my body so utterly absorbed by the swollen fuzzy monumental pressure beneath my skin so transported by a feeling that wasn t pain but felt like the tearing open of rock that I would hardly have noticed if a family of four from Smethwick had turned up and started eating chicken wings in the corner of the birthing room I have never been more aware of and more occupied by the present moment in my life  Which is why when I first read that University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is offering labouring women virtual reality headsets during labour I wondered why bother During the last hours of my labour I was so completely transported by my physical experience as I hung off door handles appeared to slide up the wall and felt my breath leave my body like a coil of golden thread that visions of a herd of buffalo or a quick virtual swim through a coral reef would hardly have registered The idea of walking around my room in that wonderful east London birth centre utterly naked but for a Daft Punk style helmet over my pale and sweaty face colostrum falling across my pulsating orb of a stomach shuddering with each contraction like a freight train seemed faintly ridiculous 
AUG19	Greta Thunberg’s attackers are morally bankrupt, but her deification isn’t helpful	As Greta Thunberg sets sail across the Atlantic to the United Nations in New York the backlash against her has been as vicious as it is has been inevitable According to the Australian conservative climate change denier Andrew Bolt she is deeply disturbed freakishly influential and strange In a nasty brutish and short tweet the former Ukip funder Arron Banks simply said Freak yachting accidents do happen in August Controversialist columnist Brendan O Neill wrote that there was something chilling about Thunberg who increasingly looks and sounds like a cult member  The attacks on Thunberg look like a kind of displacement activity rooted in fear that what she says might be true
AUG19	The weaponisation of information is mutating at alarming speed	Communication has been weaponised used to provoke mislead and influence the public in numerous insidious ways Disinformation was just the first stage of an evolving trend of using information to subvert democracy confuse rival states define the narrative and control public opinion Using the large unregulated open environments that tech companies once promised would empower ordinary people disinformation has spread rapidly across the globe The power that tech companies offered us has become a priceless tool in propagandists hands who were right in thinking that a confused rapidly globalising world is more vulnerable to the malleable beast of disinformation than straightforward propaganda Whatever we do however many fact checking initiatives we undertake disinformation shows no sign of abating It just mutates  While initially countries that were seasoned propagandists such as Russia and North Korea were identified as the main culprits the list of states employing disinformation is growing China is apparently using disinformation to portray Hong Kong protesters as proxies of nefarious western powers and violent rioters potentially to prepare the ground for more violent intervention to suppress the movement India has been the host of constant disinformation campaigns either ahead of the most recent elections or during the current standoff with Pakistan over Kashmir Lobbying and PR firms have now professionalised online disinformation as the cases of Sir Lynton Crosby s CTF Partners in the UK and the troll farms in the Philippines indicate 
AUG19	Joe Biden is a boring candidate. That's why he is doing well	Despite a seemingly unending series of gaffes and unimpressive performances in the two Democratic primary debates so far Joe Biden retains a solid lead in almost all polls He s been consistently between to percentage points ahead of his main rivals nationally and also enjoys comfortable margins in Iowa and New Hampshire By most counts even if Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren s projected scores were to be combined which almost never happens when a candidate drops out it still wouldn t be enough to match Biden s projected score  The reason for this is to be found in what many consider Biden s main weakness He s an old school candidate with a policy platform and campaigning style that seem to belong to another political era Even Barack Obama originally chose him as vice presidential candidate to reassure electors with a message of compromise and reliability And that was nearly years ago before anyone even thought Donald Trump could stand a chance as president 
AUG19	Now we know the cost of no deal, MPs must do whatever it takes	The term Project Fear must be expunged from the respectable political lexicon Now that we know the full detail of the government s Operation Yellowhammer assumptions about a no deal Brexit these two words scornfully applied for three years to all warnings about Brexit have no meaningful place in the present political emergency   There s a lot of scaremongering around declared the energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng on Sky s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show in dismissive response to the Sunday Times reports on the leaked Yellowhammer document Really These after all are the government s own assessments not the panicked assertions of ultra remainers 
AUG20	If you can’t abide Jeremy Corbyn, learn from the moral of Ed Miliband	In that moment you could feel British politics lurching out of its rut Labour was about to pick its next leader and instead of choosing the favourite the old Tony Blair tribute act voters were throwing a giant spanner in the works They wanted the slightly gawky leftwing underdog They wanted a transformed party a bigger politics They wanted Ed Miliband  So much has changed this decade that it seems absurd to consider how at its start in a year old father of two and whiz on a Rubik s Cube was considered the biggest threat to the British establishment Did that really happen Yes confirm the archives He was Red Ed a Marxoid creep the Daily Mail of course the man with the sneaky plan to turn the country into some socialist banana republic 
AUG20	Donald Trump’s UK trade promises are hot air – his aim is Brexit chaos	As the UK races towards a potential no deal Brexit President Donald Trump is cheering it on But Brexit especially without a deal in place with the European Union would be bad for the US UK special relationship and would make the UK a much less important US ally  The ramifications of Brexit in particular without a deal with the EU that pleases everyone could be explosive It could hurt the UK economy at a time when Trump s trade war and economic policies are increasing the risk of a global recession and threaten the very integrity of the UK amid growing signals that Northern Ireland and Scotland would consider breaking away Boris Johnson appears willing to drive Britain off this cliff come hell or high water threatening a no deal Brexit and saying that the UK will leave the EU by the end of October do or die Everyone hopes that the UK finds a way out of this mess but the past few years haven t provided much evidence to believe that it will end well 
AUG20	Tory MPs face a crisis of career, conscience and credibility over no deal	Privileging career prospects over the call of one s conscience can terminally damage political credibility That is the message those Conservative MPs working to prevent a no deal Brexit will want their colleagues to hear when they go back to work in September  Soon our elected representatives will have left the poolside and returned to the faded grandeur of Whitehall Meanwhile those who stayed in Westminster this August including the vast majority of ministerial special advisers have been bracing themselves for the great Brexit battle Actually it s more like even giving Windows a run for its money But never mind 
AUG20	What’s the best remedy against anti-vaxxers? Reverse public health cuts	The UK is a world leader in vaccine research and provision and an early adopter of many new vaccines This has had a profoundly positive effect on the nation s health affording protection to our children and decreasing rates of infectious disease Unfortunately immunisation has been prominent in the headlines recently for all the wrong reasons  Immunisation rates have now decreased to the point where in England we no longer achieve the World Health Organization s required level of coverage in any of the routine childhood vaccinations at the correct time point This is a travesty not only for the children who miss out on vaccination and are susceptible to catching the disease but also for people who can t have vaccinations babies people undergoing cancer treatment who gain indirect protection from high immunisation rates preventing disease spread 
AUG20	The real consequence of a no-deal Brexit is not short-term shock – it’s a long recession	A couple of days before the UK voted to leave the EU the official remain campaign Stronger In released a bulletin of what it imagined the news headlines to be the next day in the event of a leave vote Job losses would ensue it said prices would rise the pound would plummet and the UK would be stuck in a protracted negotiation process for the next decade Tellingly the issue of the Irish border wasn t mentioned  Since the vote sure life is worse in the UK than it was in but it s hard to pin that on Brexit as a sense of national decline is at least partly why a majority voted to leave in the first place Indeed aside from the parliamentary absurdities of the past three years and the slide in sterling s value it s fair to say that the predicted catastrophe hasn t really happened The principal group of people whose lives have been immediately disrupted by Brexit are EU citizens and the victims of increased racist hate crimes Shamefully that doesn t seem to be reason enough to give us pause as a nation and so we ve pressed on 
AUG20	You can’t replace the GP with an algorithm – so don’t try to, Matt Hancock	The health secretary has announced a proposed overhaul of NHS health screening that could scrap GP consultations for millions of people replacing them with online programmes and AI The idea is that the one size fits all system for routine health MOTs offered to those over has become old hat  Those between the age of and are currently called into their GP surgery every five years for checks on weight cholesterol blood sugar and blood pressure This is to see whether patients are at risk of problems such as diabetes heart disease kidney disease and stroke Now Matt Hancock says we need to be utilising technology and sophisticated data collection to direct help to those most in need These changes may see in person checks being reserved only for those deemed high risk with everyone else expected to rely on predictive online algorithms 
AUG20	Heard the one about the older comedian who was given a fair chance of success?	I m writing this from a damp Edinburgh flat having abandoned my comfortable London life for a month at the fringe which is like a month long freshers week but with finals every day  My show Invisible about life at an age when the world ghosts you came about because I turned and didn t like the cut of Yann Moix s jib the French author said last year that women over are invisible and too old to love I ve spent my whole life trying to be invisible to men like him 
AUG20	Big tech firms need to stop reducing LGBT+ people to their sex lives	Here s a question how comfortable would you feel typing the word lesbian into a search engine in the office Or maybe while a parent pottered about behind you Or even perhaps not in incognito browsing mode  If your answer is not very then you re probably aware that it s a term that has more often than not returned salacious results It s the online reflection of the far too frequently sexualised real life reaction to female sex same relationships 
AUG20	Being an EU citizen in the UK was hard enough. Now Priti Patel has made it worse	Being an EU citizen living in the UK for the past three years has largely had the same rhythm as an undergraduate degree relax relax panic for a week enter a deep state of denial relax relax and repeat  We have either been forgotten about for months at a time breezily told that everything will be fine but we shouldn t bother filling our pretty little heads with the fine print or reminded that our main function resides with the services we provide to Britons EU citizens are mostly great when we pick your fruit or treat your gran we may choose other professions but should have the decency to stay quiet if we do so 
AUG20	Denying single women IVF is a cruel policy that belongs in the past	When I look at my newborn son whose eyes crinkle as he smiles and his older sister who wakes each morning asking to give him cuddles I find it hard to believe that the NHS would describe our family as a burden on society  But because I m a single mother who used fertility treatment and a sperm donor to conceive my children this is how NHS South East London sees us 
AUG21	If you can’t abide Jeremy Corbyn, learn from the moral of Ed Miliband	In that moment you could feel British politics lurching out of its rut Labour was about to pick its next leader and instead of choosing the favourite the old Tony Blair tribute act voters were throwing a giant spanner in the works They wanted the slightly gawky leftwing underdog They wanted a transformed party a bigger politics They wanted Ed Miliband  So much has changed this decade that it seems absurd to consider how at its start in a year old father of two and whiz on a Rubik s Cube was considered the biggest threat to the British establishment Did that really happen Yes confirm the archives He was Red Ed a Marxoid creep the Daily Mail of course the man with the sneaky plan to turn the country into some socialist banana republic 
AUG21	I’m not surprised Olivia Laing is sharing her book prize money – I did the same	When I read this week that Olivia Laing would be sharing her James Tait Black prize winnings with her fellow shortlisted novelists I was less surprised than some Not because I know Laing I don t but because her decision made sense  In I donated half my winnings for the International Dublin Literary award to establish a new prize for debut translators the TA First Translation prize The previous week Jessica Cohen won the Man Booker International prize and announced that half of her would be going to B Tselem an Israeli human rights NGO What we spend money on especially in a business where there isn t enough to go around is a statement of what we value 
AUG21	Meritocracy is a myth – so don't judge people on their GCSE grades	On exam results days there s now something of a social media tradition of those long out of the school system sharing stories of success despite a disappointing set of results In some cases it s an honest attempt to reassure those who ve not hit the high grades that their future is one still full of potential for Jeremy Clarkson it s just an annual excuse to show off  And while the sentiment from many is admirable of course exams taken in your teens should not define your life there s no denying that when year olds across the UK open their GCSE results tomorrow much will be determined by what they find inside Without the right grades colleges and sixth forms might reject you the doors to competitive degree courses and universities will either be a little more open or resolutely slammed shut 
AUG21	I wrote a sketch about Muslims at airport security. Guess what happened next	I know it s coming the double take at my face the auxiliary taps on the keyboard the indiscreet scribble on my boarding pass I find myself thinking a familiar thought thank God I came early  On what seemed like a packed flight from London to Los Angeles I was the only person pulled aside for random additional security screening 
AUG21	So we’d be happier as empty-nester parents? That’s rubbish	Christoph Becker and his colleagues at Heidelberg University in Germany have discovered that people with kids are actually happier than people without so long as the kids have left home Their analysis of people aged and older from European countries revealed that people with children who had fled the nest had greater life satisfaction and fewer symptoms of depression than those without children  But according to an even newer cross sectional survey of parents this is a load of pants Using the established qualitative research method of the one to one interview I asked my partner and the mother of my children what she thought Certainly not true for us she said I then extended the focus group by asking myself what I thought nah bollocks I told myself 
AUG21	Just as in 1914, the Brexit buildup is making calamity feel inevitable	The historian AJP Taylor argued that Europe was plunged into the first world war by the inexorable operation of train timetables He was not ignoring historic rivalries between the continent s great powers nor truncating the sequence of diplomatic failures that turned competition into military confrontation But at a critical moment carefully laid mobilisation plans could not be deactivated Escalation to calamity proceeded metaphorically and literally on rails  Even with a century of hindsight it is impossible to discern a point of no return in the runup to the first world war
AUG21	‘Self-care’: how a radical feminist idea was stripped of politics for the mass market	What do professional golfers radical queer feminists and Instagram lifestyle influences have in common They are all devotees of self care While the earlier self help movement focused on improving yourself the relatively new self care movement focuses on preserving yourself It s lifestyle advice for an age of diminished expectations where most people have given up on getting to the top and the best they can hope for is to get through the day Self care is self help for a time when about a third of the population will suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder during their lives  Self care is a remarkably flexible term It includes nearly any activity people use to calm heal and preserve themselves in the face of adversity Some common forms of self care include getting enough sleep eating well physical exercise meditating and doing things you like such as watching an s teen film Other suggestions for self care include tracking your menstrual cycle having date nights with yourself doing craft activities such as crochet learning the art of saying no and consciously unfollowing people on social media 
AUG21	Yes, contemporary capitalism can be compatible with liberal democracy	Is contemporary capitalism compatible with liberal democracy The glib answer though not wrong is that it had better be There are no known examples of fully socialized economies with a liberal democratic regime The more considered answer is that it can be but only with the public policies that make it so  The relationship between liberal democracy and capitalism changes over time as do the policies needed to make them mutually supportive Not for the first time changes in the structure of capitalism have lately moved faster than the policies required to domesticate them Liberal democratic governments are scrambling to catch up 
AUG21	Ignore the sneering: young people’s rage is an age-old sign of failed politics	In the documentary Everybody in the Place the Turner prize winning artist Jeremy Deller delivers a talk to a group of sixth form politics students about late s acid house in Britain As well as documenting the massive cultural changes that took place he draws a clear line between the decline of industrialisation the miners strike sound system culture and the rise of dance music As Deller shows old footage of whey faced ravers in bucket hats and sports gear dancing in fields and warehouses the students look on with a blend of bafflement and fascination It s weird one of them says that no one has a phone  Another film also out now reports on a youth movement born from political and social disenfranchisement and a desire for a new way of living Woodstock Three Days that Defined a Generation tells the well documented story of the hippy era and the music festival that took place in the shadow of Vietnam and civil rights unrest We were looking for answers says one attendee We were looking for other people that felt the same way as we did If people could get together and have absolutely no violence absolutely no conflict I felt like we could bring all of that love back into society and change the world 
AUG21	Donald Trump’s UK trade promises are hot air – his aim is Brexit chaos	As the UK races towards a potential no deal Brexit President Donald Trump is cheering it on But Brexit especially without a deal in place with the European Union would be bad for the US UK special relationship and would make the UK a much less important US ally  The ramifications of Brexit in particular without a deal with the EU that pleases everyone could be explosive It could hurt the UK economy at a time when Trump s trade war and economic policies are increasing the risk of a global recession and threaten the very integrity of the UK amid growing signals that Northern Ireland and Scotland would consider breaking away Boris Johnson appears willing to drive Britain off this cliff come hell or high water threatening a no deal Brexit and saying that the UK will leave the EU by the end of October do or die Everyone hopes that the UK finds a way out of this mess but the past few years haven t provided much evidence to believe that it will end well 
AUG22	Boris Johnson should call the DUP’s bluff and create a border in the Irish Sea	As Boris Johnson journeyed back from this week s desperate trip to Germany and France he might have reflected on his hero Churchill and those dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone Somehow those totems of Britain s archaic colonisation of Ireland refuse to release their stranglehold on British politics And here was Johnson at their mercy being lectured by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron on how to govern them It was intolerable  Johnson got no joy in Berlin or Paris Merkel s meaningless day talks period was greeted with ecstasy by his Tory press claque But Macron merely pointed out that nothing had changed The steeples were still there telling London what not to do 
AUG22	Yes, parliament can block a no-deal Brexit – if it can just agree on how	Read this morning s headlines and you d be forgiven for thinking the highest stakes Brexit meetings this month are taking place in Berlin and Paris as Boris Johnson trails round European capitals meeting his German and French counterparts But this is all for show  Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron don t need to meet Johnson in person to hear about his hardline demand that the backstop be altogether removed from the withdrawal agreement And no amount of cordiality from Germany s chancellor changes the fundamentals of the standoff Europe will not drop the backstop unless there is a practical workable alternative on the table which there isn t The impasse continues 
AUG22	My fiancee is in an Iranian prison, a victim of the depravity of international relations	As I write my fiancee Aras Amiri is being held in an Iranian jail on false charges of espionage A British Council employee she s caught in the middle of two global powers who refuse or don t know how to talk to each other  Aras is an Iranian citizen and by fabricating untruths lies that the Iranian ministry of intelligence knows to be utterly false and imprisoning her through a bogus trial and an appeal without legal representation the Iranian government is simply imprisoning its own citizen shooting itself in the foot to spite an enemy It is no coincidence that Aras s appeal was rejected and her year sentence confirmed on the same day that a Gibraltar court made its decision on the release of the Grace tanker a ship that British troops hijacked at the behest of the US government 
AUG22	Why are children forced to choose between the arts? The Ebacc must go	All children should be required to take at least one arts GCSE and there should be no restriction on taking more than one This year there has been a modest increase in the number of children taking art itself up on last year but a fall elsewhere music and drama are down as is design technology with uptake a staggering down on last year  These figures show one thing very clearly that politicians should stay out of the pathways pupils choose throughout their education I am excited by the increase in pupils taking visual art but I am dismayed that some children who are good at art as well as drama or art as well as music have had to choose one subject over the other because of the structure of Michael Gove s Ebacc wheeze whereby even if a child can find a school that offers a timetable where art and music do not conflict then only one subject will be counted in the Ebacc league table 
AUG22	How a trip to Peppa Pig World taught me the value of nostalgia	I felt bad about what I was going to do drag my children to a town off the south coast where I used to go on holiday as a child and I thought they deserved a reward for indulging me At the end of the trip there would be a two day pass for Peppa Pig World vaguely on our way back to London and as tedious for me I assumed as the experience of eating crab sandwiches on the front at Ventnor would be for them  The entire vacation this summer has featured this kind of unstated trade off for my twin four year olds the price of the fun fair the endless cave in to demands for sweets and ice cream and some heavy lifting in the Sainsbury s toy aisle was two cathedrals a museum about Roman Britain and a trip up a th century bell tower featuring steps and some commentary about the tomb of King John But the Isle of Wight was the big one four days devoted entirely to the experience of watching me wander misty eyed around small gift shops and a lot of extremely long walks along the cliffs 
AUG22	How will Britain treat EU citizens after Brexit? They need to know – and so does business	In Boris Johnson s first speech to parliament four weeks ago he made an unambiguous vow to the million EU citizens living in the UK Thanking them for their contribution to British society the new prime minister assured EU citizens that under his government they would have the absolute certainty of their rights being protected But a string of reports in the past week has led to increasing alarm among individuals and employers that this promise is in now in doubt This risks sparking confusion and disarray in the run up to October  The muddle arises from reports that home secretary Priti Patel has been pressing for an immediate end to free movement in the event of no deal This appears to mark a significant shift in policy Until now the government has said that in a no deal scenario EU citizens will generally continue to be able to come to the UK to live and work until the introduction of a new system in January While their legal status will change in practice the main difference is that they will have to apply for European temporary leave to remain for stays of more than three months Given this status is freely open to all EU citizens provided they pass certain criminality checks a version of freedom of movement will in effect continue for at least another year 
AUG22	Britain and Italy are now the terrible twins of Europe	For most of the time since the politics and government of Britain and Italy have seemed like polar opposites True both were important European powers True too each had a place among the world s major economies Even now Britain and Italy will be among the select group of economically powerful nations whose leaders will gather in the Second Empire splendour of Biarritz s Hotel du Palais this weekend for the latest G summit  In the past that was where the similarities began to ebb away In politics Britain was famously stable while Italy was infamously not British governments were domestically strong while Italian governments were weak and short lived In Britain leftwing politics was rooted in industrial unionism while Italy possessed the largest most modern minded and most alluring communist party in the west When Britain looked in the mirror it saw the embodiment of probity and practicality while Italy was all too often synonymous with crime and corruption While Britain maintained its autonomy by refusing to join the eurozone Italy enthusiastically embraced its upper mid table place in the EU and its membership of the single currency was shamelessly engineered 
AUG22	A new poll shows what really interests 'pro-lifers': controlling women	According to self identified pro life advocates the fundamental divide between those who want to outlaw abortion and those who want to keep it legal comes down to one question when does life begin Anti abortion advocacy pushes the view that life begins at conception the name of their movement carefully centers the conceit that opposition to abortion rights is simply about wanting to save human lives  A new poll shows that s a lie The pro life movement is fundamentally about misogyny 
AUG22	Far-right violence is on the rise. Where is the outrage?	Mohammed Saleem was murdered by a terrorist and yet you ve probably never even heard of him It was April and the year old was walking home from evening prayers at a mosque in Small Heath Birmingham A Ukrainian neo Nazi terrorist who had bombed three mosques stabbed him three times from behind He was a very beautiful educated man who empowered all of his five daughters and his sons as well to pursue education and loved and appreciated everything Britain gave him says Maz Saleem his daughter I ve spent six years tirelessly campaigning for him to be recognised in a mainstream platform  In the past decade across continents white supremacists have repeatedly chosen the same targets for shootings stabbings bombings and car attacks 
AUG22	Boris Johnson is playing politics with Northern Ireland’s ‘delicate balance’	Control and consent are intimately related Where consent exists and is freely given statements of control are unnecessary  The government is determined to deliver on Vote Leave s promise to take back control to assert sovereignty on behalf of leave voters But the complicated consent structures of the UK s most complicated corner Northern Ireland are once again getting in the way On the evidence of the prime minister s letter to Donald Tusk on Monday the government is not minded to let that stop them 
AUG23	Poor Prince Andrew is ‘appalled’ by Epstein. Let that be an end to it	It s basically your classic men of the world vignette Lying in business dress in the New York mansion of his friend Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew is receiving a foot massage from a young well dressed Russian woman Other men are in the room while this is happening and they include Epstein also being foot massaged by a Russian woman and the literary agent John Brockman who runs a foundation connecting scientists and intellectuals with billionaires As the young Russians work on their feet Andy is complaining about his lot In Monaco he says according to Brockman s account Prince Albert works hours a day but at pm when he goes out he does whatever he wants and nobody cares But if I do it I m in big trouble  Waa waa waa What could be a more effective heartstring tugger than other European princes have it better than me It s right up there with Chandler s line from Friends My wallet s too small for my s and my diamond shoes are too tight 
AUG23	Greening your life is all very well – but only a global climate strategy will fix this	Judging by the latest opinion polls the public is ripe for some green austerity Ipsos Mori says that of Britons are concerned about climate change with admitting they are very concerned These are the highest figures since the pollster started tracking opinion in Given the spate of extreme weather related events and the pictures of the torching of the Amazon rainforest such concern is both logical and predictable In this country the climate deniers have been put to flight  What the polls don t show is whether the public is willing to translate this concern into action whether similar levels of concern are present in less prosperous parts of the world and whether it is possible to translate individual concerns into collective political action Here the message is a lot more mixed The furore over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex s private jets are a case in point People don t like being lectured to particularly when those doing the lecturing fail to live by their own ethical code 
AUG23	How is Boris Johnson’s Britain viewed in other G7 countries? Our panel responds	A nation of islands shaped by limited space and imperial ambitions garden aesthetics and ceremonial teas and stoic stiff lipped reserve in the face of adversity Great Britain or Japan  For many Japanese Britain has long been something of a western mirror and model nation a land whose geographical and cultural character were recognisable and achievements often admirable a doppelganger off the coast of another continent and equally rich with tradition history and parochial pride At least until Brexit 
AUG23	After a month, Johnson has exceeded Tory expectations – now the hard part begins	Three years ago Boris Johnson was the butt of the joke among Conservative MPs After his spectacular failure to become prime minister he was thrown a political lifeline by Theresa May making him foreign secretary yet there was little evidence that theirs was a relationship of mutual respect At her first Conservative party conference as prime minister May used her keynote speech to poke fun at his reputation for being a chaotic and inconsistent politician   When we came to Birmingham this week some big questions were hanging in the air Do we have a plan for Brexit We do Are we ready for the effort it will take to see it through We are Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days Just about 
AUG23	In Bolsonaro’s burning Brazilian Amazon, all our futures are being consumed	The Amazon is the centre of the world Right now as our planet experiences climate collapse there is nowhere more important If we don t grasp this there is no way to meet that challenge  For years this has been a place of ruins First with the European invasion which brought a particularly destructive form of civilisation the death of hundreds of thousands of indigenous men and women and the extinction of dozens of peoples More recently with the clearance of vast swaths of the forest and all life within it Right now in we are witnessing the beginning of a new disastrous chapter The area of trees being cleared has surged this year In July the deforestation rate was an area the size of Manhattan every day a Greater London every three weeks This month fires are incinerating the Amazon at a record rate almost certainly part of a scorched earth strategy to clear territory Why is this happening now Because of a change in power 
AUG23	Boris Johnson’s cheerleaders are delusional – no good Brexit deal is possible	Ten days before David Cameron s disastrous Brexit referendum in a group of EU diplomats asked me for my prediction Ignore the narrative that remain would sweep to inevitable victory I told them Britain is heading directly for the exit  Perturbed this was not what other journalists were telling them they explained what would happen if so There would never be a favourable deal for Britain This was an existential question for the EU they could not incentivise other nations to leave Their electorates already resented special treatment for Britain from the rebate to its exemption from Schengen They had their own domestic anti EU and anti immigration political forces to contend with none of which they wished to encourage And if their countries suffered any economic damage because of Brexit then their voters would be even more resentful towards Britain and even less willing to offer concessions Strikingly there were no dissenters from this united position 
AUG23	An election is coming – and only all-party cooperation can stop no deal	With a snap general election on the horizon the campaign machinery is moving full speed ahead As leader of the Women s Equality party for the past few weeks I have been speaking to leaders and strategists from across the political spectrum in an effort to stop us from crashing out of the EU That means I ve been privy to the jostling that is currently taking place as the mainstream parties iron out their game plans for winning votes and seats What I have seen doesn t fill me with confidence  A focus on yesterday s polling data the minutiae of legislative process and plans to unveil big name candidates without big ideas behind them will only get us so far Because standing for election should mean just that truly standing for something People across the country may soon be reluctantly opening their doors to enthusiastic canvassers ready to explain why a vote for so and so is the surest means of delivering Brexit Or avoiding Brexit Or securing a better Brexit deal Those voters who are willing or eager to accept no deal have a relatively straightforward choice ahead of them but for those who want something better the options are cloudy at best 
AUG23	When calling out environmental hypocrisy is nothing but a cynical ploy	Ever since Al Gore first launched his climate crusade the sight of any given public figure making the case for action anywhere other than in their own home has frequently been met with the following genre of response if you care so much how come you took a plane If you didn t take a plane how much did the alternative cost How much steel does a train use these days anyway Wouldn t it be cheaper ergo greener not to go anywhere  Recently the cacophony has become deafening Take for example the case of Prince Harry and Meghan s use of private jets and what it says about their environmental credentials Once we might have understood that the rich would say and do things in their own rich fashion and it was worth it for those things to be done now it seems wealth is used to discredit ethical arguments by the wealthy Groups are disbarred from collective ambition because their privilege sets them outside the collective 
AUG23	Sorry, Mr Trump – Greenland’s no go. But can I interest you in our little island?	People say that news these days is unexpected and baffling but really could there be a more predictably story than Donald Trump wants to buy Greenland It has all the boring trappings of a typical Trump story gobsmacking ignorance casual racism colonialist attitudes towards the treatment of indigenous people a cold hearted transactional view of human life and ending with him calling a woman in power nasty If the news were a binge worthy drama this would be a mid series episode that The AV Club would rate C a worryingly formulaic outing that makes you fear the writers have run out of ideas  The whole idea was a nonstarter anyway Greenland is a proud independent region What kind of self respecting island nation would willingly accept being purchased by the United States If Trump wants to buy somewhere he needs to find somewhere that s been entirely stripped of pride dignity and joy to the extent that it is now completely incapable of self governance A country so humiliated and degraded that it would happily grovel at the feet of an expansionist empire if it just promised the slightest iota of stability 
AUG23	Too many women have pain during sex. Let’s break the taboo about it	Like so many I adore Fleabag She s outrageous with a sexual animalism that I love to see in female characters on screen With Fleabag Phoebe Waller Bridge fearlessly draws out female desires that women have long buried under mounds of unwarranted shame Now that her theatre run is enthralling London I m reminded that we re in a time when female sexual enjoyment is finally celebrated  But there s another side to women s sexual experiences that is rarely represented on screen and yet it affects so many What about women who experience pain during sex It s an angle that doesn t fit in with steamy sex scenes in films and it definitely wouldn t have a place on shows such as Love Island 
AUG24	Sure, defend Meghan Markle from racists, but let’s not bow to the monarchy	Take a feudal relic Add a splash of glamour A pinch of wokeness And a dash of hypocrisy Stir in a lashing of racism Squeeze out the last dregs of nuance And dump it all into the ferment of social media and tabloid gossip What do you get A surreal debate about Meghan Duchess of Sussex the royal family racism and wokeness that seems to have turned more heads than one of the duchess s outfits  The latest episode in the soap opera began when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their three month old son Archie took a private jet to fly to the south of France to holiday in Elton John s villa Cue outrage about the hypocrisy of a couple who make much of their environmental credentials And counter outrage from those who insist that the criticism is unwarranted and cover for bigotry 
AUG24	Age shall not weary Dorothy Byrne’s wisdom... or her sharp tongue	Soulful laments for the passing of a golden age of broadcasting freedom for a time when news editors and documentary makers were kings are fairly standard at the Edinburgh television festival Back then the newsrooms were full of smoke and dynamism Decisions were made on the hoof with no recourse to compliance rules nor balance guidelines  So Dorothy Byrne s startling MacTaggart lecture last week was a true tonic This accomplished messenger from the past a woman who unusually still has a top job in television reminded us it was really not such fun in those frontier days Yet she was very funny about it 
AUG24	Jennifer Beals: The L Word’s alpha female is going straight to the top	The first trailer for The L Word sequel Generation Q was released last week teasing its return to TV screens in December Ten years after The L Word s run ended I expected to be cynical about its incarnation Right now in the world of entertainment there are more planned comebacks than Fleetwood Mac have managed in their entire career With mooted revivals of everything from The Matrix to Home Alone to Beverly Hills you could read an issue of Empire magazine from the s and assume it had come out last week  Generation Q I m trying to get on board but it still sounds breathlessly perky like a kids cartoon or a supermarket clothing line is all about the young people as the title suggests and appears to be far less glossy and polished than its elite older sibling Of the three original characters returning to LA s lesbian scene every fan will have their favourite Shane is back as is her haircut and Alice too but Jennifer Beals s Bette promises to make the biggest splash

AUG24	How luxury hotels such as Biarritz’s Hôtel du Palais have helped shape history	Few hotels in the world can claim a more storied past than the H tel du Palais in Biarritz where the G rich nation summiteers will sit in splendour to discuss world poverty this weekend Guarded by hundreds of riot police Emmanuel Macron and his guests will meet inside what the French newspaper Lib ration this week called their gold bunker the ornate Second Empire hotel that stands on the beach at the heart of a luxury Atlantic coast resort town that is still as Lib put it in the original Franglais une des capitales fran aises du bling bling  Boris Johnson will not be the first serving British prime minister to set foot in the hotel that was once a favourite of Napoleon III and Queen Victoria That s because the H tel du Palais occupies a special niche in British political history It is the only building outside this country in which a prime minister has ever kissed hands and been asked to form a government This happened in April when King Edward VII who was a regular at the hotel summoned the Liberal chancellor of the exchequer Herbert Asquith from London to succeed the terminally ill Henry Campbell Bannerman in Downing Street 
AUG24	The Peaky Blinders cult is another sign of our discontented times	Years ago a kangaroo escaped from Dudley zoo That ll put Dudley on the map mused locals laconically History doesn t record whether the animal was recaptured or whether as a beautiful dream once suggested to me it made a living as a bare knuckle fighter behind some lock ups until it could afford passage home  But that s not the point of the story The point is nothing not even rogue kangaroos or Cuddles the killer whale could put Dudley on the map For a long time the same was true of its try hard neighbour Birmingham Brummies have always been blessed with an excess of civic pride Didn t the world know that Birmingham was special city of a thousand trades true cradle of the Industrial Revolution Manchester Forget about it the place the world s greatest sauce HP the world s best chocolate Cadbury s Creme Egg and the world s greatest curry balti from the Urdu for bucket were made

AUG25	A bumpy no-deal Brexit could turn panicking MPs against Johnson	Are you ready for a no deal Brexit Have you stockpiled enough toilet paper Built a small fort of tinned tomatoes just in case Over the next few weeks government adverts will start warning the British public businesses and neighbouring countries to prepare for Britain leaving the European Union without a deal even though the official position of the government is that it still wants an agreement with Brussels  Ministers insist that they are now preparing properly for this sort of departure on October and that leaked documents predicting chaos are out of date wrong and being released by political opponents who want to scaremonger They point to the extra bn being spent on protecting the supply of medicines on ports and important freight routes and on preparing local authorities They argue that Boris Johnson s administration is taking no deal seriously unlike Theresa May and her chancellor Philip Hammond 
AUG25	Homophobic? Maybe. But at least Midnight Cowboy showed me gay men on screen	Midnight Cowboy moseys into UK cinemas again next month on the occasion of its th anniversary and with it comes another opportunity to ask whether this is a film about homophobia or a homophobic film At the risk of sounding perverse I really don t mind My feelings toward the film were formed by seeing it in my early teens when I already knew I was gay and hankered after images of other gay men on screen without caring whether they were problematic or toxic words incidentally that would never have been used in that context when I first saw it in the mid s  In its portrayal of the friendship between two New York City street hustlers the budding gigolo Joe Buck Jon Voight tall and sweet as an ice cream sundae and the stunted snivelling chancer Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffman the picture hints at the inexpressible desires in any bromance Ratso bandies the word faggot around and mocks Joe for the campness of his cowboy duds Evidently the homophobe doth protest too much for we have been privy to Ratso s fantasies in which Joe runs shirtless with him along the beach 
AUG25	Exasperation mingles with regret as Europe tries to deal with Brexit	On an unfavourable day viewing Brexit era Britain from the outside is like watching a goldfish circling the castle ornament in its bowl The country seems short of memory hazy of sight and prone to fluttering around kitsch visions of the past  The reporting of Boris Johnson s tour of Europe was a case in point Eurosceptic tabloids celebrated the supposed infectiousness of the prime minister s optimism Ja we can ventriloquised the Daily Mail over a photo of Angela Merkel sharing a drink with him On Friday the newspaper covered his return from a meeting with Emmanuel Macron with a shot of him raising his hands over his head in victory By contrast some Remainers saw in Merkel s comment we could also find a solution in the next days why not an attempt to mock or troll the prime minister They rolled their eyes at film footage seemingly showing Macron urging Johnson to get his feet off a table during their meeting in the lys e Palace 
AUG25	The world is run by comedians, but is anyone laughing?	Hello I ll be standing in for David Mitchell this week and Stewart Lee next I d like to apologise for this in advance regular readers of this column have become used to scintillating satire from these two delivered via crisp witty prose What do I have to offer in return Nothing but grim jeremiads about the dreadful state we re in and pretentious jargon laden analyses about how we got here True I too was once a well known light entertainer on national television but in recent years I ve fallen victim to the worst character trait of the ageing farceur a desire to be taken seriously an inclination that has quite rightly coincided with my gently smelly slide down into Stygian obscurity  Bobbing about down here I ve begun to suspect that my status in our septic MRSA ridden isle exists in an inverse correlation to that of Her Highness s current first minister It s a truth universally acknowledged that in search of his destiny as world king Boris Johnson turned to television to build his base and in particular to the satirical news show Have I Got News for You Throughout a number of barnstorming appearances Johnson cemented his reputation as a charming and self deprecating Old Etonian whose tousled blond mop nonetheless surmounted a mind like a steel trap Even at the time commentators remarked on how bizarre it was that serving politicians were prepared to go on the show and risk being eviscerated by their fellow panellists however by perfecting his routine in Marxist terms his praxis Johnson enacted the dialectical relation between politics and comedy that has since typified our era 
AUG25	Swearing has its place in journalism – when used sparingly and skilfully	It is difficult to discuss coarse language without using some So if reading on be warned Our style guide says the Guardian is more liberal than any other newspapers using language that most of our competitors would not  The editorial guidelines say Respect for the reader demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend Use swearwords only when absolutely necessary to the facts of a piece or to portray a character in an article there is almost never a case in which we need to use a swearword outside direct quotes The stronger the swearword the harder we ought to think about using it and never use asterisks which are just a cop out 
AUG25	Racist abuse in the real world is in decline, so why not on Twitter?	Britain is a much less racist country than the one I grew up in Yet I have received more racist abuse in the last four weeks than the previous years This paradox can be explained in a single word technology More specifically Twitter It helps to explain why last week social media once again became the key battleground for tacking racism  Growing up my experiences of racism were pretty banal If you called me a paki in the playground you could expect a sarcastic lecture about the need to get an atlas as my dad is from India Nobody ever hit me but as a football mad teenager in the s I heard shocking racism which was eventually stamped out by the mid s Monkey chanting in the ground has given way to hatred on social media see the racist abuse against Paul Pogba of Manchester United and other leading black players which hit the headlines last week 
AUG25	How can children thrive when they are squeezed into cramped homes?	Personal space is a political issue Analysing data from the English Housing Survey supplemented by a Comres poll of families in overcrowded housing the National Housing Federation NHF reports that families are living in one bedroom homes An estimated million children live in overcrowded homes defined as children sleeping in the same room as two or more siblings their parents or a teenager of the opposite sex  Just homes were built in for social rent despite at least being needed Some children are sleeping three to a bed with adults sleeping in kitchens halls and bathrooms to free up space There are more children living like this than a decade ago An estimated children are thought to be sofa surfing with their families and not even registering in the figures 
AUG25	If Boris Johnson wanted Britain to lead the world, he’d stop hedging his bets and back HS2	The foundations of the dynamic economies of the st century will be massive agglomerations of people In the new era of the learning machine anything that is routine from a production line to the legal processes surrounding buying and selling a house will be performed by a robot What will drive economic activity instead are myriad face to face interactions from education to medicine which can t be done by machines but can be done by people living in vast highly connected urban areas that foster such interactivity  This trend is already clear think Tokyo and Tokyo Bay San Francisco Bay the M area in London the Beijing orbital rings In an age of capitalism with robots the advantage of such areas is going to become even more marked Essentially the more an economy can agglomerate the more it will take off especially if it is supported by fit for purpose public interventions and investment

AUG26	Biarritz was an empty charade. The G7 is a relic of a bygone age	The G summit in Biarritz now thankfully concluded told us a lot about the world we live in Unfortunately very little of it was useful or vaguely hopeful As the presidents and premiers of the world s wealthiest countries posed for back slapping group photos and their partners sampled croissants at a charming traditional Basque bakery fierce fires raged untended and unquenched across the international landscape not to mention in the Amazon rainforest It was a low yield meeting whose main achievement was avoiding a repeat of last year s bust up  It was as though these summiteers conflabbing while the world burned belonged to a different distant era when the US president for example was a figure commanding instant respect when multilateral diplomacy worked when the postwar internationalist vision was not obscured by nationalist demagoguery when if the western democracies decided to do something together it actually had a good chance of getting done But those times have passed 
AUG26	Bantering blonds and cringeworthy kisses: G7 was the dinner party from deepest hell	You know how people ask that question who would be your dream dinner party guests The G summit is that in reverse featuring a group of people many of whom are so odious you d crawl under a tablecloth to avoid them if you saw them in a restaurant And then log on to TripAdvisor to warn other punters never to set foot in the place  True they re not all awful but the ratio isn t great Here are the highlights and lowlights from Biarritz which until last week Trump thought was a burger option at McDonald s 
AUG26	To beat Trump in 2020, Democrats will need to get down and dirty	The US presidential election is going to be about native entitlement It s going to be about race and immigration and deportation and Israel and every other wedge issue Donald Trump can summon to split the vote into us and them He will become Chief Native swelling his supporters sense of dominion over others less white The campaign has already started his social media presence has gone from ungainly swiping to a more coherent regular punching He has in effect launched a cyber bullying offensive  Trump will reduce people to tears from black TV anchors worn down by his racist attacks to Rashida Tlaib reeling from the unexpected emotional shock of her Palestinian grandmother being dragged in the mud of Trump s bear pit He will tell Jews how to vote and nurture antisemitism while pretending to give a damn about Israel so that he can smear Muslim opponents What was a prominent theme in the campaign going after Muslims and immigrants will become the only theme 
AUG26	Bury’s demise is a grim warning that small-town Britain is still being left behind	The threatened expulsion of small town Bury from the English Football League which could happen if the owner Steve Dale does not conclude a sale of the club by pm on Tuesday has been a touch more emotional for me than many of the football traumas I have investigated as a journalist over the past years I grew up in north Manchester five miles down the road and went to school in Bury Twice a day I used to pass the club s Gigg Lane ground and wonder at it from the top of the bus a proper football home bedded in with all its history behind a pleasing line of trees  In these crisis stricken months for Bury a club founded in many people have rightly pointed with bewilderment to English football s violent inequalities to Manchester City and United miles away owned by overseas billionaires making multimillionaires of their players and managers Supporters have despaired at the gaping holes in football s governance its painfully limited fit and proper persons test for owners so long campaigned for but that still fails to protect beloved clubs from needless ruination 
AUG26	All hail Ben Stokes for giving the nation a moment of sporting relief	The prime minister is making stuff up about pork pies and the president of the United States wants to nuke hurricanes but amid the late summer madness we we the people have Ben Stokes On a blazing bank holiday weekend for the ages the hero of Headingley near single handedly for we must not forget the bespectacled brilliant Jack Leach provided a moment of respite from the catastrophic chaos the powers that be seem all too happy to unleash upon their citizenry  Just to be clear here is what the immigrant Ben Stokes is not he is not a distillation of the Dunkirk spirit to be co opted by nostalgic disaster merchants keen to claim credit for all that is good and wander back off to the champagne tent to inspect their portfolios when it goes tits up He is rather an elite sportsman an expert if you will who spectacularly adapted his play to navigate a way through the trickiest of situations Unlike those in potentially analogous circumstances Stokes had the time he needed but what he still had to find were skill nerve and perhaps most importantly respect for the game he was playing and the opponents he faced There s a lesson there And after a period of calculated defensiveness he got busy 
AUG26	Fires are devouring the Amazon. And Jair Bolsonaro is to blame	As the world watches in horror and terror as the Amazon burns scientists have made clear that the cause principally if not entirely is human activity  Here in Brazil that human activity has human names and faces those of Jair Bolsonaro the Brazilian president and his extremist environment minister Ricardo Salles They have not merely permitted these devastating fires but have encouraged and fueled them 
AUG26	Sexist attitudes towards sex are cheating women of orgasms – and worse	We may like to think we re quite sexually free and equal these days but an End Violence Against Women Coalition YouGov survey of nearly adults finds that two fifths of people think men want sex more than women do And between a third of and half of us think it is more likely that in heterosexual couples men will initiate and orgasm during sex and decide when sex is finished than women In contrast women are believed to be much more likely to refuse sex and to go along with sex to keep their partner happy  The orgasm gap exists solely in heterosexual sex lesbians are not having this problem
AUG26	What is autism? How the term became too broad to have meaning any more	The word autism means a lot of different things to different people To some it conjures an image of the socially awkward eccentric who besotted by a narrow set of interests eschews small talk and large gatherings in favour of solitude To others it s a profoundly life limiting disorder that consumes every waking hour of a family s life a medical disability that entails unpredictable bouts of aggression resulting in torn upholstery cracked skulls and savage bites Severely autistic people have a life expectancy of in the United States and in Europe while their parents and care givers often experience PTSD and stress similar to that of combat veterans Mildly autistic people on the other hand though far more prone to depression and suicide can go on to lead productive and fulfilling lives often blending imperceptibly into the wider population despite their idiosyncracies and social difficulties  Many people now self identify as autistic as though it were a fashion label rather than a debilitating disorder
AUG26	Rejection is the norm for authors. So why do we hide it?	If there s any universal truth it s that rejection happens to all of us at some point especially in publishing Most writers have entertained at least one am fantasy about an editor coming crawling back Even Animal Farm was rejected by Faber Faber a decision now understandably regretted  Orwell s rejection is just one of many that have made their way into legend Extravagant rejections of authors from JK Rowling to Vladimir Nabokov fascinate all of us We like to remember that geniuses are fallible and that nobody gets it right every time But apart from these famous stories we don t talk about the everyday experience of rejection in the arts and its role in the creative process By venerating these big stories of rejection we make rejection itself feel remarkable when it s actually the norm 
AUG26	Dominic Cummings reminds me of Yanis Varoufakis – he could face the same fate	Covering the Greek crisis for BBC Newsnight in meant spending long days in a very hot Athens eating too much room service kebab and trying to stay on top of a series of twists and turns in Greek and European politics while all the time keeping an eye on the financial markets The fundamental question was will Greece do a deal or will it crash out of the euro  At the time I had no idea that my crash course in European standoffs would prove useful to understanding what has emerged as the key question in British politics Brexit deal or no deal 
AUG27	Johnson’s schools ‘revolution’ is all about an imminent election. Here’s why it’s fake	What s driving Boris Johnson s new schools programme revealed exclusively in the Guardian today The answer lies not in Downing Street but miles up the M with a revolt in a Cheshire market town You don t expect mutiny in Nantwich but it was here a Tory shires revolt took place  In February the main square of the town was packed with locals protesting about the cash crisis in their schools Their outrage made national news and it chimed with other shaming stories that were spilling out of classrooms of cash strapped headteachers begging pupils to bring in their own loo roll of teaching assistants getting laid off in droves and staff setting up food banks to feed their own pupils 
AUG27	The IMF is hurting countries it claims to help	When people think of the damage that wealthy countries typically led by the US and its allies cause to people in the rest of the world they probably think of warfare Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died from the invasion and then many more as the region became inflamed  But rich countries also have considerable power over the lives of billions of people through their control over institutions of global governance One of these is the International Monetary Fund It has member countries but the US and its rich country allies have a solid majority of the votes The head of the IMF is by custom a European and the US has enough votes to veto many major decisions by itself although the rich countries almost never vote against each other 
AUG27	Corbyn’s summit shows a no-deal Brexit is avoidable if MPs put tribalism aside	Good news from the bubble of party politics Britain s opposition leaders have today decided to engage and cooperate rather than facilitate national food and medicine shortages in nine weeks time  Many commentators suggested that Jeremy Corbyn s meeting with the SNP Liberal Democrats Plaid Cymru Change UK and Greens would yield little but grandstanding and bad temper On the contrary participants have described a positive and constructive session with further summits planned Their joint statement stresses the urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence 
AUG27	Did Liverpool’s Sun boycott result in a remain vote? It’s a neat, if flawed, theory	No one surely believes that when a newspaper tells its readers ahead of an election how to vote they simply do as they are told There is no evidence whatsoever to show a direct correlation between what is published and what happens at the ballot box  Instead media academics who have tried to divine the political impact of the press during elections particularly the populist tabloid variety have found it necessary to untangle a complex web of influences in order to explain why people voted as they did 
AUG27	I worked for Tim Bell. He was not the monster of leftwing caricature	Tim Bell was famously Margaret Thatcher s favourite PR guru It s not hard to see why He mixed a ridiculously easy and seductive charm with wit and free market views He operated at the height of the then critical nexus between global CEOs top politicians and journalists His death marks the end of a golden public relations era that spanned almost half a century and Bell was one of its leading lights and his particular star always shone brightly for good and bad  I know something about Bell because I worked for him for three years in the mid s It was an odd thing to do for someone who had worked in Gordon Brown s office I was in my late s had a young family and little money and I was intrigued to learn about my supposed enemy Bell of course knew New Labour was coming He hated having to prepare for it but took me under his wing with genuine warmth nevertheless 
AUG27	Business will not forgive or forget the great Brexit betrayal of trust	We ll easily cope breezes the no deal prime minister This is a great great country Indeed it is Most inhabitants would certainly agree But to love your country is not to think it greater than others nor incapable of making grievous mistakes Britain has not as yet made the fateful error of actually electing Boris Johnson and his cabinet of undesirables Nor did it vote for a no deal Brexit But on he drives accelerating towards the abyss  It s that insouciant ignorance that drives businesses mad the devil may care fecklessness ignoring the boring details Andrea Leadsom our improbable business secretary writes in the Sunday Telegraph that she has met firms of all kinds and guess what They were overwhelmingly positive about our future She ends Britain s best years for business and for all our people lie ahead 
AUG27	Johnson’s plan for ‘Brexit heroes’ in the Lords will reverberate for years to come	Arise Lord Tim of Wetherspoon s Try on this ermine for size any economist prepared to go against almost the entirety of your profession in arguing that a no deal Brexit would be just terrific for Britain  The prime minister is reportedly drawing up a list of so called Brexit heroes to be rewarded with peerages although the word hero here is arguably being stretched to breaking point the plan is apparently to ennoble a bunch of leading leavers after October in a clear rebuke to a House of Lords that has so far proved decidedly sceptical about the idea of leaving the EU at any price Well done everyone involved in dragging Britain into this godawful mess Now here s your reward the chance to get a whole new set of life changing political judgments wrong for generations to come 
AUG27	The Hong Kong Way protest shows enchantment is a powerful weapon	It almost felt like magic A few people standing on the street were joined by a few more people lining the footpath of one block connected to those on the next block And suddenly there they all were Hand in hand chanting slogans and singing songs On August the th anniversary of the Baltic Way a human chain linking the capitals of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania to demand the Baltic republics independence from the Soviet Union more than people came out on to the streets of Hong Kong to form the Hong Kong Way From the crowded streets of Wan Chai on Hong Kong island to the famous waterfront of Tsim Sha Tsui to the suburbs of the New Territories to the peak of Lion Rock people linked hands in a continuous human chain that some said measured km in total  This was just the latest action in Hong Kong s ongoing anti government protest movement calling for democratic reforms As a protest action it was incredibly effective entirely peaceful a striking visual spectacle and a very physical manifestation of the broad support for the movement from across the community People of all ages and from all walks of life families with young children the elderly all joined the chain and put paid to any suggestion that these ongoing protests were just a few hot headed young student agitators But perhaps most importantly the Hong Kong Way created a moment of enchantment 
AUG27	Republican Joe Walsh is challenging Trump – but that is nothing to celebrate	Donald Trump has been very good for a lot of very bad people s careers Take Sean Spicer for example Spicer lied through his teeth during his stint as White House press secretary and has been rewarded with a gig at Harvard and a spot on Dancing With the Stars where presumably he will continue to prance around the truth His successor Sarah Sanders is joining Fox News Anthony Scaramucci who lasted only days as Trump s communications director has reinvented himself as a high profile critic of his former boss  The latest odious person to scramble aboard the Trump gravy train is Joe Walsh a rightwing talk radio host and former congressman On Sunday Walsh announced he would challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination because we all know he is unfit to lead which is a dramatic change of tack from when Walsh tweeted On November th I m voting for Trump On November th if Trump loses I m grabbing my musket You in 
AUG27	Forget a second referendum. Labour has to back revoking article 50	You can tell there s a general election coming because that s the subtext to everything else that happens Boris Johnson uses the G summit to grandstand to the domestic tabloids Meanwhile the fractious coalition of anti no deal forces meets today to try and form a coherent plan to stop Britain crashing out of the EU and to force an election  If the object was to fight no deal through parliamentary process the only people you would need in the room would be Dominic Grieve and Keir Starmer with maybe somebody taking notes for John Bercow But today s get together convened last week by Jeremy Corbyn is as much about a general election which few people now doubt will happen sooner rather than later Given that it would have been better to enter the room in the spirit of anticipated unity rather than publicly set out your red lines beforehand as Jo Swinson has done She reportedly wrote a letter to Corbyn yesterday arguing that his insistence on leading a temporary government of national unity would be likely to scupper a vote of no confidence in the government 
AUG28	A civil war state of mind now threatens our democracy	An outrage a coup an abomination a country tumbling into failed state status Britain a banana republic Boris Johnson a dictator Parliamentarians stretch the limits of their vocabulary to express disbelief that this could happen in Britain the cradle of democracy Rewrite the history books tear up Bagehot s The English Constitution as the Queen and privy council sign the prorogation neither the dignified parts not the efficient parts function any longer  This country that self identified so smugly as stable tolerant and moderate with a crown to symbolise traditions honed down the centuries is revealed as fissile fragile and ferociously divided A constitution that relied on gentlemanly governments willingness to bow to parliament has evaporated blown away now it s led by a man who doesn t give a damn for parliamentary sovereignty taking back control is for him alone He is ready to destroy anything that threatens his ambition 
AUG28	Boris Johnson is trashing the democracy fought for with the blood of our ancestors	Call the suspension of parliament what it is a coup d tat by an unelected prime minister Brexit we were promised was about restoring the sovereignty of the House of Commons and taking back control of our laws That institution is now to be shut down its ability to pass legislation neutered Just days now remain for elected representatives to have any say over the greatest upheaval since the guns fell silent in the second world war It must be and will be resisted  We didn t vote to leave without a deal That wasn t the message of the campaign I helped lead
AUG28	The cat is out of the bag – Boris Johnson’s shutdown is unconstitutional	One of the gravest dangers to any society is outrage fatigue The symptom of this condition is when so many people have been so angry for so long that terrible abuses of power now seem almost normal Over a decade since the financial crash after nine years of crippling public spending and tax cuts and three years on from the bitterly fought EU referendum poor leadership leaves our country in a state of polarised peril This is frightening for people all over the United Kingdom but it poses the biggest threat to the most vulnerable and now to democracy itself  The idea of shutting down parliament no need to dress it up with the fancy language of prorogation so that a hard right minority government can facilitate a crash out Brexit on October was first suggested during the Conservative leadership campaign by Dominic Raab in June Boris Johnson has refused to rule it out ever since So last weekend s reports of leaked emails between No and the attorney general were hardly a bolt from the blue 
AUG28	Johnson has wrongfooted opponents of no deal. An election surely looms	Given that Westminster has spent weeks debating the possibility of Boris Johnson proroguing parliament it was surprising how surprised MPs were when he actually did it Even his own cabinet ministers were rather taken aback having returned to Whitehall on Tuesday expecting to spend the week in meetings with the Treasury about their spending review settlement Now they re preparing for an election which would be the result of a successful vote of no confidence in the government forced through by MPs determined to thwart Johnson s manoeuvring Even if that scenario does not unfold he is likely to call one immediately after Britain has left the EU on October  The MPs most unsettled by the announcement are the ones who have spent the summer plotting tactics to use against Johnson These anti no deal MPs who exist more as a diaspora than a coherent group love plotting among themselves but have an amusing distaste for anyone who plots against them in return As one Johnson ally puts it The anti no deal alliance have been so used to setting the weather recently Instead they ve had the weather reset so it s raining on their parade and they don t like it 
AUG28	Topless Poldark already looks quaint in our era of equal-opportunities nudity	Blockbuster Sunday night dramas have a habit of making headlines with male nudity Perhaps there is something about seeing the weekend out with a bang  The last time viewers got flustered over a pair of buttocks was for Richard Madden in Bodyguard and before him Tom Hiddleston in The Night Manager The recent Poldark finale didn t feature any topless scything but the Daily Mail waved it off to sea with a front page paying testament to the briny sorrow of never seeing Ross soaping up in his bath again with a picture of him scything topless anyway Because well one for the road 
AUG28	Boris Johnson’s intention is clear: he wants a ‘people v parliament’ election	Boris Johnson s plan to prorogue parliament ahead of a Queen s speech on October is intended to provoke parliamentarians into blocking a no deal Brexit or triggering a general election through a vote of no confidence Both are feasible in the time available  The last time parliament stepped in to block no deal earlier in the year the necessary legislation was passed in just three days Johnson has deliberately left enough time for parliament to seize control again That s because Johnson s real objective is to use Brexit to win a general election rather than use a general election to secure Brexit By forcing the hands of his opponents he has defined the terrain for a people versus parliament election Expect him to run on Back Boris Take Back Britain He will say that the only way to definitely leave on October is to give him a parliamentary majority to do so The man of Eton Oxford and the Telegraph will position himself as the leader of the people against the hated establishment and remainer elite 
AUG28	Politics-as-usual can’t fix the climate crisis. Maybe it’s time to try a citizens’ assembly	The climate crisis demands an urgent realistic and sustained response from governments around the world such a response will inevitably require sacrifices from all of us And there lies the rub for our systems of representative democracy  How can politicians facing short term constraints particularly the need to be re elected every few years be expected to take the necessary decisions that require long term and probably quite painful change on the part of the citizens who get to vote for them 
AUG28	Labour desperately needs a pro-EU vision – not just a plan to block no deal	Boris Johnson is not a skilful manager except of expectations He impressed dignitaries at the G summit in Biarritz with a capacity for seriousness that used to come as standard in prime ministers Johnson sets the bar low then clears it He steered a traditional British diplomatic course between Europe and the US His style is a flattering tribute to Donald Trump but on the substance Russia Iran the climate emergency the UK still sides with Germany and France That balancing act will be harder outside the EU and the messier the Brexit the wobblier the tightrope  Johnson needs a trade deal with Washington It is the totem pole around which Tory Eurosceptics perform their frenzied anti Brussels war dances But Trump does not distinguish between commerce and state power He will set the price of a deal at total loyalty in foreign affairs and surrender to US corporate interests The UK must switch regulatory and strategic alignment from European to US standards and thereby forfeit privileged access to the vast market on its doorstep Few Brexiteers understand what that means in practice The UK voice will be heard in Brussels from the wrong side of a closed door and in Washington from the end of a tight leash That is what a hard Brexit looks like once the bombastic rhetoric is stripped away Theresa May worried that the price was too high Johnson doesn t care This dramatic pivot in Britain s global orientation is easily overlooked because the contrast in political style between the new prime minister and his predecessor is more conspicuous May was ready to swallow the Northern Irish backstop because she was not horrified by the prospect of perpetual European alignment that it implied For Johnson ending that alignment is the whole point 
AUG28	Johnson’s schools ‘revolution’ is all about an imminent election. Here’s why it’s fake	What s driving Boris Johnson s new schools programme revealed exclusively in the Guardian today The answer lies not in Downing Street but miles up the M with a revolt in a Cheshire market town You don t expect mutiny in Nantwich but it was here a Tory shires revolt took place  In February the main square of the town was packed with locals protesting about the cash crisis in their schools Their outrage made national news and it chimed with other shaming stories that were spilling out of classrooms of cash strapped headteachers begging pupils to bring in their own loo roll of teaching assistants getting laid off in droves and staff setting up food banks to feed their own pupils 
AUG28	The media has become gossip, clickbait and punditry. This threatens democracy	Walter Cronkite once said that journalism is what we need to make democracy work He was absolutely right which is why today s assault on journalism by Wall Street billionaire businessmen Silicon Valley and Donald Trump presents a crisis and why we must take concrete action  Real journalism is different from the gossip punditry and clickbait that dominates today s news Real journalism in the words of Joseph Pulitzer is the painstaking reporting that will fight for progress and reform never tolerate injustice or corruption and always fight demagogues Pulitzer said journalism must always oppose privileged classes and public plunderers never lack sympathy with the poor always remain devoted to the public welfare never be satisfied with merely printing news always be drastically independent never be afraid to attack wrong whether by predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty 
AUG29	Only one person can avert a no-deal Brexit. And that’s Boris Johnson	This is not well done The prime minister Boris Johnson displays cowardice and mendacity in insulting parliament with enforced suspension and then in claiming that it has nothing to do with Brexit It has everything to do with Brexit It is not just an insult It is a lie  Theresa May the leader whom Johnson treated abominably stood in the House of Commons day after day pleading for support in honouring the vote on the Brexit referendum She tried to ease the United Kingdom out of the European Union with a compromise deal respecting the diverse views of a divided nation She was inept and she failed 
AUG29	Proroguing parliament sets a horrifying precedent. I’m going to court to stop it	Like hijackers of a plane Boris Johnson s ministers and acolytes are trying to keep everyone calm by giving as much as possible the impression of normality This is the way of people seizing power by force but let s be clear there is nothing that is normal about what they are doing They are subverting our democracy in a way that is unprecedented Elected representatives are being told to shut up about the inconvenient truths and logistics of a ruinous no deal Brexit Worse Johnson is trying to deny them the right to take their seats in what was once called the mother of parliaments in the run up to October  The Johnson hijackers are saying that the prorogation of parliament ahead of a Queen s speech is what always happens and that it is no more than a normal convention and precedent in our unwritten constitution But there is no convention or precedent for a five week prorogation In the last years parliament has never been prorogued for longer than three weeks In most cases it has been prorogued for only a week or less for example for days in days in and days in 
AUG29	Has Brexit destroyed party loyalty? Ruth Davidson’s resignation will show us	Your party leader embarks on a course of action that appears to threaten the constitution in order to achieve an objective that will severely damage the country What should dissenting Tories do now Turn against the leadership even bring down the government and let in Labour The old emotive choice of party or country is back  Meanwhile Ruth Davidson resigns the leadership of the Scottish Conservatives She says her new family comes first But no one believes the timing is unconnected with Boris Johnson s bid to stifle dissent by proroguing parliament Whatever she says most people think Davidson has made her call 
AUG29	Parliament had failed on Brexit long before this prorogation	 A constitutional outrage declared the Speaker John Bercow a very British coup said the shadow chancellor John McDonnell Not to be outdone Nicola Sturgeon added the day any semblance of British democracy died Some have compared the situation to when Charles I prorogued parliament before dispensing with its services entirely But Charles I was not unless the history books are grievously mistaken faced with the problem of implementing the outcome of a referendum  It is time perhaps to tone down the rhetoric and consider the facts The five week prorogation appears longer than it is because it includes the three weeks of the party conference season when parliament does not normally sit Parliament therefore loses two weeks In there was a longer prorogation of days though that included the period of the European parliament elections and the Whitsun recess 
AUG29	Welcome to the US, Greta. With your help we can save the planet and ourselves	Dear Greta  Thank you for travelling across the Atlantic to north America to help us do the most important work in the world There are those of us who welcome you and those who do not because you have landed in two places a place being born and a place dying noisily violently with as much damage as possible 
AUG29	Why comparisons between Boris Johnson and Charles I aren’t just lazy rhetoric	When a prime minister who hasn t faced a general election gains the assent of an unelected monarch to prorogue parliament it is inevitable that some parallels will be found with Charles I s dismissal of MPs in the mid th century  Only yesterday Labour s Margaret Beckett made exactly the comparison noting that it didn t end well But are there really any similarities or is this just lazy history and easy rhetoric 
AUG29	My children are teaching me to love the housing estate I fled	Don t let anyone ever tell you that you have to come from a place to belong there Just because the place you grew up in lives inside you it doesn t mean you have to like it or defend it or define every other place against it Birmingham where I come from inhabits my accent and underlies my compulsive self deprecation but apart from that my Brummie ness feels like an accident Even so I m obsessed with it  The centripetal Midlands happens to be where the Welsh Irish and English strands of my family combined having moved as humans do where there are prospects for a better life The centre drew them in then cast them to the periphery as Birmingham built outwards in concentric circles following the first world war I grew up in Chelmsley Wood on a vast estate built on green belt land outside the city boundaries where a Birmingham Post reporter predicted in the city will feel a million life miles away to the children who would come to be raised there 
AUG29	Why does the far right love Fred Perry? Mainstream fashion is its new camouflage	The Fred Perry brand found itself in the unwelcome spotlight this week when one of its brand ambassadors tweeted that he would no longer wear Fred Perry clothing in the US now that the self described western chauvinist Proud Boys group have adopted the black and yellow striped polo shirts as their unofficial uniform The company has repeatedly distanced itself from the Proud Boys describing them as counter to our beliefs and the people we work with  But the problem is bigger than Fred Perry alone There are dozens of other brands today that are either intentionally selling clothing with far right messaging or have been co opted by the far right because of the symbolic resonance of their logos This isn t entirely new the British brand Lonsdale became popular in German far right scenes decades ago for example when youth discovered that a half zipped bomber jacket over a Lonsdale T shirt displayed the letters NSDA the first four letters of the German initials of the Nazi party 
AUG29	My film is bridging cultural divides. This gives me hope in such polarised times	There is a polarisation in today s political culture that led me to seek solace in screenwriting after almost years as a journalist I found the entrenched tribalism alienating and decided instead to explore the world of fiction and film I thought I would be distracted from the question of our divided culture but in fact I found potential clues for how to bridge the very divide I was fleeing from  I have spent the last six weeks travelling across Britain and the US promoting Blinded By the Light The film directed by Gurinder Chadha is a fictionalised retelling of my memoir Greetings from Bury Park It tells what is ostensibly a very personal story It is located in a specific time and place Luton in and it is about a teenage British Pakistani boy whose life feels constrained by his class culture and community until he discovers the liberating power of the music of Bruce Springsteen The film is uncompromising in its cultural specificity and given its subject matter one would assume it would mostly appeal to British Asians who lived through the s Bruce Springsteen fans and in particular Asian Bruce Springsteen fans who lived through the s What I had not appreciated was the power of storytelling to engender empathy 
AUG29	Children deserve food, care and a home. This ought to be beyond dispute	Imagine we re building a country Our hypothetical nation is a society like any other made up of people parents nurses pensioners and toddlers It will need infrastructure laws services and taxes and a set of values to guide us on how to arrange each of them  Now imagine a whiteboard with bullet points of our first priorities What s the first that comes to mind Hospitals Schools I propose one to keep children safe No matter what else we manage as a country protecting kids from harm seems a simple place to start After all what kind of country can t even manage that 
AUG30	Sajid Javid cowers behind net curtains as Cummings ‘gets ready’ for the final act	Barely three months ago the work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd gave a speech in which she explained that Being in a job gives a person dignity Does it always though Amber There is currently no job in the UK with less dignity than cabinet minister Desperate people are doing things for crack rocks round the back of disused warehouses that are significantly more dignified than signing up to Boris Johnson s decision to prorogue parliament even when you said it was the last thing you d ever do about minutes ago  So who are they this prorogue s gallery In one sense they re anyone who hasn t resigned when a minority government lies in order to execute this dick move which is to say literally all of them apart from George Young a whip in the Lords who quit on Thursday To put that in perspective Young once reportedly described the homeless as the people you step over when you are coming out of the opera So anyone who hasn t walked from this government has been morally outclassed by that guy 
AUG30	This reckless confrontation with parliament is just what millions of voters want	And so one of the longest running dramas in British political history reaches yet another act Some of the cast are locked into much the same roles as ever Gina Miller is once again striding off to the courts the great urban remain armies are turning out with their homemade placards while the People s Vote campaign sends out emails signed by Michael Heseltine front rank Tory politicians are apparently prepared to trade in whatever faint principles they once claimed to hold dear in the hope of holding their party together whatever the price  Other characters seem to be changing Jeremy Corbyn and his aides may have belatedly discovered the art of reaching out to people beyond their inner circle Militant Labourites who have mostly affected indifference about Brexit and told us that parliament was a rat s nest of ruling class interests stuffed full of centrists are suddenly barging their way to the front suddenly convinced that the traditions of representative democracy might actually be worth defending 
AUG30	FE college helped me become chancellor. I want others to expand their horizons too	As a former student of Filton Technical College in Bristol I am determined we treat further education colleges with the seriousness they deserve  College and my economics teacher Charalambos Stamboulieh helped make me who I am today the first FE chancellor of the exchequer I attended a comprehensive school in Bristol my eldest brother Tariq had left school at and gone straight into work Nobody in my family had attended university But then I started hearing about university from my cousin it sounded pretty appealing and I wanted to keep my options open 
AUG30	‘Gay gene’ theories belong in the past – now we know sexuality is far more fluid	It turns out that genetics is almost as complicated as love and sex New research has shown that the long fabled gay gene does not exist that a variety of different genes contribute to same sex attraction and that several other factors are in the mix too  For many LGBTQ people myself included the very notion of this study sets off big queer alarm bells though it should be noted researchers worked closely with LGBTQ groups As early as the Daily Mail and mock it all you like it s one of the country s main newspapers published an article under the headline Abortion hope after gay genes findings In the age of supposed designer babies what if the hatefully inclined chose to make sure their unborn child wasn t gay or bisexual 
AUG30	Here in no-deal ops, we know vandalism when we see it. And this is it	Prorogation is actually not a bad word for helping to describe the casual cruelty with which our political biosphere is being systematically gaslighted  Like the moral fabric of any self respecting cabinet minister this word is exceedingly flexible It can be a noun when describing Boris Johnson s evolution from bumbling amateur to bumbling pro rogue It can be an adjective too As in do you think people like Dominic Cummings should be the heart of government Why yes I m actually pro rogue 
AUG30	Only one person can avert a no-deal Brexit. And that’s Boris Johnson	This is not well done The prime minister Boris Johnson displays cowardice and mendacity in insulting parliament with enforced suspension and then in claiming that it has nothing to do with Brexit It has everything to do with Brexit It is not just an insult It is a lie  Theresa May the leader whom Johnson treated abominably stood in the House of Commons day after day pleading for support in honouring the vote on the Brexit referendum She tried to ease the United Kingdom out of the European Union with a compromise deal respecting the diverse views of a divided nation She was inept and she failed 
AUG30	With hajj under threat, it's time Muslims joined the climate movement	According to research published last week by US scientists hajj is set to become a danger zone As soon as next year they say summer days in Mecca could exceed the extreme danger heat stress threshold The news comes just weeks after over million people completed their journey of a lifetime The environmental threat to the holy pilgrimage is a panic button for British Muslims like me signaling that the climate crisis is endangering an age old sacred rite  Hajj is a pillar of Islam that I ve yet to undertake and the physical endurance required will only become more gruelling in coming decades scientists predict that heat and humidity levels during hajj will exceed the extreme danger threshold of the time from and and of the time between and 
AUG30	My summer of cutlery: how packing Sheffield steel checked my privilege	What is it about a place that once you have left it draws you back however unwillingly Thirty years ago in the summer of the so called second summer of love I had completed my first year at university and dragged myself and my spider plant back home to Sheffield both of us exhausted and a little less euphoric than when we had set off  Gone seemingly were the drizzly cold summers of the recent past by July seemed to be on the same path as the drought of It was a year of upheaval the year my personal nemesis Margaret Thatcher would make a historic speech on climate change to the UN only the day before the fall of the Berlin Wall That summer the US rock giants REM s eco rage album Green dominated the airwaves along with the little known Manchester indie band the Stone Roses who a couple of months earlier had released their eponymous debut 
AUG30	Johnson wants us to feel outrage. Let’s take back control – starting with ourselves	What did you feel Maybe it was anger fury fear Perhaps it was excitement hope a certain thrill It is unlikely that you experienced the announcement of parliament s prorogation in purely cerebral intellectual terms it is hard to remain numb in the face of such drama We are emotional beings and the emotions we felt were entirely natural and human There is nothing wrong with them  But in all likelihood whatever you felt was precisely what you were expected to feel For the people in No care only that you felt something And they will be delighted with their latest wheeze which has already served its purpose to create outrage and entrench opinion The ferocity of the reaction is all part of the plan It is time for those of us who are opposed to it to become smarter and wiser in how we deal with all this 
AUG30	Imaginary friends are a sign of a lively, creative mind. But they are leaving us	When I was three I had a very good friend named Gemma She was fearless where I was fretful rebellious where I was conservative and dextrous where I was clumsy She was also entirely imaginary With Gemma s help and support I almost made it to the top shelf of the bookcase before my parents found me and Gemma said it was OK did not save me from a telling off Gemma was also very fond of Discos crisps and Bourbon biscuits and I became very good at smuggling them into my bedroom for her  I can t remember when or how I met Gemma and perhaps sadder still I don t remember the last time I saw her Even though my brain created her she inspired me to go on adventures I would not have had the confidence to embark upon without her So it saddened me to see the results of a recent survey showing of nursery workers believed children have fewer imaginary friends than they did five years ago with believing this to be a result of increased screen time 
AUG31	Sajid Javid cowers behind net curtains as Cummings ‘gets ready’ for the final act	Barely three months ago the work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd gave a speech in which she explained that Being in a job gives a person dignity Does it always though Amber There is currently no job in the UK with less dignity than cabinet minister Desperate people are doing things for crack rocks round the back of disused warehouses that are significantly more dignified than signing up to Boris Johnson s decision to prorogue parliament even when you said it was the last thing you d ever do about minutes ago  So who are they this prorogue s gallery In one sense they re anyone who hasn t resigned when a minority government lies in order to execute this dick move which is to say literally all of them apart from George Young a whip in the Lords who quit on Thursday To put that in perspective Young once reportedly described the homeless as the people you step over when you are coming out of the opera So anyone who hasn t walked from this government has been morally outclassed by that guy 
AUG31	This reckless confrontation with parliament is just what millions of voters want	And so one of the longest running dramas in British political history reaches yet another act Some of the cast are locked into much the same roles as ever Gina Miller is once again striding off to the courts the great urban remain armies are turning out with their homemade placards while the People s Vote campaign sends out emails signed by Michael Heseltine front rank Tory politicians are apparently prepared to trade in whatever faint principles they once claimed to hold dear in the hope of holding their party together whatever the price  Other characters seem to be changing Jeremy Corbyn and his aides may have belatedly discovered the art of reaching out to people beyond their inner circle Militant Labourites who have mostly affected indifference about Brexit and told us that parliament was a rat s nest of ruling class interests stuffed full of centrists are suddenly barging their way to the front suddenly convinced that the traditions of representative democracy might actually be worth defending 
AUG31	Shop less, live more – save the planet. It doesn’t sound that bad to me	Women love shopping don t they Everyone knows we were born to do it that left to our own devices we like nothing better than spending all day in some changing room leaving our menfolk slumped outside in abject boredom praying for it to be over Except it s not true or certainly not for all women and almost certainly never has been Only of women actually say they enjoy shopping according to the retail analysts Mintel for most of the rest it s somewhere between actively anxiety inducing especially for anyone uncomfortable with stripping in front of a mirror and merely rather boring  Too much advice about going green involves pushing slightly less toxic alternatives to things we don t particularly need
AUG31	Ruth Davidson’s decision was personal, but her departure is a loss for all of us	I m racing across the central belt to cover Ruth Davidson s resignation a row for missing an important email from my son s nursery ringing in my ears when I realise I ve been reporting on women s difficulty balancing work and family for what feels like two centuries No wonder I m feeling so ruddy tired It s the sheer unwieldy intractability of the dilemmas posed It s like getting stuck behind a motorhome on a Highland road the progress is teeth grindingly slow you get tired of hearing yourself complain then suddenly you re forced to reverse into a ditch  At a press conference in Edinburgh on Thursday the now former Scottish Conservative leader who is widely admired for transforming her party s fortunes north of the border explained that she was leaving frontline politics because she had been a poor daughter sister partner and friend and that the birth of her son last October had caused her to make a different choice 
AUG31	I thought I’d relish getting back to work after summer. I thought wrong	It has been a brutal re entry into normal life after summer and no one is handling it particularly well Unlike previous years we seemed on first glance to be doing so well Air travel with four year olds is infinitely easier than with three year olds We were lucky with immigration and sailed through in minutes And travelling from London to New York east to west the jet lag is a breeze And then we all went back to work  The burden of keeping someone s needs in mind when committed elsewhere is one my mother s generation had no word for
AUG31	MPs can push no deal, but it’s civil servants who will have to make it work	Try to imagine what life is like now in the civil service You have spent the summer explaining to your family and friends that holidays have been put off so you can work on no deal planning you need to understand and manage the customs issues supply chains and other business requirements plus readiness to ensure smooth running at our ports In addition you have been told to prepare a spending review a budget and a programme for the next session of parliament to be announced in the Queen s speech And of course some of you are working on getting a deal so we can leave the EU in an orderly fashion  My guess is that you have been thinking creatively about how to resolve the backstop issue but must have been disheartened to hear that many ERG members now say that even this will not be enough to gain their support They want other changes that may be even harder to get approval for from the EU For some of them and clearly Nigel Farage is in this camp the only acceptable Brexit is a no deal version 
AUG31	A ‘Brexit bonanza’ for UK fishing? That’s a fishy tale with an unhappy ending	One man s fish is another man s poisson Not for much longer it seems  French fishermen are growing alarmed They fear a no deal Brexit will exclude them from British waters where they have fished for centuries The same applies to fishers from Ireland Belgium Denmark the Netherlands and Germany

SEP1	Tories against no deal must now choose between career and conscience	Space analogies are commonplace in Downing Street these days Boris Johnson has said proof the UK can leave the EU on October could be found in the moon landing In Dominic Cummings s first meeting with government aides he gave them a presentation on the lessons they could learn from John F Kennedy s space programme  Now there s an official Apollo dashboard in operation a traffic light system signal available to more than ministers No staff and aides They are supposed to access it to track no deal preparedness and flag when a project is in trouble and requires extra attention The spreadsheet is also on the prime minister s personal laptop 
SEP1	Term is starting – and English schools must tackle their arts emergency	A new school year is about to begin This means that I might soon arrive at a school and do a poetry workshop with some younger teenagers It could well go like this They make it clear that they don t like poetry I tell them poetry comes in hundreds of different shapes sizes rhythms and moods one way we can make poems is in a group and without writing anything down For example the people who are in charge of us in life have ways of showing they are fed up with us angry with us or through which they try to control us punish us even What do such people say I suggest they go into pairs and say these kinds of things to each other in role as parents teachers carers We select the best lines Then I say can we create this into a scene They suggest that all the lines should be said to just one of them sitting in a chair the rest stand in a semicircle around him and as they each say their line they point at the boy in the chair and then step back while the semicircle repeats a chosen chorus  We have made a snapshot of one aspect of their lives It has rhythm structure solo and chorus movement and mimesis Later they can perform it for others write a transcript of it and publish it on a school blog We can talk about what we have made what worked Was it like any other poems or plays 
SEP1	The sheer scale of the crisis facing Britain’s decrepit constitution has been laid bare	Representative democracy is never easy It s been obvious for decades that the eight word British constitution established in what the crown assents in parliament is law is a decaying time worn construct on which to protect and advance today s democracy It may have seemed glorious in the th century to hit upon the then revolutionary notion that the crown can continue but only if it delegates its monarchial sovereignty to whoever commands a majority in parliament But it s a wheeze that today too easily collapses into a highly centralised executive acting dictatorially because of its monarchial authority and becomes toxic if that dictatorial dimension becomes legitimised by the will of the people in a referendum A constitution with a bias to being an elective dictatorship as Lord Hailsham famously characterised it too easily slides into dictatorship by referendum  It is only unwritten uncodified understandings that protect the body politic from regressing to government with minimal checks balances and accountability They in turn depend upon a political class that whatever its differences accepts common rules of the game especially making sure that any recourse to direct democracy by referendum is firmly subordinated to rule by parliament 
SEP1	The French should go easy on Shakespeare over Agincourt	I see Shakespeare s been at it again This time he s helped to get us in trouble with the French the very derni re chose we need right now But we must hope that Brigitte Macron who last week opened the newly revamped Centre for Medieval History in Agincourt yes The French still refurbish museums will have mercy on us More at least than Shakespeare s Henry V who shut up the gates of mercy so that the flesh d soldier rough and hard of heart In liberty of bloody hand shall range With conscience wide as hell mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flowering infants And that was before he even went into battle  Shakespeare s vision according to historians did not quite accord with the reality particularly in its portrayal of English troops galvanised by their gung ho monarch securing victory against far greater French numbers In fact they argue there was less of a chasm in manpower than previously thought and certainly not the five to one of myth nor were Henry s archers drawn from quite the impoverished ranks of society that has been suggested The director of Agincourt s museum Christophe Gilliot hopes that the renovated museum will encourage us to reject the cliches and thereby usher in a new era of Franco British cooperation and understanding 
SEP1	We know life is a game of chance, so why not draw lots to see who gets the job?	The sweaty palms the swotting the tricky question that prompts your heart to plummet job interviews are no one s idea of a good time The other side of the equation is hardly fun either days out of a busy schedule spent interviewing candidates some of whom you know within a couple of minutes you would never offer a job  Interviews are time consuming for all involved But we persist in doing them because recruitment decisions are some of the most important we take in the workplace and it follows we should invest time and energy into a robust recruitment process right 
SEP1	WWII: eighty years on, the world is still haunted by a catastrophe foretold	On September as the massed German divisions began the invasion of Poland one of the places that would be quickly overrun was a small and unprepossessing town on a railroad junction close to the Vistula river  Named O wi cim within months it would host the beginnings of the camp the world would know by its infamous German rechristening Auschwitz 
SEP1	We have become a land of permanent crisis. This suits the blustering liars of Brexit	Boris Johnson s lies encapsulate Britain s democratic decay They are the bluster of a man who holds parliament and political accountability in contempt They reveal the corruption of a Brexit movement that has no purpose now other than to secure an empty victory whatever its original intentions and whatever damage it does to the traditions of Britain s democracy once thought to be indestructible and now revealed to be as ephemeral as dust in the wind  Do I need to justify the above It s what they want you to do They come out with a big brassy lie and then insist that you so lose yourself in the thickets of a detailed rebuttal no one can follow your argument But for the record and because I must when the Observer revealed last Sunday that Johnson was planning to shut down parliament to stop it thwarting a no deal Brexit Downing Street spin doctors led by Robert Oxley Johnson s press secretary said the report was entirely false 
SEP1	America’s opioid catastrophe has lessons for us all, about greed and racial division	 We ll build a wall to keep the damn drugs out So insisted Donald Trump at a rally last year to launch the White House s initiative to stop opioid abuse For Trump at the heart of America s opioid crisis lie open borders illegal immigrants and foreign drug cartels  Brad Beckworth an Oklahoma state attorney takes a different view The drugs to which so many in the state are addicted he told a court in July didn t get here from drug cartels They got here from one cartel the pharmaceutical industry cartel 
SEP1	Stop whining, empty nesters. Your child going to uni is not about you	As a fresh contingent of British kids gears up for university who should we be most concerned for them or their parents I ask because sending a child off to university seems to have morphed from an exciting rite of passage for the child into some dark angst ridden melodrama starring the parents How do they feel about it Are their hearts broken Will they cope  This is usually accompanied by emotional accounts of parents staring forlornly into their child s empty bedroom perhaps weeping on to a favourite toy from childhood or bravely talking about taking up new challenges to fill the void What emerges is a sense almost of competitive empty nest syndrome I m sad about my child leaving for university I m even sadder I m practically suicidal And on it goes Mirror mirror on the wall who is the most bereft of us all 
SEP1	Ruth Davidson departs to focus on family. That decision is only hers to make	She is not the first working mother to walk away from a dream job and sadly she won t be the last But few do it with the blunt candour of Ruth Davidson the Scottish Tory leader who resigned last week  Since having her son Finn she said the idea of disappearing on the campaign trail for weeks on end filled her with dread Not for her the sugary euphemisms about putting family first instead she evokes the visceral animal tug of anxiety at being too far away Sometimes too far means being in a different time zone listening helplessly to your child cry down a phone line Sometimes even being in the same room isn t quite close enough Everyone has a different threshold and it can easily change from day to day but still too far is too far and you know it when you feel it Yet even to say her decision is understandable is to enter a minefield 
SEP2	Boris Johnson is using threats against his MPs: they should ignore him	Not often do MPs make great personal sacrifices They can drift along obeying their whip hoping some small ministerial plum rolls their way if they behave The Commons is a comfortable place those tea rooms those bars Mixing with pleasant pals of similar ideological ilk assiduous work in safe constituencies many MPs have barely troubled the national news in decades on the back benches Until now  Here comes a rare moment with a vote on a nation changing question of such gravity that it takes their beliefs beyond the reach of whips They may think ahead to the time when post Brexit national decline is beyond dispute in the history books and that grandchild asks Why didn t you stop it What can they say then I never thought Boris Johnson would really do it He said it was just a negotiating ploy but he drove us over the edge 
SEP2	Boris Johnson may relish the street protests, but here’s why they must go on	The protest that took place last Wednesday evening on the day the prime minister prorogued parliament was part organised by Another Europe is Possible I was on the conference call planning it and we argued about whether or not coup was the right word whether to start at pm or pm whether to protest daily or concentrate on the Saturday We talked about demo fatigue and sound systems the far right who inexplicably were marched by police straight through the StopTheCoup march at the weekend but nobody argued about whether or not we should be protesting  The debate on our current crisis has concentrated on proroguing but it is no more than the instrument of what has occurred the executive has moved against the parliament Not tricked it outwitted it bullied it or won it round moved explicitly against it You cannot find precedent for this in the debates surrounding the Falklands war or the national government of you re squarely on the territory of the English civil war To watch it happen and accede to it with silence would be unpatriotic an act of bad citizenship 
SEP2	Ireland stands united against Westminster’s arrogant Brexiteers	Bodies fall and winged spirits rise in a towering sculpture in Dublin s Garden of Remembrance dedicated to the people who gave their lives for Irish freedom Eight years ago a reigning British monarch bowed her head and stood in silence before this tribute At a state dinner in Dublin Castle dripping in diamonds she called us friends in our own language  The country was still reeling from recession with waves of young Irish people still emigrating many to the UK David Cameron the man who would gamble with Britain s future and lose prophesised that the visit would set the seal on what is already a very strong relationship between our two countries but a relationship I believe can get even stronger still 
SEP2	We, the peoples of the Amazon, are full of fear. Soon you will be too	For many years we the indigenous leaders and peoples of the Amazon have been warning you our brothers who have brought so much damage to our forests What you are doing will change the whole world and will destroy our home and it will destroy your home too  We have set aside our divided history to come together Only a generation ago many of our tribes were fighting each other but now we are together fighting together against our common enemy And that common enemy is you the non indigenous peoples who have invaded our lands and are now burning even those small parts of the forests where we live that you have left for us President Bolsonaro of Brazil is encouraging the farm owners near our lands to clear the forest and he is not doing anything to prevent them from invading our territory 
SEP2	Could language be the key to detecting fake news?	The internet represents the biggest explosion of data in human history There s more out there and more access to it than ever before The information ecosystem is a bit like a tropical rainforest luxuriant dense and fiercely competitive As such it contains its fair share of predators and poisonous plants  Deliberately misleading articles websites and social media posts can come about for lots of different reasons they might be trying to influence elections or policies they might represent a form of cyberwarfare between states they might be aimed at raising someone s profile and influence or discrediting their opponents Or they might simply be about making money relying on the attention grabbing nature of outrageous lies to generate ad revenue as in the case of the digital gold rush that saw a small Macedonian town register more than pro Trump websites during the presidential race 
SEP2	A dark appetite for adventure is driving Britain’s hardline Brexit folly	Who is really setting the agenda on Brexit The politician wielding the most leverage has never in his entire career held a parliamentary seat let alone a cabinet position He runs a party that isn t a party with no MPs no members and no manifesto But Nigel Farage holds the fate of the government in his hands  Farage has found himself somewhat overshadowed in recent weeks as all eyes have been drawn to the new power in Whitehall Dominic Cummings But with his threat to stand Brexit party candidates against the Tories unless the government delivers a no deal Brexit it is Farage who has blown wide open a long brewing crisis in the Conservative party If they don t give him what he wants he will hand the next election to Jeremy Corbyn Most Tories absurdly fear Corbyn more than no deal 
SEP2	Know the risks about HRT and breast cancer. But don’t panic about them	It was hard to avoid the story late last week Breast cancer risk from using HRT is twice what was thought it warned I read it because as someone who s experienced breast cancer I m always interested in the latest news about it  The new research doesn t apply to me I wasn t taking HRT when I was diagnosed aged and like most breast cancer survivors HRT isn t an option for me now The latest news is about the risks being higher than previously believed but researchers have long known there s a link In fact it would be remarkable if that wasn t the case since for so many women me included breast cancer is connected to hormones which HRT is all about 
SEP2	Tories against no deal must now choose between career and conscience	Space analogies are commonplace in Downing Street these days Boris Johnson has said proof the UK can leave the EU on October could be found in the moon landing In Dominic Cummings s first meeting with government aides he gave them a presentation on the lessons they could learn from John F Kennedy s space programme  Now there s an official Apollo dashboard in operation a traffic light system signal available to more than ministers No staff and aides They are supposed to access it to track no deal preparedness and flag when a project is in trouble and requires extra attention The spreadsheet is also on the prime minister s personal laptop 
SEP2	Life began for me as a queer teenager amid the happy excesses of Great Yarmouth	I ricocheted across Britain from the fishing working class of Aberdeen where I was born Up and down the country we went taking in mining villages in Northumbria Canterbury North Lanarkshire and finally Norfolk by the time I was My childhood involved more than nine primary schools I eventually lost count five secondary schools and more council houses B Bs and private slum flats than anyone s should The woman I am is the sum of all the challenges kindnesses and observed tenacity from those less written about streets as much as it is the product of my adventures in an adulthood spent nomadically in Hanoi Buenos Aires Berlin and Budapest But Great Yarmouth is the town that made me and broke me in equal measure  The name will conjure up the smell of hot sugared doughnuts the adrenalin fizz of cascading ps in neon lit arcades
SEP2	Term is starting – and English schools must tackle their arts emergency	A new school year is about to begin This means that I might soon arrive at a school and do a poetry workshop with some younger teenagers It could well go like this They make it clear that they don t like poetry I tell them poetry comes in hundreds of different shapes sizes rhythms and moods one way we can make poems is in a group and without writing anything down For example the people who are in charge of us in life have ways of showing they are fed up with us angry with us or through which they try to control us punish us even What do such people say I suggest they go into pairs and say these kinds of things to each other in role as parents teachers carers We select the best lines Then I say can we create this into a scene They suggest that all the lines should be said to just one of them sitting in a chair the rest stand in a semicircle around him and as they each say their line they point at the boy in the chair and then step back while the semicircle repeats a chosen chorus  We have made a snapshot of one aspect of their lives It has rhythm structure solo and chorus movement and mimesis Later they can perform it for others write a transcript of it and publish it on a school blog We can talk about what we have made what worked Was it like any other poems or plays 
SEP3	The Brexit ultras cheer him, but the Boris Johnson pantomime will end	Brexit is not the first thing Boris Johnson has found difficult but it might be the first difficult thing he cannot simply abandon The path by which he arrived in Downing Street is strewn with jettisoned jobs principles and relationships He finds other people s needs burdensome and is used to shrugging them off But now he is yoked to an onerous national duty His discomfort was obvious in parliament today  Johnson s traditional repertoire of glibness and bluster served him poorly as his authority and his majority melted away The first significant test of his command of the Commons resulted in humiliation He was defeated by a majority of forfeited control of the legislative agenda desperately threw a general election gauntlet across the chamber and watched helpless as the leader of the opposition dodged it 
SEP3	Justine Greening’s decision to quit shows Tory centrists are running out of options	Justine Greening has had enough The staunchly pro European former cabinet minister comprehensive schoolgirl and passionate advocate of social mobility has contemplated a future inside a Conservative party that no longer seems to have room for people like her and chosen to walk away Threatened with the loss of the whip for voting to take control of the Commons order paper to block Boris Johnson pursuing a no deal Brexit she announced that she wouldn t stand again for Putney For good measure she hinted that if a no dealer is chosen to contest the south west London seat instead then they re likely to lose any successor she explained would have to represent her constituents and most of them voted to remain Her clear message was that even if Downing Street wins this battle it could easily lose the war  They ll know that if all the moderates melt away then Nigel Farage will essentially have won
SEP3	Boris Johnson is threatening his own MPs, but I’ll be voting to stop no-deal Brexit	Ever since Theresa May s premiership I have become suspicious of the lectern moment That is when the prime minister steps outside Downing Street to address the nation on Brexit This week with Boris Johnson was no different Like many I was left puzzled by the prime minister s speech on Monday When he spoke of the clear vision for our desired future relationship with the EU that we now supposedly have I could not help but ask myself what this vision was and whether it really exists There seems to be a disconnect between the words uttered outside No and the reality we now face as a country  Given what we know it would be utterly reckless and irresponsible to proceed on this path
SEP3	To the Tory rebels: hold your nerve, put your country first, and defeat Johnson	I don t have enough fingers to count the things Nick Boles and I disagree on The independent MP for Grantham and Stamford only recently resigned the Conservative whip over the party s refusal to compromise over Brexit But I can only concur with his clear explanation of the crisis within his former party Johnson is truly Britain s Trump There is no institution no relationship and no international commitment that he is not willing to sacrifice to achieve a no deal Brexit He is turning the Conservative and Unionist party into the English National Party He must be stopped  The only coherent thing to do in the face of such orchestrated chaos and confusion is to put the national interest first
SEP3	Why are all the motherhood memoirs so white?	I am more than a little obsessed with reading memoirs about motherhood It is not inexplicable for I have three young children of my own aged five and under In this intense period of parenting whereby my tired head spins sometimes from simply trying to remember to call the right one by the right name and endlessly loading the washing machine reading these individual experiences of mothers has helped me feel less alone Less afraid  I ve been spoilt for choice you can t help but browse a bookstore without stumbling upon yet another first person account of motherhood In the last year especially motherhood memoirs have become as much of a trend as thrillers with the word Girl in the title once were I ve certainly noticed and read many more memoirs on motherhood since expecting my youngest child now two than when my eldest child was born five and a half years ago 
SEP3	The AfD is gaining strength in Germany. A reformed EU can stop it	As migrants from Syria poured into Germany throughout the summer of Angela Merkel responded with the reassurance We can manage this The phrase came to define Merkel s chancellorship setting her apart from the rest of the European elite for its humanitarian commitment to the refugee crisis  For the far right Merkel s welcoming response symbolised all that was wrong with Europe They declared her out of touch with ordinary working people Across European capitals moderates were also incandescent Some rejected the approach in principle advocating securing EU borders instead Others saw it as a well intentioned but muddled gesture a gift to the far right 
SEP3	Don’t buy the bluff. Here’s the truth about no-deal Brexit	No deal Brexit has never loomed larger than in the current moment Boris Johnson has said that Britain will leave the European Union on October His entire political strategy is based on the credibility of his threat to follow through regardless of whether he has come to an agreement with the remaining members As a result the need to understand what no deal may mean in practice has become increasingly urgent  At the UK in a Changing Europe we have tried to address this our report on it is out on Wednesday We don t have any inside information We re not privy to material that others do not have But we do have a team of scholars who have spent their careers studying the relationship between the UK and the EU and so are well placed to consider the potential implications if the UK were to leave in this manner 
SEP3	Should Labour back a general election under any circumstances?	If rule number one of opposition is Never turn down an election then rule number two ought to be Don t label an opportunity to replace the government as pointless particularly if you ve spent the past four years railing against Jeremy Corbyn s leadership arguing that the left enjoys the comfort of opposition and would rather be a party of protest and rallies than a serious party with aspirations of government  Oh how the tables have turned There is absolutely no justification for a Labour MP wanting to keep Boris Johnson in No but by refusing to back a general election that is precisely what they re doing The EU will not agree to any meaningful changes to the withdrawal agreement unless the government changes and the negotiating principles change with it So to stop a no deal Brexit even if article is extended we will in all probability have to win some version of a public vote either a general election that elects a Labour government or a second referendum with an option to remain 
SEP3	How much destruction is needed for us to take climate change seriously?	News of Hurricane Dorian s first casualty came early on Monday morning from the Bahamas Press A seven year old boy named Lachino Mcintosh drowned as his family attempted to find safer ground than their home on the Abaco islands Dorian is reportedly the strongest hurricane to have ever hit the Bahamas and the second most powerful Atlantic storm on record Five deaths have been reported so far and more are likely The Bahamian MP and minister of foreign affairs the Honorable Darren Henfield offered a bleak update form the area he represents to reporters We have reports of casualties we have reports of bodies being seen  Rising temperatures don t make hurricanes more frequent but they do help make them more devastating Each of the last five years have seen Category storms pass through the Atlantic brewed over hotter than usual waters How many more people have to die before political leaders treat climate change like the global catastrophe it is 
SEP3	This prorogation crisis shows why the UK needs a written constitution	Who would have thought that a niche constitutional verb would be the word of the moment We ve known this mess was coming for months but it doesn t make it any less galling as the word prorogue dominates the debate  So are the prime minister s actions unconstitutional I think so and there is a case at the Scottish court of session due to be heard on Tuesday to determine that question But the fact is we can t know for certain because the UK constitution is a fluid interpretation of codes conventions and case law Despite having influenced many constitutions around the world we are one of only a handful of countries without such a written document of our own The European Communities Act and the Human Rights Act come close in terms of placing limits on executive power but both are under immediate threat from the current occupants of No

SEP4	We know how Johnson wants to play this election. The signs are it’s not working	Imagine the scene in parliament late last night a scruffy man with a ruffled open shirt swinging a plastic carrier bag staggers up to the escalator near the Palace of Westminster yelling wildly at the leader of the opposition Jeremy let s have an election Corbyn was on a phone call but a bewildered phalanx of shadow ministers clocked who it was career psychopath in the words of David Cameron Dominic Cummings the UK s co prime minister I thought he was a drunk tourist reports Cat Smith one of the shadow ministers present last night  A drunk tourist is an apt description for Cummings intoxicated with his own overblown reputation and sense of destiny a man with foul mouthed contempt for a party he s simply passing through subjecting it to a reign of terror in order to secure his precious Brexit project 
SEP4	Britain is mired in democratic crisis – but it goes much deeper than Brexit	Growing up I learned that leaders who threaten democracy normally came decked out in khaki green in front of troops toting shiny hardware They commandeered broadcast studios captured national buildings and imposed curfews on the streets What is happening in Britain this week looks nothing like those grainy TV pictures but it nonetheless marks an assault on our democracy  The government wants to shut down parliamentary democracy claiming it is acting for the good of parliamentary democracy From within No Dominic Cummings threatens to end the career of elected MPs And David Gauke the Conservative MP who just six weeks ago was secretary of state for justice wrote to his former government colleagues on Monday to ask them to obey the rule of law 
SEP4	An election is on the cards. So what do the polls tell us?	With the government shorn of its majority and the Brexit deadline looming the odds of an imminent election have dramatically reduced So it s worth examining the current state of the parties in the polls What s important to bear in mind of course is that polling provides a snapshot of public opinion at the time the poll is taken and we are currently living in a highly volatile political situation  It s possible that people s minds will change when faced with the reality of an actual general election and the parties experience the pressures of the campaign as we saw in Not only that but it s very difficult to say precisely where the election will be fought and won The key battlegrounds may not be the easily identifiable marginal seats where results were decided in the past 
SEP4	Hong Kong’s protesters have scored one for democracy, but the struggle is far from over	Hong Kong s courageous demonstrators have won a significant victory but the struggle to halt stealthy long term Chinese efforts to curtail legally guaranteed freedoms in Britain s former colony is by no means over Their protest campaign has come to symbolise the wider global confrontation between authoritarian and democratic law based forms of governance and that epic battle too has a long way to run By agreeing on Wednesday to officially withdraw the proposed extradition bill that first sparked the protests in June Carrie Lam Hong Kong s chief executive has finally done what she probably wanted to do weeks ago but was prevented from doing by Beijing In leaked remarks last week Lam admitted making unforgivable mistakes that plunged Hong Kong into an unprecedented post crisis  Yet it is clear that her freedom of action was severely limited Lam would almost certainly have resigned by now had her Communist party masters let her But they feared that any attempt to quit would be seen around the world as a sign of their weakness and indecision and so are insisting for now at least that she stay in post But Lam s position has been fatally weakened If and when calm returns Beijing is expected to replace her 
SEP4	To my merciless, brutal period: it’s time you and I talked	I am standing in a draughty picturesque church on an icy Saturday in December wearing four inch gold glittery heels and silently cursing you as you churn up my insides without a thought for the occasion Try as I might to focus on my friend the gleamingly beautiful bride and stand stoic during the hymns she s painstakingly chosen for us to chorus all I can think is will you please fuck off And when can I rip off this fascinator my heels dress tights and while I m at it my skin The need for delicious wedding champagne to dull your grip is getting increasingly urgent  Yeah I m talking to you My pushy aggressive attention seeking period The very same period that has no sense of timing or mercy OK fine due to the wonder of the pill you do arrive on time mostly But you pay no heed to how you transform me from a fast walking talking vibrant being into a husk who craves warmth trousers that have lost their elastic and copious amounts of fat chippy chips doused in vinegar 
SEP4	As an MP I’ve been called a traitor and worse, but I will still fight no-deal Brexit	Westminster feels like a cauldron of fraught emotion Not just in the chamber the corridors and the streets surrounding parliament but among colleagues with individual consciences wrestled over with increasing regularity I was elected in on a staunch stop Brexit mandate by the people of Oxford West and Abingdon so my voting decisions are straightforward but I sympathise with those like Ken Clarke Sir Nicholas Soames and my new colleague Dr Phillip Lee It is not easy to walk away from a party that you have aligned yourself with for decades Many of them say their parties have left them the moderates behind That s a feeling echoed by much of the electorate  Anxiety permeates the areas in which all MPs work and live Protesting is a fundamental aspect of our democracy and I will always encourage this course of action but it can be intimidating MPs put ourselves at the behest of the British people certainly but we are not infallible or devoid of sensitivity Though the Liberal Democrats have been clear and consistent while walking between appointments in Parliament Square I have been called a traitor and worse We are often warned not to exit the parliamentary estate unaccompanied and we are besieged with threats and abuse online It is not a healthy environment in which to work but it does reflect the strength of emotion that is splintering our society What provides me with the strength and conviction to walk proudly among protesters so angry about the policies I endorse is the support I absorb when I am in my own constituency Whenever I am at home I am met with smiling faces and words of thanks even hugs 
SEP4	Boris Johnson’s electoral gamble risks wrecking the Tory party	When some of the best known Conservative figures of the last half century are booted out of their party when a new prime minister loses his first parliamentary vote and his governing majority on the same day when historians are referring to this as a revolutionary moment you know something of great significance is going on But what exactly is it  What we are witnessing is another round in the same historic struggle that powered the English civil war of the th century the contest between the executive and the legislature At its simplest the House of Commons has voted once again to take control of the Brexit process in order to prevent the UK crashing out of the European Union with no deal on October That s the substance of the bill that MPs will vote on and are likely to pass today having cleared the procedural hurdle in dramatic fashion last night The comparisons with the th century are not hyperbolic because what this move represents is a bid by the legislature parliament to grab powers that have traditionally been the preserve of the executive 
SEP4	Boris Johnson's blustering strategy has fallen at the first hurdle	Tuesday night s result is a defeat that Boris Johnson has worked tirelessly to secure From proroguing parliament to furiously provoking rebels on his own side Johnson created this moment of crisis That s because his political strategy aims to force a general election before Britain leaves the EU and to use Brexit to win it In a single day Johnson managed to drive one Tory MP to walk across the chamber to join the Liberal Democrats others to announce they would not seek re election and more to walk through the opposition lobbies with Jeremy Corbyn It is quite the political feat  In his personal life and his political career Johnson has shown himself to be a risk taker But while a general election is a huge risk for him there is a greater risk of inaction Johnson has no viable negotiating strategy for Brexit itself and yet he invested all his political capital in meeting the October deadline For all the bluster about no deal the reality is that the chaos it would cause means the only gamble for the Tories bigger than a general election before Brexit is one afterwards 
SEP4	History will be kind to Heathrow climate protesters who stop us flying	Obedience is dangerous it has facilitated every form of institutional oppression and violence Every advance in justice peace and democracy has been made possible by disobedience Ethical progress is unlikely when we do only what we are told  We owe our right to vote our freedom from servitude and subjection our prosperity and security to people reviled in their time as lawbreakers and reprobates Breaking the law on behalf of others is a long and honourable tradition Next week a few dozen unaffiliated activists intend to start something they call Heathrow Pause They will each fly a toy drone within the restricted zone around Heathrow airport The drones will fly nowhere near the flight paths and never above head height ensuring they present no risk But any drone activity forces the airport to suspend all flights The activists know they face arrest and possibly long prison sentences 
SEP5	Johnson is acting like a winner. But reality may have other ideas	When a football team loses its first four games of the season the manager s job is on the line Could the same thing happen with Boris Johnson s prime ministership It seems unlikely so soon after the ousting of Theresa May And yet politics like football is a results driven game  This week Johnson lost four big votes in the Commons Last week he lost Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson too On Tuesday he threw MPs out of his party On Thursday he even drove his own brother out as well The damage that Johnson is willing to inflict on politics appears limitless But it may also extend to Tory prospects in the general election he is so keen to hold 
SEP5	Boris Johnson may not get an election. But he can still avoid asking for a Brexit delay	One consequence of the topsy turvy landscape created by Brexit is that we currently have a prime minister who says he doesn t want an election pushing for one and an opposition leader who has spent much of the past two years calling for one refusing to immediately back a snap poll  As Boris Johnson put it with glee to Jeremy Corbyn in the chamber on Wednesday night after the prime minister s motion for a general election failed to win sufficient support This is the first time in history that the opposition has voted to show confidence in Her Majesty s government The Labour leader has suggested he won t back the election he craves until he is certain the imminent threat of a no deal Brexit has been averted A debate is ongoing within Labour as to when that can be known whether there can be an election before an extension has been agreed or whether it needs to come after 
SEP5	The promised Tory tax cuts will only mean more austerity in the long run	If I have been ill and I say I am better does that mean I am better than I was or that I am no longer ill The same ambiguity applies to the phrase the end of austerity If you took this to mean that the public sector had stopped shrinking then in overall terms you would be correct But you would be completely wrong to think the austerity that began in had been significantly reversed  The chancellor Sajid Javid plans for government spending as a share of GDP to rise from in this financial year to in while this ratio was planned to fall slightly under Philip Hammond However the same figure was at the end of the Labour government Nearly all areas of spending are still below levels in real terms Overall public spending has stopped being squeezed but it is still much smaller than it once was 
SEP5	Boris Johnson is a hostage in No 10. No wonder he fears a long contest	Boris Johnson s strategy is coming apart He had no plan for a deal He promised not to call a general election He feared the consequences of no deal So in an ideal world which is the only one he had planned for he would have had an election forced upon him by Jeremy Corbyn  Instead he had to go to the House of Commons and ask for one under the Fixed Term Parliament Act which requires a two thirds majority His request was rejected leaving him a hostage prime minister with no meaningful option available that doesn t lead him into the territory of compromise which would jeopardise his offer the man who beats the Brexit party by being even more uncompromising than them 
SEP5	Johnson should beware – forcing a crisis rarely ends well for aspiring strongmen	Genuine national crises where everyday life is disrupted and the status quo buckles or crumbles don t come along often in a usually stable sometimes boring country like Britain Over the last half century there have arguably been less than half a dozen the three day week in the winter of discontent of the riots and recession of the financial crisis of and the current accelerating meltdown constitutional economic and cultural around Brexit  Such episodes are a nightmare for many people but others yearn for them Once these catastrophists were mostly found on the revolutionary left Now they increasingly come from the right 
SEP5	At last, a generation of schoolchildren will grow up knowing it’s OK to be LGBT	Students across the country are heading back to school this week and while this might not seem momentous for Stonewall this school year marks the beginning of the end of a decades long campaign to get an inclusive education system in England In September new regulations for teaching relationships and sex education RSE in English schools come into force It will be a landmark moment a whole generation will attend schools that not only accept LGBT people and same sex relationships but also celebrate and offer support on the issues that young LGBT people face  The guidance means that primary schools will teach about different families which of course includes LGBT families Contrary to what s been said by some online and in the media this is just about showing kids that families can have two mums or two dads Or to put another way different families same love

SEP6	Dazed and confused, Johnson stumbles into the twilight zone with a police escort	Why do people still call it a Tory split on Europe It s not a split it s an episiotomy The Tory episiotomy on Europe went septic this week as Boris Johnson expelled MPs including two former chancellors and his hero Winston Churchill s grandson lost his own brother in a tale we ll call Cain and Far More Able and gave a speech so hallucinatorily bad it whiteyed a policewoman At the current rate even Robert Caro will only need a week to write this Johnson biography  Then again Johnson might get a majority and we ll look back on these as the good old days More on the prospect of that banter apocalypse later 
SEP6	The three questions that will decide the next general election	When answers are in short supply sometimes the best we can do is try to ask the right questions Some of those dive into legal and constitutional arcana as experts try to work out how Boris Johnson can climb out of the hole he has spent this last week digging ever deeper for himself Now that the opposition parties have refused to accede to his cunning plan for an October election and will next week see passed into law their demand that he seek an extension of Britain s EU membership he s left with a series of unpalatable alternatives from breaking the law to resignation to tabling a motion of no confidence in himself  Still even if it s later rather than sooner polling day is coming So here goes with the three questions that will decide the next election and with it the fate of Brexit 
SEP6	For the Bahamas, hurricanes like Dorian are now an existential threat	We had gone through this countless times On the eve that Dorian made landfall in the Bahamas we knew the drill Board up your home secure your belongings and stock up on food water non perishable items and the good snacks  Bahamians had faced down the merciless beatings of Hurricane Andrew Frances Jeanne Wilma Joaquin Matthew Irma and more We thought we knew the score But no one could anticipate that mother nature could be this angry and cruel Once the water subsides the debris is cleared and the bodies are counted what hope will be left for the Abacos and Grand Bahama 
SEP6	Switzerland was sent into scientific exile. No deal could mean the same for Britain	Switzerland has been touted as a model for the UK post Brexit It is an independent state that determines its own laws controls its own borders and through its status as an associated country has access to many key elements of EU membership including the institution s leading science and research programmes  But Switzerland s recent experiences should sound a warning about the importance of cross border ties and about how future collaborations between the UK and the EU could be jeopardised if a no deal Brexit materialises this autumn 
SEP6	Boris Johnson has shown why Britain’s constitution must be reformed	Recent events in British politics have stretched the capacity of our constitutional norms to their limits But what have they collectively taught us They highlight worrying weaknesses but also some less discussed strengths  Two key features lie at the heart of the British constitution One is the centrality of parliament the other is that key aspects depend on politics not law Sadly the weaknesses in such a system have now been demonstrated by an officeholder who rejects convention and seeks to push powers to their legal limit Suddenly a previously stable system has shown itself to be fragile 
SEP6	Britain is behind the slaughter in Yemen. Here's how you could help end it	Nothing can diminish the threat of a disorderly Brexit or the significance of Boris Johnson s recent anti democratic prorogation of parliament That those stories lead the news is no surprise But when our government provides crucial support to a campaign of indiscriminate killing in Yemen that has claimed the lives of thousands of people and this is treated as a footnote in our politics rather than a national scandal it is plain that something has gone badly wrong  This week a report by UN experts warned that Britain could be complicit in war crimes through its arming of the Saudi Arabia led coalition intervening in Yemen s civil conflict The report is the latest in a long line from the UN and the world s most respected NGOs documenting a consistent pattern of violations The experts note that leading arms providers like the UK have a specific influence on the belligerents and may be held responsible for providing aid or assistance for the commission of international law violations 
SEP6	The Home Office’s message to EU citizens living here: we want you to stay	EU citizens are part of the fabric of the UK They are our friends our family our colleagues  Our country has been made all the richer for their contribution Whether you are an Italian living in Manchester a Pole in Leicester or a Portuguese national in my constituency of Great Yarmouth you help to make our great country one of the most vibrant and diverse in the world 
SEP6	Johnson thinks a ‘culture war’ will win crucial working-class votes. He’s wrong	Not long after the referendum in some neighbours suddenly erected a big wooden fence around their front garden Well it seemed sudden Our postman jokingly called it the Brexit wall and although the two events may have been entirely unconnected the fence took on a symbolism it was probably never intended to have  Whether it was there for reasons of privacy security or simply to have something for the ivy to grow on we ll never know I don t like to ask But the fence reinforced my belief that community life has never been and never will be as straightforward as some dewy eyed nostalgics would like to present it That thought recurred this week as the country staggers towards a general election Whenever it does finally take place both the Tories and Labour will make a pitch in the Midlands and the north of England particularly on the presumption that the leave vote represented a desire to take things back to how they supposedly once were 
SEP6	An early or late election? This dilemma will decide Labour’s future – and Brexit	Early or late That is the question Labour must now answer Does it accede to Boris Johnson s demand for a general election on October Or does it seek a delay until a much later date in November  It might seem a small difference but it could potentially be crucial both to the outcome of the Brexit process and to Labour s electoral fortunes 
SEP6	Johnson and Trump: two leaders afraid to do the hard work of running a country	They rose together and now they are falling together  For three long years the DoBo project a scheme to spark global mayhem spearheaded by Donald and Boris with a few critical assists from Vladimir has afflicted most of our cultural political and economic norms 
SEP7	Why ruin Stonehenge to shave a few seconds off a car trip?	For the past four years a disaster has been threatening of such calamitous proportions that should it ever come to term future generations will rub their eyes in wonder that a Conservative government a Conservative government could ever have let it occur  At stake is much that Tories are supposed to hold dear the ancient fabric of the country fiscal responsibility Britain s good name Yet ministers seem content to sit on their hands As a result with the clock ticking down towards an October deadline a grotesque act of vandalism threatens We are facing a desecration the desecration that is the Stonehenge road tunnel 
SEP7	The law must step in to fill the gap left by a wounded parliament	In The Usual Suspects Kevin Spacey has a line for all Remainers laughing at the sight of Boris Johnson striding to power and then tripping over his shoelaces and falling flat on his face He tells of a gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob They realised that to be in power you didn t need guns or money or even numbers You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn t If they broke even gangsters lax conventions not just kill a rival but his wife and kids they would dominate  Johnson is showing a ruthlessness no one has seen in British politics When are you fucking MPs going to realise we are leaving on October We are going to purge you the Mail reported Dominic Cummings screaming at Greg Clark Cummings and Johnson duly purged not just the former business secretary but two former chancellors of the exchequer Winston Churchill s grandson and other fucking MPs who refused to do as they were told 
SEP7	James Middleton (and Ella the dog): no need to mooch with a pooch for companionship	It takes a lot for me to muster up enthusiasm for a Middleton but last week James brought a noteworthy date to the GQ awards his cocker spaniel Ella I m not sure if anyone on the red carpet took the opportunity to shout Who are you wearing at the dog but allow me she sported a flattering black jacket with a fetching tartan sort of kilt with Pets as Therapy in a blocky white print on the back In January Middleton wrote eloquently and at length about his experience of depression in the piece he explained how vital his dogs and particularly Ella had been for his recovery  Middleton volunteers for Pets as Therapy and Ella is a fully fledged therapy dog Whenever I hear about support animals I think of an unforgettable New Yorker feature from in which writer Patricia Marx explored the growing numbers of officially sanctioned emotional support animals by trying to take a snake a turkey and an alpaca with her into restaurants museums and shops not at the same time It is a brilliant witty piece and one of my all time favourites It revelled in the absurdity of the ease with which a psychologist could deem a peacock for example banned from a United Airlines flight in necessary for emotional support 
SEP7	Think Boris Johnson is toxic to voters? Don’t be so sure	Boris Johnson has blown it surely Even the man who invariably gets away with murder rising above things that would sink any mortal politician can only push the Tory faithful so far Or so I thought at any rate the night it emerged that police had been called to his girlfriend Carrie Symonds flat by worried neighbours  Whatever happened between them and the police went away satisfied it was nothing but a lovers tiff the episode seemed at best embarrassing and distinctly un prime ministerial Surely older Conservatives pens poised over leadership ballot papers would worry about the risks of putting such a volatile character into No

SEP7	On the stage, Alexander Litvinenko gets the justice he was denied in life	The character is called Mr President He s a fussy little man who walks briskly down a red carpet The Russian national anthem is a clue as are the golden Kremlin doors Yes it s Vladimir Putin making an appearance on a London stage in A Very Expensive Poison Lucy Prebble s reimagining of the story of the dissident Alexander Litvinenko s murder by Russia s FSB spy agency based on my book  Reece Shearsmith plays Mr President with dark charm He addresses the audience directly Whenever you tell a story you tell a lie he begins He offers an alternative version of Litvinenko s ghoulish killing Instead of being poisoned with radioactive tea Litvinenko lives out a happy family life in a cottage with his cat Yuri Putin says On the banks of the Volga In the background a dog barks The scene is marvellously chilling Mr President is compelling He has the best lines including a gag about the only crime being the cost of the theatre programme and the Old Vic makeshift loo arrangements and we laugh with him But does this make us complicit in his deeds Mr President is everywhere and nowhere He offers quips from the balcony He appears at Litvinenko s death bed robed in a hazmat protection suit 
SEP7	Robert Mugabe killed the freedoms he had worked so hard for	 Wafa wanaka it is said that it is unAfrican to speak ill of the dead But what choice does one have when the death of a once towering figure raises complex emotions and not in a good way  On April Zimbabwe was born In a colourful celebration that started the previous night at Rufaro stadium in Harare then known as Salisbury the independence flame was lit Bob Marley sang Zimbabwe a song he d written at the invitation of the government Hope filled the air as Robert Gabriel Mugabe the nation s first prime minister took his oath of office and swore allegiance to the new nation Julius Nyerere the leader of Tanzania prophetically cautioned Mugabe saying You have inherited a jewel in Africa Don t tarnish it

SEP8	Without MPs like Amber Rudd, the Tories won’t survive	Conviction often has its own contagious energy When Dominic Cummings was briefly director of strategy for the then party leader Iain Duncan Smith in there were occasional lunches for journalists at what was then still called Conservative Central Office in Smith Square Cummings would sit at one end of the table in open necked shirt and jeans bellowing about the inadequacy of the Conservative party while IDS in pinstripe suit sat meekly head bowed at the other end like a deeply unhappy vicar being berated by an evangelical member of the parish council It was easy to forget that technically at least Duncan Smith was the one in charge  Even now after Boris Johnson s disastrous week capped by the dramatic resignation of Amber Rudd last night many are still mesmerised by Cummings and his cunning plans Not unreasonably they recall his choreography of Vote Leave s victory in Less reasonably they persuade themselves that the present mayhem is all a necessary prelude to eventual glory citing the Leninist maxim that worse is better 
SEP8	Like Macbeth, Johnson is too stepped in blood to turn back. Where next?	Because Boris Johnson has such a notoriously casual relationship with the truth there is a tendency not to take him seriously even on the occasions when he is probably speaking with an unforked tongue So there has been a lot of derision for his declaration that he would rather be dead in a ditch than ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline  Seriously Even if instructed to do so by the legislation that will be written into the statute book this week Would he break the law a ditch no previous occupant of his office has chosen to expire in That I think is ultimately unlikely He wouldn t like the food in prison So might he resign as prime minister rather than carry out parliament s orders Yes I think he might do that He would not want to quit He may not have realised yet that the positions he has taken will compel him in that direction But I think we may get to the point where resignation from Number taking his government with him ends up being his least worst option He has been boxed by parliamentary votes that will not let him have a no deal Brexit He has been coxed by the opposition refusing him an election The one thing they can t stop him doing is quitting as prime minister and taunting the Commons to find someone else to carry out its instruction Deposing himself may turn out to be the most powerful card left in his hand 
SEP8	Mugabe’s death can be the start of Zimbabwe’s healing process	Zimbabwe s founding leader Robert Gabriel Mugabe has died The widespread reaction to his death has revealed starkly the divided legacy he leaves behind From one viewpoint he is Zimbabwe s founding father the man who led his comrades through an armed struggle for the liberation of Zimbabwe s black majority from Rhodesian white minority rule His achievements in those early heady years of independence were exemplary with emphasis on health education and women s empowerment thus opening up possibilities to many Zimbabweans particularly the rural poor who were shut out from Rhodesia s opportunities  From another viewpoint he is the hero who became a villain his year rule characterised by massive human rights abuses from the Gukurahundi massacres and persecution of supporters of the rival Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo just after independence to the persecution of perceived enemies both in the opposition and within his own party whom he considered threats to his power Even the land reform programme much admired across Africa for restoring land to its rightful owners was implemented amid chaos and violence 
SEP8	Was the old Guardian better than today’s? I can now make a direct comparison	I have scouted for ages for an issue that would allow a comparison of Guardian journalism across time What might be concluded from a look at print only black and white coverage alongside today s converged paper and screens coverage Was the remembered paper really so much better than today s as readers sometimes lament to me I needed subject matter that was sufficiently prominent consequential and open to this kind of exercise even if the samples were separated by decades  The chance came last week with the UK parliamentary drama over Brexit The scene resembled the four days in October when the UK parliament debated and approved Edward Heath s Conservative government s decision of principle to join the European Communities on the basis of arrangements which have been negotiated Labour whipped its MPs to vote against rebelled and the motion passed to Recriminations swiftly followed The House of Lords approved by to as brother passed brother in the Labour party on the way to the lobbies with none of the acrimony of their Commons counterparts reported the Guardian 
SEP8	The Observer view on the best way to defeat Boris Johnson	 A no deal Brexit could cause far more damage to our future economic success than a Corbyn government the former chancellor Ken Clarke told the Observer this weekend  It is an extraordinary sign that the Conservative party has imploded beyond the point of no return that someone who until days ago was its longest serving MP would now rather see not Boris Johnson but a man whose politics he has staunchly opposed for decades as prime minister The party s crisis was compounded last night by cabinet minister Amber Rudd resigning the Conservative whip I cannot stand by as good moderate Conservatives are expelled she said 
SEP8	Politics should be about getting things done – not creating drama	A prime minister willing to die in a ditch A machiavellian adviser snared by his own ambition Bloodletting and purges Brothers falling out An opposition leader trapped by his own indecision  It s been a week of high political drama Journalists and politicians have revelled in the brinkmanship the bluffs the clash of characters the arcane plots There will no doubt be a TV drama And probably a David Hare play too 
SEP8	Robert Mugabe was once a hero of the left. What can we learn from his descent into tyranny?	If democracies have learned anything it is that one man or woman in control of a country for decades never works Having come to power by fighting against the previous regime with spells in prison or exile charismatic leaders can only sustain their power as that charisma fades by progressively tightening control Challengers typically embodying some combination of fresh ideas new social forces and a desire to end abuse are held down by ever fouler means  Even if the state purports to be a democracy elections are rigged the media muzzled and opposition politicians harried or even killed Inevitably the economy suffers there is a lack of investment growing shortages government rationing and rampant inflation As the despot gets older there is a fight for the succession but without rules process or accountability so that it becomes a raw and destructive battle between factions The need for orderly succession is an overlooked and powerful argument for democracy as those conniving in the strutting power of presidents Putin and Xi will one day discover 
SEP8	What Harvey Weinstein looks like doesn’t matter – it is the evil lurking within	Should Harvey Weinstein s physical appearance matter Watching Ursula Macfarlane s devastating recent documentary Untouchable The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein I felt renewed admiration for all the courageous women recounting the alleged attacks all denied by Weinstein However I was also struck by how much interviewees generally mentioned Weinstein s appearance his ugliness his weight his repulsiveness Which seemed strange Surely Weinstein s unattractiveness isn t the issue  Weinstein s appearance should be completely irrelevant Ugly people attract beautiful people And it isn t as though women feel any less attacked if a good looking man does the attacking Some sexual predators are good looking look at handsome serial killer Ted Bundy but they re still preying on women Predators are just predators being attractive doesn t seem to stop them nor does it excuse them Why then is there so much emphasis on Weinstein s ugliness 
SEP8	The vices that led Johnson to the top are useless when it comes to wielding power	The self image of the public school ethos from which Boris Johnson springs is best expressed in Thomas Hughes s high Victorian novel Tom Brown s School Days But Johnson s own model is surely not the honourable Tom but the contemptible cad Harry Flashman as he is so hilariously reimagined in George MacDonald Fraser s The Flashman Papers The arch bounder was sometimes suggested as an avatar for David Cameron but he is surely a better match for Johnson He rises inexorably to become Sir Harry Flashman VC and brazenly informs us that all my fame and glory has been earned by accident false pretence cowardice doing the dirty and blind luck Flashman makes his career in the military and explains Some human faults are military virtues like stupidity and arrogance and narrow mindedness  We may take assurance from the very fact that Johnson is prime minister that the same goes for politics Some human faults mendacity cynicism opportunism bluster recklessness are political virtues But only up to a point Those qualities have taken Johnson to the pinnacle of power Shamelessness is practically a requirement for high office But as we have seen in a dramatic week the vices that allow you to take power are not much use when you have to wield it at least not yet and not in a country whose battered democracy retains some life 
SEP8	If there’s a cardinal sin to be made, count on the Catholic church	A grim little vaudeville act is currently touring some of Scotland s Catholic parishes featuring the remains of Th r se of Lisieux a long dead French nun Th r se died of tuberculosis at the age of in and was canonised in becoming Saint Th r se of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face By all accounts this young woman developed an exemplary devotion to her faith and was the author of some beautiful if slightly ripe spiritual tracts I m not sure she deserved the fate of having some of her remains bumped in and out of cars and through the hills of South Lanarkshire and Paisley for the devoted titillation of the faithful  These relics of Saint Th r se are considered to be first class this being the ultimate seal of Vatican authentication To be accorded this distinction they must be parts of the bodies of the saints such as fragments of bone skin blood hair or ash Apparently poor dead Th r se or parts thereof has been getting ferried like this throughout the Catholic world since Is there no one to call a halt to this unedifying distortion of faith Can we not let this blameless lassie rest in peace 
SEP9	Proroguing parliament is bigger than Brexit. It’s a display of political power	What do political leaders hope to achieve by breaking with constitutional rules and conventions As government policy becomes increasingly hard line from talk of proroguing parliament to ignoring its laws at the risk of jail much of the coverage has focused on the goals this may serve Whether as part of a negotiating strategy intended to force the hand of EU partners by showing how close a no deal Brexit could be or as a way to weaken domestic opposition and run down the clock constitutional transgression can be read as a way to get things done  But breaking with norms can also be an end in itself Rather than being about achieving specifics it can be a way of signalling broader ideas about the nature and authority of executive power and about politics itself In the name of getting a task done leaders can seek a wider redefinition of themselves and the landscape around them 
SEP9	If Boris Johnson quits, MPs should back Jeremy Corbyn to avoid no deal	Who s afraid of Jeremy Corbyn Unthinking knee jerk Corbynphobia is a danger in the precarious weeks ahead as the country s fate hangs by that red thread As parliament is brutishly banished by Boris Johnson after failing to secure an election both sides retire to plot feverish ploys and counterploys for the Brexit endgame  Johnson s crew brief that they have scores of cunning loopholes to escape the paralysing parliamentary vice that stops him crashing the country out of the EU with no deal on October even defying the law But the rebel alliance of opposition parties and Tory refugees is confident there is no trapdoor he can slip through without parliamentary consent 
SEP9	In Brussels, the goodwill Boris Johnson fostered is slowly ebbing away	The attention of Brexit watchers has understandably been focused on Boris Johnson s disastrous week in parliament and the exact timing of any election But key to what happens next is of course the EU s position  When UK and European commentators talk about the EU s stance on Brexit they almost invariably conclude that nothing has changed Europe s unity is paramount Ireland will not be sacrificed The withdrawal agreement will not be reopened Even suggesting that Germany s deteriorating economic conditions may give Berlin some pause for thought is tantamount to heresy The EU s Brexit position is fixed in time and space 
SEP9	Charging migrant women for maternity care puts us all to shame	Rarely have I felt more ashamed of Britain than when having to provide passport details before my first ever midwife appointment  There alongside my name and address close to the section about smoking and family history I was asked to prove what exactly That I was British enough to deserve a healthy pregnancy 
SEP9	I don’t want to strike, but British Airways has left me with no choice	Why are pilots earning six figure salaries going on strike On the face of it I do a highly respected and sought after job and I am paid handsomely for it Yet this week I am going to strike and I feel hugely conflicted My heart feels that I do not want to inflict a strike on British Airways to which I have given the lion s share of my working life or on my passengers for whom I make safety and commercial decisions every working day  Pilots tend to work until retirement for the better airline employers so we have a deep practical and emotional connection to our airline s wellbeing Passenger safety along with our own and the other crew members safety affects every decision action and thought while we are at work so to decide to destroy the plans of travellers which we know include highly important life and business events goes against every fibre of my working soul 
SEP9	The London arms fair is an inexcusable disgrace – it’s a stain on the nation	This week s London arms market decorously called a fair is a national disgrace and the protesters currently calling attention to it are right It is a shameless marketplace for global death and destruction vitiating any work done by British diplomacy in support of a more peaceful world  The best apology the government can offer is that it supports jobs The same line of argument applies to membership of the EU and yet the government doesn t support that job supporting measure 
SEP9	Britain is facing a stark choice. So why are so many people tuning out?	As parliament tumbled through last week s drama I was in the north west of England trying to divine the public mood What we found is about to appear in the Guardian s Anywhere But Westminster video series I spent a lot of time in Bury the large town miles to the north of Manchester whose two constituencies recently returned Labour MPs although Bury North was held by the Tories between The previous year of voters in the wider metropolitan borough had supported Brexit  Though it was not hard to find people whose belief in leaving the EU remains undimmed the prevailing mood seemed to mix weariness with disconnection and a sense that Westminster s convulsions were just one more story of crisis and chaos I m just confused one woman told me I ve stopped watching any of it One man folded both the Brexit mess and the loss of his job as a refuse collector into a much wider story of cuts to the borough council which since has lost of its annual budget and the collapse of Bury football club a woeful example of a beloved local institution ruined by financial mismanagement and mountains of debt 
SEP9	Without MPs like Amber Rudd, the Tories won’t survive	Conviction often has its own contagious energy When Dominic Cummings was briefly director of strategy for the then party leader Iain Duncan Smith in there were occasional lunches for journalists at what was then still called Conservative Central Office in Smith Square Cummings would sit at one end of the table in open necked shirt and jeans bellowing about the inadequacy of the Conservative party while IDS in pinstripe suit sat meekly head bowed at the other end like a deeply unhappy vicar being berated by an evangelical member of the parish council It was easy to forget that technically at least Duncan Smith was the one in charge  Even now after Boris Johnson s disastrous week capped by the dramatic resignation of Amber Rudd last night many are still mesmerised by Cummings and his cunning plans Not unreasonably they recall his choreography of Vote Leave s victory in Less reasonably they persuade themselves that the present mayhem is all a necessary prelude to eventual glory citing the Leninist maxim that worse is better 
SEP9	When feminism supports trans rights, everybody wins – just like in Iceland	On October of all women in Iceland went on strike Twenty five thousand women more than of the country s population made their way to the parliamentary square to rally for their rights Since that day Iceland has been at the forefront of women s rights and since it has been at the top of the World Economic Forum global gender gap index  That doesn t mean the fight is won though and Icelandic women continue the battle for true equality not just for women but for the LGBT community too Despite a reputation for being one of the most progressive nations towards LGBT people Iceland has in fact not always gone as far as it could A recent bill a form of self identification for trans people has moved the country further along The prime minister of Iceland Katr n Jakobsd ttir was the driving force For her it was a way to ensure that Iceland was again setting an example for the world Well you could say that we have been running a little bit behind but now with this legislation we re actually again at the front So it took some time I think for this small group of people to actually get heard 
SEP9	The great breakup of big tech is finally beginning	Last week state attorneys general led by Texas and New York announced investigations into Google and Facebook for possible antitrust violations This is a big deal No society has ever centralized control of information as we have in big tech and this is the first real American strike at the problem As Scott Galloway frequently notes in his podcast with tech journalist Kara Swisher the big tech breakup has finally begun  What have Google and Facebook done to merit such attention from authorities To put it simply they use their control of the flow of information to monopolize advertising revenue killing newspapers across the country and around the world and eliminating potential competitors in a host of areas Since a little less than half of all newspaper journalism jobs in the US have been eliminated Out of America s counties two thirds now have no daily newspaper Every sector of news gathering is in decline and not because the appetite for news is down People want news But the traffic and ad revenue that used to flow from news now flows to the digital duo 
SEP10	Johnson can’t escape the clutches of May’s zombie Brexit deal	In schlock horror movies there is a moment when the monster assailed by every weapon and presumed dead lurches back to life And so Theresa May s Brexit withdrawal agreement comes crawling from behind the closed doors of parliament where it was killed at least three times  Boris Johnson says he wants a deal and there is neither time nor diplomatic goodwill sufficient to craft a new one Erasure of the backstop the Brexiteers big demand is not available As a candidate for the Tory leadership Johnson boasted that Brussels would yield once confronted with a UK government prepared to quit the bloc with no deal at all Conversations in Paris and Berlin have disabused him of that notion 
SEP10	The Lib Dems’ plan to revoke article 50 is as undemocratic as the race to no deal	Today the Liberal Democrats have moved from being a party supporting a second referendum on EU membership to one that simply wants parliament to revoke article at the earliest opportunity This type of polarising behaviour mirrors the no deal extremists on the other side of the debate and illustrates exactly why British politics is stuck in deadlock  Jo Swinson s decision is nonsensical for two reasons First it flies in the face of everything the party has ever stood for How can any Lib Dem politician look their constituents in the eye refer to themselves as a democrat and then pledge to overturn the biggest democratic exercise this country has ever seen without even having the courtesy to first ask the public if they have changed their mind It is as astonishing as it is hypocritical 
SEP10	With parliament out of the picture, what happens next?	Parliament is now suspended for five weeks and the outcome of Brexit is as uncertain as ever The deadlock means we are almost certainly heading for a general election but the route towards one offers only stark options for both government and opposition and risks putting severe strain on our constitution  Parliament has spoken unambiguously on its opposition to a no deal Brexit by passing a new law mandating an extension However Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted that he will not ask to delay Brexit beyond October At the same time he has also said he will adhere to the law This is an obvious contradiction 
SEP10	Theresa May’s resignation honours list is another sign of our rotting political system	When Theresa May first began to recruit staff for No she made one thing very clear Anyone joining government in the new ostentatiously workmanlike post Cameron era shouldn t be doing so hoping to get a gong out of it they would the new prime minister is said to have warned be lucky to get so much as a chocolate biscuit at the end The sentiment encapsulated everything that was meant to have changed since the old Etonian set cleared their desks so much so that she eventually wheeled it out in public At an awards dinner she joked that David Cameron s former spin doctor Craig Oliver had confessed to retching into a bin when he heard the referendum result when he became Sir Craig everyone else knew the feeling  For many the most sickening aspect of May s own resignation honours list will be the sight of a woman praised for her work on domestic violence giving a knighthood to a cricketer convicted of it But the political honours she dished out are in their own way just as capable of undermining any remaining legacy Worse still they fuel the corrosive belief that all politicians are the same that even those who promise to be different eventually revert to type Who imagines Boris Johnson will be any more immune to the temptation of abusing the honours system given recent threats to stuff the Lords with pro Brexit peers 
SEP10	The real cost of cheap US chicken? Chlorination is just the start	As sugar was to the th and th centuries so chicken is to the th and st centuries It has been turned into one of the defining commodities of our era A luxury until it underwent its industrial revolution from the s on it is now ubiquitous Today questions about how poultry is produced by and for whom and to whose profit take you to the heart of the global trade system So there is no escape from the debate about chlorinated US chicken  Politicians perhaps bemused at having to repeatedly discuss something so mundane and dirty as contamination by chicken excrement try to downplay concerns President Trump s national security adviser John Bolton treated the issue as a joke recently when he visited the newly installed Boris Johnson to offer solidarity in the form of a quick and easy US UK trade deal Others have elevated the chicken argument with a flourish of Latin as Daniel Hannan did when he gave a speech in praise of Gallus gallus domesticus and the huge contribution its industrialised progeny have made by providing cheap protein to the world s poor 
SEP10	Britain could lead the fightback against nationalist populism	Britain is fast approaching a democratic showdown The Brexit saga may yet prove to be among the worst of the current worldwide horde of nationalist populisms or it could offer the best example of a democracy fighting back To seize the chance of the latter will require exceptional wisdom from voters who want Britain to be true to itself  The claim that British populism could be among the worst may seem like another example of Britons arrogantly overestimating their own importance Worse than Viktor Orb n s demolition of democracy in Hungary Worse than what Donald Trump can do to international order Yet no other populism is likely to dismantle the very country it claims to be saving The end of the United Kingdom is a probable outcome of the hardline Brexit towards which Boris Johnson is steering the country like a demented racing driver Brexit would also very significantly weaken both the European Union and the transatlantic alliance 
SEP10	Media bias is OK – if it's honest	Most people distrust the media and most people are right It s healthy to question what you re being told that s the mark of an intelligent and independent populace And the media in the United States are in fact biased in many ways Not always toward the left or right but frequently toward reaffirming the worldview of an insular establishment as Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky pointed out years ago in Manufacturing Consent  It should be obvious that there can t be such a thing as a neutral journalist We all have moral instincts and points of view Those points of view will color our interpretations of the facts The best course of action is to acknowledge where we re coming from If we show an awareness of our own political leanings it actually makes us more trustworthy than if we re in denial about them 
SEP10	Proroguing parliament is bigger than Brexit.

SEP10	Camping satisfies our urge to escape. But we take our baggage with us	The Oxford philosopher GA Cohen thought that a camping trip was a good model of what socialism might look like When we go camping claimed Cohen there is no hierarchy among us our common aim is that each of us should have a good time doing so far as possible the things that he or she likes best During a camping trip all the campers have control of the means of production Even if they are privately owned things they are under collective control for the duration of the trip Cohen explained  A camping trip becomes an occasion when people cooperate within a common concern that so far as is possible everybody has a roughly similar opportunity to flourish and also to relax on condition that she contributes appropriately to her capacity to the flourishing and relaxing of others If things go as they should even most anti egalitarians accept indeed take for granted norms of equality and reciprocity 
SEP10	If Boris Johnson quits, MPs should back Jeremy Corbyn to avoid no deal	Who s afraid of Jeremy Corbyn Unthinking knee jerk Corbynphobia is a danger in the precarious weeks ahead as the country s fate hangs by that red thread As parliament is brutishly banished by Boris Johnson after failing to secure an election both sides retire to plot feverish ploys and counterploys for the Brexit endgame  Johnson s crew brief that they have scores of cunning loopholes to escape the paralysing parliamentary vice that stops him crashing the country out of the EU with no deal on October even defying the law But the rebel alliance of opposition parties and Tory refugees is confident there is no trapdoor he can slip through without parliamentary consent 
SEP11	Adaptation isn’t enough. We’ve got to throw everything at the climate crisis	When we re faced with threats of inundation our reaction has traditionally been to build walls Sea level rises storms and floods have been held back with solid barriers seawalls and dykes We have used walls to keep out people too the fact that this has failed throughout the ages has not stopped its recent revival in the United States  The climate crisis threatens global sea level rises of well over half a metre if we fail to act while tidal storm surges will reach many times that height Fiercer and more frequent hurricanes will batter us and millions of people who live in areas where crops have failed and wells run dry will be forced to flee their homes But walls will not work with the climate crisis even if the temptation to try to keep out the consequences rather than dealing with the causes is as strong as ever 
SEP11	Why it’s time to take the Liberal Democrats seriously again	Beneath the soaring arches of Westminster Abbey at Paddy Ashdown s memorial service on Tuesday it was sometimes tempting to imagine Britain s liberal tradition regaining something of its former eminence As the service came to an end and with a theatricality fully worthy of the former Liberal Democrat leader himself a valedictory Last Post was followed by a summons to action in the Reveille A sense of resumed purpose was unmistakable in the sunlit chatter outside the abbey  The Liberal Democrats have been marginalised by most commentators for many years It is easy to see why Tarnished in leftwing eyes by austerity and in rightwing ones by pro Europeanism the post coalition electoral implosion of reduced the party from Commons seats to a mere eight Fewer people voted Lib Dem in the election than for the Lib Dems or their predecessors in any election since 
SEP11	Is it the end of the road for the Conservative party?	In his only working week presiding over a full House of Commons Boris Johnson was defeated in three successive votes in a single day lost two members of his cabinet team one a very senior colleague the other his little brother relinquished control of the order paper and was threatened with the prospect of prison if he ignores new legislation mandating a delay to Brexit  That s got to be some sort of ruinous record It prompted many commentators to claim that Johnson is a busted flush and even prompted speculation that the Conservative party itself may be reaching the end of the line at least in its traditional form I would not bet on that just yet 
SEP11	Tom Watson is wrong. We need an election first – and then a second referendum	Anti Brexit MPs from the Tories Oliver Letwin to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson have hit the airwaves arguing that the country should resolve Brexit before deciding on its next government  However this push for a second referendum ahead of a general election is doomed to failure As the indicative votes process showed there is no majority in this parliament for a second referendum or indeed for any particular outcome So demanding one before a general election is an act of political pique 
SEP11	Chaos is being normalised. It is all part of Boris Johnson’s pernicious plan	On Saturday for the first time in living memory neo fascists were chanting the name of the serving prime minister Supporters of the English Defence League and the Democratic Football Lads Alliance wandered around Whitehall some drunk harassing random remain protesters and shouting into the faces of journalists until inevitably they attacked the police  It s part of an unnerving trend that s emerged in the past two weeks the normalisation of chaos 
SEP11	Margaret Atwood’s new work is full of feminist hope. But don’t dumb it down	In these dark and difficult political times I often find myself craving clarity looking for explanations and reassurances and rarely if ever finding what I seek When I got my hands on a precious copy of Margaret Atwood s The Testaments a couple of days ago I was surprised by the almost physical hunger I felt to step back into Gilead Obviously I m not alone and one reason why this dystopia has hit the spot for many of us is its clarity I m not saying that there isn t complexity of plot in Atwood s creation but in Gilead there is also a great deal of moral certainty There is good and there is evil There is oppression and there is resistance  The appearance of handmaids in their red cloaks has put heart into me at various protests over the past couple of years I have photographed them at women s marches in London and seen them gather in courtrooms in the US Although they are a symbol of a possibly terrifying future they are also a symbol of shared understanding which gives me hope And The Testaments unlike The Handmaid s Tale itself is a truly hopeful tale It reassures us that we are right to fear our enemies and right to resist them and it reassures us that totalitarianism can be seen off 
SEP11	The insidious ideology pushing us towards a Brexit cliff-edge	At first sight it s incomprehensible Why risk everything for a no deal Brexit Breaking up their own party losing their parliamentary majority dismantling the UK trashing the economy triggering shortages of food and medicine how could any objective for the Conservative and Unionist party be worth this What good does it do them  Yes some people will benefit To judge by recent donations to the Conservative party some very rich people approve of Boris Johnson s policies A no deal Brexit might favour hedge funds that thrive on uncertainty financiers seeking to short the pound vulture capitalists hoping to mop up cheap property if markets collapse But the winners are likely to be greatly outnumbered by the losers among whom are many powerful commercial interests 
SEP11	Johnson can’t escape the clutches of May’s zombie Brexit deal	In schlock horror movies there is a moment when the monster assailed by every weapon and presumed dead lurches back to life And so Theresa May s Brexit withdrawal agreement comes crawling from behind the closed doors of parliament where it was killed at least three times  Boris Johnson says he wants a deal and there is neither time nor diplomatic goodwill sufficient to craft a new one Erasure of the backstop the Brexiteers big demand is not available As a candidate for the Tory leadership Johnson boasted that Brussels would yield once confronted with a UK government prepared to quit the bloc with no deal at all Conversations in Paris and Berlin have disabused him of that notion

SEP11	Jeremy Corbyn is wise to emulate Harold Wilson’s pragmatism on Europe	It is said of Harold Wilson that he epitomised the quip If you can t ride two horses at the same time you shouldn t be in the circus He was often criticised for putting pragmatism before principle in his years as Labour leader but it was an attribute that served him well in preventing the party from tearing itself apart on Europe in the s  When Wilson won a fourth general election on October he faced the challenge of navigating Labour s deep divisions on whether or not to reverse the decision to join the common market The party s election manifesto had promised the British people a final say on Britain s membership without committing itself one way or another to a recommendation It is as yet too early to judge the likely results of the tough negotiations which are taking place it said 
SEP12	Boris Johnson has no right to call himself a one-nation Conservative	I have been around long enough to know that I should not always be surprised or shocked about what is written in the Sun newspaper But it was reported yesterday that Boris Johnson was telling cabinet colleagues he was basically a Brexity Hezza with the newspaper helpfully explaining this was a reference to Tory wet Michael Heseltine who battled rightwing PM Margaret Thatcher  The quotes have not been denied and I assume they were well sourced Part of me is even a little flattered not least because there is a side to the prime minister that I like He succeeded me as MP for Henley and I got to know him More importantly as mayor of London he once showed a capacity to govern in the tradition of one nation conservatism 
SEP12	The Brexit crisis is political. Its resolution must be political too	Boris Johnson is looking like Saint Sebastian pierced with a thousand arrows but with a saintly smile on his face Next week more judges join in the archery as the supreme court begins his prorogation case Who knows what damage they might do Their task is simple The purpose of a supreme court is not to avoid politics but to set its rules to frame it in law  This week s Scottish judges were right The advice given by the prime minister to the monarch must be reviewable where its implications are plainly constitutional Johnson s potentially deceptive advice to the Queen on proroguing parliament must be open to review not just condemnation if his ulterior motive was to curb parliamentary freedom If the court refuses to intervene whatever it decides it will be inviting future monarchs to dispute the advice thus sucking them into politics The supreme court must adjudicate 
SEP12	Rape is becoming decriminalised. It is a shocking betrayal of vulnerable women	If I were a rapist I would be laughing all the way to my next victim in the context of today s news that rape prosecutions are at their lowest level in a decade And if I was raped today it pains me to say that I wouldn t dream of reporting that rape to the police As a lifelong feminist campaigner against male violence I feel more pessimistic about the prospect of ending rape which is what any civilised society should aim for than I did years ago  For decades the proportion of reported rapes that end in a conviction has been dismally low But things are getting worse today s statistics show that although the number of rapes reported to the police has doubled in the last year the number of rape cases charged and prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service CPS has fallen dramatically Out of reports of rape in thought to be a fraction of the rapes actually committed only ended in a conviction 
SEP12	Marie Claire wasn’t all fluff. It filled a crucial gap in women’s lives	Lucinda Chambers had not she said read Vogue for years The magazine was too full of ridiculously expensive clothes that felt irrelevant to ordinary women s lives she complained and besides the glossies always left her feeling faintly anxious that her life wasn t up to their standards It s hardly an unusual take on women s magazines long accused of encouraging readers to go shopping by preying on their insecurities save for one crucial detail Chambers had been running Vogue s fashion pages for the previous years and let rip only after being sacked  An army of influencers is giving away for free large chunks of what magazines once sold with little regulation
SEP12	A four-day working week is common sense – but the state must make it happen	The future means working less This is the new common sense that has emerged in Britain and across the globe in recent years We ve seen a flurry of books pushing for a shorter working week trade unions such as the Communications Workers Union winning reductions in hours for its members and Day Week campaigns created both inside and outside the Labour party  Almost every week a new company announces that it operates with a four day week or is at least trialling it Whether it s a data design company such as Normally a marketing company such as Pursuit Marketing or a call centre like Simply Business a four day week is quickly becoming a sign of best practice The Monday to Friday working week we inhabit today is of course a social and historical construct While it might appear as a natural configuration of time the reality is that our hour working week and the weekend are the result of labour movements of the th and th centuries demanding limits to the toil that industrialism had imposed upon them American unions famously won the weekend Australian unions won the eight hour day and working class pressure here in Britain resulted in the two day weekend being firmly normalised after the second world war 
SEP12	Central banks were always political – so their ‘independence’ doesn’t mean much	Independent central banks were once all the rage Taking decisions over interest rates and handing them to technocrats was seen as a sensible way of preventing politicians from trying to buy votes with cheap money They couldn t be trusted to keep inflation under control but central banks could  And when the global economy came crashing down in the autumn of it was central banks that prevented another Great Depression Interest rates were slashed and the electronic money taps were turned on with quantitative easing QE That at least is the way central banks tell the story 
SEP12	Passionate politicians took us into Europe. A poisonous press is dragging us out	In the bare ruined choirs of the prorogued parliament one small event carried on unhindered The scrutinising committees are banned the prime minister shut parliament to avoid interrogation by the mighty Commons liaison committee as he hid from PMQs But this one small elegiac meeting went ahead Lord Giles Radice launching his little red book A Love Affair With Europe  There they were older noble lords of passionate pro European persuasion assembling to mourn the passing of a long held dream For years Radice was one of those who toiled unceasingly for the UK to join and to love the Europe of peace and prosperity a beacon of democracy 
SEP12	A general election is coming – the left must keep its focus on marginalised voters	With the prorogation of parliament and the government set on a no deal Brexit it s easy to feel powerless And yet this is not the time to feel helpless A general election may have stalled but one is inevitably on its way Those of us who wish to remove Boris Johnson and his hard right ilk from power will need to organise with laser focus not only setting out an inspiring vision for a fairer society but targeting its message to reach the public  At the election there was a percentage point gap between the turnout of the richest and poorest income groups
SEP12	My son is one of Kashmir’s ‘disappeared’. When will India tell the truth about their fate?	The Eid this year was like no other We could not even offer the obligatory sacrifice because of the total siege by India of Kashmir  When my son Yasir went to fetch bread in the morning and didn t return promptly I started pacing with worry outside the house What if the security forces manning every corner had roughed him up or even worse My fear is the fear of every single person living in shock in Kashmir and wondering What next Eventually he returned explaining that the delay was due to long queues at the only bakery open in the entire area But unlike Yasir my son Javaid has never returned 
SEP12	Johnson’s ugly rhetoric thrills the far right, but he’s playing with fire	For the first time in our history we have a prime minister whom the far right regard as their leader Last Saturday far right thugs at a demonstration in Westminster lunged at remainer and leftwing activists as they chanted We ve got a lamppost just for you and We love you Boris The jailed fraudster and thug Tommy Robinson has declared We back Boris commending him for taking on Tory rebels and Labour traitors while one of his key allies has promoted a video clip featuring Johnson with his thumbs up captioned The people s prime minister and Parliament vs the People and accompanied by a football stadium style chant of Boris for England  While Margaret Thatcher whipped up fears of Britain being rather swamped by people with a different culture and held out the prospect of an end to immigration the National Front the dominant far right movement of the time never saw her as one of its own If Johnson is privately concerned about becoming the pin up for a resurgent far right he has shown no signs of it Instead he and his co prime minister Dominic Cummings casually play with matches even though they know that Britain is a tinderbox 
SEP13	Even the Tories admit it: only duty free can get us through	Now wanted north of the border for a prorogation scam prime minister Boris Johnson went on the run this week with a series of alarming public appearances Tuesday found him in a primary school as per the timeworn political practice of ministers using inappropriate venues as backdrops You know the sort of thing It s great to come to this wonderful early years centre and announce new active nuclear warheads each capable of snuffing out human futures in an instant  The reality was somehow even more unsettling as Johnson wandered miles off script to wistfully inform the kiddies I m afraid I didn t do enough work at university My strong advice is don t waste your time at university sigh Don t get drunk don t do not that you would but use it well I frittered too much time at university I m afraid to say An excruciating pause Shortly after a boy no older than seven put his hand up and went Are we leaving Brexit with a deal or no deal 
SEP13	This political crisis now goes far beyond Brexit – our very democracy is at stake	The sensation has become so rare it took a moment to realise what it was But following Wednesday s ruling by Scotland s highest civil court that Boris Johnson s suspension of parliament was unlawful the feeling was unmistakable It was optimism Admittedly it was optimism in its weakest form not the confident certainty that all would turn out for the best but rather a fragile flicker of hope that things might not be so bad after all  Coupled with MPs success in both outlawing a no deal crash out from the European Union on October and forcing the release of the Yellowhammer papers outlining the government s own assessment of the calamity such a Brexit would inflict on the country a hopeful thought took root Maybe just maybe the British constitution was working as the textbooks say it should Here was an independent judiciary and independent legislature doing their jobs acting as a restraint on an overmighty executive 
SEP13	Hero or villain? Bercow’s notoriety is a consequence of parliament’s crisis – not its cause	On Monday only hours before the drama of parliament s prorogation John Bercow announced he would retire as Speaker before the next election Downing Street had declared war on him in the Sunday papers briefing that it would break convention and seek his removal from his seat at the next election Instead Bercow has sought to undercut the government by giving the current parliament habituated to autonomy and rebellion against the whips a vote on his successor  Bercow s constitutional vandalism is unlikely to trouble any government with a majority
SEP13	Never mind ‘tax raids’, Labour – just abolish private education	The British class system is an organised racket It concentrates wealth and power in the hands of the few while million Britons languish in poverty  If you are dim but have rich parents a life of comfort affluence and power is almost inevitable while the bright but poor are systematically robbed of their potential The well to do are all but guaranteed places at the top table of the media law politics medicine military civil service and arts As inequality grows so too does the stranglehold of the rich over democracy The wealthiest can double their fortunes in the aftermath of financial calamity while workers suffer the worst squeeze in wages since the Napoleonic wars State support is lavished on rich vested interests such as the banks responsible for Britain s economic turmoil but stripped from disabled and low paid people The powerful have less stressful lives and the prosperous are healthier expecting to live a decade longer than those living in the most deprived areas 
SEP13	Johnson is sure he would win an election. A closer look at the polls says otherwise	In October British voters went to the polls It was an unstable time over the previous two years as one inconclusive election followed another the country had got through three prime ministers This time however the result was decisive Stanley Baldwin won the biggest Conservative landslide in British history The story will no doubt provide comfort to Boris Johnson as he seeks to win his own snap election But a Conservative majority in is by no means guaranteed Johnson faces many more obstacles than Baldwin  Many observers have focused on the Lib Dems impact on the Labour vote That s a mistake
SEP13	We have to avoid 'integration' becoming another form of racism	I will never forget the day I joined an English Defence League march in Chelmsford Essex in the run up to the Brexit vote I went as a journalist and I wasn t expecting it to be a comfortable experience But the most shocking moment was not what I predicted Instead of threatening me with directly racist slurs a senior figure at the march told me he wasn t fussed by my presence You re OK he said You speak English properly You know our ways You re like us It s the others we have a problem with  By others he meant Muslims the EDL s most frequent target or any other visible minorities he deemed to have made insufficient effort to assimilate into British culture It struck me as the most chilling and insidious form of racism of all he was in effect saying People who come to England are acceptable to the extent they attempt to mimic us Underpinning that is a confidence in one culture s inherent superiority over others It s for exactly this reason that it is becoming more widely recognised that assimilationist thinking the idea that a particular culture is preferable and that others should therefore adopt it is a racist ideology 
SEP13	Justin Welby has apologised for Amritsar. But Britain still won't face the reality of empire	It was a remarkable sight the archbishop of Canterbury clad in purple prostrating himself before the memorial to the Amritsar massacre And his act of public penitence on Tuesday has once again thrust this colonial atrocity into the public limelight years after it took place Justin Welby s heartfelt apology provided a stark contrast to the mealy mouthed politics that have so far characterised the centenary commemorations The Amritsar massacre remains one of the most notorious acts of brutality in the history of the British empire On April colonial troops under the command of Brigadier General Reginald Dyer opened fire on a large unarmed gathering of Indian civilians at Jallianwala Bagh in order to quell what was incorrectly believed to be an imminent uprising The shooting lasted minutes leaving between and people dead and at least three times as many wounded The massacre permanently alienated most Indian nationalists including Gandhi who in for the first time called for outright independence from Britain Months after the massacre CF Andrews a Christian priest and close friend of Gandhi helped interview survivors and gather evidence for the independent inquiry into the events As he described it Each act has been in very truth an act of penance of atonement an act of reparation for my country  Nothing could be more damaging to the myth of British exceptionalism than having to publicly apologise for the Raj
SEP13	‘Protecting the European way of life’ from migrants is a gift to the far right	How would you define the European way of life What unique homogenous culture is shared by people who live in Bolton Palermo or Plovdiv but not those who live outside Europe And what threatens it so profoundly that the European Union has this week nominated a minister with responsibility for defending it  Just asking these questions shows what a fatuous and deeply sinister stunt it was for the incoming president of the European commission Ursula von der Leyen to unveil a new role on Tuesday vice president for protecting the European way of life Within a day after widespread criticism there were suggestions that the job title would be revised but the intended message was clear What supposedly threatens the European way of life according to the commission is migration the new role incorporates the duties of the previous migration commissioner bundling together the responsibility for controlling Europe s external borders with security employment and education 
SEP13	An alliance between progressive parties would be fragile, but it could win an election	A general election is now more or less certain the only remaining question is How soon We know where we want to go but we d rather not be starting from here If the aim is not just to deny Boris Johnson a majority but to get rid of the Conservatives as the party of government altogether the best scenario would be Labour polling high having created a solid anti Brexit anti hard right anti austerity tripod  That hasn t happened but a progressive alliance is still more than capable of having a decisive impact Nigel Farage says a pact between his Brexit party and the Tories would make them unstoppable Yet the focus on Johnson s ability to ally with Farage is misplaced The Conservatives and the Brexit party will certainly pull together the only unknown is how many core Tory values the prime minister is prepared to traduce to get there which is hardly unknown at all 
SEP13	UK cancer survival rates are too low – our priorities are all wrong	Cancer survival rates in the UK have long lagged behind those in other countries of comparable wealth and income levels And an international study published this week shows that while the UK is making rapid progress there s still a big gap in the survival rates cancer patients can expect in Britain compared with countries such as Australia Canada and Norway  The good news is that the outlook for patients suffering from major forms of cancer has got much better On an age standardised basis fewer than half of patients with rectal cancer in the UK lived more than five years in By more than did 
SEP14	Fixing a tattered reputation like Harvey Weinstein’s is dirty work, but pays so well	Odious Harvey Weinstein is of course chief villain of the brilliant and deeply satisfying new book She Said by the New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey It details how in they finally unmasked the alleged his trial is pending serial rapist Shortly after publication however much interest has alighted on another less familiar figure in this story who was once as fully committed as Weinstein to silencing and shaming survivors intimidating reporters and rebuilding his good name a US lawyer called Lisa Bloom  At the same time as it offers inspiration and guidance to investigative reporters in pursuit of powerful bullies She Said with its startling new evidence about Bloom s involvement also supplies a priceless introduction for novices to the business of reputation management 
SEP14	I left Russia to escape Putin’s assault on reason. Now I fear the UK is on the same path	Nothing is true and everything is possible That was my one line attempt to sum up the politics and propaganda that enveloped Russia at the start of the st century It was a world where politicians no longer cared whether they were caught lying where old ideologies were dead and conspiracy thinking had become the new way to explain the world where all the old political categories socialist and liberal conservative and communist seemed utterly meaningless and it was unclear what political parties stood for where warped nostalgia and vague emotive calls to Raise Russia From Its Knees had taken over from any rational idea of the future  The same pathologies of public opinion I saw in Putinist Russia are now prevalent here
SEP14	To see how extremism has taken root in Britain just look at Islington North	At the general election in Jeremy Corbyn s Islington North a candidate will stand from a party with a history of supporting IRA atrocities But it won t be the Labour party It will have roots in a conspiracist Leninist sect that denied the existence of the concentration camps in to which socialist Serbs herded Bosnian Muslims But much of the media will be too compromised by past endorsements to expose it as they exposed the Communist party of Britain and the other conspiratorial factions that guide Labour  Its candidate told a critic This is such a retarded argument that you are now forever fixed in my mind as a drooling fuckwitted sack of shit But he is not one of the charming Twitter outriders for the Labour leadership 
SEP14	Rihanna: love your undies, but where’s the next album?	It has been a week of boom and bust for Rihanna fans as the singer hosted her second Savage x Fenty fashion show at New York fashion week to a standing ovation  The only fashion shows I ve ever been to all two of them were by unknown designers took place in cold and remote buildings that could easily have been gangland interrogation sites and felt a bit like being in the school gym at am after being taken hostage by the local am dram society 
SEP14	We can revive Britain’s high streets. But developers stand in the way	Anyone who has walked down a British high street recently will not be surprised by the latest news on their dire state A report by the Local Data Company and PricewaterhouseCoopers reveals that chain store closures are at their highest level since their audit began in On Britain s top high streets shops shut in the first half of  This is the new reality Former anchor tenants have either sunk BHS Toys R Us or like M S Debenhams and House of Fraser are shutting stores to stay afloat At Topshop New Look and Monsoon a company voluntary arrangement financial first aid for ailing brands is this season s must have accessory

SEP14	Students, this is your chance to get Boris Johnson and the Tories out. Here’s how	British politics may feel like it s in flux with parliament prorogued and a Brexit deadline looming but one thing is clear a general election is coming Parliament is paralysed and the Conservatives no longer have a majority And the campaign is already in full flow  From spurious spending reviews to choreographed speeches with police as props Boris Johnson and the Tories are obviously in full election mode and the nature of their authoritarian populist programme is clear Johnson is going to offer voters a hard Brexit brutal borders state racism and a ramped up culture war all distracting from yet another obscene transfer of wealth to the richest in society And with parliament out of session and the prime minister having a free run of the sympathetic broadcasters he s likely to get a hearing too 
SEP14	Why, this year, Last Night of the Proms will be woke	In recent years we seem to have reached peak wokeness but not entirely for the right reasons I first heard woke as an adjective from the US alongside the rise of the BlackLivesMatter movement The term stay woke was used as an empowering slogan that encouraged people to be vigilant to the injustices in society especially racism But as the word grew in popularity the licence to use it in any which way expanded and its meaning became diluted It was in response to this woke washing that I decided to call my piece for tonight s Last Night of the Proms Woke   When I was young I remember feeling a sense of otherness where were all the other black and minority ethnic children 
SEP14	My nameless village, now lost in time	I went to a school in Pakistan s Punjab province called government primary school Chak L Chak means village L is the name of my village the number of the canal feed that irrigates it and L because it s on the left side of the canal Most villages along the canal had named themselves after a local legend or a landmark We never bothered I always assumed that our people were so hardworking they forgot to name where we lived  I don t mean to romanticise hard labour but my people were always busy cultivating their land The land was fertile but fertile land requires even harder work you must irrigate it at midnight and pick your vegetables before dawn And there were rewards If you owned two acres of land you could send your sons to university and give water buffaloes to your daughter in their dowry if you had no acres but owned a buffalo you could still send your son to school and your daughter to a Qur an class

SEP15	Why do we cling to the myth of the evil genius? Because the alternative is worse	At the peak of the media s fascination with Steve Bannon and before it became clear that his route to the White House was less the application of evil genius and more a question of a peripatetic opportunist striking it lucky one issue dominated why does he wear two shirts at the same time The speculation reached fever pitch towards the end of when this minor sartorial deviation became yet another marker of his special talents He had baffled DC fashionistas There is something hideously irresistible about Bannon the Financial Times commented as recently as July Is it the blend of a dishevelled public image he wears two shirts simultaneously and looks as if he cuts his hair with a combine harvester with scandalising political views  The only right answer to the question is of course who cares He was an unelected official with no accountability but enough power to promote the racial profiling of Muslims via a travel ban which was yanked into the courts by concerned citizens and lawmakers It didn t matter what he wore while families were being separated due process was violated and legal residents were denied entry 
SEP15	There’s nothing normal about this beast of a government	How grimly symbolic of the times in which we live that it is necessary to correct the prime minister on his reference to comic book characters  Only a couple of years ago Boris Johnson was urging the Tory party conference in pseudo Churchillian phrases to let the British lion roar Now in an interview with the Mail on Sunday he is invoking more primitive and aggressive imagery If he fails to get a new Brexit deal with the EU he will simply ignore the legislation requiring him to seek an article extension The madder Hulk gets the stronger Hulk gets 
SEP15	Dishing out more drugs won’t stop the pain. Doctors need new tools	Growing concern about the prescription of drugs that cause dependence has been backed up by a recent report from Public Health England PHE The agency discovered that in of adults in England received at least one prescription for opioids such as morphine or oxycodone although this represented a slight downturn in prescribing after a long upward trend Other drug classes were implicated too with of adults prescribed one or more of the following drugs benzodiazepines such as Valium z drugs sleeping pills such as Zopiclone gabapentinoids gabapentin or pregabalin prescribed for neuropathic pain or antidepressants  The fear is that the UK is following in the footsteps of the US where overprescribing is said to have led to a full blown opioid crisis But where does this leave those who live with severe or chronic pain and are dependent on opioids to function day to day GPs like me and pain specialists need lots of time and a toolbox of interventions to properly treat those who suffer But in the current cash and time poor environment is it any wonder that they dole out prescriptions instead 
SEP15	Against very familiar rivals, Jo Swinson will be the wild card of the election	David Steel once told a Liberal conference to go away and prepare for government They went away and remained in opposition Vince Cable once said that he could imagine himself becoming prime minister Which is where that idea stayed in his imagination Nick Clegg did take them into government during the coalition years an experience that ended with the Lib Dems losing all but eight of the MPs they started with five years earlier  So they have had fair warning about the perils of dreaming of breakthroughs They usually don t come true On the rare occasions when they do the consequences for the party can be terrible But dream they always will and never more so than now 
SEP15	The games industry shouldn’t be ripping off children	Last week MPs called on the government to classify online loot boxes as gambling and in the process highlighted a scandal the bn bn gaming industry makes much of its profit by ripping off children Young people are being nudged enticed and coerced not only to carry on playing but also paying  Loot boxes mystery objects in virtual treasure chests that players pay to open resemble nothing so much as a lottery Gamers spent bn on them worldwide in a figure that has been predicted to rise to bn in the next five years 
SEP15	Age should be no barrier to high office. Worn-out ideas are another matter	Which country has the oldest leader Officially it is Malaysia whose current president Mahathir Mohamad weighs in at an impressive years Yet the unassailable winner of this contest is North Korea because although the nation s supreme leader Kim Jong un is a mere youth of his father Kim Il sung who inconveniently died in still holds the title Eternal Leader making North Korea the world s only necrocracy  The age of national leaders or candidates for high office has never been automatically regarded as an issue for concern When Winston Churchill became prime minister for the last time in he was Nelson Mandela was in when he became South Africa s first democratically elected president His unique moral authority and the historic drama of the moment meant that few people fretted about his age 
SEP15	From India to Britain, every citizen is harmed by anti-migrant hostility	In the Indian state of Assam the authorities are building detention camps for illegal immigrants most of whom are Indian citizens In South Africa hundreds of Nigerian workers have been airlifted home as anti migrant violence spirals out of control  Two different events in two different countries but each a glimpse of the malevolent trends transforming politics globally While neither event has received much attention in Britain consumed as we are by all things Brexit both throw light upon developments here too 
SEP15	The con artist and her mark – the very modern morality tale of Caroline Calloway	For any victim of a scam the most brutal part is this thought it could only work because in some way or other you were asking for it You had to invite the vampire over the threshold before they could suck you dry The successful con artist is a true artist with an instinctive grasp of character that makes the average fiction writer look like an unsophisticated child  The con artist knows all your petty humiliating wants Your thirst for unearned wealth Your hunger for approval Your terrible pride which means that even when your bank account is empty and your hopes are broken you ll still swear loyalty to the person who scammed you rather than admit your weakness to the world

SEP16	Swinson’s remain extremism has given Labour a golden opportunity	Brexit is the disrupter that breaks things and shape shifts as it scythes through the political life of the nation Look at its unexpected landing zone this week after the Liberal Democrat conference The Tories and the Lib Dems have adopted two startlingly extreme positions Boris Johnson heading for no deal damn the consequences versus Jo Swinson s revoke now to hell with the will of the people Both stands are alarming one ignoring the economic fate of the nation the other risking riots over the denial of democracy  Suddenly Labour is the moderate thoughtful one only another referendum has the authority to abandon or confirm the decision of the first after three years of hellish impasse If Swinson was trying to position the Lib Dems midway between the extremes of Hulk Johnson and Corbynism her revoke blunder takes her party out on another distant limb Her abrasive rejection of ever working with Jeremy Corbyn is another error her better role should be as enabler bringer together a progressive alliance Caroline Lucas does that tone well 
SEP16	The world ignored the warning signs – and now the Middle East is on the brink	Like a furious maelstrom roiled by opposing currents the crisis in the Gulf gains in intensity and destructive power almost by the day On Sunday Donald Trump said the US was locked and loaded ready to respond to attacks on an oil facility in Saudi Arabia in which it believes Iran was involved But warning bells akin to those used to alert fog bound mariners steering towards rocks have been ringing out for months They have mostly been ignored The daunting bill for multiple acts of political insouciance measured in lives and petrodollars is now coming due  Trump is even trying to sell the Saudis nuclear technology What would you think were you in Iran s shoes 
SEP16	Inheritance tax would be scrapped by the Brexit party – good news for the very rich	There are bad ideas really bad ideas and there s abolishing inheritance tax This is the new top priority announced by the Brexit party one of only two policies it has beyond Brexit  Scrapping inheritance tax is a very expensive pledge it raised bn for the Treasury last year And it s particularly expensive when there s a political consensus that we need to spend more earlier this month a Conservative government set out proposals to increase the size of the state at the price of binning their fiscal rules 
SEP16	Cameron may have fought Brexit. But it was his policies that made it happen	Here he comes wielding the delayed memoirs that will finally go on sale on Thursday about to star in the two part BBC documentary that premieres the same day and committed to the bare minimum of public appearances In the midst of such a huge national mess David Cameron seems to be fulfilling a role that will be familiar to any devotee of country music or TV soap opera that of the estranged emotionally constipated husband who left behind the domestic carnage he created and then hesitantly returned lost as to what to say but desperate to somehow make amends  The media has a habit of reducing complex and confounding questions about recent history to a single supposedly momentous event or decision and so it is proving this time With Tony Blair and his legacy everything still supposedly centres on Iraq in Cameron s case of the weekend s headlines were focused on what he now says about the promise delivery and conduct of the referendum of June I should have done more to mix criticisms of the EU with talking about its very real achievements he writes a sentence that is surely a shoo in for the understatement of the decade The two big leave campaigns he says were a cauldron of toxicity Boris Johnson backed his side no really to benefit his political career and Michael Gove was transformed into a foam flecked Faragist His anger and contrition however don t encompass the vote itself putting our membership of the EU to the public he reaffirms was necessary and I believe ultimately inevitable 
SEP16	Labour cannot out-remain the Lib Dems. Thankfully, it doesn’t need to	The Liberal Democrats at their Bournemouth conference this week are in triumphant mood This year has witnessed the strange rebirth of the party as the champions of remain And its latest commitment to revoke article without a further referendum is a naked attempt to outflank Labour among highly motivated remainers  The Lib Dems have become the standard bearers for a form of elite politics where commitment to Britain s membership of the EU eclipses all other matters This affliction is also found in parts of the Labour party where many self identifying moderates have seized upon Brexit in the absence of locating anything else to believe in No matter that ordinary voters have a much wider set of concerns about their lives from wages to public services to climate change 
SEP16	Johnson’s cynical ‘tough on crime’ talk shows the depth of his incivility	The thesis that Boris Johnson is a liberal in Tory clothing is shot to ribbons His latest proposals on crime leaked by a Whitehall source are a shameless lurch to the wilder shores of rightwing populism In next month s Queen s speech he will apparently get tough on crime by increasing the severity of sentences He wants life to mean life for child murderers together with more prison places simpler stop and search and less early release His source says most people think all parties and the courts have lost the plot on sentencing Johnson will act aggressively  The source we assume Dominic Cummings or a minion offers no authority for most people It also turns out that the proposed changes are almost all within the competence of the existing judicial system and are in reality all for show There is no call for them from within or outside the prisons The worsening of prison violence and mental health and the recidivism rate among young offenders within a year is glaringly due to austerity cuts since As the chief inspector of constabulary Sir Tom Winsor has written reacting to Johnson s proposals the cost of crime in treasure blood and human suffering is caused by the failure of prevention not the laxity of punishment We must ask if the new draconianism is approved by Michael Gove who as justice secretary in called for a drastic cut in the prison population

SEP16	Norway is in denial about the threat of far-right violence	 Never again Norwegian politicians pledged after the terrorist attacks perpetrated by rightwing extremist Anders Breivik on July the worst in the nation s history Yet just last month an armed year old Norwegian Philip Manshaus stormed into a mosque in B rum outside Oslo and opened fire his actions inspired apparently by Breivik as well as recent terror incidents in New Zealand and El Paso  Norway is generally portrayed in the international media as a haven of peace prosperity happiness and equality So why has it produced so much violent rightwing extremism in the past decade

SEP17	Only Labour will give the people a final say on Brexit	Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are threatening to drive our country over a no deal cliff edge in six weeks time He has no mandate for that and is opposed by a majority of the public Since he became prime minister in July Johnson has been defeated on every vote he has put to parliament Now his undemocratic manoeuvrings and his decision to close down parliament and avoid accountability are being challenged in the supreme court Johnson s visit to Luxembourg on Monday was a further humiliation The prime minister went to Europe with no plan and no proposals and did his best to hide from scrutiny while he was there  Three years ago Johnson backed Brexit because he thought it would boost his political career writing one article in favour of remain and another backing leave Now he s backing no deal because he thinks it s politically expedient to win back votes from the Brexit party and keep his Tory Brexit ultras on board At the same time he needs to look like he s trying for a deal to hold his cabinet and parliamentary party together 
SEP17	Britons in Europe are being hung out to dry. In Luxembourg, they found their voice	If it was meant to highlight Boris Johnson s tendency to flee the consequences of his actions then the trick almost worked  The Luxembourg prime minister s decision to face the press with an empty podium where his British counterpart should have been rather than let him move their press conference away from noisy protesters has delivered the diplomatic burn that Xavier Bettel presumably intended But in truth it won t change anyone s mind 
SEP17	Pitting climate justice against remain won’t make Brexit go away for Labour	Atmospherically speaking Brexit will certainly dominate Labour s conference as it has for the Liberal Democrats and will for the Tories All the conversations outside the hall in fringe meetings on beaches in pubs either side of the karaoke activists love microphones no one knows why will revolve around it The Love Corbyn Hate Brexit tote bags will have been updated Remain Reform Revolt on one side and optimistically Labour can stop Brexit on the other there will be no shortage of views as to how  Labour is with or without Jo Swinson s missteps plainly the party of remain in its membership and its voters in its stated policy of backing a second referendum in most of its MPs and the bulk of its shadow cabinet in its visceral reaction to Boris Johnson and his crash and burn fantasies Yet the leadership is still clinging to the dated electoral calculation that it can only win if they pick up votes from both leavers and remainers and the idea that it is possible if you re clever enough to simultaneously support both outcomes 
SEP17	White, male and middle class: why Britain’s political parties must change	Regardless of the recent endless political convulsions and intrigue one thing is certain party conference season is going ahead as usual  Whether that s a cause for celebration among the MPs and journalists schlepping to events in Bournemouth Brighton Manchester Newport and Aberdeen in quick succession remains to be seen 
SEP17	For Palestinians, Israel’s elections promise nothing but defeat	When Boris Johnson announced his plan to suspend parliament I was visiting Orkney with my wife Penny It was the last week of a month long stay in Scotland and it took a day for the news to reach us We were having tea with some English friends on August when they heard what had happened They began to fume he s done it again They worried how this would undermine their country s democracy It was a curious twist I am usually the one bearing bad news about the state of my country For a brief moment we traded anxieties although mine were of a more existential nature Even in Scotland the bad news from home was constant the expansion of Israeli settlements the threat of annexation and the steady tally of death and injury in Gaza all eating away at what remained of my Palestine  A few days later just after Johnson had expelled MPs from his party we flew home The driver who picked us up from the airport took the usual circuitous route to get us to Ramallah crossing three checkpoints on the way At each one we held our breath and hoped the soldiers were not in a bad mood As always I felt the shock of returning home seeing our parched hills at the end of summer and my noisy crowded city I had a sudden and pervasive sense of precariousness 
SEP17	Swinson’s remain extremism has given Labour a golden opportunity	Brexit is the disrupter that breaks things and shape shifts as it scythes through the political life of the nation Look at its unexpected landing zone this week after the Liberal Democrat conference The Tories and the Lib Dems have adopted two startlingly extreme positions Boris Johnson heading for no deal damn the consequences versus Jo Swinson s revoke now to hell with the will of the people Both stands are alarming one ignoring the economic fate of the nation the other risking riots over the denial of democracy  Suddenly Labour is the moderate thoughtful one only another referendum has the authority to abandon or confirm the decision of the first after three years of hellish impasse If Swinson was trying to position the Lib Dems midway between the extremes of Hulk Johnson and Corbynism her revoke blunder takes her party out on another distant limb Her abrasive rejection of ever working with Jeremy Corbyn is another error her better role should be as enabler bringer together a progressive alliance Caroline Lucas does that tone well 
SEP17	The beauty of a Green New Deal is that it would pay for itself	In September as credit was crunched and the financial crisis began to unfold a group of economists and environmentalists including the future Green party MP Caroline Lucas met regularly in my small London flat Supping on comfort food and wine we argued furiously while drafting a plan we hoped would transform the economy and protect the ecosystem We called it the Green New Deal Little did we know that the ideas we seeded then would be adopted by a shooting star of the Democratic party Alexandria Ocasio Cortez as part of her bid for a New York congressional seat in  Fast forward to and the Green New Deal is now at the centre of the US presidential campaign Bernie Sanders last week declared the climate crisis a national emergency and launched his version of the deal a trillion plan that includes massive investment in renewable energy green infrastructure for climate resilience and money for research 
SEP17	The populist rewriting of Polish history is a warning to us all	Populists treat the past like fast food they go straight for what s tasty and comforting for them leaving aside the bits that might be healthier and more nutritious for all But the honest study of history is not about making you feel good Take the case of the second world war and how years after the invasion of Poland a dispute in Gda sk over a museum about the war is playing out  The populists in Poland s ruling Law and Justice PiS party have meddled so much in redrafting the narrative conveyed both by the museum and its main exhibition that four Polish historians involved with the institution s creation and launch have been left with little choice but to go to court 
SEP17	The world ignored the warning signs – and now the Middle East is on the brink	Like a furious maelstrom roiled by opposing currents the crisis in the Gulf gains in intensity and destructive power almost by the day On Sunday Donald Trump said the US was locked and loaded ready to respond to attacks on an oil facility in Saudi Arabia in which it believes Iran was involved But warning bells akin to those used to alert fog bound mariners steering towards rocks have been ringing out for months They have mostly been ignored The daunting bill for multiple acts of political insouciance measured in lives and petrodollars is now coming due  Trump is even trying to sell the Saudis nuclear technology What would you think were you in Iran s shoes 
SEP17	Inheritance tax would be scrapped by the Brexit party – good news for the very rich	There are bad ideas really bad ideas and there s abolishing inheritance tax This is the new top priority announced by the Brexit party one of only two policies it has beyond Brexit  Scrapping inheritance tax is a very expensive pledge it raised bn for the Treasury last year And it s particularly expensive when there s a political consensus that we need to spend more earlier this month a Conservative government set out proposals to increase the size of the state at the price of binning their fiscal rules 
SEP18	Will Corbyn’s Brexit referendum strategy work? Our panel responds	Neutral In mid national crisis how does a party campaign on the great issue of our time with a leader who won t say where he stands Everything about the idea is preposterous What do canvassers say on the doorstep We re a bit split and our leader refuses to say  Jeremy Corbyn in today s Guardian accuses Boris Johnson of backing no deal simply because it s politically expedient But Corbyn s fence sitting is no different No one expects straight dealing from Johnson double dealing is priced in But it s dangerous for Corbyn to flaunt callow political calculation Honesty is his USP What else was he doing all those wilderness back bench years voting against his own government times if not standing up for unpopular principle He was always a leaver remain voters will assume while leavers will not be convinced either by his umpire s disguise 
SEP18	If the world ran on sun, it wouldn’t fight over oil	We are sadly accustomed by now to the idea that our reliance on oil and gas causes random but predictable outbreaks of flood firestorm and drought The weekend s news from the Gulf is a grim reminder that depending on oil leads inevitably to war too  Depending on how far back you want to stand the possibility of war with Iran stems from a calculated decision by Tehran or its Houthi allies to use drones and missiles on Saudi installations or on the infantile rage that drove President Trump to tear up a meticulously worked out and globally sponsored accord with Iran and to wreck its economy But in either case if you really take in the whole picture the image is rendered in crude black tones were it not for oil none of this would be happening 
SEP18	Our quiet county has nothing against McDonald’s. But we prefer our own burgers	Rutland is a funny place When I moved back here five years ago and told my London friends where I was going the response was mostly Where A mere miles at its longest point it is England s smallest county Our motto is multum in parvo meaning much in little  Things we have little of are speed cameras a functioning mobile phone signal change and McDonald s we are the only county in England not to host a branch Or we were because Ronald s corporate gaze has finally swivelled in our direction The company has expressed a desire to set us on a par with all other counties submitting a planning application to build a freestanding restaurant with drive thru facility on a patch of empty ground just outside Oakham the county town This has ignited fires of rebellion in an area not known for hostility even our castle isn t a proper one There hasn t been a battle here since Empingham in unless you count some unpleasantness over our temporary loss of independence to neighbouring Leicestershire and we won that one too 
SEP18	Whatever Iran’s role in the Saudi attack, the regional status quo is unsustainable	Saturday s attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities at Abqaiq represent a potential tipping point in regional and international relations Although many questions remain and Iran has officially denied responsibility the likelihood of its involvement at some level is high Regardless of the precise details there is already a range of serious geopolitical implications to consider  If Tehran is responsible this clearly demonstrates that Iran s asymmetric military capabilities can pose a serious threat to the strategic interests of the west and its partners in the region Oil supply vulnerabilities are no longer limited to the Strait of Hormuz a vital waterway for exports and a repeated flashpoint over the years After all with this strike on a land based facility Saudi oil production reportedly dropped by about 
SEP18	How a parent’s bid to save their school exposes the rotten core of our democracy	Some defenders of democracy tog themselves up in suits joust over case law and star on the teatime news Others raise two boys single handedly in a market town in Essex carry a smartphone with a perma cracked screen and do their best work in the dead of the night when the kids have gone to bed and there s finally a bit of peace and quiet Like Shaunagh Roberts  Roberts doesn t hang out in courtrooms and can t quote Latin yet her battle shines as bright a light on our corroded politics as any case in the supreme court I ve been writing about it in these pages for over a year how she and an entire community are fighting this government and one of its central dogmas to save their local school And now we can exclusively reveal that in the past few days Roberts has forced the education secretary Gavin Williamson into a historic climbdown Her victory is to be celebrated even while it raises other profound questions about what kind of democracy we live in 
SEP18	Suddenly, it’s OK to be German and to talk about race	When I was growing up there was no racism in Germany In the s every child learned at school that race was a construct that fascists had used to justify segregating and killing people So if race didn t exist it naturally followed that racism didn t exist either If you wanted to talk about it people looked at you as if you were the Nazi  All this is changing It is dizzying to watch my motherland grapple with the concept of race And to be honest to grapple with it myself because when you stop speaking about something you stop thinking about it eventually too So we re all walking on eggshells the discussion about racism is on the agenda but we re whispering race as if it were a dirty word Except for members of Alternative f r Deutschland the far right party who keep pushing the boundaries of what you can and can t say and at every opportunity tout their worries about other races outbreeding white Germans Germans of colour meanwhile worry about the AfD s success in winning a quarter of the votes in recent state elections in Saxony and Brandenburg 
SEP18	The NHS saved Mum - but I saw a system on life support	A week ago the NHS saved my mum s life She had been prescribed some new blood pressure medication which caused her sodium levels to plummet dangerously Clinicians in A E ran blood tests identified the problem and treated it restoring the balance of minerals so that her sodium was once again coexisting in harmony with her potassium and the various other things floating around in the blood that we take for granted until something goes wrong with them The staff were without exception kind competent and respectful  So what s the problem My mum is the perfect case study for just how good the NHS is at saving lives and looking after older people But the bits in between the cement that glues the bricks is crumbling into dust And like the climate crisis this erosion is speeding up with disastrous consequences 
SEP18	Britons in Europe are being hung out to dry. In Luxembourg, they found their voice	If it was meant to highlight Boris Johnson s tendency to flee the consequences of his actions then the trick almost worked  The Luxembourg prime minister s decision to face the press with an empty podium where his British counterpart should have been rather than let him move their press conference away from noisy protesters has delivered the diplomatic burn that Xavier Bettel presumably intended But in truth it won t change anyone s mind

SEP19	The Tories are learning that Boris Johnson is electoral Marmite	Life is just too short Siobhan McArdle said to be a chief executive in the NHS right now In an unusually blunt resignation letter earlier this month the outgoing leader of the troubled South Tees hospitals foundation trust said her hospitals had delivered millions in so called efficiency savings but now the cupboard was bare The trust had already been severely criticised by regulators for a bed shortage that was hurting patients it couldn t she suggested keep cutting without care suffering It s rare for a hospital boss to throw in the towel so publicly but many in the NHS will understand where she was coming from  The number of patients waiting for NHS surgery is now at its highest since records began in One in NHS posts are lying vacant as staff quit and aren t replaced If we didn t have a winter crisis last year or not in the classic sense of patients piling up in corridors that s arguably because what was once an acute seasonal shortage of beds has become a chronic one rumbling all year long For months all this has rather puzzlingly failed to get much political traction But now thanks to the father of a very sick baby girl it has 
SEP19	There’s a side to Eton that you won’t read about in David Cameron’s memoirs	David Cameron publishes his memoirs today in which he looks back on his time at Eton college and back on the drug use that had he been from a different background might have landed him in jail Eton is proud of its political leaders This can be seen from the fact that in one of its most famous rooms you can find the bust of every student who has gone on to become prime minister Eton must ask itself though whether it is proud of the kind of leader that it is producing It must also ponder why if it truly sees itself as a school of leadership there are more and more people who regard it and similar institutions as utterly unfit for purpose  A few weeks ago like thousands of other people I shared a photo of Jacob Rees Mogg on social media The photo an image of him reclining in the House of Commons as he listened to his furious opponent in a debate about Brexit seemed to be the very image of entitlement At a time when the country s economy and social fabric were under unusual strain there was Rees Mogg apparently revelling in the bedlam 
SEP19	For the sake of life on Earth, we must put a limit on wealth	It is not quite true that behind every great fortune lies a great crime Musicians and novelists for example can become extremely rich by giving other people pleasure But it does appear to be universally true that in front of every great fortune lies a great crime Immense wealth translates automatically into immense environmental impacts regardless of the intentions of those who possess it The very wealthy almost as a matter of definition are committing ecocide  A few weeks ago I received a letter from a worker at a British private airport I see things that really shouldn t be happening in he wrote Every day he sees Global jets Gulfstream G s and even Boeing s take off from the airport carrying a single passenger mostly flying to Russia and the US The private Boeing s built to take passengers are filled at the airport with around litres of fuel That s as much fossil energy as a small African town might use in a year 
SEP19	Thousands of rape victims are being denied justice. The CPS and police must do better	Crime statistics can often be lacklustre and impenetrable but in recent weeks they have painted a vivid and shocking picture of how our criminal justice system is letting down rape victims at every stage Today s new figures published by the Guardian which show that thousands of rape allegations have been recorded inaccurately by the police over the last four years are only the latest evidence that there are serious inconsistencies in how different police forces are handling rape allegations If reports of rape are being filtered out before any real investigation has taken place this not only raises huge concerns about how victims are being treated but increases the risk that rapists are going unpunished free to rape again  The latest figures from the Crown Prosecution Service CPS published last week show that despite a significant increase in the number of rapes being reported each year there has been a terrifying drop in the number of alleged perpetrators being prosecuted This situation is prompting victims groups to argue that rape is being effectively decriminalised by the very people upon whom victims rely to enforce the law because so few cases are actually taken to court This year from reports of rape only accused perpetrators were even charged with an offence let alone convicted which raises the question of what on earth the criminal justice agencies are doing 
SEP19	The climate crisis isn’t just causing extreme weather. It’s fuelling extreme politics, too	In the past three weeks we took the pulse of citizens in eight countries in the Americas and western Europe whose governments will prove critically important to global efforts to tackle the climate emergency  Our findings were unambiguous tackling climate breakdown was deemed the most important priority for government ahead of terrorism the economy and migration In all the countries except the US the majority of those surveyed said that the climate emergency was the number one issue and that governments had to do more 
SEP19	Poland wants its citizens to leave the UK. It should support those who call it home	In common with European countries and increasingly the UK itself Poland does not know quite what to make of Brexit  This is evident in the Polish ambassador Arkady Rzegocki s letter to his compatriots on Tuesday which reveals a conflict between the consular duty of care for Polish citizens amid the uncertainties of the protracted Brexit process and the political ambition of the Polish government to tempt back some of the Poles who have migrated to the UK 
SEP19	There is no longer any justification for private schools in Britain	A few years back I finished a PhD on how to tackle Britain s unequal life chances which among other measures included abolishing private schools Dusty academia seemed the home for this sort of proposal one that has long filled endless papers but never quite makes it off the page and into reality  That is no longer the case In a few days the Labour party will debate the future of private schools The grassroots group Labour Against Private Schools Laps will bring a motion to the annual party conference in Brighton calling for the full integration of state and private schools including nationalising the endowments of the hugely wealthy public schools It has support from six constituency parties so far and the backing of senior party figures with the shadow chancellor John McDonnell putting his weight behind the motion this week A leaked memo to the Telegraph last week noted that the party is already considering making a manifesto pledge to remove tax breaks from the sector while leaving the door open to getting rid of the schools altogether 
SEP19	Unbelievable – at last, a rape drama that gives victims a voice	When Cersei Lannister was raped by her brother Jaime next to the corpse of their dead son in the fourth season of Game of Thrones even longstanding viewers inured to the scenes of sexual violence in the series found cause for concern  In the book by George RR Martin the scene had been consensual but in the dramatised version a weeping Cersei says no and tries to push her brother off The episode s director Alex Graves shrugged off criticism When asked if the scene constituted rape he said Yes and no There are moments where she gives in and moments where she pushes him away It s typical of the attitude often taken by film makers that if it serves the plot in this case to remind us of Jaime s ruthless streak then sexual violence is justifiable

SEP19	This election should be about much more than just Brexit	The Brexit debacle is an obnoxious man following you everywhere clashing cymbals that drown out anything you say or think Don t try to speak louder he ll just clash them harder But if a Brexit election is upon us one entirely and narrowly framed by Britain s relationship with the European Union then our current turmoil is merely the appetiser for much worse to come That is the plan of Boris Johnson s unelected co prime minister Dominic Cummings sweep up the Brexit party vote drown out a Labour domestic agenda that proved popular in and fragment the anti Tory vote with the willing assistance of the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson  There are those who treat the Brexit crisis as though it has landed from a clear blue sky many were jelly kneed at the admirable Olympics opening ceremony claiming that it represented as former New Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell put it a Britain that was modern vibrant dynamic outward looking multicultural confident welcoming successful united It was no such thing the Tory Lib Dem government was busy offloading the costs of a crash caused by big finance on to the backs of those who had nothing to do with it slashing and privatising services scapegoating migrants two months before Windrush Britons were valorised in the thanksgiving ceremony the hostile environment immigration policy had been introduced and ravaging the welfare state But the Brexit result produced one consensus that it could not be understood without examining what Theresa May termed the burning injustices 
SEP20	Climate change is morally wrong. It is time for a carbon abolition movement	Human induced climate change is a moral wrong It involves one group of humans harming others People of this generation harming those in future generations People in the developed world harming those in the developing world Each of us is emitting carbon that is harming those caught in climate driven superstorms floods droughts and conflicts And there s the greatest moral wrong of all the mass extinction event we have triggered that harms all life on Earth  Yet until recently climate change has not been argued as a moral issue Rather it has been presented as a technocratic problem a cost benefit problem where the costs of action must be weighed against the benefits of avoiding disaster The debates have been around taxes jobs growth and technologies While such debates are important there are better and worse ways to tackle the climate crisis the effect has been decades of inaction denial and delay When something is a moral wrong particularly a deep systemic moral wrong we don t wait around debating the optimal path or policy we stop it 
SEP20	I’m a young climate striker – and here’s why Labour must adopt a Green New Deal	For the first time in my life climate breakdown is high up on the UK s political agenda The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report the Amazon fires and the hottest day on record in the UK have meant we can no longer ignore the fate of the planet we live on  But there s another reason we re talking about the climate crisis For the past six months young people like myself have taken to the streets month after month calling for urgent climate action and demanding an internationalist Green New Deal an immediate change to the cataclysmic system that created enabled and perpetuates the climate crisis 
SEP20	Boris Johnson has to deliver a Brexit deal. And now he may be on track to do it	The good ship Brexit surges forward jagged rocks and whirlpools on all sides Non papers are on the table The president of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker says We can have a deal The French and the Finns have given Boris Johnson until the end of the month to show if his deal exists He wants to wait until after the Tory conference in two weeks or even until the EU summit in four What on earth is going on  I still believe Johnson is on track to pull off a coup He has an obvious problem but with an obvious solution Earlier this year he promised to leave the EU by October do or die no ifs or buts This pledge was for no other purpose but to win the Tory leadership It worked Given his reputation as a liar he really has no alternative but to deliver Yet he needs help from Brussels Otherwise he must endure the humiliation of a further Brexit delay 
SEP20	No We Can’t? How liberal pessimism could return Trump to the White House	Elizabeth Warren was in New York this week on the stump in front of large crowds in Washington Square Park The contender for the Democratic party presidential nomination talked about corruption in the White House and the need for sweeping dramatic change she repeated her proposal if elected to impose a tax on the country s highest earners and she namechecked an early th century labour movement spearheaded by women After the rally people stood in line for an hour to take photos with her All of which invited only one possible response I think Donald Trump s going to win  Electoral pessimism on the left in the United States is a finely balanced game that depending on your view acts either as a check to complacency or a self defeating hedge that guarantees the very result it s seeking to avoid For many predicting a second term for Trump goes back to the experience of watching George W Bush win a second election when John Kerry was a strong favourite Hope is all well and good but what about superstition 
SEP20	Today’s sex workers, like their Victorian sisters, don’t want ‘saving’	On Tuesday Sheffield council s licensing committee voted to renew the licence of the Spearmint Rhino lap dancing club until next April Lap dancing clubs in the UK are legally required to reapply for their licence and the city s Spearmint Rhino has been successful in doing so every year since it opened in But this year what is usually a routine procedure became a lightning rod for highly charged debates around sex work and feminism  Over the past months the Spearmint Rhino has been the target of a coalition of feminist groups who have campaigned against its licence being renewed on the grounds that strip clubs sexually objectify women and act as a prostitution grooming ground for vulnerable young women 
SEP20	The west’s self-proclaimed custodians of democracy failed to notice it rotting away	Anglo American lamentations about the state of democracy have been especially loud ever since Boris Johnson joined Donald Trump in the leadership of the free world For a very long time Britain and the United States styled themselves as the custodians and promoters of democracy globally fighting a great moral battle against its foreign enemies From the cold war through to the war on terror the Caesarism that afflicted other nations was seen as peculiar to Asian and African peoples or blamed on the despotic traditions of Russians or Chinese on African tribalism Islam or the Arab mind  But this analysis amplified in a thousand books and opinion columns that located the enemies of democracy among menacingly alien people and their inferior cultures did not prepare its audience for the sight of blond bullies perched atop the world s greatest democracies The barbarians it turns out were never at the gate they have been ruling us for some time 
SEP20	It’s taken years, but at last there’s real hope for meaningful climate action	It s been more than years in the making and is the top demand of the youth strikers gathering on Friday for the UK s largest ever climate protest which is why Friday is also the first attempt in Britain to put legislation in place to make a Green New Deal a reality for our country Working with the Labour MP Clive Lewis I am launching the full version of a Green New Deal bill formal title the decarbonisation and economic strategy bill which sets out a transformative programme driven by the principles of justice and equity It aims to move our economy away from its harmful dependence on carbon at the scale and speed demanded by the science and to build a society that lives within its ecological limits while reversing social and economic inequality  Our country needs investment and a worker led just transition Too many areas have been all but abandoned by Westminster over the past years industries shut down with nothing to replace the jobs lost people ignored and disempowered I m struck by the opportunities our country is missing compared with the bold action taken by others In Spain for example the closure of the coalmines comes with a m investment package agreed with the unions which includes environmental restoration of mining areas and reskilling of miners for green industries UK workers want to be part of the sustainability revolution and we are denying them the chance 
SEP20	Facial recognition technology threatens to end all individual privacy	The pernicious growth of the surveillance state continues with the imminent rollout of live facial recognition cameras across Britain That is why this week I signed a statement alongside a cross party group of MPs experts and civil liberties campaigners calling for a halt to facial recognition trials to give parliament the chance to debate it properly There is a point at which crime fighting measures cease to challenge the guilty and become a threat to the innocent That point has come with unfettered facial recognition  Over the past few years six forces including the Metropolitan police have trialled facial recognition with spectacularly poor results After surveilling hundreds of thousands of people the Met has made a mere handful of arrests using this technology in the past four years Indeed of the suspects caught by the cameras were simply innocent bystanders not on the police s watchlists Two of the trials even had an error rate of 
SEP20	It’s no surprise a woman was the first to swim the Channel four times	On Tuesday morning year old Sarah Thomas from Colorado US became the first person to swim the Channel four times without stopping In just over hours of swimming and miles she redefined what an endurance athlete could be for a generation until this week only four swimmers had ever managed to make the journey three times without stopping At an age when most of us are thinking about how little exercise we can get away with and only a year after going into remission from breast cancer she completed the feat with minimal fuss emerging to a treat of champagne and M M s with the comment I m pretty tired right now Rather more tartly her mother called her a freak of nature  But those of us who follow outdoor swimming will understand that it isn t actually that surprising that it was a woman who accomplished something so dramatic Because women have been quietly dominating outdoor endurance swimming for some time now A combination of obvious and not so obvious factors currently means that across average times of male and female Channel crossings the average female time is faster than men s 
SEP20	The polling industry doesn’t measure public opinion – it produces it	The polls keep coming one after another But the polls are all over the place For example they can t agree on where the competing parties stand One gives the Tories a point lead another gives Labour a lead Polling has never been an exact science but political volatility the growth of new polling firms and the extraordinary ubiquity of conflicting polls has put it under new strains and new scrutiny  Polling was once a specialised sector of market research Now it is a niche area of the much bigger data industry using the same Bayesian techniques of probabilistic analysis that stock markets employ in financial forecasting Its customers include huge financial firms that can extract commercial advantage from the slightest margin of predictive accuracy 
SEP21	For authoritarians, stifling the arts is of a piece with demonising minorities	Early this month Brazil s leading literary event the Bienal do Livro Rio found itself at the centre of the country s culture wars when a comic book was ordered to be confiscated by the authorities The book in question was Avengers The Children s Crusade which in one scene showed two fully clothed men kissing The gay kiss so upset Rio s mayor Marcelo Crivella who once called homosexuality a terrible evil that he ordered the book to be removed by police in order to protect children  Crivella a former bishop belongs to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God which is known for its statements that homosexuals and bisexuals are possessed by a female devil Crivella has also argued that Hindus hold unclean spirits and Catholics are demonic The evangelical organisation has hundreds of branches and is one of the major forces behind the electoral success of the country s far right president Jair Bolsonaro The church s founder the billionaire Edir Macedo by far Brazil s richest pastor according to Forbes magazine claims that prostitutes homosexuals and bisexuals are always possessed by pombagiras Afro Brazilian spirits associated with witchcraft 
SEP21	Baby Anoush offers a modish twist to past experiments in childrearing	Regardless of their reasoning the very ambition of the gender neutral experiment embarked upon by parents Hobbit Humphrey and Jake England Johns surely deserves some sort of recognition  As they have explained in a much studied BBC interview the parents of an adorable month old called Anoush have already taken gender neutrality far beyond anything usually practised by enlightened carers and educators Where less enterprising parents have rested their gender neutral free hopes in for instance the liberating avoidance of stereotypical toys and clothing and of traditionally girl boy activities and endearments England Johns and Humphrey not only shun sex identifying pronouns on behalf of their infant but conceal his or her biological sex from family members 
SEP21	The Queen above politics? Not when Cameron and Johnson come calling	The Queen is a sham head of state She cannot act as a constitutional president and force rival politicians to look for ways out of a national emergency She cannot insist that the prime minister obeys the rules because there are too few rules in Britain and too many woozy unenforceable conventions  Elizabeth II s strength came from being above politics Now even that pose how can a head of state be above politics has been exposed as Buckingham Palace s displeasure and annoyance at David Cameron reveals It is not angry because he dragged the Queen into politics but because he revealed that she happily got stuck in without the need for dragging 
SEP21	Justin Trudeau – not so much racist as slight and ineffectual	As a Canadian living in Britain I m pretty sure nobody on either side of the Atlantic really believes Justin Trudeau is a racist Certainly not an afro wig wearing Banana Boat singing face blacking one Though admittedly he did do all those racist things and possibly more it s hard to know because he says he can t remember  If we know one thing about Trudeau it s that he loves people all people Especially racialised Canadians as he now calls them using the parlance of the day Trudeau admires people of colour so much that when he found himself at a party dressed as Aladdin he was happy to throw his arms around two genuinely racialised Canadians and grin boldly for the camera 
SEP21	Insights... efficiency is fine, but happiness at work is another kettle of fish	We are having a productivity crisis More of us are working but since the crash we ve made almost no progress in getting more out of each hour In part that s why we ve had the longest pay squeeze in two centuries But what affects our productivity An answer has come from an unlikely source fishmongers in Vietnam And those of a sociable disposition are not going to like it  Many economists recognise the benefits of having similar companies in proximity The story goes that clusters of particular types of businesses lead to higher productivity because people learn from each other But does this apply to proximity of workers within a firm Not so much is the answer from intriguing research by the University of Hong Kong The author took a seafood processing plant in Vietnam and compared how many kilograms of fish were filleted when people were randomly allocated work stations as against choosing their neighbours Ten per cent more fish were gutted when people were randomly allocated and less able to chat to their mates But before employers start segregating staff it s worth noting that people like to chat the study found that workers would forgo nearly of their wages to work around friends 
SEP21	We MPs know that Boris Johnson’s rhetoric is dangerous and divisive	As members of parliament we have borne witness to a change in the way in which politics is conducted in this country that deeply concerns us  Of course politics can involve heated debate and there is no doubt that we have both been involved in fiery and impassioned exchanges over the course of our political lives Politics involves important decisions that can have life changing impacts and it is unsurprising that such debates and discussions involve emotion on the part of those involved 
SEP21	The Mean Girls have had their day. Welcome to the new Machiavellians	Fifteen years after the release of Tina Fey s cult film Mean Girls where Lindsay Lohan s central character battled her peers the all powerful Plastics is it time to move on from the Mean Girls caricature  Researchers at Florida Atlantic University found that far from being ostracised Mean Girl types are the most popular social group FAU followed more than pupils aged around for two years placing popular adolescents into three categories prosocial outgoing popular aggressive popular and the bistrategic popular or Machiavellian with this latter group noted for being feared and loved All very intriguing and it s good to see the Machiavellian label covering both sexes perhaps finally putting the Mean Girl where she belongs on a dusty shelf with other oversold pop culture relics 
SEP21	Even bankers are starting to think Corbyn might be the safe choice now	Beneath all the noise of Brexit an unexpected question is being quietly asked in British politics as an election nears Is a Jeremy Corbyn government actually the safe option If you ve been persuaded by the years of warnings from most of the media and countless politicians that such a government would be extreme chaotic authoritarian and doomed to failure you may find this question ridiculous If you re still a Corbynista then the notion of him as a stabilising premier for today s turbulent Britain may be equally absurd For many believers the whole point of Corbynism has been the possibility that it might lead to the most radical government in British history as the leftwing theorist and activist Jeremy Gilbert yearningly put it in  Yet people in unexpected places are starting to consider a Corbyn government less risky than the alternatives Earlier this month Oliver Harvey an analyst for Deutsche Bank in the City of London told the Telegraph We see the magnitude of economic damage caused by a no deal Brexit as much higher than that caused by policies proposed in the last Labour manifesto In the same article Christian Schulz an analyst for Citibank noted approvingly that Labour has become more decisively pro EU while a fiscally profligate no deal Conservative government had become less enticing 
SEP21	Rape victims should not be forced to hand over their phones. It feels like more abuse	As someone who has supported and advocated for survivors of sexual abuse within the criminal justice system for more than years I have witnessed how victims of rape and sexual abuse have become subject to digital strip searches Since the collapse of a small number of high profile rape trials due to failures in disclosure of digital evidence it has become routine for the police to require victims to grant them access to their mobile phone and other digital data in order to take the case forward  My job as an independent sexual violence adviser is to provide support and guidance to anyone reporting rape or sexual abuse as they make their way through the criminal justice system In the last couple of years we have witnessed a very worrying escalation in digital disclosure requests by the police 
SEP21	The language of Brexit ‘betrayal’ is poisoning politics	For a few weeks it was all going well for the so called remain alliance As Boris Johnson strained every sinew to facilitate the most damaging Brexit possible bitter opponents Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson teamed up with other party leaders to force in law a request to extend the process They then agreed not to sanction an early election against Corbyn s natural instinct and arguably his party s immediate interests And then the truce broke  No sooner had parliament been prorogued than the centre and left parties forgot they were meant to be working together against a near existential threat The old rivalry resumed in earnest Labour denounced the Liberal Democrats for their new extreme policy of seeking to revoke article without a referendum Swinson accused Corbyn of betraying remain voters for not personally committing to remain in a referendum 
SEP22	Forget Brexit. The new battle is over Jeremy Corbyn’s successor	Labour is a remain party Sadiq Khan London s mayor said on Saturday night to a room in Brighton that exploded Emily Thornberry arrived at the People s Vote rally wearing a blue top with a necklace of golden stars calling for Labour to become the party of remain Keir Starmer John McDonnell Diane Abbott Clive Lewis Tom Watson all of the high ranking members of the shadow cabinet are openly remain Some of constituency Labour party motions on Brexit call for the party to campaign unambiguously for remain It has the features of a showdown not between the leadership and the members but between a very tight inner circle which no longer even includes McDonnell the shadow chancellor and everybody else But atmospherically it feels more like an ultimatum delivered in a rocky relationship Do this or I ll leave is never the starting point of the row or even its apex By the time that person says it and means it the balance of power has already shifted  Jeremy Corbyn must be wishing there was some way he could prorogue his own conference maybe get the Queen involved He appeared on the BBC s Andrew Marr show on Sunday morning categorically giving Labour s Brexit stance before conference had even discussed it That position was both trenchant and incredibly confusing First there would be a general election in which Labour would triumph that hypothesis Corbyn was happy to discuss and build plans around Then he would renegotiate a deal with the EU according to five pillars then he d take that deal set against remain to the country for a people s vote Which side he would support himself he couldn t possibly guess he told Marr because it was a hypothesis Labour meanwhile wouldn t decide its final position until a special conference even though it is in the middle of its annual conference 
SEP22	Saudi Arabia won’t attack Iran. But it may pay someone else to	There is a longstanding joke told in the Middle East about Saudi Arabia s reluctance to fight its own wars Saudi Arabia will fight until the last Pakistani the punchline goes in reference to the fact that Pakistani troops have long supported Saudi s military endeavours  The punchline has expanded lately to include the Sudanese a recent addition to the Saudi army s ground troops Saudi Arabia is accustomed to buying labour that it deems too menial for its citizens and it extends that philosophy to its army 
SEP22	She holds the key to the Brexit deadlock. But will Arlene Foster dare use it?	You may not realise it but Arlene Foster is one of the most powerful politicians in contemporary Europe In the bizarre and tumultuous state of British politics this fact is one that will stand among the most historically significant It is an extraordinary situation Foster is a member of a regional legislative assembly that hasn t sat for nearly days the leader of a party with just MPs and the subject of an inquiry that may well see the end of her political career within weeks  But at this time she holds the key to Brexit And the stability of the pound the constitution of the UK the size of the European Union and the future of the continent are in no small way affected by her decisions 
SEP22	Suffering is not relative	A Guardian editorial online last Sunday was prompted by the imminent appearance of the memoir of a former UK prime minister David Cameron Its overarching assertion was that privileged people do not govern the UK well Its theme was that because Cameron came from a privileged background he lacked empathy for the people who suffered as a result of policies he pursued when in office between May and July A theme like that could generate strong views pro and con many editorials do It could involve a harsh character analysis public figures must expect that  The way the editorial initially elaborated its theme was woefully misjudged I am personally completely devastated that it was ever published in any form in the Guardian and that we caused distress to so many people the editor in chief Katharine Viner told me in one of our exchanges about what had happened 
SEP22	Tiny changes might seem insignificant. But they are how we save the planet	There is a celebrated line in Jared Diamond s Collapse How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive his bestselling study of ecocide and sudden social implosion Referring to the self inflicted environmental damage on Easter Island by deforestation Diamond asked What did the Easter islander who cut down the last palm tree say while he was doing it  While there has been much academic controversy about the accuracy of his shorthand for what happened on Easter Island what remains however is a powerful and affecting metaphor one ever more resonant in the midst of the escalating global climate emergency 
SEP22	What is it about Britain that has produced such a litany of failed leaders?	Britain faces a crisis of political leadership Neither the right nor the left of politics is capable of throwing up a figure who can bind their respective coalitions together and sustain parliamentary majorities best to navigate Brexit or Remain and their aftermath  Faith in parliamentary democracy is plummeting belief in strongman politics is rising the view that there is an elite of which the political class is a member intent only on feathering its own nest and pursuing its own sectarian interests is widespread 
SEP22	The failed Watson plot exposes what really scares Corbyn and his coterie	On the eve of the Labour conference a poll was published that gave Jeremy Corbyn a negative personal approval rating of minus points yes you read that right minus points These are depths of unpopularity never plumbed by any opposition leader in the more than years that pollsters have been recording this figure Even Michael Foot wasn t that disliked by the British public in the run up to Labour s landslide defeat at the hands of Margaret Thatcher in To have a candidate for prime minister who is that repellent to the country is a problem for Labour especially when it is facing a general election To Mr Corbyn s allies the answer is obvious the deputy s head must roll  The plot to oust Tom Watson by abolishing his post ought to be shocking and yet it is not that surprising to anyone who has been paying attention to the Labour party since it came under the control of Mr Corbyn and his friends 
SEP22	Boris Johnson’s confrontation: don’t lose sight of the real story	 The problem with politicians and political activists is that they are trapped in their own little bubbles If there s one complaint that defines our age it s the accusation that those involved in politics are too removed from real people The trouble is when political activists show that they have the same concerns as everybody else the complaint gets turned on its head But that s not a real person that s a political activist  So it was with the confrontation last week between Boris Johnson and Omar Salem the father of a sick child at Whipps Cross university hospital in London Much of the debate about the confrontation has been less about Johnson or the state of the NHS than about Salem being a Labour party activist 
SEP22	For authoritarians, stifling the arts is of a piece with demonising minorities	Early this month Brazil s leading literary event the Bienal do Livro Rio found itself at the centre of the country s culture wars when a comic book was ordered to be confiscated by the authorities The book in question was Avengers The Children s Crusade which in one scene showed two fully clothed men kissing The gay kiss so upset Rio s mayor Marcelo Crivella who once called homosexuality a terrible evil that he ordered the book to be removed by police in order to protect children  Crivella a former bishop belongs to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God which is known for its statements that homosexuals and bisexuals are possessed by a female devil Crivella has also argued that Hindus hold unclean spirits and Catholics are demonic The evangelical organisation has hundreds of branches and is one of the major forces behind the electoral success of the country s far right president Jair Bolsonaro The church s founder the billionaire Edir Macedo by far Brazil s richest pastor according to Forbes magazine claims that prostitutes homosexuals and bisexuals are always possessed by pombagiras Afro Brazilian spirits associated with witchcraft 
SEP22	Baby Anoush offers a modish twist to past experiments in childrearing	Regardless of their reasoning the very ambition of the gender neutral experiment embarked upon by parents Hobbit Humphrey and Jake England Johns surely deserves some sort of recognition  As they have explained in a much studied BBC interview the parents of an adorable month old called Anoush have already taken gender neutrality far beyond anything usually practised by enlightened carers and educators Where less enterprising parents have rested their gender neutral free hopes in for instance the liberating avoidance of stereotypical toys and clothing and of traditionally girl boy activities and endearments England Johns and Humphrey not only shun sex identifying pronouns on behalf of their infant but conceal his or her biological sex from family members 
SEP23	Labour has let the fight over Brexit distract it from defeating the Tories	The best and the worst of Labour are locked in mortal combat at their conference less left and right more the admirable and the despicable often tussling within the souls of the very same players This can be a detestable party yet in its next breath the most uplifting a soaring then plummeting rollercoaster to observe  Admirable visions of all that could be under a Labour government were spelled out in John McDonnell s radical stream of policies to make bad working lives better Some working conditions have reverted to brutish pre union days the care workers delivery drivers warehouse pickers overworked and underpaid Ken Loach s latest harrowing horror movie Sorry We Missed You previewed here is a heartrending depiction of the working wrongs that McDonnell addresses Shorter working hours and better pay are only part of Labour s intent to shift the share of income power and wealth at least back to where it was years ago Labour s Green New Deal is a double win decarbonising energy insulating homes and bringing green industries to areas in most need of good jobs From speech to speech on offer are remedies for the decade of stagnant wages 
SEP23	This election will transform Britain – its impact will last decades	With an imminent general election both the main political parties are riven by rows over Brexit and how tough a line to take Yet the lesson of the last election in was that the public gets to choose which issues really matter not the politicians and politicians forget at their peril that elections are about issues that are as broad as life itself And this forthcoming vote could well be much more consequential than the last one not just wider than Brexit but bigger than it too  Brexit itself is merely the prism through which a much larger contest has been refracted Over the past few years the Brexit debate has shifted away from the question of whether the UK would secure a good deal or a bad deal from the European Union as if we were haggling over the price of a secondhand car towards a more isolationist impulse Now the Brexiters argue we should walk away with a clean break 
SEP23	If world leaders choose to fail us, my generation will never forgive them	This is all wrong I shouldn t be standing here I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean Yet you all come to me for hope How dare you You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words And yet I m one of the lucky ones People are suffering People are dying Entire ecosystems are collapsing We are in the beginning of a mass extinction And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth How dare you  For more than years the science has been crystal clear How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you are doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight 
SEP23	I thought I’d made it when I got to Cambridge University. How wrong I was	I ve always been a diligent worker Having had a part time in a fish and chip shop throughout my A levels I know what hard work means When I received my offer to study at Cambridge University I was congratulated by my colleagues for finally making it In the warm heat of June a few days before my last exam I thought this would be the last time I would smell the fish in batter as it hit the sizzling oil I reflected on the idea that Cambridge meant I was finally competing on a level playing field with socially and economically privileged students  Within my first four days at university by which time tickets had already sold out for the winter ball I realised this was not the case Around me students effortlessly parted with well over for that one night out I could only struggle to do the same so I applied to work for half of the ball in order to enjoy the other half for free It soon dawned on me that for a working class student a Cambridge education did not give me equal status 
SEP23	Labour is finally reaching out to minority voters to help shape policy	The Jeremy Corbyn project wants to hear from people within minority communities across Britain At last Speaking at the Labour party s annual conference in Brighton Dawn Butler the shadow women and equalities secretary said I need help with my race and faith manifesto and asked for ideas The plan is for nationwide listening events with ethnic minority groups intended to help shape party policy  And Labour wants to get the ball rolling with issues ranging from political representation to making public services more inclusive as well as examining the legacy of slavery colonialism and empire Butler said a better understanding of this British history was a vital component in the fight against the far right which she added was the fastest growing terrorist threat in the UK Her words are backed up by the police In figures showed that hate crimes had more than doubled in the past five years And earlier this year a leading children s charity found that children were whitening their skin to avoid this terrifying increase in racial abuse 
SEP23	The Trump-Ukraine scandal is a taste of how dirty the US elections will get	America has a grand tradition of the brazenly dumb criminal the kind who is so desperately needy that he brags about his guilt  Back in the earliest days of the new media known as newspapers a certain Chicago mob boss rose to fame by calling a press conference to proclaim everyone else s guilt if not exactly his innocence 
SEP23	Britain’s common ground is lost. But there are glimmers of hope we can find it	 I ve given up watching the news said the man in the other room It s all lies  We were both in a hi fi shop in Bath me immersed in an arcane conversation about amplifiers while he asked for help with his internet enabled flatscreen television He was sixtysomething with the look of someone being endlessly annoyed by the world or what he saw of it These days he said all his information about current affairs came from online videos What I wondered was he watching Claims of faked bombings in Syria False warnings about the dangers of vaccines Or labyrinthine theories about the global cabal intent on stopping Brexit 
SEP23	Forget Brexit. The new battle is over Jeremy Corbyn’s successor	Labour is a remain party Sadiq Khan London s mayor said on Saturday night to a room in Brighton that exploded Emily Thornberry arrived at the People s Vote rally wearing a blue top with a necklace of golden stars calling for Labour to become the party of remain Keir Starmer John McDonnell Diane Abbott Clive Lewis Tom Watson all of the high ranking members of the shadow cabinet are openly remain Some of constituency Labour party motions on Brexit call for the party to campaign unambiguously for remain It has the features of a showdown not between the leadership and the members but between a very tight inner circle which no longer even includes McDonnell the shadow chancellor and everybody else But atmospherically it feels more like an ultimatum delivered in a rocky relationship Do this or I ll leave is never the starting point of the row or even its apex By the time that person says it and means it the balance of power has already shifted  Jeremy Corbyn must be wishing there was some way he could prorogue his own conference maybe get the Queen involved He appeared on the BBC s Andrew Marr show on Sunday morning categorically giving Labour s Brexit stance before conference had even discussed it That position was both trenchant and incredibly confusing First there would be a general election in which Labour would triumph that hypothesis Corbyn was happy to discuss and build plans around Then he would renegotiate a deal with the EU according to five pillars then he d take that deal set against remain to the country for a people s vote Which side he would support himself he couldn t possibly guess he told Marr because it was a hypothesis Labour meanwhile wouldn t decide its final position until a special conference even though it is in the middle of its annual conference 
SEP23	Corbyn has committed to a people’s vote, so why do remainers still attack him?	Essential to the success of any struggle is to recognise when you have won It is less than a year and a half since the People s Vote campaign was founded It has organised mass demonstrations rallies petitions its grassroots have leafleted chanted sung and often rather pointedly made themselves heard on social media Their demand was straightforward any Brexit deal negotiated with the EU should be subject to a confirmatory referendum with remain as the other option And that campaign has achieved a dramatic success compelling Labour to implement its policy if it wins an election Yet where are the triumphant declarations or the rightly triumphalist victory parties  Labour s leadership is savaged for inconsistency and zigzagging incomprehensibly as though it is unique or politically bankrupt in its attempt to manage drastically shifting sands and an ever more polarising culture war For those of us who campaigned for remain in the referendum there was a particular problem there was no mass movement on our side The official remain campaign was a dire corporate status quo outfit that did not understand and was institutionally incapable of relating to a deep well of disillusionment in British society 
SEP23	Saudi Arabia won’t attack Iran. But it may pay someone else to	There is a longstanding joke told in the Middle East about Saudi Arabia s reluctance to fight its own wars Saudi Arabia will fight until the last Pakistani the punchline goes in reference to the fact that Pakistani troops have long supported Saudi s military endeavours  The punchline has expanded lately to include the Sudanese a recent addition to the Saudi army s ground troops Saudi Arabia is accustomed to buying labour that it deems too menial for its citizens and it extends that philosophy to its army 
SEP24	The verdict is in: Boris Johnson is a liar. And he should pay the price	If Boris Johnson does nothing more his name in history is already inscribed as the man who lied so hard he nearly broke the constitution He certainly broke the law as definitively interpreted by the supreme court today Any leader with respect for the responsibilities that come with high office and capable of shame would immediately resign Nothing in Johnson s record suggests he is such a person He clambered to Downing Street over the wreckage of his own former beliefs ruined friendships and betrayed relationships He has never recognised the imperative of truth so takes no instruction from it now  The new pinnacle of Johnson s career as a peddler of falsehood is his claim that parliament s suspension earlier this month was procedural a conventional legislative reboot ahead of a Queen s speech to set out a new domestic agenda No one believed him His own ministers struggled to hold the line blurting out the true motive which was to limit MPs control over Brexit By unanimous verdict the country s most senior judges ruled that prorogation did indeed have the effect of preventing or frustrating the legislature in pursuit of its constitutional duties passing laws holding ministers to account and crucially representing the public in Commons debates The court noted that those functions were uniquely urgent given the proximity of the Brexit deadline The stymying deed had to be undone 
SEP24	The supreme court judgment is a devastating blow for a failed prime minister	The supreme court has delivered a comprehensive demolition of Boris Johnson s government and its handling of Brexit The unanimous judgment of the justices announced by Lady Hale this morning amounts to a root and branch rejection of the prime minister s attempts to rule without parliament to take Britain out of the European Union by October without a deal and to contrive a premature general election The judgment was incisive and without any waffle It was very consciously written in the best tradition of British constitutional law of which parliamentary sovereignty is the foundational rock  The immediate effect of the judgment is devastating for Johnson It is expressed so cogently and unambiguously that it will be difficult for him to wriggle out of it even though he is certainly foolish enough to try Parliament will surely be recalled on Tuesday since as the judgment said it has not been prorogued in the first place Johnson s efforts to the extent that they exist at all to negotiate a new or tweaked deal with the EU will be held up to the light And since Johnson spectacularly lacks a majority in the House of Commons it is likely that the cross party efforts to shape Brexit will be redoubled 
SEP24	The Gates Foundation shouldn’t legitimise Narendra Modi	It is one thing for a political leader to come to power in his country by exploiting the darkest nationalistic instincts of its electorate It is quite another thing for such a man to be awarded an international prize and embraced as a statesman by the most powerful and influential country in the world The former reflects a familiar and vexing paradox of democracy its deliberate subversion from within The latter is entirely gratuitous and speaks to the collapse of any sense of international political morality  The Gates Foundation has announced it is bestowing a prestigious annual award on prime minister Narendra Modi of India And in advance of the UN general assembly meeting in New York Donald Trump flew down to Houston Texas to welcome him at an event charmingly dubbed the Howdy Modi rally 
SEP24	Labour’s National Care Service should be for everyone, not just older people	On Monday John McDonnell set out Labour s new flagship policy on social care A Labour government would provide free personal care for people over who need help with washing dressing and eating and would invest an extra bn into adult social care over the next few years The shadow chancellor also pledged to end the use of zero hours contracts for care workers and ensure they are paid a real living wage including for time they spend travelling  As anyone who currently needs care or who has battled to get it for a loved one will know this is the sort of policy that will transform lives Governments have long neglected to find a long term solution for social care in the context of an ageing population and the crisis has spiralled during a decade of austerity Since bn has been cut from adult social care budgets in England leaving million people without the care they need This is affecting millions more as family carers largely women are forced to plug the gap left by the state That the Conservative s long promised green paper on social care is still MIA is emblematic of how those relying on the system have been forgotten 
SEP24	So parliament is returning. But what happens next?	In its ruling on Tuesday that the prime minister s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful void and of no effect the supreme court has decided that parliament was never actually suspended two weeks ago The clock is turned back to September the last day MPs sat So parliament will return but as prorogation did not take place it is not being recalled There will be no Queen s speech no new legislative agenda no state opening Business will resume But since this has never happened before this is not business as usual  A degree of improvisation and innovation with the government working with the opposition parties and Commons Speaker John Bercow will be required to map out the days and weeks ahead The government is expected to table a motion to secure a short conference recess If MPs reject this then the Conservative party conference in Manchester would take place while parliament sits an unusual and from Boris Johnson s point of view logistically unhelpful clash 
SEP24	Labour has let the fight over Brexit distract it from defeating the Tories	The best and the worst of Labour are locked in mortal combat at their conference less left and right more the admirable and the despicable often tussling within the souls of the very same players This can be a detestable party yet in its next breath the most uplifting a soaring then plummeting rollercoaster to observe  Admirable visions of all that could be under a Labour government were spelled out in John McDonnell s radical stream of policies to make bad working lives better Some working conditions have reverted to brutish pre union days the care workers delivery drivers warehouse pickers overworked and underpaid Ken Loach s latest harrowing horror movie Sorry We Missed You previewed here is a heartrending depiction of the working wrongs that McDonnell addresses Shorter working hours and better pay are only part of Labour s intent to shift the share of income power and wealth at least back to where it was years ago Labour s Green New Deal is a double win decarbonising energy insulating homes and bringing green industries to areas in most need of good jobs From speech to speech on offer are remedies for the decade of stagnant wages 
SEP24	Labour is right to target private school privilege – but abolition isn’t the only answer	Labour s general election gambit of declaring a so called class war on Britain s private schools is partly intended to distract from its own internecine struggles and Brexit woes  Delegates at the party s annual conference in Brighton on Sunday voted to abolish fee paying schools and redistribute their assets democratically and fairly for the benefit of all children 
SEP24	It's time to start impeachment proceedings against Trump	Donald Trump has a problem with elections Seemingly lacking confidence in his ability to win them through honest and untreasonable means he has repeatedly questioned the integrity of the American electoral system while seeking the help of foreign powers to tip the balance in his favor From suggesting he might not accept the results of an election based on the lie that millions of illegals are able to cast votes to openly welcoming the help of Russia in Trump has made it clear that he cannot be trusted to oversee the presidential election of  Sadly in the months following the fizzle which marked the end of the Mueller investigation this basic truth has slipped out of focus A coalition of Republicans for whom Trump can do no wrong Democratic lawmakers worried about the politics of impeachment and progressive commentators who claim that holding Trump accountable for his conduct is a distraction from the pocketbook issues which most concern voters has come together to urge the nation to move on 
SEP24	This election will transform Britain – its impact will last decades	With an imminent general election both the main political parties are riven by rows over Brexit and how tough a line to take Yet the lesson of the last election in was that the public gets to choose which issues really matter not the politicians and politicians forget at their peril that elections are about issues that are as broad as life itself And this forthcoming vote could well be much more consequential than the last one not just wider than Brexit but bigger than it too  Brexit itself is merely the prism through which a much larger contest has been refracted Over the past few years the Brexit debate has shifted away from the question of whether the UK would secure a good deal or a bad deal from the European Union as if we were haggling over the price of a secondhand car towards a more isolationist impulse Now the Brexiters argue we should walk away with a clean break 
SEP24	Jake Humm's death fills me with anger and despair – thousands like him are at risk	It is every parent s deepest fear that they might lose their child When that child is in supported living and supposedly being looked after losing them is not only a heartbreak it feels like a betrayal  The story of Jake Humm a talented young musician fills me with despair and anger not just because of his early and unnecessary death but because it appears there were so many warning signs of his deteriorating state and not enough done to protect him It is tragic that he was only discovered in his room by staff two days after his death 
SEP25	Johnson’s plan is to turn his supreme court humiliation into rocket fuel at the polls	An angry and disturbingly pumped up Boris Johnson s response to the court in the recalled House of Commons tonight was an act of total contempt for the courts for parliament and ultimately for public and political decency For the time being Johnson still retains much of the formal power of the prime minister But the role s inner power its moral authority the holder s ability to govern and his meaningful capacity to represent the country are practically shot There is nothing tragic about this for Johnson personally There is everything tragic for the country that never asked for him to become its leader  He can t blame the judges because he does not dare He likes to blame MPs because they are an easy target But the real blame lies with himself and the Tory hard leavers 
SEP25	Labour’s pledge to take on big pharma will save lives	Sixteen years ago I first saw the impact of pharmaceutical greed on people living with HIV in Tanzania In order to maintain their profits the companies that had developed effective medicines fought hard to prevent the sale of affordable generics So while those with the condition in the US and Europe were getting lifesaving treatment only a handful of the millions across Africa who needed it had access  Fast forward to and campaigning has resulted in HIV treatment prices dropping from tens of thousands of pounds a year for each patient to about and millions of people across the global south are alive today thanks to cheap quality assured generic medicines But the problem at the heart of the current model of pharmaceutical innovation has not gone away It is endangering the lives of patients in the UK and threatening the sustainability of health systems across the rich and poor worlds 
SEP25	Britain claims it protects girls from FGM. So why are we deporting them?	Today the family division of the high court ruled that it has no power to stop the home secretary from deporting a vulnerable girl at risk of female genital mutilation FGM to Bahrain or Sudan  Jasmine not her real name is years old As a barrister I have seen how the government s hostile immigration environment extends to refusing asylum claims on the basis of FGM leaving girls and women liable to deportation to countries where this practice is prevalent if not the norm The government claims it is committed to supporting victims of FGM and prosecuting perpetrators Yet when girls at risk of being cut claim asylum they are turned away 
SEP25	Like it or not, Boris Johnson still has two paths to election victory	It s the morning after Yesterday was a ball at least for remainers But it was like the Duchess of Richmond s ball before Waterloo now the real battle must commence The supreme court did not rewrite the UK s constitution on Tuesday it merely enforced the conventions of the existing one It reasserted Be ye never so high the law is above you though it cited no particular law rather the rule of law as interpreted by itself  The person who should be resigning is the Commons leader Jacob Rees Mogg for inducing the monarch to collude in a political device We can only imagine how pompously he would now be demanding resignation were the culprit not him 
SEP25	Political highlight of the week? Actually, it was Labour's carbon game-changer	The most significant political moment of the last decade happened on Tuesday afternoon not in the supreme court but on a packed floor of the Brighton Centre during Labour party conference Delegates overwhelmingly voted in favour of two motions backing a Green New Deal a programme that will decarbonise the UK through a radical policy package to increase social and economic justice One of the motions included a target for the UK to achieve net zero emissions by and one did not instead calling for the UK to act as a world leader on climate change and to establish a National Climate Service  The net zero emissions target now has a very real chance of being included in the Labour party manifesto Jim Pickard chief political correspondent for the Financial Times said the target was one of the most radical policies by a mainstream political party in my lifetime 
SEP25	Rewilding will make Britain a rainforest nation again	The forests still burn but the world now looks away In both the Amazon basin and the rainforests of Indonesia the world scorching inferno rages on already forgotten by most of the media Intricate living systems species that took millions of years to evolve are being incinerated in moments then replaced with monocultures Giant plumes of carbon tip us further into climate breakdown And we re not even talking about it  But underneath the grief and frustration I also feel disquiet We rightly call on other nations to protect their stunning places But where are our rainforests I mean this both metaphorically and literally Out of nations the UK ranks th for the intactness of its living systems Having trashed our own wildlife our excessive demand for meat animal feed timber minerals and fossil fuels helps lay waste the rest of the world 
SEP25	Ousting Netanyahu isn’t enough for Israel’s Palestinians. They want equality	In my hometown of Tira an Arab community in central Israel word spread on election day last week of many residents deciding to vote at the last minute During the campaign s final weeks families watched as the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched ferocious tirades about the threat of a leftist Arab government He told his followers the Arabs want to annihilate us all and that they were stealing the elections through rampant voter fraud his legislative attempts to place surveillance cameras at Arab polling stations failed to get through the Knesset  Tira s residents were no strangers to the prime minister s history of racist incitement but for many people his shocking escalations compelled a response If they couldn t stop him from winning they thought they would at least try to make his job as difficult as possible 
SEP25	Impeach Trump? The United States is now in uncharted waters	Nancy Pelosi the US House speaker might sympathize with the quote attributed to th century French politician Alexandre Auguste Ledru Rollin There go the people I must follow them for I am their leader  For months following the release of the Mueller report Pelosi had resisted pressure from within her caucus to begin impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump But now with more than two thirds of Democrats in the House of Representatives favoring impeachment in the wake of Trump s Ukrainian scandal she has reversed herself and announced a formal impeachment inquiry 
SEP25	The verdict is in: Boris Johnson is a liar. And he should pay the price	If Boris Johnson does nothing more his name in history is already inscribed as the man who lied so hard he nearly broke the constitution He certainly broke the law as definitively interpreted by the supreme court today Any leader with respect for the responsibilities that come with high office and capable of shame would immediately resign Nothing in Johnson s record suggests he is such a person He clambered to Downing Street over the wreckage of his own former beliefs ruined friendships and betrayed relationships He has never recognised the imperative of truth so takes no instruction from it now  The new pinnacle of Johnson s career as a peddler of falsehood is his claim that parliament s suspension earlier this month was procedural a conventional legislative reboot ahead of a Queen s speech to set out a new domestic agenda No one believed him His own ministers struggled to hold the line blurting out the true motive which was to limit MPs control over Brexit By unanimous verdict the country s most senior judges ruled that prorogation did indeed have the effect of preventing or frustrating the legislature in pursuit of its constitutional duties passing laws holding ministers to account and crucially representing the public in Commons debates The court noted that those functions were uniquely urgent given the proximity of the Brexit deadline The stymying deed had to be undone 
SEP25	Boris Johnson can’t keep dodging scrutiny about his past	If success was really all about who you know then Jennifer Arcuri might easily be a millionaire by now The American model turned tech entrepreneur was a friend of Boris Johnson back when he was London s mayor So good a friend apparently that he used to visit her at her Shoreditch flat so friendly that she reportedly managed to join a trade mission to New York led by Johnson despite not having been officially invited on the trip  The man whose number she stored in her mobile under Alex the Great to close friends he s Al or Alexander not Boris which is his middle name lent her kudos by coming to tech summits she organised She even reportedly used his name to approach the election campaign guru Lynton Crosby for a meeting But most alarmingly of all the Department for Culture Media and Sport is currently investigating exactly how a grant of in public money came to be awarded to her all told she won in grants and sponsorship money that for many people struggling to get a small business off the ground would be the stuff of dreams And that s where this story moves from the realms of gossip into far more serious questions about abuse of power and position 
SEP26	Tory moderates may have to fight to get their party back	If Boris Johnson is capable of shame then he should surely now be feeling it He has brought this country to the point where an election is genuinely to be feared no matter who wins because of the violence that may follow where MPs facing death threats will need all the courage they can muster just to go out campaigning and decent voters will switch off from the spite and hysteria surrounding them  It should go without saying that Johnson s dismissive response to the Labour MP Paula Sherriff when she challenged his deliberately provocative talk of surrender and betrayal over Brexit was awful Having listened in the past to Sherriff matter of factly describe the threats she has faced from the far right and the depressingly elaborate precautions so many of her colleagues must take just to go about their everyday life I too feel rage bubbling up at the idea that this was somehow faux concern But what if rage is what they want those determined to turn this next election into some kind of political hunger games For only when we are goaded beyond reason red mist descending at the slightest provocation can they get the reaction their divide and conquer strategy needs 
SEP26	Racism is not a legitimate standpoint. When will the BBC learn that?	Journalism tells us that if someone says it s drizzling outside and another that it s dry the job of the journalist is not to quote both but to find out which is true But this week the BBC upheld a complaint against the breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty for stating a truth as obvious as water is wet Munchetty was found to have breached the BBC s impartiality policy for her unscripted response to President Trump s tweets telling four congresswomen of colour to go back home Every time I have been told as a woman of colour to go back to where I came from that was embedded in racism She said she felt absolutely furious about it  The BBC s misguided response suggests that reacting to racism is worse than racism itself All I saw was another woman of colour calling out racist remarks for what they were and describing her own experiences The clear message sent by this ruling is that whether or not something is racist is purely subjective 
SEP26	Impeachment isn’t the answer to America’s political crisis	Donald Trump is facing impeachment and a single phone call seems to have tipped the balance During a conversation in July with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy he asked for help in the investigation of his likely opponent in Joe Biden whose son had business dealings in the country On Tuesday Nancy Pelosi announced that impeachment proceedings would finally begin  But the release of the conversation summary or memcon between Trump and Zelenskiy on Wednesday left things a little hazier than expected 
SEP26	The far right in Italy is blocked but not banished	In Matteo Renzi was Italy s most popular politician Pragmatic liberal minded still in his thirties he was a poster boy for the European establishment living breathing proof that the country had got its act together after the Silvio Berlusconi years  Then he became prime minister the youngest in Italy s history and it all fell apart In an attempt to dramatically extend the powers of his government Renzi called an ill judged constitutional referendum He was heavily defeated and forced to resign His fall from grace would prove fatal not only for his own reputation but for that of Italy s entire centre left 
SEP26	Spain has a democratic problem – the people have outgrown its political system	In November Spain will hold its fourth general election in four years Only five months have passed since the last election which had a turnout of more than the highest in years In an increasingly conservative Europe it was a rare election result that lifted progressive spirits Pedro S nchez s victorious Socialist Workers party looked as if it would almost certainly have to form a coalition government with Unidas Podemos the newer more leftwing party led by Pablo Iglesias But since the election in April the two have failed to reach an agreement In the end S nchez preferred to risk another election rather than rely on a party that would put pressure on him from the left  The negotiations have been a sad spectacle not least because the voters message in April had seemed so clear On the night of the socialists victory hundreds of ecstatic supporters outside the party s headquarters chanted anti fascist slogans and urged party leaders not to side with Ciudadanos a rightwing technocratic party They wanted a leftwing coalition and it looked like a done deal throughout the electoral campaign S nchez had claimed he would have no problem governing in coalition with Unidas Podemos 
SEP26	The struggle for equality is real. The ‘woke police’ are a myth	There s a lot of talk these days about new political tribes so allow me to introduce another one the anti woke The first curious thing to note about members of this group is that they define themselves in opposition to an identity that doesn t actually exist They are anti woke even though there is no woke  Woke a term once used by African Americans to denote people who were alert to racism and social injustice has been retired As is often the case with black innovations overuse by the white mainstream killed off its authenticity Today the person using the word is likely to be a rightwing culture warrior angry at a phenomenon that lives mainly in their imagination 
SEP26	For Labour's grassroots, a radical agenda is finally within reach	Labour s conference began as farce but culminated in a triumphant affirmation of the most radical incarnation of Corbynism yet The abortive attempt to remove the party s deputy leader Tom Watson enraged Jeremy Corbyn so much he broke with his near cardinal aversion to swearing and threatened to destabilise Labour s last major pre election opportunity to showcase its radical vision The supreme court s damning ruling against the prime minister reinvigorated morale and offered a necessary reminder of the frightening political stakes at hand but it was a democratic insurgency at the conference although sometimes colliding with old style machine politics that re energised a Labour grassroots preparing to march into an existential political battle  Rather than policies cooked up by unelected advisers and thinktank wonks the wisdom of members would be trusted instead
SEP26	Labour’s pledge to take on big pharma will save lives	Sixteen years ago I first saw the impact of pharmaceutical greed on people living with HIV in Tanzania In order to maintain their profits the companies that had developed effective medicines fought hard to prevent the sale of affordable generics So while those with the condition in the US and Europe were getting lifesaving treatment only a handful of the millions across Africa who needed it had access  Fast forward to and campaigning has resulted in HIV treatment prices dropping from tens of thousands of pounds a year for each patient to about and millions of people across the global south are alive today thanks to cheap quality assured generic medicines But the problem at the heart of the current model of pharmaceutical innovation has not gone away It is endangering the lives of patients in the UK and threatening the sustainability of health systems across the rich and poor worlds 
SEP26	Britain claims it protects girls from FGM. So why are we deporting them?	Today the family division of the high court ruled that it has no power to stop the home secretary from deporting a vulnerable girl at risk of female genital mutilation FGM to Bahrain or Sudan  Jasmine not her real name is years old As a barrister I have seen how the government s hostile immigration environment extends to refusing asylum claims on the basis of FGM leaving girls and women liable to deportation to countries where this practice is prevalent if not the norm The government claims it is committed to supporting victims of FGM and prosecuting perpetrators Yet when girls at risk of being cut claim asylum they are turned away 
SEP26	Like it or not, Boris Johnson still has two paths to election victory	It s the morning after Yesterday was a ball at least for remainers But it was like the Duchess of Richmond s ball before Waterloo now the real battle must commence The supreme court did not rewrite the UK s constitution on Tuesday it merely enforced the conventions of the existing one It reasserted Be ye never so high the law is above you though it cited no particular law rather the rule of law as interpreted by itself  The person who should be resigning is the Commons leader Jacob Rees Mogg for inducing the monarch to collude in a political device We can only imagine how pompously he would now be demanding resignation were the culprit not him 
SEP27	Tory MPs beware: if you whip up an angry mob, they may end up angry with you	Drawn increasingly into darkness and rage the UK government functions as a promotional tie in for the controversial Joker movie Out next week kids Think of it as a Tory conference chaser For now it s great to see everyone s favourite political incel break cover as Dominic Cummings makes a series of appearances among the chaos to announce We are enjoying this Such a self styled antihero He used to think what happened to his Brexit was a tragedy but now he knows it s a comedy  The latest clip ends with Cummings blowing a kiss to the news cameras a reminder that politics allows some people to play out a wishful version of themselves that would be laughed out of town anywhere normal In any sane arena Dominic is the answer to the inquiry What would happen if you shaved Quentin Tarantino s head but kept everything else much the same 
SEP27	Trump and Johnson are getting their comeuppance. But will it make them stronger?	Since Britain and the United States have grappled with a shared fate facing down the conjoined twins of populism Brexit and Trump This week at long last came the first signs of a reckoning After three years in which the winners of have mocked pushed or trampled on the constitutional constraints that sustain a liberal democracy the constitutions on both sides of the Atlantic struck back  The mechanisms are different of course but the convergence of these two connected stories has been uncanny all the same The judges of the UK supreme court cancelled Boris Johnson s unlawful suspension of parliament on the very day the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put aside her previous misgivings and launched an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump 
SEP27	MPs of all parties must unite to rein in this reckless, divisive government	At the moment our country is more unsettled more divided than I can ever recall Ministers assure us they are moving towards a deal The European Union tells us they are not because no new or viable proposals have been put forward by the British government The prime minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe But we don t see him sitting down in Brussels hammering out an agreement  Lip service is paid to the unanimous judgment of the supreme court that it was unlawful to prorogue parliament for five weeks while the prime minister tells us the court was wrong and he was right That is the cry of those found guilty of misdemeanours throughout the ages 
SEP27	Separation anxiety: why breaking up with your babysitter is hard to do	My children s babysitter stayed over this week after I went out late one night Since my children were born we have seen her every day bar the weekends Officially we are now divorced after the summer my children were old enough to go to after school club and our babysitter found a new job In truth I am finding it hard to let go I can t let go I wailed to her this week Wearily she agreed to come back  She has contrived not to notice when I ve come in late wasted everyone does it in England I say defensively 
SEP27	You can’t be ‘impartial’ about racism – an open letter to the BBC on the Naga Munchetty ruling	Dear BBC  On July President Trump tweeted that four congresswomen should go back to the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came All four congresswomen are people of colour all four are US citizens and only congresswoman Ilhan Omar was born overseas These comments were widely acknowledged as racist in a broad spectrum of reputable international news outlets including the Washington Post New York Times CNN MSNBC Sky News and the Guardian 
SEP27	Tory moderates may have to fight to get their party back	If Boris Johnson is capable of shame then he should surely now be feeling it He has brought this country to the point where an election is genuinely to be feared no matter who wins because of the violence that may follow where MPs facing death threats will need all the courage they can muster just to go out campaigning and decent voters will switch off from the spite and hysteria surrounding them  It should go without saying that Johnson s dismissive response to the Labour MP Paula Sherriff when she challenged his deliberately provocative talk of surrender and betrayal over Brexit was awful Having listened in the past to Sherriff matter of factly describe the threats she has faced from the far right and the depressingly elaborate precautions so many of her colleagues must take just to go about their everyday life I too feel rage bubbling up at the idea that this was somehow faux concern But what if rage is what they want those determined to turn this next election into some kind of political hunger games For only when we are goaded beyond reason red mist descending at the slightest provocation can they get the reaction their divide and conquer strategy needs 
SEP27	The drama in parliament is irresistible for the media. But real politics is happening elsewhere	At this year s London Marathon a runner dressed as Big Ben got stuck under advertising hoardings as he reached the finish line For the past couple of years the real Big Ben has been clad in scaffolding while business in the House of Commons has been intermittently interrupted by fires and water leaks As the UK s institutional politics crumbles the gods are writing the metaphors for us  How can we make some sense out of our current tumult this feverish period in which an old politics is imploding before our eyes and we can feel the birth pangs of contested futures 
SEP27	Lady Hale pulled pints? She’s all the stronger for it	For all the talk of an industry in crisis you have to hand it to the British media for their ability to get to the nub of a story It was one imagines with a gasp of triumph that the Daily Mail was able to deliver a stinging blow to the president of the supreme court Lady Hale she of the spider brooch and the damning verdict on our prime minister s prorogation wheeze Via a stunned headline the paper was this week able to reveal that Hale who graduated top of her class at Cambridge in law who was the first woman to be appointed to the Law Commission and the second to be appointed to the court of appeal was in fact an ex barmaid Truly we must applaud this mighty organ s dogged commitment to truth and scrutiny  I do worry about what sort of precedent this sets however When the day comes that I achieve something of professional import that has implications on the very notion of democracy will I too be put through the media wringer I may not have a law degree or a seat on the most powerful court in the land but like Hale I am an ex barmaid I m also an ex waitress dishwasher and tour guide and my personal nadir a former milk factory worker required to wear a hairnet and fetching paper suit These jobs were executed through my late teens and early s with varying degrees of competency and enthusiasm I still maintain however that my three years working behind a bar were the best fun I ve ever had in a job

SEP28	Trump acts as if he is above the law. The law has begun to fight back	Nancy Pelosi s decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump following reports that he used the power of his office to solicit interference by a foreign government in the US election makes him only the fourth president in US history to have this notable distinction with Bill Clinton in Richard Nixon in and Andrew Johnson in The picture changes by the hour but the main story concerns Trump s apparent offer to Ukraine s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to unfreeze m in Congress approved military aid if he would investigate Joe Biden the current frontrunner in the Democratic primaries  The conversation so shocked a member of the intelligence community that they filed an official whistleblower complaint The White House then appears to have engaged in a cover up in part by keeping these conversations from officials who would normally have access to them as well as allegedly moving the transcript of the call to a secret computer system the Presidential Records Act of passed in response to the Watergate scandal mandates that all presidential records must be officially preserved 
SEP28	End front-page falsehoods and regain the public’s trust	The postmortem on how we got ourselves into this mess will be long and complex But at its heart will lie this simple proposition good democracy relies on good information  What does good information look like We might say information that is not only true but also believed And therein lies the problem We re no longer very willing to believe almost anybody Most surveys of trust find very little faith in what government or politicians tell us But there are also extraordinarily low levels of trust in most media Nearly two thirds of people say they can no longer tell good journalism from rumour or falsehoods This is to put it mildly a disaster Into this vacuum of unbelief and mistrust step liars and peddlers of fantasies By all means call another referendum or election but what makes anyone confident that the electorate will make a better decision than last time round And I don t just mean Brexit 
SEP28	Jennifer Lopez: a comeback of positively epic proportions	Like stories about how much everyone still loves Friends could it be any more necessary to talk about how everyone still loves Friends Jennifer Lopez is everywhere Last week she was announced as co headliner of the next Super Bowl half time show sharing that million or so strong audience with Shakira In a statement she said it was a lifelong dream And now it s made even more special not only because it s the NFL s th anniversary but also because I am performing with a fellow Latina I can t wait to show what us girls can do on the world s biggest stage  Lopez is enjoying a career renaissance of epic proportions In a way epic proportions are a big part of her story in the first place She closed the Versace show during Milan fashion week with a revival of that green dress years after she wore it to the Grammys So many people searched for it back then that it led Google to the creation of Google Images She is also receiving that much coveted Oscars buzz not a bad turnaround for the woman who once uttered It s turkey time Gobble gobble gobble widely considered the worst movie dialogue of all time for Hustlers She plays a blinder as Ramona Vega a stripper turned con artist who either wants to wrap everyone up in her giant fur coat or drug them and fleece them depending on which side of the transactions they are on I went to see Hustlers the weekend it came out I can t remember the last time I sat in a cinema filled and it was filled almost entirely with young women My friend Louis audibly gasped when J Lo performed her pi ce de r sistance a gravity caressing pole dance to Fiona Apple s song Criminal He grabbed my hand and whispered She s Nobody shushed him 
SEP28	Meet the new enemy of an ordered, happy society – the crying baby	Babies and toddlers the game is up good people adult people aren t putting up with your antisocial behaviour any more Japan Airlines has developed an app with a child icon showing passengers where small children aged between eight days and two years are sitting thus enabling them to sit as far away as possible from the nappy wearing sociopaths of the skies Or something like that Maybe there s an argument for hyper frequent flying business people using such an app but what about the rest of us people who occasionally fly for a few hours a time Is it socially acceptable to hate babies now leastways to sit coldly prodding a child icon to banish them from your presence  There s something so intrinsically misanthropic about all this I don t know whether to laugh or ask for around the clock police surveillance on the people who use such icons Certainly it raises important ethical questions Eight days months how old is the child you re prepared to vaporise from your flight experience If there were an app to force young children to travel in a livestock cage in the cargo hold would you use that too Duct taping a kid s mouth shut where do you stand on that 
SEP28	Tory MPs beware: if you whip up an angry mob, they may end up angry with you	Drawn increasingly into darkness and rage the UK government functions as a promotional tie in for the controversial Joker movie Out next week kids Think of it as a Tory conference chaser For now it s great to see everyone s favourite political incel break cover as Dominic Cummings makes a series of appearances among the chaos to announce We are enjoying this Such a self styled antihero He used to think what happened to his Brexit was a tragedy but now he knows it s a comedy  The latest clip ends with Cummings blowing a kiss to the news cameras a reminder that politics allows some people to play out a wishful version of themselves that would be laughed out of town anywhere normal In any sane arena Dominic is the answer to the inquiry What would happen if you shaved Quentin Tarantino s head but kept everything else much the same 
SEP28	Education needs an overhaul, but closing private schools is not the answer	The Labour party s radical proposals to shake up England s schooling system has thrust educational debate into the spotlight shattering the post millennial political consensus of what s best for our children A Labour government would dismantle the very foundations of the current education landscape abandoning tests at the end of primary school replacing the schools inspectorate and abolishing private schools altogether Labour claims it s the party fighting for social justice rather than social mobility It is certainly offering a different vision to that of the Conservatives who want to create more places at selective grammar schools  But how do these policies stack up against the hard evidence What s undeniable is that we need to rethink the current approach to education Amid stagnating social mobility schools remain the great hope of levelling a grotesquely uneven playing field But the achievement gap between poorer children and their better off peers continues to be stark Reviews of progress on narrowing the gap have adopted an increasingly futile tone 
SEP28	Brexit is giving Welsh nationalism a new popular appeal	The last time I visited family in north Wales I was heartened to see the words Cofiwch Dryweryn Remember Tryweryn emblazoned on several walls I had read about how the patriotic slogan was popping up meme like all over the country but I hadn t seen it with my own eyes Call me a misty eyed Welsh nationalist if you like but I felt quite emotional Ever since I was a little girl and my father pulled over the car to show me where a village once stood I had known the story of Capel Celyn the community flooded in to create a reservoir for Liverpool in the Tryweryn valley and how it became a nationalist cause  The repeated vandalisation of the original graffiti which the poet Meic Stephens painted in the s and which has now gained charity protection has led to a kind of viral graffiti campaign with Cofiwch Dryweryn appearing on walls and slag heaps alongside roads and near beaches and even on the side of mountains It feels like the most significant display of Welsh pride that I have seen in my lifetime 
SEP28	Macron’s national debate on immigration plays into the hands of the French far right	Nearly halfway into his rocky first term as French president Emmanuel Macron has concocted a new plan to bolster his flagging approval ratings a sweeping national debate on immigration Starting on Monday the French parliament is slated to begin a wide ranging discussion of French and European migration policy It comes just weeks after Macron told legislators from his party La R publique En Marche that he believes immigration to be a major concern of working class people something they apparently endure along with poverty and unemployment The question he told the parliamentarians is whether we want to be a bourgeois party or not  It s unclear what exactly will come of the debate Just in case legislators are looking for inspiration though the president has floated a handful of his own ideas and they give a sense of where this is headed He has suggested that state medical aid for undocumented immigrants is too generous that some are abusing the right of asylum and that deportations sometimes take too long to process because of legal challenges France cannot host everyone if it wants to host people well Macron said on Wednesday 
SEP28	Trump and Johnson are getting their comeuppance. But will it make them stronger?	Since Britain and the United States have grappled with a shared fate facing down the conjoined twins of populism Brexit and Trump This week at long last came the first signs of a reckoning After three years in which the winners of have mocked pushed or trampled on the constitutional constraints that sustain a liberal democracy the constitutions on both sides of the Atlantic struck back  The mechanisms are different of course but the convergence of these two connected stories has been uncanny all the same The judges of the UK supreme court cancelled Boris Johnson s unlawful suspension of parliament on the very day the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put aside her previous misgivings and launched an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump

SEP29	If Boris Johnson has a plan for Brexit he must reveal it now	At school you can only tell the teacher so many times that the dog ate your homework After a while you have to produce it Or admit you never did it in the first place That is the position Boris Johnson finds himself in on Brexit And whether it s being accountable to parliament or to the public in an election after a vote of no confidence this week it s time he came clean on what his detailed plan is  Theresa May s mistake was to promise Brexit means Brexit but then negotiate a vassal state deal as Jacob Rees Mogg described it that was the worst of all worlds and more unpopular than the poll tax Johnson quit his cabinet position as he felt so strongly that May s Brexit deal was a bad one Brexiteers said it was because her heart wasn t in it as a remainer So it s hardly surprising there is little trust left in the Brexit process 
SEP29	We were told capitalism had won. But now workers can take back control	Before the financial crisis of it was widely assumed class politics was dead A rising tide we were told would lift all boats In fact unprecedented levels of credit creation and rising asset prices obscured the growing gap between the and the rest Now the bubble has burst it is obvious whose interests are served by our economic model and the class divides are sharpening once again  In Francis Fukuyama declared that history had ended and capitalism was the last man standing Margaret Thatcher had already stated that there is no alternative to the free market The world fell under the spell of what Mark Fisher termed capitalist realism it had become easier for most people to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism 
SEP29	I used to think Boris Johnson could get a Brexit deal. Not after last week	I cannot recall a more critical week in British politics It will decide whether parliament the law and public opinion can hold the prime minister Boris Johnson to account or whether a new poison has entered public life We need constantly to remember that Britain faces no menace to its security or prosperity It could by now be outside the EU with agreed terms of trade This crisis is entirely the outcome of one man s device to seize control of his party  From the moment Johnson began his final climb to power his appeal has been crudely populist He has discarded the core Tory tradition of fiscal probity with a welter of spending pledges and tax cuts plus plans for immigration control and toughness on crime On Brexit he has distorted a near trivial freedom to trade with the rest of the world with claptrap about vassalage sovereignty and patriotism The idea that Brexit will bring a new dawn of national wealth is absurd It is simply how Johnson became prime minister 
SEP29	Europe isn’t the enemy – demonising us is undermining Britain	Seventeen years ago Theresa May stunned her fellow Conservatives by telling their annual party conference that they were just plain unattractive The Tories she said had become the nasty party Today from where I sit in western Europe Britain itself looks just plain unattractive It seems to have become the nasty country I m not saying the British people are any worse or any better than any other Europeans I am saying its ruling political party is nasty as is much of its press The leader of the Conservative party and therefore the prime minister is a man who has personally taken nastiness to an entirely new level yet is the country s most popular politician  Ever since the UK voted to leave the EU millions of other Europeans like me have been looking for signs that the country is coming around to its old pragmatic self It s a version of Boris Johnson s cakeism you want to love Britain and you want to be honest about the kind of country it is now These two positions have become impossible to hold at the same time 
SEP29	It’s open season for political thugs and the Tories gave them the pass	If a malign power wanted to push a peaceful country into political violence it would follow the example of the British Conservative party For violence to come from the fringe to the mainstream two conditions must be met the taboos against violence must be undermined and the forces of order weakened The Tories have met them both  Political violence needs authorisation from above Politicians intellectuals and religious leaders either issue a call to arms or more usually find reasons to understand and excuse In the manner of the sexist judge saying women in miniskirts are asking for it they divert attention from perpetrators and say victims have no one to blame but themselves 
SEP29	Boris Johnson seeks to divide and conquer with his incendiary rhetoric	There s a case to be made that British democracy is not in dreadful trouble but working quite well Or at least as well as can be expected in extreme circumstances Even under the intense stress of the Brexit crisis our spatchcock constitution is just about keeping it together  Exhibit One The prime minister exploits the prerogative powers to attempt a prolonged suspension of parliament that is designed to prevent MPs from invigilating the government at a critical time The supreme court coolly steps up to this challenge to democracy delivers a unanimous and impeccably reasoned judgment explaining why the prime minister acted unlawfully and parliament is back in business the very next day 
SEP29	Trump acts as if he is above the law. The law has begun to fight back	Nancy Pelosi s decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump following reports that he used the power of his office to solicit interference by a foreign government in the US election makes him only the fourth president in US history to have this notable distinction with Bill Clinton in Richard Nixon in and Andrew Johnson in The picture changes by the hour but the main story concerns Trump s apparent offer to Ukraine s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to unfreeze m in Congress approved military aid if he would investigate Joe Biden the current frontrunner in the Democratic primaries  The conversation so shocked a member of the intelligence community that they filed an official whistleblower complaint The White House then appears to have engaged in a cover up in part by keeping these conversations from officials who would normally have access to them as well as allegedly moving the transcript of the call to a secret computer system the Presidential Records Act of passed in response to the Watergate scandal mandates that all presidential records must be officially preserved 
SEP29	Change will come to China, but not through following western ways	On Tuesday perfectly groomed military personnel each between ft in and ft in tall will march down Chang an Avenue in Beijing Some aeroplanes and ballistic missiles drones tanks machine guns and other military kit will showcase the might of the People s Republic of China  The parade marks the th anniversary of the day that Mao Zedong announced the founding of the People s Republic from atop the Tiananmen Gate It will inspire a sense of pride among Chinese citizens and worries among their neighbours especially Taiwan 
SEP29	These radical ideas might seem utopian but at least they fire the imagination	Back in May the shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested that if Labour won the next election it would launch pilot schemes for universal basic income The aim of UBI is to provide every citizen with regular unconditional payments to afford basic security It might seem an impossibly utopian notion free cash for all provided by the state but it has fired the imagination of growing numbers of thinkers from across the political spectrum  Last week at the Labour party conference McDonnell unveiled his plans for universal provision not of income but of services Where UBI provides a regular cash sum to every individual universal basic services or UBS provides universal free access to services from health to education from housing to transport That too might seem utopian but is an idea that again has gathered support in recent years

SEP30	The Tories have split the country. No spending splurge can repair it	Look at the people here in Manchester at the Tory party conference stare into their eyes and they look much as they always did ordinary home counties folk small business people plus a few sharp suited would be spads Not noticeably odd yet these party members are the tiny group who have done for their country  Over the past decade their Brexit fever has packed the Commons with Europhobes These respectable law and order minded patriots chose a dishonest disreputable disgrace of a man for prime minister who will trash their constitution mislead their monarch and disrespect their judges to use any means necessary to get anything he wants These ordinary people have turned into wreckers of what they used to hold dearest 
SEP30	The Tories can live with a Brexit extension – as long as someone else takes the blame	The best way to rouse drowsy delegates at the Tory conference is to declare Get Brexit done It is this year s guaranteed applause line No matter how clunking the speech or how flat the joke uttering it gets the members clapping In the bars and the receptions it s the same story the phrase has people raising their glasses and cheering approval  The message is simple and repetitive back Boris Johnson to get Brexit done and allow the country to move on and talk about something else Normally a party comes up with a slogan for its conference and then focus groups it But there was no need with this slogan it came out of the focus groups No and CCHQ were struck by how often voters said it in these groups which Dominic Cummings sets such store by and so decided to adopt it as their own 
SEP30	Is defeat inevitable for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement?	Who lost Hong Kong It s a question that should worry and anger western politicians and voters as they watch from afar the slow merciless strangulation of the former British colony s courageous pro democracy movement Once the grand panjandrums of China s ruling Communist party have completed Tuesdays national day celebrations additional potentially fatal twists of their state security garrotte appear inevitable  The malign nature of Beijing s looming actions may only be intensified by the large scale demonstrations planned in Hong Kong to coincide with the People s Republic s th anniversary Multiple protests and strikes are going ahead despite official bans pre emptive arrests brutal police tactics and media intimidation But they look destined to end in more damagingly futile violence similar to that seen at the weekend 
SEP30	Boris Johnson’s unwinnable chess match is nearing its endgame	The go to analogy for some when looking at the latest stage of the Brexit mess is three dimensional chess with multiple boards being played simultaneously Political scientists for their part have tended to refer to two level games The language is different but the point is the same to understand Boris Johnson s predicament you need to grasp the complex and contradictory trade offs inherent in keeping power at home while managing international negotiations abroad  Parliament has boxed the prime minister in He faces a stark choice break the law request an extension from the EU he has vowed never to request resign or attempt to secure a Brexit deal All of a sudden getting a deal seems the most attractive option Amid all the noise from the Tory conference the promise of concrete proposals from the UK this Thursday is a signal this reality has been digested by No 
SEP30	Greta Thunberg’s enemies are right to be scared. Her new political allies should be too	Greta Thunberg has made a lot of enemies They are easy to recognise because their rage is so great they cannot help making themselves look ridiculous Thunberg s arrival in the US earlier this month set off rightwing pundits and then the president himself The conservative provocateur Dinesh D Souza compared her look to a Nazi propaganda poster a Fox News guest called her a mentally ill Swedish child being exploited by her parents and Trump mocked her on Twitter as a happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future after a speech in which she urgently laid out the dismal prospects for her generation s future  These are the latest attacks but they aren t the darkest or most unhinged Arron Banks intimating that she might drown crossing the Atlantic in August might be the single worst example or you can stare directly into the abyss by witnessing the depraved abuse Thunberg receives across the social media networks 
SEP30	Why Europe’s new populists tell so many lies – and do it so shamelessly	The torrent of lies that flows from the mouths of populists feels relentless from Donald Trump s routine lying about everything from Iran to the weather to Boris Johnson s fictitious m for the NHS Turkey on the cusp of joining the EU or most sensationally misleading the Queen about why the UK parliament should be shut down  My research on populism elsewhere in Europe confirms that lying is a constant feature of populist politics In France Marine Le Pen lies about how her party spends public money and her fake Twitter accounts Viktor Orb n the Hungarian prime minister lies gigantically and systematically about the migration to his country As for Italy s Matteo Salvini from migration to sanctions against Russia as the song goes if his lips are moving he s lying 
SEP30	Brexit may feel apocalyptic – but radical new ideas are taking root	Who would now dare to find hope in among the Brexit nightmare Halloween is just a month away and there is still no sign of any breakthrough in negotiations The Conservative party is dealing in dangerous rightwing populism a development that looks all the more abject because its new leader has taken this turn solely in the interests of his own career  The idea that an election could end the mess is undermined by wildly uneven polls many of which have pointed to another hung parliament And after his behaviour in the Commons last week and lack of contrition since the prospect of Boris Johnson somehow agreeing some kind of compromise deal and getting it through parliament with the help of Labour MPs now looks like a fantasy If you want a vision of the future imagine an upper class voice yelling Get Brexit done for ever as the paralysis and failure deepens 
SEP30	This isn’t a crisis of ‘civility’ – it’s the right whipping up violence	There were bad people on many sides this is how Donald Trump notoriously responded to the killing of Heather Heyer an anti fascist protester by a far right terrorist in Charlottesville Virginia in As a debate rages over the deliberate use of incendiary language by the British right it seems this moral equivalence has been imported  We are told that British politics is being menaced by a general lack of civility that threatens to fuel violence from all sides and that both left and right have an equal responsibility to dial down the rhetoric But this deflects from the real threat a violent far right that is emboldened and fuelled by mainstream politicians including from the prime minister s office and several media outlets 
SEP30	The Naga Munchetty row shows diversity is still about optics, not real change	There are broadly two designated roles for people of colour in the British media The first is to be the as a person You know the one the person who is there to speak about their experiences of racism or discrimination as a black man or as a Muslim woman  The second is to simply to be there bringing your talent yes but also to add diversity to a lineup News presenter Naga Munchetty discovered last week that the BBC sees her as the latter It s happy to have black and brown faces but only as long as they don t wander off the reservation and actually attempt to bring their experiences to bear on their journalism 
SEP30	If Boris Johnson has a plan for Brexit he must reveal it now	At school you can only tell the teacher so many times that the dog ate your homework After a while you have to produce it Or admit you never did it in the first place That is the position Boris Johnson finds himself in on Brexit And whether it s being accountable to parliament or to the public in an election after a vote of no confidence this week it s time he came clean on what his detailed plan is  Theresa May s mistake was to promise Brexit means Brexit but then negotiate a vassal state deal as Jacob Rees Mogg described it that was the worst of all worlds and more unpopular than the poll tax Johnson quit his cabinet position as he felt so strongly that May s Brexit deal was a bad one Brexiteers said it was because her heart wasn t in it as a remainer So it s hardly surprising there is little trust left in the Brexit process 
OCT1	Sajid Javid says everyone wants to get Brexit done. That’s patently not true	You develop a certain immunity to the news these days You can t succumb to despair every time the prime minister lies or the leader of the House of Commons makes a debasing remark about parliament there simply isn t time I find it quite surprising now to feel depressed by the Today programme  And yet on Monday the Saj did reawaken that political nerve on a tour of the broadcast studios to preview his unmemorable conference speech Everyone on the doorstep the chancellor proclaimed is saying get Brexit done They don t say cancel the result They don t say have a second referendum They say get Brexit done As a matter of observable fact this can t be right what about the million who signed the petition to revoke article Or the million plus who voted remain Or the young voters who came of age after And on and on Sajid Javid would have been safer sticking to the formula deployed by the Conservative party chairman James Cleverly He told an audience in Manchester this week that he had been knocking on very traditional Victorian terraced houses in Darlington where he met a guy who said You re that Tory I m going to vote for you lot It might not get past a creative writing tutor but at least it s not immediately falsifiable 
OCT1	While Johnson plays games, the EU prepares to move on	In a normal game of poker a bluff cannot continue once it is called But for Boris Johnson an exposed bluff can just be re bluffed The stakes get higher even when the poor hand lies open on the table  Before entering Downing Street Johnson claimed that deficiencies in Theresa May s Brexit deal were caused by failure of nerve not weakness in the UK s position The theory was that Brussels needed to see kamikaze intent in British eyes total commitment to quitting the bloc with no deal Only then would the cowardly continentals yield It is true that the EU wants a deal because of the harm that Brexit without one would do But the harm is asymmetric In a no deal scenario the UK suffers more and after a period of gratuitous pain returns to negotiations with diminished leverage It was never a real bluff because the economic cards were dealt face up 
OCT1	Johnson has run out of road. Other people’s outrage is all he’s got now	Boris Johnson is routinely dismissed as a liar for whom the truth is just another fling So it is all the more perplexing that his bluster about a no deal Brexit is taken seriously The truth is that Johnson does not want a no deal Brexit and certainly not one that precedes a general election  Let s start with the genesis of no deal Brexit It was an exemplar of Theresa May s politics a tactic invented to force her will on parliament rather than to engage in the hard graft of consensus building political leadership It was also an embarrassingly misguided attempt to threaten the European Union 
OCT1	Homelessness could happen to any of us – the numbers shame us all	It is the census that utterly shames us as a nation According to the Office for National Statistics ONS the number of people dying homeless is at an all time high An estimated homeless people died in England and Wales in a rise on The biggest rise was in drug related deaths up by since This in one of the world s richest nations is a moral emergency and it demands emergency action  Since I lost my dad to a tragic lifelong struggle with drink I ve worked with Birmingham s homeless community What drives me is the simple realisation that so many people sleeping rough are self medicating for trauma and distress with drugs and alcohol in exactly the same way my dad did 
OCT1	Chirac delivered little and left office under a cloud. Why does France now love him?	We French love to mourn our former presidents Thousands queued to pay their last respects to Jacques Chirac as he lay in state at the weekend Monday was a day of national mourning the tricolour flew at half mast everywhere and a minute s silence was observed even in schools It is hard though to know which love is greater the love of mourning the passing of former heads of state or the love of loathing them with the fervour we held when they were in power I remember all through the s my mother calling Chirac facho Chirac because of his greasy thinning pulled back hair his wannabe Charles de Gaulle style of speaking and his war like conquest of the right and of Paris city hall  The French have an unusual relationship with power specifically with our elected presidency It is some would say with good reason a relationship that is borderline pathological
OCT1	The Tories have lost their ideology. Now they are merely the party of resentment	What does the Conservative party stand for in If you survey the central tenets of Tory ideology from the past years it is hard to find a single one that is still intact  The party of business is hellbent on undermining access to an export market of half a billion people The party of law and order is now raging against the judiciary with senior Tories being regularly asked whether their government intends to obey the law 
OCT1	Strong, smart teen girls have had enough. No wonder men like Trump are rattled	The president of the United States openly mocked a teenage girl After dismissing the year old climate activist Greta Thunberg in person and earning her ire he tweeted to his million followers She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future So nice to see  Dismissive Sarcastic Mocking Utterly typical Is anyone surprised 
OCT1	We’re not ‘traitors’ or ‘remoaners’ – but this is a dark time to be a civil servant	There is a clear link between the provocative language used by ministers and other politicians and the increase of threats to public figures Everyone knows it which is why politicians of every stripe have asked urgent questions in parliament that all focused on Boris Johnson s use of inflammatory language as a deliberate strategy Instead of answering them junior minister Kevin Foster shrugged off the concerns and relentlessly bridged back to what has become the Tory party conference motto get Brexit done  Only after that we are told will the hate and the division in our country subside as if an election and a promised spending splurge could repair the damage that s been done to our public square over three years 
OCT1	Labour’s pledge to scrap universal credit could end the era of blaming ‘scroungers’	Critics call it inhumane Even its supporters talk of its colossal delays and waste Now universal credit has been given another blow as Labour announced the system would be scrapped under a Jeremy Corbyn government Labour has not yet disclosed what this would fully entail rather than a total scrap it appears the basic structure would remain But a bn package of emergency reforms seems enough to make the new model unrecognisable from removing the tax credit rape clause whereby women have to show their third or subsequent child was conceived as a result of rape to be exempt from the two child limit on receiving the credit to introducing interim payments to cushion people from the debt creating five week wait  That the party has committed to scrap the system is a hugely significant step The underfunding of Britain s safety net has now gone beyond critical levels Over the past decade multibillion pound cuts combined with a toxic anti welfare narrative has upended the meaning of social security Humiliation has replaced help punishment put in place of compassion 
OCT1	Centrist politics will not defeat Boris Johnson’s rightwing populism	In his determination to deliver Brexit do or die Boris Johnson is planning to launch an election campaign that will pit the people against parliament He promises to take sovereignty back from the political elites and return it to the people The announcement of these tactics has caused alarm among those who fear democracy will be threatened by a populist politics of polarisation between us and them  But this fear of populism reveals something troubling about how we currently understand democratic politics What most people seem to find shocking about Johnson s strategy is that it involves an us v them confrontation as if democratic politics could avoid conflict between irreconcilable political projects 
OCT2	This cowardly speech reveals Boris Johnson’s armoury is empty	Boris Johnson s speech to the Conservative party conference was of a piece with his brief and tawdry prime ministership so far The speech was a scam an attempt to pretend that inconvenient realities can be wished out of existence by putting on a crowd pleasing act Yet these inconvenient realities include such things as the law of the land the elected parliament the European Union and the island of Ireland Between them these realities have enough clout to foil him  Today s speech was hardly designed to reassure the undecided Most prime ministers devote weeks to honing their message to their party conference They probably take the occasion too seriously Johnson is the precise opposite He seemed to have cobbled together his speech over breakfast There was no architecture or narrative to it 
OCT2	Labour’s message of ‘the many not the few’ can beat the Tories	For those bristling under a near decade of Tory rule what should disturb most about the Tories annual gathering Priti Patel s bitter broadside against the north London metropolitan liberal elite and her look of sadistic delight as she pledged to end the free movement of people once and for all The crowd of Tory members faces contorted with fury angrily booing and jeering when a journalist dared to challenge Boris Johnson s cruel appropriation of Jo Cox s memory Or what about when Johnson addressed a party reception and began a sentence about Jeremy Corbyn with We ll invite him to enter and delegates finished his sentence with traitors gate and a noose  No What should truly chill is that this gaggle intoxicated with an authoritarian brand of nationalism could win the coming electoral clash and transform the country in their own image 
OCT2	I’ve seen how rash words can escalate into conflict. I fear it may happen again	Boris Johnson today announced that the Conservative government intends to propose a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic something that Theresa May to her credit went to enormous lengths to avoid in negotiations over Brexit There is no doubt this proposal while apparently welcome to the DUP will be rejected by the EU and by the majority of people in Northern Ireland This move and Johnson s earlier suggestion before becoming prime minister that the border in Ireland was analogous to the border between Islington and Camden makes me wonder if he understands how high the stakes are  I have worked for more than years trying to help end armed conflicts from Northern Ireland to Colombia One thing that strikes me is how often countries slip into them by accident not because the leaders want to start a civil war but because they get carried away with their cause and feel justified in doing absolutely anything to win without fully thinking through the consequences 
OCT2	The Tories’ ‘angry white men’ act is desperate and dangerous	In his just published memoirs David Cameron describes how in he finally broke New Labour s grip on power to become prime minister We had changed the Conservative party making it appeal once more to Middle England and making people in urban liberal Britain feel that they could vote for us  Wandering around this year s Tory party conference I sought some remnants of that legacy even the ghostliest traces of the Cameron spirit I came up empty As the Conservatives plough toward the end of a decade in power that he bequeathed to them the institutional memory of its leader of years has been almost wiped clean A new gang now runs the show both in the secure zone at Manchester and across the land They are redder of face faster to jab fingers and they are fuelled by a vast resentment that demands constant replenishment Forget Cameroonian optimism and progressive posturing anger is the Conservatives new electoral strategy An exaggerated focus grouped nasty anger to be sure but not entirely artificial nor without some justification And it is my genuine fear that their anger could consume the entire country 
OCT2	The climate protest movement must not alienate Britain’s working classes	Next week thousands of Extinction Rebellion protesters will descend on Westminster the latest example of direct action in a year when committed women men and children across the world have pushed climate change to the top of the global agenda where it belongs Although London will again be the focal point the movement mustn t overlook the committed activists in places such as Bolton Wigan and Sunderland who are also spreading the message across the country For the climate movement to succeed we have to build a broad coalition that covers our nation s towns as well as our cities and reaches out across class divides  Calls for individual action can t just be modelled on the lifestyles of middle class city dwellers Telling people to get out of their cars can t be the solution in those parts of the country where decades of chronic underinvestment have left us without public transport In towns such as Wigan jobs have disappeared as investment flowed into cities creating lengthy commutes on public transport for most working age people Trains are overcrowded deeply unreliable and ceased to function entirely for a large part of last year while the buses are few and far between and often more expensive than getting a taxi Demanding people abandon their cars isn t realistic if the alternative is a round trip of miles a day on foot or by bike just to get to work Campaigns to tackle climate change need to link up with campaigns for better transport and fairer funding for it particularly for buses 
OCT2	The Tories' tough talk on crime is shameless and cynical	In the spirit of the party conference season let me start with a platitude everybody wants dangerous criminals to be dealt with properly  But what properly actually means depends heavily on someone s political perspective The law sets out five purposes of criminal sentencing rehabilitation crime reduction including by deterrence reparation protection of the public and punishment The problem with our current system in the eyes of Boris Johnson s government is that there isn t enough emphasis on punishment So it was that justice secretary Robert Buckland QC trailed his conference speech by announcing in an interview with the Daily Mail that he was introducing proper punishment for the most serious violent and sexual offenders 
OCT2	I work in a crumbling NHS. Glitzy Tory promises won’t save it	As predictable as English downpours are the pools of water I have to sidestep in hospital corridors caused by the leaking rickety s roofs One flood came from burst internal sewerage pipes That was infinitely worse It smelt exactly as you d expect and caused an entire assessment unit to be closed for weeks I ve sat in doctors messes infested with cockroaches and once looked up at the scuttling to find myself face to face with a rat  This is the grim reality of so much NHS real estate Threadbare dilapidated in dire need of refurbishment Staff struggle to care for their patients these days amid collapsing ceilings crumbling buildings broken boilers and unsafe fire cladding Some of NHS buildings are now more than years old and an astonishing predate the founding of the NHS in I ve conducted ward rounds in huts that resemble the old codebreakers cabins of Bletchley Park Freezing in winter sweltering in summer hardly a healing environment 
OCT2	Silence still surrounds the murder of my fiance, Jamal Khashoggi. Who will speak up?	Exactly one year ago I stood outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul waiting for my fiance Jamal Khashoggi to come out with the marriage documents we needed to begin our life together I was optimistic even excited Yet I never saw Jamal again  I did not expect to have my life transformed I did not expect to have to alert the authorities to Jamal s disappearance or to find myself at the centre of a story that would shake the world I did not expect on a day that seemed unremarkable to have my dreams shattered By necessity I was put on a path compelled to begin a campaign for justice for the man who was not only stolen from me but also taken away from those who read his work and who admired him for his courage and his unrelenting commitment to the truth 
OCT2	Sajid Javid says everyone wants to get Brexit done. That’s patently not true	You develop a certain immunity to the news these days You can t succumb to despair every time the prime minister lies or the leader of the House of Commons makes a debasing remark about parliament there simply isn t time I find it quite surprising now to feel depressed by the Today programme  And yet on Monday the Saj did reawaken that political nerve on a tour of the broadcast studios to preview his unmemorable conference speech Everyone on the doorstep the chancellor proclaimed is saying get Brexit done They don t say cancel the result They don t say have a second referendum They say get Brexit done As a matter of observable fact this can t be right what about the million who signed the petition to revoke article Or the million plus who voted remain Or the young voters who came of age after And on and on Sajid Javid would have been safer sticking to the formula deployed by the Conservative party chairman James Cleverly He told an audience in Manchester this week that he had been knocking on very traditional Victorian terraced houses in Darlington where he met a guy who said You re that Tory I m going to vote for you lot It might not get past a creative writing tutor but at least it s not immediately falsifiable 
OCT2	Ireland: no country for the young, creative or homeless	There s a reason that Was it for this remains one of WB Yeats s most recited fragments of poetry in Ireland The line comes from Yeats s September which poured scorn on how the greed and hypocrisies of the business class had replaced the romanticism of previous Irish generations  Ireland s modern dismay however is at rampant and growing inequality and the way in which its cities and cultural spaces are being hollowed out by speculation gentrification poor or absent planning and squandered opportunities 
OCT3	A version of Theresa May’s deal is the only way out of the Brexit nightmare	So what now Boris Johnson s tactic of leaving Brexit to the last minute and then serving up a dog s breakfast seems unlikely to work Both Dublin and Brussels have effectively rubbished it The offer to the EU is absurd In place of Brexit s promised no border on the island of Ireland he offers two borders a customs one on land and a regulatory one in the Irish sea In place of frictionless trade he offers a blizzard of bureaucracy and a gift to smuggling In place of take back control he offers a non existent Northern Irish assembly a veto over British trade policy As the prime minister s first hesitant step into personal diplomacy it is dire  The only sensible way forward must now be to separate Brexit on October from the resolution of these fiendish trading arrangements
OCT3	This brutal judgment on pensions is blind to the reality of older women’s lives	Equality for women is not always a victory Women and men s entitlement to a state pension was equalised by law back in so women retire at now at next year just the same as men Sounds fair Not to women born in the s whose lives were hard work and slim savings with no chance to build up pensions they expected to retire at and draw their state pension  Women Against State Pension Inequality Waspi took their case to court for compensation and today they lost These implacable campaigners for the pension rights of nearly million women born in the s turn up at every political event and tail each Department for Work and Pensions secretary relentlessly to protest about pension changes that left many in penury Politicians groan inwardly when they see them coming but these women never give up 
OCT3	Northern Ireland’s abortion ban is finally crumbling. Even if some won’t accept it	In Sarah Ewart received a heartbreaking fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis for her much wanted pregnancy Faced with the prospect of a baby who might die during gestation or shortly after birth she felt she couldn t continue with the pregnancy But in Northern Ireland abortion is illegal unless the mother s health or life is at risk so Sarah travelled to England for a termination  It was a journey she should never have had to make 
OCT3	Demagogues thrive by whipping up our fury. Here’s how to thwart them	Is this democracy s death spiral Are we in this country and others falling into a lethal cycle of fury and reaction that blocks the reasoned conversation on which civic life depends  In every age there have been political hucksters using aggression lies and outrage to drown out reasoned argument But not since the s have so many succeeded 
OCT3	Hillary Clinton says when life’s tough, ‘keep going’. I’m not so sure	At the theatre on Saturday night I watched Diana Nyad the long distance swimmer ignite an audience for over an hour She recounted her record breaking mile swim from Cuba to Florida at the age of after several failed attempts and in the face of killer sharks deadly jellyfish and huge waves It was like listening to a one woman version of the Iliad an almost too perfect literalisation of inspirational metaphor The subtitle of the show was never ever give up a well worn sentiment that in Nyad s hands was made thrillingly new  As it happens the Clintons were in the audience at New York s Minetta Lane Theatre that night Afterwards on the pavement with one eye on the SUV convoy theatregoers joked that Nyad s words risked inspiring Hillary God forbid to have another crack at the White House A few days later Hillary and Chelsea appeared on the TV show Good Morning America to promote their book The Book of Gutsy Women To the question What s the gutsiest thing you ve ever done Hillary replied Ah boy I think the gutsiest thing I ve ever done well personally make the decision to stay in my marriage The bravest thing she d done in public was run for president she said and in both scenarios the trick was to just get up every day and keep going 
OCT3	Teenagers need to know where love stops and abusive relationships start	Why are we always pointing to Instagram as the cause of mental illness in our teenagers It s frustrating that abusive relationships and the trauma they cause are rarely mentioned in discussions about the prevalence of mental health problems in young people Research by Women s Aid and Cosmopolitan has found that a third of teenage girls have been in an abusive relationship And if that isn t shocking enough when the remaining two thirds were asked further questions it emerged that of them had in fact experienced abusive behaviour they just didn t realise it was abuse  Domestic abuse is normally associated with women cowering on the floor as a violent husband waits to strike or mothers covering up their black eyes with concealer before the school run On the same day that the domestic abuse bill received its second reading in parliament Age UK called for action to tackle domestic abuse of over s whose needs it says are often overlooked by the law policy and practice The needs of teenagers in the heady throes of first love who are in emotionally abusive relationships also need to be recognised

OCT3	In the twisted story of eugenics, the bad guy is all of us	How should we remember historical figures who we know have done terrible things It s a dilemma we face more often as universities and public institutions critically examine their histories reassessing the past with st century eyes And over the last year University College London has been in the midst of a historical inquiry into its role as the institutional birthplace of eugenics the debunked science that claimed that by selectively breeding humans we could improve racial quality  We tend to associate eugenics with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust but it was in fact developed in London Its founder was Francis Galton who established a laboratory at UCL in Already some students and staff have called on the university to rename its Galton lecture theatre 
OCT3	I’ve seen how rash words can escalate into conflict. I fear it may happen again	Boris Johnson today announced that the Conservative government intends to propose a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic something that Theresa May to her credit went to enormous lengths to avoid in negotiations over Brexit There is no doubt this proposal while apparently welcome to the DUP will be rejected by the EU and by the majority of people in Northern Ireland This move and Johnson s earlier suggestion before becoming prime minister that the border in Ireland was analogous to the border between Islington and Camden makes me wonder if he understands how high the stakes are  I have worked for more than years trying to help end armed conflicts from Northern Ireland to Colombia One thing that strikes me is how often countries slip into them by accident not because the leaders want to start a civil war but because they get carried away with their cause and feel justified in doing absolutely anything to win without fully thinking through the consequences 
OCT4	Jennifer Arcuri came late to the party. But the Johnson franchise is unthinkable without her now	Kick back and pour yourself a tech o tini because there s a new political star in town and she is finally talking She s talking in a Los Angeles supermarket car park for now laughing merrily while holding a large carton of almond milk But if her lawyer gets his way she ll be talking in a high paying British newspaper this weekend She is of course Jennifer Arcuri model infosec entrepreneur and the businesswoman responsible for the technological education of Boris Johnson  On Thursday a US attorney was fielding multiple calls attempting to broker a deal for her story Asked if that would include her confirming a romantic relationship with Johnson he replied It depends on your definition of romantic Wow Go on I ve known Jennifer for years There s a lot of scrutiny of Mr Johnson Get in the queue if you want her services you have to pay for it Ought he to be making his client sound like Lol Flanders It s not for us to judge 
OCT4	Peace in Ireland is precious. Brexit has made us forget that	It is one of the stranger aspects of the Brexit debate When the plea is raised to remember the Good Friday agreement to do nothing that might jeopardise the fragile peace that has held in Northern Ireland for two decades that plea usually comes in a continental European accent Of course Irish politicians have been saying it loudly from the start but this week it was striking to hear French German Dutch or Belgian voices explaining to British TV and radio audiences why the EU couldn t possibly accept Boris Johnson s revised Brexit plan because of the risk it posed to peace in a corner of the United Kingdom where a bloody conflict had raged within recent memory  You d think Britons wouldn t need to be reminded An estimated people were killed during the year war we euphemistically referred to as the Troubles That violence was the background hum of life on these islands on the news most days until the late s in Northern Ireland obviously but also in Britain Pubs were bombed along with department stores and shopping centres even a party conference As a schoolchild I remember how routine it became for the tube home to be closed due to a bomb scare 
OCT4	For those who want to stop no deal, Jeremy Corbyn is the only hope	Departing Tory leaders have developed an odd and presumptuous habit of demanding that the leader of the opposition resign too As a party leader who has accepted when her time was up Theresa May told Jeremy Corbyn in her final prime minister s questions preparing to leave her party to Boris Johnson and the country without a prayer perhaps the time has come for him to do the same  In David Cameron who had called a referendum lost it only to then break his promise and abandon the country in a moment of self inflicted crisis suggested Corbyn s resignation would be a patriotic act It might be in my party s interest for him to sit there It s not in the national interest I would say for heaven s sake man go 
OCT4	Why the world needs an IMF for the climate crisis	Human civilisation is facing a crisis on a scale that we have not seen since the second world war We must finally respond in a way that meets this immense challenge  The climate crisis is of our own creation particularly that of the richest countries whose development has been based on exploiting natural resources without end The casualties are piling up some countries and entire communities in particular island nations are the most exposed and least prepared after Hurricane Dorian we have all seen the devastation in the Bahamas 
OCT4	Trump is his own biggest enemy in the impeachment inquiry	Less than two weeks after his election Donald Trump announced to the world that he was considering a crazed animal for his first secretary of defense  Nobody but Trump called the highly respected general Mad Dog But that didn t stop the maddest dog of them all Jim Mattis who told everyone he hated the nickname eventually resigned because he wasn t mad enough to follow the leader of this peculiar pack by trashing every US ally on the planet 
OCT4	I reported my friend for raping me. It was no surprise when the case was dropped	UK rape prosecution statistics make depressing reading especially for the victims News such as rape charges prosecutions and convictions in England and Wales falling to their lowest levels in more than a decade for example Or the report showing that only of rape claims in London result in convictions Recently even prosecutors have been urged to adopt a more risk averse approach to rape cases by taking a proportion of weak cases out of the system  These are just a few examples of the kind of news that still gives me a full body adrenaline surge that drains the blood from my face and leaves me feeling ill Of course I am all for an increased media focus on the failure of our justice system to prosecute those who commit acts of sexual violence but on a personal level I find the constant reminder disturbing if that s the right word 
OCT4	I’ve seen the child slavery of county lines up close. £20m won’t stop it	Most people I speak to don t know what the term county lines means I didn t either but when a child close to me became entrapped I had no choice but to climb a steep and terrifying learning curve   County lines refers to the mobile phone numbers used by criminal networks to sell and distribute drugs around the country The term sounds kind of street and clever But it s a sanitisation of what county lines drug gangs really represent the slavery of our children and young people for the purposes of making vast amounts of money Child slaves are being recruited in our communities under our noses in parks town centres and outside schools across the country Criminals actively target communities they deem to be easy targets those with cut to the bone services thin policing and a belief that this sort of thing doesn t happen here 
OCT4	Harry and Meghan are celebrities, but that doesn’t mean they owe us everything	The royal family does not much go in for the vulgarity of emotion  Princess Diana was expected to tolerate her husband s infidelity in dignified silence not go crying to Panorama Her children would in turn be expected to walk dry eyed behind her coffin The family still mostly takes its lead from the Queen s constitutional obligation to conceal her feelings recognising that her rockiest moments have come when asked to reveal more than is comfortable during Scotland s independence referendum or when the unexpected national wave of grief over Diana s death left the family looking dangerously stiff The younger royals have pushed the boundaries by discussing their mental health but raw unfiltered emotion is still regarded as suspiciously bad for business Imagine the concern then at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex s insistence on showing some 
OCT4	A version of Theresa May’s deal is the only way out of the Brexit nightmare	So what now Boris Johnson s tactic of leaving Brexit to the last minute and then serving up a dog s breakfast seems unlikely to work Both Dublin and Brussels have effectively rubbished it The offer to the EU is absurd In place of Brexit s promised no border on the island of Ireland he offers two borders a customs one on land and a regulatory one in the Irish sea In place of frictionless trade he offers a blizzard of bureaucracy and a gift to smuggling In place of take back control he offers a non existent Northern Irish assembly a veto over British trade policy As the prime minister s first hesitant step into personal diplomacy it is dire  The only sensible way forward must now be to separate Brexit on October from the resolution of these fiendish trading arrangements
OCT4	This brutal judgment on pensions is blind to the reality of older women’s lives	Equality for women is not always a victory Women and men s entitlement to a state pension was equalised by law back in so women retire at now at next year just the same as men Sounds fair Not to women born in the s whose lives were hard work and slim savings with no chance to build up pensions they expected to retire at and draw their state pension  BackTo took their case to court for compensation and today they lost BackTo and Women Against State Pension Inequality Waspi are implacable campaigners for the pension rights of nearly million women born in the s Waspi turn up at every political event and tail each Department for Work and Pensions secretary relentlessly to protest about pension changes that left many in penury Politicians groan inwardly when they see them coming but these women never give up 
OCT5	The EU was crucial to securing peace in Ireland. This plan puts it in peril	One of the disconcerting things about Brexit is its capacity constantly to rewrite the script of political dysfunction The latest government proposals won t work They do represent a significant concession but create an incoherent muddle leading to a bizarre outcome  Northern Ireland would remain part of Europe s single market but Britain would leave it There would be regulatory checks down the Irish Sea but not at the Irish border There would however be customs checks so the border would not be open as now And Northern Ireland s membership of the single market could be unilaterally revoked by its assembly which is not presently able to constitute itself and so the whole plan is subject to the notorious vagaries of Northern Irish politics 
OCT5	Is architecture at last breaking through its own glass ceiling?	Some kind of congratulations are due to the Royal Institute of British Architects for choosing as this year s winners of the royal gold medal for architecture the Irish practice Grafton For Grafton Architects is run by two women Shelley McNamara and Yvonne Farrell which means that for the second time since Queen Victoria awarded the first such medal in it has gone outright to members of the same sex as the late queen empress On two other occasions women have won the prize together with their husband colleagues  This year the RIBA could hardly have done otherwise given a campaign by an action group called Part W to highlight the scarcity of women among the winners of the gold medal and the world s other top awards for architecture It is flabbergasting that this conversation still has to be had now in Still baby steps The choice of Grafton can t be faulted either they are outstanding architects 
OCT5	If Donald Trump goes down, he’ll try to take everyone with him	There are two ways of looking at Donald Trump s astonishing response to the Democrats attempt to impeach him Either Trump has finally lost the plot or else he has just guaranteed himself a stunning victory in next year s presidential election Whichever view is correct both signal a rising sea of troubles for the US and the world  Suggestions that Trump has no idea what he s doing were reinforced by some unhinged behaviour last week His ranting about traitors spies and low life at a White House event was utterly bizarre reviving claims that he is unfit for office 
OCT5	Europeans in Britain used to feel at home. Now they have their doubts	The liberal command to celebrate diversity misses that there is often little to celebrate It takes a truly privileged and cosseted mind to imagine that identities are always a joyful embrace of essential natures Minorities can be manufactured by the prejudiced and powerful who need outsiders for their supporters to define themselves against If the prejudice and power did not exist nor would they  Brexit Britain may not be up to much but it has become a world leader in creating identities no one needed or wanted You would have been met with incomprehension in if you had declared yourself a Leaver or Remainer or talked about European Union nationals in Britain and Britons in Europe as if they were aliens who must meet the exacting demands of a suspicious bureaucracy 
OCT5	It was gutsy of Hillary Clinton to stand by Bill. But it made political sense too	A woman who has been cheated on has a complex social role to play she must be devastated dignified and instantly unforgiving banishing the sexual miscreant as though she s been given Gloria Gaynor s I Will Survive to act out in some ghastly very public round of emotional charades No one knows this more than Hillary Clinton who in some eyes committed a heinous feminist faux pas by forgiving her husband Bill for his multiple infidelities  Instead of the Go on now go walk out the door narrative that is practically the cheatee national anthem Hillary stood by her man even as she denied becoming a Tammy Wynette caricature She has been relentlessly questioned mocked and distrusted on account of this decision arguably suffering more for her husband s betrayals than he ever did Now interviewed with her daughter Chelsea about their new The Book of Gutsy Women she cited the decision to stay in my marriage as the gutsiest personal thing she ever did Just the gutsiest Hillary or also the smartest the only outcome that made any kind of sense 
OCT5	Jonathan Safran Foer: I’ve got no beef with his plan to save the planet	Jonathan Safran Foer published Eating Animals in I didn t read it until because I had a feeling that it would be persuasive and I would have to stop eating meat which I found delicious especially buttery white bread ham sandwiches and chicken shish kebabs It took a long time before I was ready to have my last pepperoni pizza but in choosing to pick up a book that I knew laid out the horrors of mass meat production it was clear that I was almost there And when I d finished reading it I simply stopped eating meat The trade off no longer seemed worth it  Safran Foer now aims to repeat that trick with We Are the Weather Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast Rather than focusing on the grotesque scale and inhumane practices of factory farming he talks about the environmental impact of meat and dairy and offers practical suggestions for reducing our consumption of animal products instead We hear again and again that in the US and the UK to have any hope of slowing the climate emergency we need to cut down on meat by and dairy by Safran Foer s idea is that we eat meat and dairy only in the evening Easy 
OCT5	Jennifer Arcuri came late to the party. But the Johnson franchise is unthinkable without her now	Kick back and pour yourself a tech o tini because there s a new political star in town and she is finally talking She s talking in a Los Angeles supermarket car park for now laughing merrily while holding a large carton of almond milk But if her lawyer gets his way she ll be talking in a high paying British newspaper this weekend She is of course Jennifer Arcuri model infosec entrepreneur and the businesswoman responsible for the technological education of Boris Johnson  On Thursday a US attorney was fielding multiple calls attempting to broker a deal for her story Asked if that would include her confirming a romantic relationship with Johnson he replied It depends on your definition of romantic Wow Go on I ve known Jennifer for years There s a lot of scrutiny of Mr Johnson Get in the queue if you want her services you have to pay for it Ought he to be making his client sound like Lol Flanders It s not for us to judge 
OCT5	Peace in Ireland is precious. Brexit has made us forget that	It is one of the stranger aspects of the Brexit debate When the plea is raised to remember the Good Friday agreement to do nothing that might jeopardise the fragile peace that has held in Northern Ireland for two decades that plea usually comes in a continental European accent Of course Irish politicians have been saying it loudly from the start but this week it was striking to hear French German Dutch or Belgian voices explaining to British TV and radio audiences why the EU couldn t possibly accept Boris Johnson s revised Brexit plan because of the risk it posed to peace in a corner of the United Kingdom where a bloody conflict had raged within recent memory  You d think Britons wouldn t need to be reminded An estimated people were killed during the year war we euphemistically referred to as the Troubles That violence was the background hum of life on these islands on the news most days until the late s in Northern Ireland obviously but also in Britain Pubs were bombed along with department stores and shopping centres even a party conference As a schoolchild I remember how routine it became for the tube home to be closed due to a bomb scare 
OCT5	Britain was complacent about the far right. Now it’s out in force	Once upon a time the BBC banned fascists from its broadcasts In when Oswald Mosley s British Union was near its peak of popularity organising rallies and marches across the country the corporation stopped allowing him to appear on its programmes The ban unofficially supported by successive Conservative Labour and coalition governments lasted years Its rationale was straightforward Mosley s views were too extreme his supporters too threatening and his admiration for foreign authoritarians too strong for him to be allowed a prominent place in the national discourse A line was drawn between what was acceptable and unacceptable in rightwing politics and Mosley was on the wrong side of it By the time the prohibition was lifted in he was a bitter old man  It s impossible to imagine such a sustained and effective ban on a big far right figure being imposed in Britain now Many of our politicians and much of our media have stopped setting let alone policing any boundaries between mainstream conservatism and rightwing populism and extremism The BBC seems reluctant to characterise Donald Trump as a racist Nigel Farage despite never having been elected as an MP has been a panellist on BBC One s Question Time times Tommy Robinson has been interviewed on BBC Two s Newsnight Meanwhile Boris Johnson and many of his ministers party members and newspaper allies have adopted the boot boy phrases and demagoguery of the far right As the home secretary Priti Patel told a thrilled Conservative party conference this week To the criminals I simply say this we are coming after you A stronger law and order state she said is what the people want 
OCT5	Labour is letting other people define its Brexit message. That has to change	When the coming electoral contest is settled there will either be a government led by an anti austerity Labour party committed to a referendum with remain on the ballot paper or a hard right Tory party committed to the hardest of Brexits Everything else is noise  Unfortunately there is a lot of noise and Labour is partly responsible The party s new Brexit position that a deal with the EU should be put to the British people and the government will implement whatever decision they make is entirely straightforward or at least it should be It was after all the sole demand of the People s Vote campaign which until three months ago did not even officially back remain just a referendum to end the impasse But Labour is failing to communicate its stance clearly fuelling a perception that the policy is a contorted mess when it actually isn t 
OCT6	Boris Johnson’s love of classics is about just one thing: himself	I had the same education as Boris Johnson Not the Eton part self evidently it is in that period I assume that he learned to recite from memory and in Greek the first lines of the Iliad but the Balliol classics part I did that We were taught by the same men and men they were Effortless superiority a ghastly phrase once used by another Balliol prime minister Herbert Asquith was the college s unofficial motto though there was nothing tranquil or effortless still less superior about my own panicky grapplings with Homer Women I should note in passing were admitted in years after the first men  Some of the Balliol classics dons clearly adored Johnson s blustering undergraduate charm Definitely a good egg is how the philosopher Jonathan Barnes then famed for his wardrobe of th century style breeches and cravats described him in Sonia Purnell s biography Jasper Griffin who taught us Homer wrote a Greek ode for Johnson s th birthday 
OCT6	Britain must pay its debts to the Windrush generation – no matter what it costs	Sixty years ago when Caribbean migration to the UK peaked the BBC produced a handy little booklet Going to Britain as a guide to what new arrivals might expect In the shop or in the store wherever you go you will most likely find people standing one behind the other waiting for service readers were told They call this line a queue and your place in this Q is Z that is at the end of the line  The black and white cover photo featured a neat pensive young woman at a London train station beside a pile of suitcases that seem suddenly to have become too cumbersome for her to carry She has the bearing of a schoolteacher but the suggestion of fastidiousness draws attention to the one real oddity her overcoat is two or three sizes too big She is emblematic of the times and of the women I interviewed for Homecoming Voices of the Windrush Generation The book will be published into an environment that is still full of toxic narratives around immigration and at a time when the Home Office has failed to learn lessons from what has become known as the Windrush scandal 
OCT6	Shame on those who defend ‘the loving smack’ – it’s just plain violence against children	Back in around the same time it appears that he was starting his tech lessons with Jennifer Arcuri Boris Johnson as mayor of London reached out to anxious smackers  Following the London riots some parents including the Tottenham MP David Lammy thought Labour s restrictions on hitting might be partly to blame for the disorder These constraints Lammy said meant his constituents no longer feel sovereign in their own homes Johnson agreeing said People do feel anxious about imposing discipline on their children whether the law will support them I think parents should be seen as the natural figures of authority in this respect Bear in mind this was ages before we had got to know his more prominent parent minor celebrity Stanley Johnson or witnessed the pointed absence of Johnson Jr s own children at moments of career glory so it probably came across quite differently Johnson added There should be a clear statement from the government that the benefit of the doubt should always be given to parents 
OCT6	Boris Johnson is still gambling on winning his Brexit blame game	Very often what matters in politics is not how you play the game but how you place the blame No one knows this better than Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson His career would have been terminated long ago did he not possess a talent for wriggling out of responsibility for his behaviour in both his personal and political life The biographer of Margaret Thatcher Charles Moore who once employed him as a journalist sometimes refers to Mr Johnson as the greased albino piglet  We are now entering the most intense round of the Brexit blame game For three years Remainers have pointed infuriated fingers at Mr Johnson and the other frontmen of the Leave campaign for flogging a bogus prospectus that Brexit would be a painless piece of cake not never ending agony Since it cannot be the Brexiters fault that their promises have not been fulfilled they must find someone else to blame and that would be intransigent Europeans obstructive parliamentarians quisling civil servants and meddling judges With less than a month to go before the Halloween deadline and an election hovering on the horizon as well the issue of culpability is going to become even more fiercely contested We approach the endgame of the blame game 
OCT6	There is only one route out of the Brexit maze and Jeremy Corbyn must lead the way	Brexit weary as we are we must gird ourselves for the most significant few weeks for Britain since the Second World War The crises of our economy our constitution our political parties our identity and even public truthfulness are finally coming to a head We must save our country from the duplicitous clutches of a zealous nationalist right and for that the array of opposition parties and independent MPs with Labour necessarily at its heart must act  There is only one way out of the maze There must be a second referendum with the facts laid out in the light of the lessons of the past three years The seismic act of leaving the European Union with its disastrous consequences has to be reality tested in a single issue confirmatory vote A general election with its shopping list manifestos addressing multiple issues can never provide either the clarity or legitimacy for addressing such a question especially as it was a referendum that created the mess in the first place 
OCT6	The spirit of eugenics is still with us, as immigrants know to their cost	Birth control Intelligence tests Town planning Immigration controls It s striking how much of contemporary life has been shaped at least in part by the eugenics movement as Eugenics Science s Greatest Scandal a two part BBC documentary by science writer Angela Saini and disability campaigner Adam Pearson which began last week usefully reminds us  Eugenics is the belief that societies can be improved by selective breeding and that the state should encourage the enlightened to have more children and discourage the lower orders whether the poor the disabled or the immigrant from breeding

This plan puts it in peril	One of the disconcerting things about Brexit is its capacity constantly to rewrite the script of political dysfunction The latest government proposals won t work They do represent a significant concession but create an incoherent muddle leading to a bizarre outcome  Northern Ireland would remain part of Europe s single market but Britain would leave it There would be regulatory checks down the Irish Sea but not at the Irish border There would however be customs checks so the border would not be open as now And Northern Ireland s membership of the single market could be unilaterally revoked by its assembly which is not presently able to constitute itself and so the whole plan is subject to the notorious vagaries of Northern Irish politics

OCT7	Thanks to Extinction Rebellion, we’re experiencing a climate culture change	In the Mall up Whitehall or crossing Trafalgar Square early this morning the climate activists looked like rush hour office workers and civil servants mainly to year olds with no dreadlocked tree huggers SWP banners or black masked anarchists looking for a punch up Chanting about the climate emergency frankly they seemed a bit sheepish not used to it Their ordinariness makes Extinction Rebellion or XR especially effective farmers scientists doctors Cumbrians and other local platoons stand at the key roadblocks  After their successful capture of central London in April local cells or affinity groups all over the country have trained and planned for this protest Deciding who would be arrestable for highway obstruction and who wouldn t be because of jobs or young families they were primed to expect a tougher police response after rightwing press complaints against the friendly policing last April when officers were caught dancing at a blocked Oxford Circus 
OCT7	Boris Johnson’s Arcuri scandal is about public funds, not private life	There were a lot of denials in Jennifer Arcuri s interview on Monday morning with Susanna Reid and Piers Morgan who single handedly tried to play both good cop and bad cop But few of them were meaningful  Arcuri denied that the friends who said she d had an affair with Boris Johnson were actually her friends She denied that she would have gabbed to them even had they been and denied that any of the public money flowing into her successive startups was influenced by her relationship with the then mayor of London whatever that may have been Both have refused to deny that it had been a sexual relationship 
OCT7	The fantasy of a ‘national unity government’ is simply a gift to Brexiters	As politics descends into deeper chaos more and more of those in Westminster have taken retreat in the imagination of their hearts The unending speculation about a so called government of national unity is the ultimate act of escapism it provides deliverance from the chaos without the necessity of contact with the general public in an election  The summit of ambition for such a government are politicians that reached the middle ranks of the coalition or New Labour governments or perhaps those who have persisted in politics for long enough to see their Thatcher era reputations laundered by the passage of time It s like fantasy football where given the choice of any players in the world they alight on Derby County s first team a team that suffered the lowest points total in Premier League history 
OCT7	The US withdrawal from northern Syria creates the perfect climate for war crimes	Donald Trump s rash and foolish decision to pull the remaining US ground troops out of northeast Syria is a shocking betrayal of the Kurdish forces that were instrumental in destroying the Islamic State caliphate It opens the way for a vicious protracted struggle between the Kurds and Turkey s military which is poised to cross the border And that in turn presages more civilian suffering in a country that has seen far too much during the past eight years  Trump s impromptu order was taken against the advice of his generals and diplomats and without prior consultation with allies such as the UK that have forces in the field It came following a telephone conversation with Recep Tayyip Erdo an Turkey s president on Sunday evening Trump tried last year to withdraw US forces but was thwarted at the time Now he has got his myopic capricious way Erdo an has been pushing for months to create what he terms a safe zone on Syrian territory miles deep by miles long For him too altruism is not a motive 
OCT7	Britain is less polarised than the media would have us believe	Last week I spent four days in Milton Keynes the Buckinghamshire new town that sits in the English imagination as a byword for modernist architecture endless roundabouts and the fact that many of us still think that anything remotely futuristic is best sniggered at The Conservatives conference provided the mood music in between nights spent in a short let new build house in the neighbourhood of Bletchley I drove and wandered around business districts and ever expanding housing developments trying to get a sense of where the country has arrived  Contrary to the received idea of the place as somewhere strange and almost unique Milton Keynes reflects English politics in imperfect microcosm Though it has two Tory MPs saw its voters split pretty evenly between the Conservatives and Labour The local electorate narrowly voted in favour of leaving the EU by a margin that matched leave and remain s shares in the UK as a whole The population reflects the diversity of modern Britain and there are depressingly familiar signs of inequality child poverty rates across its council wards range from just over to about and the centre of town is smattered with those grimly familiar clumps of tents in which homeless people sleep 
OCT7	The police watchdog’s inaction over the VIP child abuse inquiry is a disgrace	The details revealed last week from a report by retired judge Richard Henriques that castigated the Metropolitan police over its VIP sex ring investigation beggared belief That disbelief is now compounded by today s ruling from the Independent Office for Police Conduct IOPC which has exonerated all those involved It is bad enough that a former high court judge can think senior police officers guilty of gross and indeed criminal misconduct and their supervisors of lamentable inexcusable neglect That not one officer involved in one of the most error ridden investigations in history has been held to account is worse But that the IOPC supposedly charged with monitoring the police should emerge as their lackey is incredible  The exploitation by the Met and the Labour MP Tom Watson of fantasies about sex in high places from the hapless Carl Beech is no secret The use of such accusations to destroy reputations and convict individuals without trial has become a trope of modern justice What is special about the Henriques report is the glaring injustice of the police themselves publicising as true stories about well known public figures without evidence or investigation 
OCT7	Extinction Rebellion has won the first battle – now it must win the war	Extinction Rebellion seems to have cracked using protests to transform public debate But as it starts another major rebellion this week it might find the challenge ahead is even greater  Extinction Rebellion s April protests were an enormous success Together with the BBC s Attenborough documentary and the school climate strikes they created a surge in public concern about the environment The climate emergency is now established in the top five most important issues facing the UK today at around the same level as the economy Since the April protests the government has legislated for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by and Labour is moving towards a much more ambitious target 
OCT7	The 12-week pregnancy rule makes the pain of miscarriage worse	Most of us will be familiar with the week rule the longstanding social convention that dictates that women mustn t tell anyone they re pregnant before the week mark in case something happens It s time to talk about the insidious effect it has on women who suffer a miscarriage early in their pregnancy  An estimated babies are miscarried every day in the UK with the vast majority occurring during the first trimester Most of these losses will be suffered in silence because it s considered so socially unacceptable to reveal that you re pregnant before weeks let alone that you were pregnant but now you re not It s baffling that in we seem so wedded to an anachronistic superstition about tempting fate that shames women into keeping quiet and heaps blame on the woman who dares to tell and subsequently loses her baby as though we were still in a bygone era where the stigma of miscarrying could mark you out as cursed Social mores around the week rule are brimming with contradictions it s fine to broadcast the minutiae of our daily lives on Instagram yet disclosing that we re pregnant even just to close friends and family is somehow transgressive

OCT8	Boris Johnson’s ‘deal’ has collided with reality. So what now?	Brexit has produced few scenes as absurd as the race in Westminster to count up backers of Boris Johnson s deal The DUP were on board Tory hardliners too Maybe disaffected Labour leavers as well Just one hitch the EU was never in on this deal There are complex technical reasons why the Downing Street plan was a non starter in Brussels but the broad outline is simple enough It would impose a new customs border in Ireland that would be both intrusive and unenforceable It would give a veto over every aspect of Northern Ireland s future to the DUP making a fragile peace settlement hostage to a party that rejected the Good Friday agreement  Was this plan even meant to be the basis for a negotiation or was it pure provocation a phoney offer designed for rejection setting the Europeans up as the Brexit bad guys in an election There are certainly Tory MPs who are stupid or uninterested enough in the detail to believe that the government offer was serious There is also a pro sanity faction inside Downing Street led by Eddie Lister Johnson s chief of staff from his London mayoralty years that believes in complying with laws and maintaining relationships with continental allies But that side of the operation competes with the revolutionary set around Dominic Cummings who has imported the single minded fanaticism of the Vote Leave referendum campaign to No 
OCT8	If we can’t call racism by its name, diversity will remain a meaningless buzzword	Politicians accuse each other of being cowardly collaborators who surrender betray and capitulate Commentators on television warn of riots Inflammatory language is increasingly the norm in public life yet one word remains muffled under a curious omert The BBC presenter Naga Munchetty was only the latest to discover that describing something as racist even in a measured way can get you into a lot of trouble  For many people of colour in largely white institutions this is a familiar prohibition that works to shut down much needed discussion and create a repressive and demoralising silence 
OCT8	Downing Street’s tough-talking ‘memo’ is part of a dangerous game	Hell hath no fury like a Brexiteer scorned That s the ostensible message of the lengthy memo sent on Monday evening by a Downing Street source to the Spectator s impeccably connected political editor threatening almighty vengeance if the prime minister has to extend the Brexit deadline yet again The anonymous author who might or might not be Dominic Cummings suggested among other incendiary measures withdrawing cooperation on defence and security from EU countries that support any requested extension or else forcing a general election in which the Tories would campaign simply to get the hell out This was the author suggested the EU s last chance Reject our offer and we ll make you rue the day  As the former cabinet minister Amber Rudd pointed out on the Today programme this is desperate stuff the sort of thing politicians say only when hopelessly cornered And cornered Boris Johnson is for all the heroic efforts to conceal the fundamental weakness of his position Johnson said repeatedly over the summer that while he was prepared for a no deal what he really wanted was a deal a point he made even more strongly in private when trying to coax moderate Tory MPs on board the project But it is rapidly becoming clear that he has failed to get one with talks now expected to break down within a matter of days 
OCT8	What we eat matters: to change climate crisis, we need to reshape the food system	The world came together last week for the UN general assembly and climate crisis was high on the agenda Many of the discussions focused on changing the energy and transport sectors to mitigate potential catastrophe Climate activist Greta Thunberg traveled to New York on an emissions free yacht to deliver her speech at the UN climate summit The point of her journey was to raise awareness that transatlantic flights generate significant greenhouse gases That message is getting across people are putting limits on the number of flights they take each year to conferences workshops and holidays  What was not high on the agenda was the impact food systems have on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental degradation A slew of high level reports produced over the last few months all argue that if the world is to make an impact on climate crisis the food system needs to be radically reshaped 
OCT8	The Irish border is a matter of life and death, not technology	 Spaff some money on some geeks According to Chris Cook s excellent account of Theresa May s Brexit negotiations with Brussels that was the instruction issued to the civil service by May s enforcer Fiona Hill in late  It had finally dawned on the British government that it had committed itself to two incompatible things One was that under no circumstances would there be a return to a hard border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland The other was that all of the UK was going to leave the EU s customs union May faced exactly the same problem that her successor Boris Johnson is struggling with you can do one or other of these things but you cannot do both If Northern Ireland leaves the customs union there will be border controls 
OCT8	Operation Midland made mistakes, but the presumption of innocence must prevail	Yesterday we at the Independent Office for Police Conduct IOPC published our report into certain elements of the Metropolitan police s Operation Midland the investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ring Some chose to condemn that investigation even before the publication of the report I understand that those who have suffered great injustices as a result of the lies told by Carl Beech are unhappy with our conclusions but many of the comments made are inaccurate and appear to be based on misunderstandings of the role and remit of the IOPC  Our role was not to investigate all the assertions made in the review of the case by retired high court judge Richard Henriques We did of course consider his findings and agree with many aspects of Henriques s review but on some aspects we do not 
OCT8	A new India is emerging, and it is a country ruled by fear	Four months have passed since Narendra Modi and the BJP came back to power in India and more seems to have happened there than in the last years The sense of severance that many experience today of being divorced from the workings of the nation exceeds even the helplessness felt during the suspension of civil liberties in the emergency of to and the political traumas that followed  This is because without the matter being explicitly articulated citizen has been set against citizen not just Muslim against Hindu or say Kashmiris against the rest of India but those who subscribe to the BJP s new conception of the nation against those who do not leaving one without trust in the other 
OCT8	Thanks to Extinction Rebellion, we’re experiencing a climate culture change	In the Mall up Whitehall or crossing Trafalgar Square early this morning the climate activists looked like rush hour office workers and civil servants mainly to year olds with no dreadlocked tree huggers SWP banners or black masked anarchists looking for a punch up Chanting about the climate emergency frankly they seemed a bit sheepish not used to it Their ordinariness makes Extinction Rebellion or XR especially effective farmers scientists doctors Cumbrians and other local platoons stand at the key roadblocks  After their successful capture of central London in April local cells or affinity groups all over the country have trained and planned for this protest Deciding who would be arrestable for highway obstruction and who wouldn t be because of jobs or young families they were primed to expect a tougher police response after rightwing press complaints against the friendly policing last April when officers were caught dancing at a blocked Oxford Circus

OCT8	The fantasy of a ‘national unity government’ is simply a gift to Brexiters	As politics descends into deeper chaos more and more of those in Westminster have taken retreat in the imagination of their hearts The unending speculation about a so called government of national unity is the ultimate act of escapism it provides deliverance from the chaos without the necessity of contact with the general public in an election  The summit of ambition for such a government are politicians that reached the middle ranks of the coalition or New Labour governments or perhaps those who have persisted in politics for long enough to see their Thatcher era reputations laundered by the passage of time It s like fantasy football where given the choice of any players in the world they alight on Derby County s first team a team that suffered the lowest points total in Premier League history 
OCT9	Brexit is a necessary crisis – it reveals Britain’s true place in the world	Who backs Brexit Agriculture is against it industry is against it services are against it None of them needless to say support a no deal Brexit Yet the Conservative party which favoured European union for economic reasons over many decades has become not only Eurosceptic it is set on a course regarded by every reputable capitalist state and the great majority of capitalist enterprises as deeply foolish  If any prime minister in the past had shown such a determined ignorance of the dynamics of global capitalism the massed ranks of British capital would have stepped in to force a change of direction Yet today while the CBI and the Financial Times call for the softest possible Brexit the Tory party is no longer listening 
OCT9	The big polluters’ masterstroke was to blame the climate crisis on you and me	Let s stop calling this the Sixth Great Extinction Let s start calling it what it is the first great extermination A recent essay by the environmental historian Justin McBrien argues that describing the current eradication of living systems including human societies as an extinction event makes this catastrophe sound like a passive accident  While we are all participants in the first great extermination our responsibility is not evenly shared The impacts of most of the world s people are minimal Even middle class people in the rich world whose effects are significant are guided by a system of thought and action that is shaped in large part by corporations 
OCT9	The flu jab saves lives. This is a fact worth spreading	With winter approaching we re getting into the flu season and right on cue NHS England has announced that every primary school child in England is to be offered vaccination against it This year s vaccination campaign will be the biggest ever with million people being offered free vaccines including schoolchildren aged between and  Children who are given the delightful term super spreaders are particularly liable to infect others so all of them aged between two and will be offered the nasal spray vaccine in the coming weeks 
OCT9	It’s time to rein in the fossil fuel giants before their greed chokes the planet	We ve long known that the big fossil fuel companies are responsible for a huge share of the world s carbon emissions Now the Climate Accountability Institute is publishing new data quantifying how much each of these has contributed to the climate crisis We find that chiefly from the combustion of their products the top companies have collectively produced bn tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane since of all fossil fuel emissions worldwide in that time The worst offenders in the top include Saudi Aramco number one Chevron ExxonMobil BP and Royal Dutch Shell  Seven eighths of emissions attributed to the top carbon producers is from use of their products petrol jet fuel natural gas and coal and one eighth from extracting refining and delivering finished fuels These carbon fuels are produced and marketed to consumers with the knowledge that they will worsen the climate crisis For the most part these companies are ignoring calls to urgently shift investment from exploration and production of carbon fuels to the renewable and alternative technologies required to reduce global emissions in alignment with the science based target to eliminate net carbon emissions by 
OCT9	The DUP’s support for Soldier F protests shows how extreme it is	Peace in Northern Ireland is a delusion The grim reality since the collapse of the power sharing assembly in January is that the historic divisions between unionists and nationalists have deepened still further More honestly it is about the division between one extremist branch of unionism and the rest of the people  Nowhere has this been more obvious than in the differing responses to the prosecution of a former member of the parachute regiment for the murder of two people on Bloody Sunday in Derry in 
OCT9	Don’t fear the rise of Fortnite and other video games – they bring young people together	At family gatherings I am the de facto tech whisperer a role bestowed on me by my father who bewildered by live streaming and electronic sports summons me for guidance For the last decade I have worked as a video game reporter giving me unprecedented access to this growing industry which has gone from a hobby conceived in the internet cafes of South Korea to a professional sport rivalling football  Until this summer the huge rise in popularity of video games played competitively and watched by millions on streaming websites such as Twitch or seen live with thousands of others at Colosseum like sporting arenas had bypassed many people over the age of But few could escape the headlines about the Fortnite World Cup and its m m winner There were finalists in the tournament in New York many between and years old whittled down from a total of about million yes that s correct who attempted to qualify They battled it out for a total prize pot of m the largest ever for such an event 
OCT9	Reforming the Prevent strategy won’t work. It must be abolished	The first year law student too afraid to pick human rights law as a module at university The student officer told to hand over a list of members of the Islamic society One thing binds these together the Prevent duty This week the Guardian revealed that counter terror police across the UK have been running a secret centralised database containing the details of the thousands of individuals who have been referred to Prevent the government s counter radicalisation programme Many of them on the government s own terms were unworthy of referral but fell victim to an increasing climate of suspicion  Prevent was launched in by the then Labour government with the supposed purpose of supporting people vulnerable to radicalisation and diverting them from terrorism before they offend In a statutory duty was placed on schools NHS trusts prisons and local authorities to report concerns about people they believe to be at risk The coalition government extended its remit in and in a statutory duty was placed on schools NHS trusts prisons and local authorities to report concerns about what they believe to be at risk individuals The whole programme has been criticised since its inception but the mounting pile of evidence of its failure has led the government to concede to a review which is now under way 
OCT9	If we can’t call racism by its name, diversity will remain a meaningless buzzword	Politicians accuse each other of being cowardly collaborators who surrender betray and capitulate Commentators on television warn of riots Inflammatory language is increasingly the norm in public life yet one word remains muffled under a curious omert The BBC presenter Naga Munchetty was only the latest to discover that describing something as racist even in a measured way can get you into a lot of trouble  For many people of colour in largely white institutions this is a familiar prohibition that works to shut down much needed discussion and create a repressive and demoralising silence 
OCT9	Downing Street’s tough-talking ‘memo’ is part of a dangerous game	Hell hath no fury like a Brexiteer scorned That s the ostensible message of the lengthy memo sent on Monday evening by a Downing Street source to the Spectator s impeccably connected political editor threatening almighty vengeance if the prime minister has to extend the Brexit deadline yet again The anonymous author who might or might not be Dominic Cummings suggested among other incendiary measures withdrawing cooperation on defence and security from EU countries that support any requested extension or else forcing a general election in which the Tories would campaign simply to get the hell out This was the author suggested the EU s last chance Reject our offer and we ll make you rue the day  As the former cabinet minister Amber Rudd pointed out on the Today programme this is desperate stuff the sort of thing politicians say only when hopelessly cornered And cornered Boris Johnson is for all the heroic efforts to conceal the fundamental weakness of his position Johnson said repeatedly over the summer that while he was prepared for a no deal what he really wanted was a deal a point he made even more strongly in private when trying to coax moderate Tory MPs on board the project But it is rapidly becoming clear that he has failed to get one with talks now expected to break down within a matter of days 
OCT9	What we eat matters: to change climate crisis, we need to reshape the food system	The world came together last week for the UN general assembly and climate crisis was high on the agenda Many of the discussions focused on changing the energy and transport sectors to mitigate potential catastrophe Climate activist Greta Thunberg traveled to New York on an emissions free yacht to deliver her speech at the UN climate summit The point of her journey was to raise awareness that transatlantic flights generate significant greenhouse gases That message is getting across people are putting limits on the number of flights they take each year to conferences workshops and holidays  What was not high on the agenda was the impact food systems have on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental degradation A slew of high level reports produced over the last few months all argue that if the world is to make an impact on climate crisis the food system needs to be radically reshaped 
OCT10	Johnson’s desperate for a general election, but he faces an unpleasant surprise	This is war That s the ludicrous intended message of summoning parliament to sit on a Saturday echoing the eve of battle in It also recalls the Suez crisis and that s a more apt Brexit comparison this maverick act of hubris the last hurrah of empire leading to national humiliation  The Saturday theatrical show is meant to shine a spotlight on the scene where Boris Johnson is forced by traitors to sign a surrender letter to the EU enemy to beg for more time But wait In the last act the people will set our hero free from these parliamentary villains when a general election resoundingly acclaims him as the leader to take them out of the EU and into the promised land 
OCT10	In its insatiable pursuit of power, Silicon Valley is fuelling the climate crisis	The climate crimes of big tech are legion This summer the Amazon burned Why In part because of the policies of the new anti environmental anti human rights president Jair Bolsonaro  How did Bolsonaro rise to prominence and then the presidency YouTube and certain of its algorithms that push people toward more extreme content played a large part As the New York Times reported in August not long ago Bolsonaro was a marginal figure in national politics but a star in YouTube s far right community in Brazil where the platform has become more widely watched than all but one TV channel Members of the nation s newly empowered far right from grassroots organisers to federal lawmakers say their movement would not have risen so far so fast without YouTube s recommendation engine 
OCT10	Nothing has changed since I was sacked. Drugs policy still doesn’t work	This week one the UK s leading experts on drugs policy Prof Alex Stevens resigned from the government s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ACMD His resignation came almost years to the day since I was sacked as the council s chair  My mistake years ago was to argue that UK drug policy was politically rather than scientifically based It seems that nothing has changed in the past decade evidence still takes second place to politics with regard to drug policy decisions Stevens resigned because the Home Office the government department in which the ACMD is based refused to allow the appointment of at least two other experts selected to join the council It appears their appointments were blocked after political vetting by the Home Office which discovered some previously declared criticisms of government policies 
OCT10	Streets make communities. Have architects realised at last?	Wonders never cease The Royal Institute of British Architects has just given a prize to a street Not to a vainglorious skyscraper or an iconic bunker museum or a luxury pad in a field but a living breathing street This street is not just a street but a council street Norwich council s chief executive Laura McGillivray claims no higher ambition than that new social housing should be a fabulous place to live She did not seek some architectural statement just a neighbourhood like the thousands that at least in the private sector have retained their popularity among Britons who have had choice in the matter for some three centuries  I have championed streets all my life and find it painful to hear Goldsmith Street s new residents say why they so like it The place just seems safe To see my little girl playing outside the front door made me cry We made instant friends across the street I feel like I don t rent it I own it Why should such sentiments be surprising from council tenants 
OCT10	Rightwing populists are on course to win Poland’s election. But resistance is stirring	In the decades since the end of Communism Poland has rarely been a country of mass demonstrations It has never had its equivalent of Ukraine s Euromaidan for instance But the four years since the Law and Justice party PiS came to power have been marked by public demonstrations from nationalist commemorations of independence day and Catholic run marches for life and family to LGBT rights parades pro choice protests and the Campaign to Defend Democracy s KOD fight against the government s perceived weakening of the constitution  Sunday s parliamentary election can be viewed as a test of the relative success of these different campaigns Despite polling that suggests Law and Justice will secure the best results of any single party in the post period there is much to suggest the country is increasingly divided 
OCT10	We have all been cornered into a no-deal Brexit that will harm millions	In the months after the referendum there was a chance of finding a Brexit deal that parliament could have voted for Both major parties wanted to respect the result Many remain voters were prepared to back Brexit But it required Theresa May to negotiate with the opposition to find a soft Brexit deal both leaders could support  The moment May took a different course she was doomed to fail EU support for Ireland s position on the border meant the government could not get the UK wide free trade agreement Brexiter MPs wanted A significant number in May s own party then decided only no deal would be acceptable From that point on it would be impossible to get any kind of Brexit deal through either the current parliament or the country in a second referendum 
OCT10	Street harassment of young girls should not be ‘normal’. I won’t rest until it is illegal	My little sister Gemma was years old when she was first subjected to street harassment Afterwards she asked me whether it had been her fault The conversation that followed was not an easy one  First she explained what had happened It was the summer before starting secondary school and she had been walking down our local high street in broad daylight A van slowed down beside her and a man leaned out to make crude sexual remarks about her body Petrified and confused she ran crying all the way to her friend s house 
OCT10	Brexit’s legacy for England will be politics as sectarian as Northern Ireland’s	You could call it Ireland s sweet revenge and both the timing and the irony would be historically exquisite It would come just as Boris Johnson s reckless government tries to bully Dublin on future Irish customs arrangements and as large parts of the Tory party salivate for a no deal Brexit that will cast the Irish peace process casually aside But if the general election that Johnson craves takes place it may not be long before politically speaking Brexit Britain comes to resemble Northern Ireland  To understand that this possible Ulsterisation of British politics is a genuinely serious prospect step back a bit and consider the way that electoral behaviour has been evolving in Britain Ever since political scientists mainly based at Nuffield College Oxford have worked on the British Election Study BES For more than half a century they have tracked the decline of the old industrial based two party system in which general elections were fought between the Conservatives and Labour who battled for the floating voters in the middle ground across the land 
OCT10	What I learned from my year of reading outside the box	If I have not quite been myself for the last year it s time I explained why I have spent the past months lost in other people s imaginations the breadth and scope of which have been a revelation This time last year I became a judge on the Booker prize whose winner will be announced on October I said yes instantly in delight knowing I would work out how on earth to fit in so much reading later  Over the past months I have been sleeping less answering my phone little not mentally present in queues or on public transport and roaming instead the mountains of Kashmir the villages of the Cotswolds colonial era Zambia and superhuman communities in Northern Ireland I have found myself decrypting Shakespearean time travel and complicated sibling love in Lagos

OCT11	Trump’s Ukraine call could get him impeached – but his Syria betrayal is worse	Donald Trump is set to face impeachment for a phone call that came to light last month The crimes he committed in that call were serious and merit the ultimate sanction that can be imposed on a sitting president namely removal from office And yet even since that conversation took place in fact this very week Trump has had another call that included an act that may not meet the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanours and for which he will face no such punishment but whose consequences will surely be even graver For they will be measured in life and death  The first of these two fateful calls was of course with the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy featuring a request that he dig for dirt on Trump s would be Democratic opponent Joe Biden Even if that demand did not form one half of a clear quid pro quo in which US military aid and future arms sales to Kyiv would be contingent on compliance though the grammar of the phone call very much suggests it did it is still an impeachable offence The soliciting of foreign interference in US elections has been forbidden since the birth of the republic It was one of the menaces against which the framers of the constitution were most determined to protect their infant nation 
OCT11	Caught out that it was Abiy Ahmed, not Greta? I can help repurpose your rant content	Huge congratulations to the prime minister of Ethiopia who has just been awarded the Nobel peace prize in Oslo beating out competition from hotly fancied regional candidate Greta Thunberg Abiy Ahmed was garlanded for his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation and for bringing an end to more than years of conflict between Ethiopia and its neighbouring Eritrea So yes this is a victory  But in a very real sense far more deeply felt in the content mills of the west it is also a tragedy Clearly Abiy s win and Greta s loss leaves countless angry hacks pundits shockjocks populists provocateurs and alt right conspiracists with an unexpected hole in their rant schedule The crusaders had their already somewhat familiar backlashes against this year old climate activist all ready to go and then this absolute dog in the manger goes and ruins it for them How dare he That is the most urgent question we face today 
OCT11	Boris Johnson has next to no chance of passing a Brexit deal by his deadline	For now we know very few details of what Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar agreed at their private summit in Wirral yesterday We do however know that it was enough for the UK and EU sides to enter the negotiation tunnel this weekend an intensive period for hammering out the details of a potential new deal Think the Channel tunnel only this time you re trying to drag two close partners further apart  It may be a technical extension of a few weeks but it still breaks the pledge on which he has staked his leadership
OCT11	I was proud of my literature award. Then came the talk of ‘box-ticking’	Let me tell you a story A few years ago months after this riven old island voted to leave the European Union and days after an ex reality TV host became the leader of the free world a writer happened to win an award In her speech she thanks this country which has been her home for half her life She thanks it for valuing her book for valuing her at this historic moment in time And she means it This validation means the world to her It comes from a country Scotland that is not exactly hers but in which she has settled In which she has produced a mixed race baby and become a writer  Afterwards she is whisked away for photos handshakes congratulations the heady stuff of success Only the following day does she discover what else happened that night Following her speech the head of the organisation returned to the stage and made an off the cuff comment about this award really ticking all the boxes It was nothing really just a lighthearted joke more at the expense of funders and their infuriating rules than the writer who happens to be Indian English bisexual a woman the daughter of first generation immigrants 
OCT11	The shake-up in Corbyn’s team comes at a critical moment for Labour	As the Jeremy Corbyn project hurtles towards an existential election an old alliance is reasserting itself The political partnership between Corbyn and John McDonnell sustained the Labour left at its weakest moments Jeremy is my best friend in parliament McDonnell used to say before being swiftly corrected by his wife Cynthia Pinto Your only friend  This explains why in part Corbyn was chosen as the Labour left s flagbearer in the leadership contest while the affable backbencher was then almost universally liked by his colleagues one or two things have happened since McDonnell was contemptuous towards Labour MPs he believed were spineless and unprincipled That contempt was reciprocated in kind when McDonnell attempted to stand for leader in Tom Watson wrote a blog wondering why the left was fielding someone so discourteous to his colleagues Surely it made more sense he suggested for them to field the kindly Corbyn instead 
OCT11	This must be the climate crisis election	The government that wins the next election stands to govern for half of the decade that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says we have left to tackle the climate emergency It will also oversee next year s international conference on the climate crisis COP the most important since the Paris Accord of We owe it to ourselves and to the world to make sure that climate is not a marginal issue at the election whenever it comes  Yet maybe we don t need to worry We have largely enjoyed a broad climate consensus in this country we believe in the science most of us don t indulge climate change deniers and there is agreement on the need to act Not for us on this issue at least so far the culture wars of the US 
OCT11	Fight Downing Street’s fake stories. But not by playing them at their own game	Since the end of the summer it has become apparent that Downing Street is now a fake news factory Not a day goes by without a new ludicrous provocation from threats to break the law at home and punish allies abroad to disobeying the Queen and parliament there has been a steady drumbeat of dishonesty emanating from No  But just as Boris Johnson and his team rip up the old rules of politics the rest of us need some new rules of thumb if we are to avoid dancing to their tune Here s my first attempt 
OCT11	At its best, Britain can rise to the challenge of racism. In the case of Windrush, it hasn’t	As Oswald Dixon was laid to rest in Salford on Wednesday the heavens wept One hundred years old and with no traceable family when he died on September the staff at his care home feared no one would come to his funeral They put out an appeal for mourners And on a rainswept midweek afternoon about showed up  Dixon was by all accounts a charming man with a wonderful sense of humour who had lost his sight and succumbed to dementia in his later years At his th birthday party he said that he always tried to live life as it should be lived by doing things for other people 
OCT11	Johnson’s thin coat of red paint could win him an election	The general election was a disaster for Theresa May She lost the Conservative party s overall majority lost what leverage she had in the Brexit negotiations and lost the argument to a Labour party campaigning with a simple message for the many not the few  But the dark cloud of Tory gloom had a silver lining the party gained half a dozen seats in areas that had hitherto been seen as Labour fiefdoms Stoke on Trent Mansfield Derbyshire North East and Walsall North were never supposed to go Conservative but in they did 
OCT11	How did one man kill 93 people over 35 years? He targeted the women no one saw	She was out in a club at a birthday party with a group of friends when she made the mistake of asking him to dance  Decades later Samuel Little could still remember the buttons down the front of the dress she was wearing and the intimate details she told him about her life that her mother was sick that she was one of three sisters But the one thing he couldn t conjure up was a name In the end she was just another of the women he killed in a murderous spree across the US that somehow continued unsuspected and uninterrupted for years It is amazing how easy it is for a woman to go missing but not to be missed astonishing how the seemingly obvious can be overlooked when it happens to women who are not properly seen It was only this week following months of prison confessions and painstaking cross checking that the FBI finally confirmed year old Little as the deadliest serial killer in American history 
OCT12	Brexiters’ adoption of war language will stop Britain from finding peace	Brexit s wounds will always bleed Britain cannot go back to normal whether a deal is done or not Normal in Britain now is a civil war without the bloodshed The warring parties cannot sign a peace treaty and pretend the fair minded sensible Britain of the national myth will carry on as before That land is dead and gone however loudly our trash prime minister tries to atone for his guilt with promises to bring the country together  The language of war has been the language of Brexit The right raids the dressing up box for Battle of Britain uniforms The prime minister damns half the population as quislings advocating betrayal and surrender Dominic Cummings s hero Bismarck fought three wars to unify Germany Cummings talks as if he s ready to unleash one to break up Britain Paranoid fear of enemies within once confined to the rightwing press and far right politics now defines British conservatism 
OCT12	A Nobel prize that dishonours the victims of genocide	So the highest award in literature goes to a writer who denies the existence of concentration camps that it was my accursed honour to find in Bosnia in who lauded Slobodan Milo evi mastermind of the hurricane of violence of which they were part and contests the massacre at Srebrenica in  Peter Handke is an apologist for genocide within living memory at the heart of Europe He says one thing while earth across the Balkans gives up its mass graves While Handke proffers his views the bones are facts 
OCT12	A speedy referendum would be a far better alternative than a general election	Should an election or a referendum come first While it is obvious that an election cannot resolve Brexit the concern about waiting for a referendum is that it would take too long who would govern in the interim and with what mandate  However that concern is based on the false premise that a referendum would take a minimum of weeks to organise This assumption is based largely on the application of existing legislation reviewed in a report in October by The Constitution Unit and The UK in a Changing Europe organisations 
OCT12	For both the Ratcliffes and Dunns, justice remains cruelly out of reach	Scenes of a little girl being reunited with her father on British soil looked wonderful but were misleading there s no happy ending yet In Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe was wrongly sentenced to five years for spying in Iran While her husband returned to the UK to campaign for her release their daughter Gabriella now five lived with the maternal grandparents visiting her mother weekly in prison Now that Gabriella is back in Britain to start school Richard Ratcliffe fears that his distraught wife will further deteriorate mentally and physically  While Zaghari Ratcliffe is happy that the Australian government managed to secure the release from Iran of dual British Australian citizen Jolie King and her Australian boyfriend Mark Firkin within months she s increasingly desperate for freedom herself What s the hold up The smart money is on a m arms debt owed by Britain to Iran It didn t help that as foreign secretary Boris Johnson the blundering idiot said that Zaghari Ratcliffe was teaching journalism in Iran she was on holiday 
OCT12	Ellen DeGeneres: should we judge her by the company she keeps?	Ellen DeGeneres is nice isn t she She dances funny She s got lovely twinkly eyes and she s made it OK for grans everywhere to love lesbians if they re like Ellen and are nice and do dancing Last week the comedian and talkshow host used a segment of her show to perform a four minute monologue on the importance of being friends with people whose views do not always resemble our own especially when it comes to awkward topics such as war crimes  She was moved to sermonise on this topic after being criticised on Twitter While watching the Dallas Cowboys she was photographed laughing along with the man sitting next to her who happened to be George W Bush People were upset she explained They thought why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president Nobody pointed out the obvious because you re both so rich and powerful that the team s owner invited you but nobody shouted Guant nam oh no she didn t either so opportunities were missed

OCT12	Fake views this bad make me thankful for the real thing	In the New York Times last week the columnist and reliable generator of mirth David Brooks imagined a conversation between a Democrat and a Trump voter The Democrat whom he named Urban Guy was trying to convert the Donald Trump supporter Flyover Man to his low view of the president Flyover Man was resisting Park for a moment any reservations you might have about entering the realm of Brooks s imagination and praise the man for at least owning his column s fictional status Per the conventions of the genre he could have put the quotes in the mouth of a cab driver and claimed the entire exercise as a piece of reporting  Instead boldly Brooks let us in on his screenplay in progress He is hardly a stranger to negative attention think of the outcry over a column he wrote about class and sandwiches a few years ago in which he pitied a poorly educated friend for freaking out in the face of the word soppressata 
OCT12	The Guardian view on the polluters: days of reckoning	The huge differences in the voting records of MPs on climate issues revealed in the Guardian s rankings today should immediately disabuse anyone of the notion that Britain s elected politicians are united apart from a handful of contrarians in their efforts to limit global heating  True a consensus exists in the UK and most of Europe with regard to the necessity of cutting emissions That is in stark contrast to countries such as the US and Australia where leading politicians deny climate science and promote fossil fuel extraction But acceptance of the evidence that shows the next decade will be crucial for efforts to restrict global temperature rises to C is the basis for action not a substitute for it Politicians should be judged on what they do And our research shows that the voting record of most Conservative MPs over the past decade on parliamentary divisions ranging from fracking to renewable energy subsidies and vehicle emissions is abysmal They are five times more likely to vote against climate measures than MPs from other parties with the prime minister Boris Johnson among several dozen MPs to get the lowest possible score of zero 
OCT13	Divestment works – and one huge bank can lead the way	Millions of people marched against climate crisis over the past two weeks in some of the largest demonstrations of the millennium Most people cheered the students who led the rallies call them the Greta Generation But now we ll start to find out if all their earnest protest actually matters  Perhaps the first real test will come on October when the board of the EU s European Investment Bank the largest public bank in the world meets to decide whether the time has finally come to stop expanding the fossil fuel sector This should be a no brainer decision the bank s staff has put forward a cogent proposal supported by campaigners across the continent that would end loans to new fossil fuel projects by 
OCT13	There is a crisis on campuses – but it’s about racism, not free speech	Have you heard about the crisis on Britain s university campuses Free speech is under assault it seems with students no platforming guest speakers because they hurt their feelings Political correctness is absolutely roiling higher education Students are vandalising curriculums forcing their teachers to replace white authors with those of colour demanding trigger warnings ahead of classes on classic works of literature and calling for safe spaces to be set up to exclude others for no reason other than their racial background or sexuality You can t even clap at events any more because student unions think it s overwhelming for those with PTSD The solution Jazz hands apparently  It is likely that some of this is already familiar to you if not in the detail then in the mood music There is now a mini industry within the media often backed up by unquestioning politicians based on the idea that Britain s universities are going to the dogs But let me tell you about another crisis that you probably haven t heard of In it was reported that the number of racist incidents in universities across the UK had surged by more than in the two years preceding A freedom of information request by the Independent showed a similar rise in the number of religiously motivated hate crimes at universities Antisemitic or Islamophobic incidents were reported in UK universities The situation became so dire that the Equality and Human Rights Commission a public body in England and Wales that promotes and enforces equality and non discrimination laws in the UK launched an official inquiry into what seemed to be an epidemic of racism A Warwick University student discovered racial slurs written on bananas he had stored in a shared kitchen In two year old men were arrested after a Nottingham Trent University student posted video footage of racist chants including we hate the blacks outside her bedroom door in her student halls 
OCT13	Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal would make people worse off than Theresa May’s	Back to the original backstop By conceding that any customs border will have to be in the Irish Sea Boris Johnson appears to have revived the possibility of a Brexit deal But the focus on the politics of the Irish border risks missing the implications of his proposals for the economy of the UK as a whole And as we reveal in our report for The UK in a Changing Europe these are significantly worse than was the case for Theresa May s Brexit plan  Indeed Johnson s motivations for ditching May s withdrawal agreement have little if anything to do with Northern Ireland Rather it is because the new prime minister sees the ultimate relationship the UK should have with the EU very differently to his predecessor Gone is the notion that a shared customs territory and close regulatory alignment on goods should form a bridge to the long term relationship As Johnson put it himself in his letter to Jean Claude Juncker The backstop acted as a bridge to a proposed future relationship with the EU in which the UK could be closely integrated with the EU customs arrangements and would align with EU law in many areas That proposed future relationship is not the goal of the current UK government The government intends that the future relationship should be based on a free trade agreement in which the UK takes control of its own regulatory affairs and trade policy 
OCT13	Dominic Cummings’s big ego has been a gift for the press	When journalists land a scoop it s only natural for them to boast about its significance So I guess we can forgive James Forsyth the Spectator s political editor for his hyperbolic claim last week that he had been the recipient of the most explosive Downing Street memo in modern times  In fairness it was hugely interesting and not just for its content It was a rare example of a supposedly confidential source being cavalier about his own identity Step forward Dominic Cummings special adviser to Boris Johnson Allegedly No for sure 
OCT13	Western tech giants must stop kowtowing to China’s bullying	It has been a bad few weeks for anyone wanting to express approval for Hong Kong protesters online A player of the Hearthstone online game for example ended a stream with a statement of support for those engaged in the protests against local police and government While doing so he wore a mask similar to the ones worn by many protesters Blizzard the owner of the game was not amused the player was immediately removed and banned from participation in Hearthstone esports for months  In another case Daryl Morey general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team tweeted and quickly deleted a message in support of Hong Kong s protesters It seems that the National Basketball Association was alarmed by the furore this caused in China where there is a huge following for US basketball Eventually the tweet was restored after some US politicians became exercised about the curbing of free speech in their jurisdiction But the point was made don t annoy the Chinese 
OCT13	Invoking the spectre of rioting is an insult to those who voted Leave	Using the threat of other people s criminal violence to demand you get your way is despicable from anyone It is the politics of the protection racket It s not sadly altogether unusual these days but what s new in recent weeks is threefold  First these threats are coming directly from government Not from the prime minister on the record but anonymously from senior sources and No briefings These threats are then being given credibility by widespread dissemination in print on broadcast and above all online by journalists who might do well to question whether they should be broadcasting or printing such comprehensive statements to which no one is prepared to put their name 
OCT13	The Queen might be admired, but the crown has seldom seemed so empty	We have Helena Bonham Carter to thank for the revelation that the Queen s sister Princess Margaret dead these many years is now available as she never was in life for civil consultations with subjects In that respect at least heaven seems to have done her a power of good  Bonham Carter was eager for tips via a psychic on how to portray Margaret in the forthcoming tranche of The Crown during which Margaret spoiler if you weren t alive then gets off with Roddy Llewellyn divorces and smokes a lot 
OCT13	Labour and the Tories promise to lavish us with gifts, but who will foot the bill?	By the grace of God and through the machinations of Boris Johnson tomorrow the Irish state coach will convey the Queen down the Mall to preside over the state opening of parliament At around am she will address the assembled peers and MPs My Lords and Members of the House of Commons there now follows an election broadcast on behalf of the Conservative party  Well probably not but she might as well It is always the case that the Queen is a jewel encrusted ventriloquist s dummy for the prime minister of the day When Harold Wilson came to office in Private Eye put the monarch on its front cover with the speech bubble And I hope you realise I didn t write this crap 
OCT13	Climate protests have roots that go deep into the rich history of British social change	The criticisms of Extinction Rebellion fit a well established pattern indulgent middle class crusties slumming it naughty children revolting for their own entertainment Then there are the takes on its tactics too disruptive too naive or too disrespectful and miles away from the actual concerns of real people  Extinction Rebellion will be assessed and evaluated against criteria its activists did not ask for Its tactics will be compared and contrasted one against the other with different strands of the movement categorised accordingly Good tactics will be those that are lawful unobtrusive and polite and don t really get in the way of other people s daily lives Whereas lobbying for reform politely asking politicians to change their priorities will be judged respectable but pointless 
OCT14	This sham of a Queen’s speech could prove the end for Boris Johnson	Folderol hokum and flapdoodle the usual absurdities of the Queen s speech rigmarole were reduced to their ultimate fatuity on Monday As she named those never to be enacted bills engraved laboriously on goatskin vellum they might as well have been scribbled in ballpoint pen these electioneering geegaws and giveaways embellished with thumbscrews on crime and migration But nothing matters here except the evanescent promise of an EU withdrawal deal always just beyond reach My government will she intoned as if sucking lemons but she has no government capable of doing anything at all  What heavy lifting it would take to turn this country into Boris Johnson s greatest place on Earth in its present miserable state caused mainly by him Leave aside Brexit devilment that hangs by a thread look at the rest of his empty prospectus If this was a hunting expedition designed to shoot Labour s fox it may have the opposite effect 
OCT14	The Kurds have faced their own ‘endless war’. And this is a dark new chapter	Last week Turkey began its long planned attack on Kurdish forces in north east Syria Days before the US president and his Turkish counterpart had spoken on the phone Donald Trump was reportedly supposed to caution Recep Tayyip Erdo an against a unilateral attack on Kurdish allies who had helped to defeat Islamic State Instead he sanctioned one  The Kurdish led Syrian Democratic Forces SDF had previously agreed to all the terms of a US sponsored security mechanism in the region They made real concessions removing fortifications and moving forces away from territory the Kurds had liberated from Isis on Turkey s southern border Erdo an however has had no such commitment to diplomacy The Turkish military used the agreement that had been in place for two months to gather intelligence on SDF positions and on Tuesday it went ahead with its real goal invasion 
OCT14	Spain’s imprisonment of Catalan leaders is a desperate move that will backfire	The Spanish supreme court s decision to imprison nine democrats and civil society leaders for organising a referendum on self determination in Catalonia marks a new phase in the struggle for independence Catalans have been calling on the government of Pedro S nchez for more than a year to intervene and attempt to bring about a peaceful resolution of the crisis Monday s ruling is an escalation that will ignite anger right across the region  Answering the calls of extreme rightwing elements in Spain the court imposed crushing prison terms on nine members of the government that I had the privilege to lead I know these people well They are dedicated democrats committed to the cause of peaceful democratic change to Spain s fragile post Franco constitution They include the speaker of the Catalan parliament and the presidents of the two most important non partisan civil society organisations Omnium and the ANC They are all pacifists and liberals 
OCT14	Does Labour really want to elect a female leader?	Not now darling There are really more important things than women And the Labour party There is Brexit the Queen s speech voter suppression almost every other issue and the unfettered egos of Boris Johnson and the posh bouncer Dominic Cummings And there is the Brexit party on the sidelines with its Stepford Wives view of femininity  This is not the time to think about that single issue of female representation because everything else is more urgent Except actually there is no policy that doesn t affect the majority of the population women And there is no future for Labour unless it attracts women voters When John McDonnell spoke of shortening the working week which is great I wondered how this plays out in the double shift of paid work and domestic work that is most women s lives Jeremy Corbyn s power is leaking away No simple chant can bring it back and if you want to call me a Tory for saying so more fool you Polls schmolls 
OCT14	The fantasy of Britain at war could be nearing its last hurrah	Can you hear it the theme from The Great Escape and the hum of Spitfire engines Such is the mood music that echoes around many leading Brexiteers men who seem to have all but forgotten the comparatively recent conflict centred on Northern Ireland but affect to be consumed by the distant stuff of Dunkirk the blitz and VE day Question marks still hang over how we will get to a general election but some aspects of the looming campaign seem certain If Boris Johnson somehow gets a deal with the EU and manages to steer it through parliament he will presumably continue to talk about a country destined to stand apart from Europe and set an example to the world of derring do mention Winston Churchill and use a lot of martial metaphors If everything comes to grief and he has to request the dreaded extension that stuff will doubtless be accompanied by rhetoric about remainer MPs and judges the obstinate and unreliable French and Germans and a view of Ireland as a country that has ideas above its station  Deal or no deal all these things will presumably be voiced by Nigel Farage and the Brexit party who like their fellow Brexiteers in the Conservative party have a vision of Britain unbound that harks back to the days of empire and a loud obsession with Britain s role in the second world war or their imagined version of it 
OCT14	Trump is right to take troops out of Syria. Now they must leave Iraq and Afghanistan	Donald Trump is right to extricate the US from Syria American troops have no strategic reason to be in that country If they stayed any longer they would only be sucked in deeper if they tried to impose a sort of peace they would be attacked by all sides The outside world has no dog in the Turkish Kurd fight  The US should get out of Syria as it must leave Iraq Afghanistan Saudi Arabia and the Gulf 
OCT14	A black woman was shot and killed by police in her house. We need real justice	Last month a judge sentenced former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger to years in prison for entering the wrong apartment in her building and killing Botham Jean her neighbor Lee Merritt the Jean family attorney boasted This is a victory for black people in America It is a signal that the tide is going to change here Police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions and we believe that will begin to change policing culture all over the world  But it would not Guyger s conviction didn t even change police culture near Dallas Before the ink could dry on the sentencing papers a Fort Worth police officer entered into Atatiana Jefferson s home He shot and killed her within seconds She was playing video games with her nephew A neighbor called a non emergency number for a wellness check because Atatiana s door was open late at night In Fort Worth police also killed a man in his own garage during a wellness check The officers were not prosecuted 
OCT14	A recession is coming. When it does, we need to demand a Green New Deal	American carnage and Brexit collapse detention camps and environmental breakdown the daily barrage of bad news makes it easy to forget that these are disparate symptoms of the same disease unleashed by the financial crisis  Back then activists in Europe and the US pushed for a holistic cure a Green New Deal to deliver necessary investments in people and planet But establishment economists waved them off preferring a shot in the arm of easy money Now all the grave symptoms of recession have returned and the old drugs don t work any more antibiotics to which the disease has already adapted 
OCT14	Two years on, the literature of #MeToo is coming of age	When Mary Gaitskill s MeToo novella This Is Pleasure was published by the New Yorker in July it didn t go viral in the same spectacular way as Kristen Roupenian s Cat Person did almost two years previously just as the MeToo movement was peaking  Cat Person spoke to many as though it were true At a time when women were sharing their collective painful testimony of abuse at the hands of men a short story that read like a personal essay pinballed across the internet Now that the frenzy has passed a new literature is in the process of emerging and it is subtle and nuanced reaching beyond relatability and identity and offering no easy answers

OCT15	Any Johnson Brexit deal sows seeds of future confrontation with the EU	Boris Johnson wanted to be prime minister long before he wanted to take Britain out of the EU The novelty of Brexit among his ambitions prompts a thought experiment imagine there was no referendum By some other craft Johnson has reached Downing Street Would he propose swapping full EU membership for the latest version of a deal being hammered out in Brussels today  Of course not It would be a bizarre surrender of international status and economic leverage in the world s largest trading bloc He would see no wisdom in quitting the single market erecting new borders and retreating from the rooms where big continental decisions are made Even the fiercest Eurosceptics did not advocate that path before They thought there must be a way to leave the club without relinquishing members privileges Seeing Brussels as a parasite on sovereignty they did not understand that EU membership was a component of British power 
OCT15	The Booker prize judges have exposed the doublethink behind our arts awards	You can see the dilemma On the one hand there is a bestselling novel that has nailed a political moment by a writer hailed as a prophet of our times On the other there is a verse novel capturing the hidden voices of black British women by a writer who has honed her art for years outside the spotlight To give the prize to Margaret Atwood s The Testaments would put the Booker in the centre of the cultural tide To give it to Girl Woman Other by Bernardine Evaristo would push a deserving but unsung book towards a much wider audience  That at least is how this year s Booker fudge looks from the outside Inside the judging room on Monday all kinds of arguments and rhetoric may have been employed all kinds of views aired and argued I have been on enough prize panels to realise how very odd these conversations can be how you get the feeling that it all could have gone differently on another day in another mood let alone with another set of judges Of course there can be only one winner of the Booker prize Until that is the very judges themselves choose to flout the regulations as they did on Monday and give it to two Confusingly it used to be OK to split the prize until the rules were changed after the prize was given to both Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth 
OCT15	The real voter fraud is this government’s new ID plan	What do you do when a government proposes a policy solution to a crisis that doesn t exist On Monday the Queen announced the electoral integrity bill which would require voters to show an approved photo ID before they vote in local and general elections in order to address concerns about electoral fraud  The only problem is electoral fraud in this country particularly voter impersonation barely exists And more importantly it s negligible compared with the number of voters who will be turned away by imposing mandatory ID requirements at the ballot box 
OCT15	Without encryption, we will lose all privacy. This is our new battleground	In every country of the world the security of computers keeps the lights on the shelves stocked the dams closed and transportation running For more than half a decade the vulnerability of our computers and computer networks has been ranked the number one risk in the US Intelligence Community s Worldwide Threat Assessment that s higher than terrorism higher than war Your bank balance the local hospital s equipment and the US presidential election among many many other things all depend on computer safety  And yet in the midst of the greatest computer security crisis in history the US government along with the governments of the UK and Australia is attempting to undermine the only method that currently exists for reliably protecting the world s information encryption Should they succeed in their quest to undermine encryption our public infrastructure and private lives will be rendered permanently unsafe 
OCT15	The climate revolution must be accessible – this fight belongs to disabled people too	Last week the Paralympian James Brown tried to glue himself to the top of a plane as part of Extinction Rebellion s protest at London City airport Watching the epic performance unfold I realised I hadn t seen a single person with a disability who was also a climate protester Brown is visually impaired so while he has no direct mobility impairment I don t imagine straddling an Embraer is an easy manoeuvre But it was a testament to democracy and made me think about the place that people with disabilities have within the growing climate movement As someone with cerebral palsy I want an accessible revolution It is everyone s future and that needs to be represented in both climate protest and climate policy  Let the plastic straw ban be the first and last anti disabled pro climate legislation
OCT15	Zelenskiy's brush with Trump won't help him end Ukraine's war	At a press marathon in Kyiv last week Volodymyr Zelenskiy declared that his mission was to be the Ukrainian president who would end the war That s a tough ask for a former comedy actor who had barely got his feet under the presidential desk before being snarled up in a Donald Trump impeachment scandal that has led some Ukrainians to refer to their leader as Monica Zelenskiy  Ukraine s war is rightly Zelenskiy s priority having now claimed more than lives since when demands for greater territorial autonomy in Donetsk and Luhansk collectively known as Donbass escalated into a separatist crisis with Russia supporting the separatist rebels 
OCT15	Bernie Sanders is right, it’s time to redistribute economic power	Oligarchy rules the United States the republic has been ransacked its commonwealth privatised and rentierism runs amok The richest of Americans capture an estimated of all capital income including capital gains corporate dividends and interest payments Since the financial crisis of almost half of all new income generated in the US has gone to the top The three wealthiest people in the US now own more wealth than the bottom million Americans And the richest family in America the Walton family which inherited about half of Walmart s stock owns more wealth than the bottom of the American people  The case for bold action is clear and overwhelming Only a deep reconstruction of economic and political rights can challenge oligarchic power and halt runaway environmental breakdown Fortunately Bernie Sanders has just announced a new plan that matches the scale of the crisis 
OCT15	How Macron discovered the soft power of the working class	 Progressive politics is doomed if it exists only to promote the interests of the middle classes French president Emmanuel Macron recently warned a large group of parliamentarians and ministers from his centrist La R publique En Marche LREM party and the Mouvement D mocrate Modem In particular he cited the issue of immigration He said the subject had to be faced and explained that he saw an essential difference between the middle and working classes the latter are in contact with immigration the former are not We have no right to dodge this issue The question is whether or not we want to be a middle class party The middle classes are not bothered by this immigration it doesn t impinge on them The working classes have to live with it His statement blindsided the entire French intelligentsia the political cultural and literary classes and recast a divisive question  But Macron s epiphany didn t stop there he appeared to be changing his mind about how France is organised territorially With input from local policymakers who he has previously disregarded moves are afoot for a plan to address the concerns of rural areas and medium sized towns those bits of peripheral France that gave birth to the gilets jaunes yellow vests insurrection

OCT16	At first, I accepted Brexit. Now it’s become clear that we must not leave the EU	Though we don t always admit it lots of us pro Europeans have spent the years since the Brexit referendum trying to juggle two essentially irreconcilable views of what should happen next One is that awful though Brexit is the leave vote must be honoured in the least damaging way The other is that Britain s departure from the European Union is so mistaken that it must be reversed once again with least damage  More than three years on some of us are still juggling even as Boris Johnson heads to Brussels The thing that keeps the juggling alive is not in the end an inability to make up our minds I am a remainer Full stop The question is how to respond to Brexit in the political circumstances of the moment in the best long term interests of the country as a whole The answer has evolved But it will soon be make our minds up time 
OCT16	Labour MPs who vote for a Johnson Brexit deal should lose the whip	Even a broad church must be bound by a common faith Labour s founding purpose was to secure parliamentary representation for organised labour and to use that power to advance the collective conditions of working people Sure there were some interpretations of that historic mission that were more radical than others Some believed it meant humanising the existing system others replacing it altogether Even New Labour which struck an accommodation with Thatcherism invested in public services the minimum wage and tax credits to improve the lot of millions of working class people  A striking exception in Labour history was the premiership of Ramsay MacDonald who in attempted to slash public spending and unemployment benefits When his own party refused to sanction such a remorseless assault on the British working class MacDonald formed a coalition with the Conservatives provoking swift expulsion from Labour and leaving his legacy in the history books a byword for betrayal 
OCT16	The DUP knows it will have to carry the burden of Brexit	The very existence of Northern Ireland means that a clean break Brexit was never possible A hard sharp Brexit for the whole of the UK cannot be done without causing fatal damage to the union For all the Democratic Unionist party s talk of the UK leaving the customs union and the single market as one nation there are few believers in the one nation these days  The fact that Northern Ireland is not only across the Irish Sea but also home to an idiosyncratic suite of political parties and a white elephant of a devolved legislature makes it the part of the UK that is rather more easy to forget than to accommodate One of the lasting legacies of Brexit no matter how it turns out is that it has reminded the British in Britain of the fairly ungainly nature of the UK state Ironically this has happened as much because of the European Union s insistence on avoiding a hard Irish border as it has because of the DUP s canny use of the Westminster spotlight 
OCT16	Why China fears sending the tanks into Hong Kong	Two decades ago many scholars began predicting that as China s creation of wealth continued to speed ahead the country would cross a threshold Once a substantial new middle class had been created they reasoned politics would tip decisively in a more participatory possibly even democratic direction  But while robust economic growth continued the first decade of this century came and went with no severe challenge to China s authoritarian model And under China s present leader Xi Jinping who took office in it has only become more entrenched last year he changed the longstanding rules of succession to allow himself to remain in charge for life 
OCT16	These are busy times for ‘No 10 source’. Journalists should refuse to be played	The prime minister s bonhomie with Leo Varadkar after their talks in the Wirral last Thursday took many by surprise It must have come as a particular shock to readers of the Times who just hours earlier had been told that the taoiseach had reneged on a secret deal with Boris Johnson to open the way to a Brexit compromise And the source of this story An unnamed Downing Street insider  It s been quite a run for No source In barely a week the increasingly ubiquitous attribution was behind reports that the normally stolid Angela Merkel had accused Johnson of trying to play a stupid blame game and the news that European states seeking to stymie the prime minister s Brexit proposals would go to the back of the queue for future trade deals 
OCT16	Today, I aim to get arrested. It is the only real power climate protesters have	A few hours after this column is published I hope to be in a police cell I don t yet know what the charge will be where I will be arrested or when but I know that if I go home this evening without feeling the hand of the law on my sleeve I will have failed This may sound like a strange ambition but I believe it is a reasonable one  If I succeed I will be one of many In the current wave of Extinction Rebellion protests more than people have so far allowed themselves to be arrested It s a controversial tactic but it has often proved effective The suffragettes the Indian salt marchers the civil rights movement and the Polish and East German democracy movements to name just a few all used it as a crucial strategy Mass arrests are a potent form of democratic protest 
OCT16	The EU praises ‘the common good’, but its words ring hollow	 The greatest challenge of our times Donald Tusk declared in a speech a few days ago in Athens is how to make out of politics what it once was acting and thinking for the common good At the moment he continued politics is understood as war even if shots are not fired everywhere almost everywhere some part some fragment of the whole wants to destroy invalidate or totally subordinate the others  One of the most unfortunate implications of Brexit is that we seem to have lost interest in discussing the visions for the European Union set out by its leaders We focus mostly on their tweets and indeed only the subset of tweets that is directly relevant to the fate of Brexit And the more the public loses sight of what else goes on in the EU apart from Brexit the fewer tools we have to engage with its politics in the future 
OCT16	Europe can’t keep shutting its eyes to the disaster in Syria	These past few days have been a watershed for Europe I m not thinking about Brexit but about Syria which increasingly looks like our st century Spanish civil war Western and European defeat in Syria by which I mean political and moral not just military defeat has parallels with the s when democracies were unable or unwilling to stand up to authoritarians when it mattered or even to play any kind of meaningful role in preventing a catastrophe that would soon enough engulf them too  Events in north eastern Syria are obviously tragic if not lethal for the tens of thousands of people caught up in them locally But they will also have an impact on Europe in more ways than we perhaps care to acknowledge Donald Trump himself has said as much casually pointing out that Islamic State connected foreign fighters now on the loose would make their way back to Europe He made clear that that is a problem Europe would have to handle alone As bad as that prospect is it is only one part of a wider picture that should make Europeans feel desolate at a crucial moment in history the Russia Iran authoritarian axis is now fully victorious on Europe s doorstep 
OCT16	‘Impostor syndrome’ is a pseudo-medical name for a class problem	The term impostor syndrome has enjoyed a lot of airtime in recent years yet it s always troubled me One person who I m sure has never suffered from it is Boris Johnson Between fortifying racists and humiliating our country on a daily basis I ll admit that there aren t many positives to be taken from his shambolic premiership But one thing it has done is finally shatter any illusion that many of today s politicians and by extension business leaders media executives and even lawyers are there on merit I ve got a radical idea that instead of focusing on the symptoms of poor mental health as we so often do we should begin to look at some of the causes starting with the assumption that those in power got there entirely under their own steam and that millions still struggle to make ends meet because of their own personal failings  Watching a leader such as Johnson bumble his way from one disaster to the next should make us all deeply sceptical about this idea of social mobility Not only does the concept necessarily create losers but it also neglects to mention the elusive middle class club mentality that underscores so many success stories Decoding the language styles and tastes of the upper classes creates a huge amount of uncredited and unremunerated labour even for those who do climb the ladder and manage to work the system to their advantage And once they do achieve success the sense that they are impostors and that their success is somehow undeserved seldom goes away

OCT17	This Brexit deal still won’t ‘get it done’ – only a referendum can do that	The red hand of Ulster says no Their blood red line has been crossed by putting a hard customs border down the Irish Sea dividing them from the rest of the UK They have lost the veto they wanted reduced to a vote only held four years after the dual customs union comes into effect aligned with the EU and even then they would have to wait for another two year cooling off period  These devilishly good DUP negotiators usually succeed because their No Surrender reputation has the other side of the table believing their stony faces are unmovable But this time it looks as though Boris Johnson has thrown them under another of his mendacious buses Of course this could be a last minute DUP bluff There are rumours not only of a new medical school and a motorway but also a daintily gift wrapped peace fund paid by the UK with EU contributions via the Irish government However the biblically well versed DUP won t be trading their birthright for that mess of pottage 
OCT17	Extinction Rebellion has built up so much goodwill. It mustn’t throw that away	Early in the morning the sky still dark behind him a man climbs on to a tube train in one of the less wealthy patches of east London and prepares to make a stand After weeks of climate protests across the capital its commuters have arguably grown used to navigating scenes such as this But what happens next in the footage shot by an ITV journalist and spread virally across social media is disturbing on many levels  Passengers on the packed platform sensing they re now going nowhere react furiously A voice can be heard shouting I need to get to work I have to feed my kids One man boosted by the crowd grabs for the protester s legs the protester appears to kick out towards his head The protester is white The man below him is black The protester is quickly dragged down into a surging crowd rescued only by the intervention of other passengers and a London Underground worker And suddenly we are a long way from cheering scenes of giant pink octopuses being escorted down Whitehall or grey haired pensioners submitting courteously to arrest 
OCT17	Labour’s nationalisation plans should be debated – but not with misleading figures	It s hard to unite nationalisation advocates and sceptics But the Confederation of British Industry has managed to do just that getting into hot water this week with an unsubstantiated claim that the Labour party s plans to renationalise utilities would cost bn These kinds of big numbers get media attention and help drive a narrative particularly when they come from an establishment organisation such as the CBI But by presenting an unbalanced view it has lost out on an opportunity for genuinely useful public debate  The organisation which lobbies on behalf of British business has already been forced by Labour to admit its mistake The analysis assumed that a Labour government would purchase the rail industry s rolling stock trains that are privately held and leased to rail operating companies even though this is not party policy While this mistake is important as it has misled the public its effect on the overall figure is likely to be relatively small

OCT17	Saving the union will need imagination – and we’ve lost it	How do some countries tear themselves apart while others keep together To the most vital question facing the UK the answer it seems to me lies in an old book I can picture its burgundy spine the black and white cover photo of three solemn Asian gentlemen wearing tuxedo jackets and sarongs and that title so good it is almost a spell Imagined Communities  Perhaps you know this classic study for its influence still reverberates nearly years after its first edition In it Benedict Anderson analyses how a national identity is manufactured so that a hunk of rock can inspire men and women to kill or die for it Prescribed it by a university teacher a quarter century ago I felt the thing practically buzzing with timeliness The Soviet imperial glacier had broken apart and politicians and pundits assumed the world s future lay in the nation state Yet Anderson argued that what nationalists saw as ageless and undeniable was to scholars modern and confected The nation he wrote is an imagined political community a collective waking dream fed by comparatively recent technology such as books in the vernacular language and common consumption of the same media Reading the same newspapers as one s neighbours on the train or in the barbers reassured citizens that their imagined world is visibly rooted in everyday life 
OCT17	By ending the free TV licence, the Tories are closing a vital window on to the world	It s not the biggest austerity measure this decade and it certainly won t gain the most attention but there s one Conservative cut that s quietly lining up to cause significant harm taking the free TV licence away from people over the age of  The free licences were introduced by Labour in as part of a plan to improve conditions for pensioners with the cost funded by government But in the Conservatives announced they would phase this out by and push the financial burden on to the BBC despite making a manifesto promise to keep up the m a year funding Unable to cover the cost and after a lengthy consultation the BBC says it will need all those aged or over to pay the annual fee from next June apart from those who can show they claim the means tested pension credit 
OCT17	Trump's treatment of the Dunn family was reality TV spectacle at its most heartless	When the grieving parents of Harry Dunn arrived from the UK at the White House they never expected to meet Donald Trump Their only hope was to get justice for their son a British teen killed by a reckless American diplomatic wife driving a car  Trump met with the parents But instead of promising to allow the British police to prosecute Anne Sacoolas who fled to the United States after striking and killing the year old he had a far more odious idea convince the family to meet Saccolas in front of a pool of photographers 
OCT17	Labour MPs who vote for a Johnson Brexit deal should lose the whip	Even a broad church must be bound by a common faith Labour s founding purpose was to secure parliamentary representation for organised labour and to use that power to advance the collective conditions of working people Sure there were some interpretations of that historic mission that were more radical than others Some believed it meant humanising the existing system others replacing it altogether Even New Labour which struck an accommodation with Thatcherism invested in public services the minimum wage and tax credits to improve the lot of millions of working class people  A striking exception in Labour history was the premiership of Ramsay MacDonald who in attempted to slash public spending and unemployment benefits When his own party refused to sanction such a remorseless assault on the British working class MacDonald formed a coalition with the Conservatives provoking swift expulsion from Labour and leaving his legacy in the history books a byword for betrayal 
OCT17	The panic over Labour’s ‘trigger ballots’ is misguided	Unless you re fixated on the intricate details of Labour s internal processes you ll be forgiven for assuming that any MP who is critical of Jeremy Corbyn can expect to be booted out of the parliamentary party There is currently a drip drip of stories coming out about Labour MPs being triggered Louise Ellman who quit the party yesterday citing alleged antisemitism was one such MP widely expected to meet that fate But the reality is that far from facilitating a Corbynite takeover the trigger ballot battles taking place across the country have allowed the Labour leader s critics to come out largely unscathed and better organised than ever  In the summer ahead of a likely early general election the party began its trigger ballot process It is a system that gives ordinary members a choice automatically reselect your MP as a candidate or trigger a full selection process which could bring in a different challenger Under new rules an MP is triggered when the request for a full selection is made by either a third of local party branches or a third of affiliate branches such as trade unions 
OCT17	The DUP knows it will have to carry the burden of Brexit	The very existence of Northern Ireland means that a clean break Brexit was never possible A hard sharp Brexit for the whole of the UK cannot be done without causing fatal damage to the union For all the Democratic Unionist party s talk of the UK leaving the customs union and the single market as one nation there are few believers in the one nation these days  The fact that Northern Ireland is not only across the Irish Sea but also home to an idiosyncratic suite of political parties and a white elephant of a devolved legislature makes it the part of the UK that is rather more easy to forget than to accommodate One of the lasting legacies of Brexit no matter how it turns out is that it has reminded the British in Britain of the fairly ungainly nature of the UK state Ironically this has happened as much because of the European Union s insistence on avoiding a hard Irish border as it has because of the DUP s canny use of the Westminster spotlight 
OCT18	For three years, we remainers have held our breath. This is the moment our dreams may die	It would be tempting to call this the moment of truth had truth not been an early casualty of a Brexit saga that was mired in lies and deception from the very start Even so the Brexit story which has twisted and tormented this country for the last three and a half years is at a moment of decision Outside parliament hundreds of thousands will gather to make one possibly last plea to stay in the European Union Inside MPs are due to vote on an agreement that if it passes will see us make the break in less than a fortnight thereby ending British participation in a dream that has animated Europe ever since the final bombs fell in  Almost everything about this moment deserves either regret or condemnation Forty months have passed since the referendum but MPs will have little more than four hours to assess the new withdrawal agreement governing Britain s departure from the EU That s barely time to read it let alone debate and scrutinise it To rush through a decision of such gravity is not the action of a country that is serious about its own future 
OCT18	David Cameron’s ‘greased piglet’: the perfect image for the Brexit moment	There s a real sense of occasion now we ve almost reached the bit of Brexit where the elites who gifted it to us don t have to pretend any more Always ahead of the curve David Cameron is leaning in to the coming winds of financial and ritualistic deregulation with demob abandon Speaking in Harrogate to promote his book on Thursday night Cameron predicted success for Boris Johnson and his deal As the former prime minister put it The thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people s hands where mere mortals fail  That s it mate Why keep your mouth shut about pigs any more We should just take it from one who knows greasing a pig makes it go better Given the dramatic degeneration of our public conversation over the past three years it feels right that Cameron chose to finally go there on the porcine front in Harrogate a town that was for so long a byword for a certain type of regional gentility 
OCT18	The DUP has been humiliated in Westminster – and in Northern Ireland too	Three days ago the Democratic Unionist party DUP seemed to hold the fate of Europe in its hands Ever since it has been forced to stand gloomily in the wings watching while Boris Johnson struts in the limelight backslapping those blackmailing burghers of Brussels as Sammy Wilson MP the DUP s Brexit spokesman called the EU leaders last year Whatever happens in the vote for the Brexit deal in parliament this weekend the special relationship with the Tories that enabled the DUP to act like old style one party rule had returned to Northern Ireland is over  Did the DUP really think it could have and hold Lord Snooty just for the price of a dinner in a Ballymena hotel 
OCT18	Boris Johnson’s Brexit dream is to shred workers’ rights and social protections	Less than a year ago Boris Johnson told the Democratic Unionist party DUP that no British government could or should put a customs border in the Irish Sea he appointed himself minister for the union upon assuming the premiership Tory hardcore Brexiteers solemnly pledged not to abandon their unionist brethren Look how casually their erstwhile allies were tossed overboard the truth is they never really cared What they really wanted and what Boris Johnson s hard Brexit deal gives them is a chance to shred workers rights and social protections  This is no conspiracy theory it is the expressed intention of the Tory politicians championing it Seven years ago a group of Tory MPs published a book entitled Britannia Unchained that argued that Britain rewards laziness that British workers were the worst idlers in the world and that too many people in Britain prefer a lie in to hard work Businesses were deterred from hiring people they claimed because of employment laws that made them fear taking a risk and hiring new staff The solution Repealing those laws or what should more accurately be described as rights Three of the book s authors are now in the cabinet Priti Patel Dominic Raab and Liz Truss 
OCT18	The London ban on Extinction Rebellion risks a perilous erosion of public trust	Earlier this week using section of the Public Order Act the Metropolitan Police effectively banned Extinction Rebellion s autumn uprising protests from the whole of London It was a bold and unprecedented move and it provoked predictably strong reactions For the home secretary Priti Patel it was a justified response to an escalating problem For Labour s policing minister Louise Haigh it was a grotesque overreaction and extremely worrying attack on basic civil liberties  If protesters feel they are under ever greater restrictions then the police undoubtedly feel they cannot win
OCT18	Justin Trudeau is a fake progressive. Now Canada must vote for real ones	How far Justin Trudeau s star has fallen In the rise of this hopey changey wunderkind was supposed to usher in a bold new Canadian era democratic reform ambitious climate action a plan to tackle inequality and a new respectful relationship with Indigenous peoples But his Liberal party s bid for re election ahead of the election on Monday looks altogether different this campaign is dominated by warnings in ominous tones about the threat posed by a resurgent rightwing Conservative party  It s not hard to understand why Trudeau s leftwing posturing has been exposed as a sham His widely hyped tax hike on the richest was actually a giveaway to the next richest of Canadians His embrace of a carbon tax became a cover for frenzied approval of fossil fuel projects culminating in his purchase of a C bn US bn tar sands pipeline He dispatched heavily armed police to violently dismantle a peaceful blockade of Indigenous land defenders He made Canada the second largest weapons dealer to the Middle East arming the Saudi war on Yemen And he pressured his own justice minister to exempt a well connected and corrupt engineering giant from a criminal trial Beholden to powerful vested interests Trudeau promised big but delivered small 
OCT18	When it comes to politics, the UK suffers from a chronic disease. It’s called satire	Satire props up what it should destroy Chris Morris a satirist himself understands this as well as anyone Satire placates the court he told Jon Snow on Channel news recently You do a nice dissection of the way things are in the orthodox elite and the orthodox elite slaps you on the back and says Jolly good Can we have some more  The return of Have I Got News for You last week for its th series only confirms Morris s point Poetry wrote WH Auden changes nothing Satire is worse than poetry it has made us a nation of giggling couch potatoes laughing at what we don t have the gumption to change 
OCT18	Donald Trump’s sanity is not the question. The real issue is how he got into office	While writing a New Yorker profile on Donald Trump in the late s Mark Singer attempted to discover something about the businessman s private thoughts as opposed to his outsized public persona When Singer asked him what he thought about when shaving in front of the mirror Trump did not really understand the question   OK I guess I m asking do you consider yourself ideal company Singer said You really want to know what I consider ideal company replied Trump A total piece of ass 
OCT18	This Brexit deal still won’t ‘get it done’ – only a referendum can do that	The red hand of Ulster says no Their blood red line has been crossed by putting a hard customs border down the Irish Sea dividing them from the rest of the UK They have lost the veto they wanted reduced to a vote only held four years after the dual customs union comes into effect aligned with the EU and even then they would have to wait for another two year cooling off period  These devilishly good DUP negotiators usually succeed because their No Surrender reputation has the other side of the table believing their stony faces are unmovable But this time it looks as though Boris Johnson has thrown them under another of his mendacious buses Of course this could be a last minute DUP bluff There are rumours not only of a new medical school and a motorway but also a daintily gift wrapped peace fund paid by the UK with EU contributions via the Irish government However the biblically well versed DUP won t be trading their birthright for that mess of pottage 
OCT18	A second referendum on Scottish independence is suddenly very likely	The crowds converging on London this weekend to march for a people s vote will encompass many thousands of Scots because their country voted by a handsome to remain in the European Union Yet do a vox pop north of Hadrian s Wall on a second referendum and you ll find most people assume you re discussing what s known as IndyRef a rerun of the referendum on Scottish independence which the unionist vote won by to  However by the time Scotland s first minister Nicola Sturgeon rose to address her party conference in Aberdeen this week the polls were suggesting that favoured Scotland seceding Significantly more people than not supposed Scotland would be wealthier in the EU and outside the UK 
OCT19	We marched with hope but few expectations. Yet history will side with us	This was the third People s Vote march I have joined the most sombre with the blackest humour We could all read the runes the best we could hope for was deferring the vote Instinctive Tory tribalism and Jeremy Corbyn s endless temporising had delivered insufficient momentum to muster parliamentary support for a second referendum  Still we cheered at the news that Oliver Letwin s procedural deferment to avoid no deal had passed But we knew that in a few weeks barring Boris Johnson s lies being quickly exposed or his misplaying of the politics again it could all be over and a new fight that could last years would begin To rejoin 
OCT19	A mea culpa from Pharrell Williams? Truly we live in an era of delayed woke	Musician Pharrell Williams says he is now embarrassed by Blurred Lines his controversial hit with Robin Thicke He says that he has only belatedly realised that such sentiments as I know you want it and guest rapper TI s lyric I ll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two could be considered rapey Now Williams says Some of my old songs I would never write or sing today I get embarrassed It just took a lot of time and growth to get there Williams adds I realised that we live in a chauvinist culture Didn t realise that some of my songs catered to that So that blew my mind  And there you have it folks behold the pop cultural phenomenon of Delayed Woke The generally male conveniently belated mea culpa of sexism which seems to say that you can behave as you like as long as you re very apologetic at some unspecified point in the future 
OCT19	Jennifer Aniston: The One Where She Breaks the Internet	If Instagram were a TV series then it is in the middle of one of those season highlights that you know everyone will be talking about the next day It s the explosion episode of Bodyguard Game of Thrones s Red Wedding any season finale of Succession  After the previous week gave birth to the thriller of the year the Rooney Vardy you dunnit last week provided another blockbuster moment Jennifer Aniston signed up posted a selfie with fellow Friends cast members and promptly broke the internet without so much as a champagne glass poised perilously on a gravity defying backside

OCT19	The campaign to stop Brexit has never found the right words	For a lot of Britons Brexit is still mostly just words Jargon vague promises dire warnings contradictory predictions a few catchphrases an alternately gripping and boring conversation that has been going on for years only occasionally accompanied by actual changes to everyday life It s a conversation that remainers have rarely controlled let alone dominated If they are finally about to lose the Brexit battle this may be why  For all their ingenuity and energy since the referendum they haven t done enough to undermine the messages that leavers have used to sell their project Nor have remainers produced equally effective propaganda of their own Much of the empirical case for Brexit may have unravelled over the past three years but remainers still haven t shifted public opinion decisively enough 
OCT19	David Cameron’s ‘greased piglet’: the perfect image for the Brexit moment	There s a real sense of occasion now we ve almost reached the bit of Brexit where the elites who gifted it to us don t have to pretend any more Always ahead of the curve David Cameron is leaning in to the coming winds of financial and ritualistic deregulation with demob abandon Speaking in Harrogate to promote his book on Thursday night Cameron predicted success for Boris Johnson and his deal As the former prime minister put it The thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people s hands where mere mortals fail  That s it mate Why keep your mouth shut about pigs any more We should just take it from one who knows greasing a pig makes it go better Given the dramatic degeneration of our public conversation over the past three years it feels right that Cameron chose to finally go there on the porcine front in Harrogate a town that was for so long a byword for a certain type of regional gentility 
OCT19	When I look at Extinction Rebellion, all I see is white faces. That has to change	Some Extinction Rebellion activists present climate warming as a disaster waiting to happen But for my cousins in the global south the dystopian future has already arrived A staggering million people in Kenya Ethiopia and Somalia are facing hunger caused by low rainfall Deadly tropical diseases are spreading more easily as the climate warms and people a year are dying in Africa because of air pollution But for many black inner city teenagers like me the climate change movement conjures up nothing but apathy Last week beneath the cloudy skies of north west London I asked some of my comprehensive school classmates what they thought about Extinction Rebellion One answered flatly What s that  Without the involvement of black voices the movement may slip into being a vehicle for climate colonialism

OCT19	The Observer view on Boris Johnson’s sorry Brexit deal	Boris Johnson is a prime minister without a mandate He has never faced an election and has lost every vote he has put to the House of Commons Yet time and again he has proved his willingness to ride roughshod over parliament in order to get his way  Yesterday was no different MPs were disgracefully given just a few hours to scrutinise the terms of the most important decision the country has faced in decades But he miscalculated badly Parliament reasserted its sovereignty voting to withhold approval of his EU deal until MPs have a chance to scrutinise the relevant legislation effectively forcing him by law to request an extension from the EU 
OCT20	Europe is fed up with Brexit, but it’s still best for all if Britain stays in	Granted Brexit is driving everyone mad We Brits owe all our European friends a sincere apology a bottle of whisky and complimentary tickets to a Royal Shakespeare Company performance of Hamlet For Britain is now Hamlet forever agonising over whether Brexit is to be or not to be  So I can perfectly understand why Europeans such as French president Emmanuel Macron just want to be shot of us so as to push ahead with an important ambitious agenda for the whole European Union Nonetheless it remains in Europe s own enlightened long term interest to go the extra kilometre This means concretely that if the British parliament does not approve Boris Johnson s new deal this week the EU should offer an article extension as formally requested in the letter sent though childishly not signed by Johnson 
OCT20	Rest assured, Boris Johnson won’t be allowed to ride roughshod over our laws	Despite another defeat in Saturday s parliamentary sitting Boris Johnson may yet have the last laugh While all eyes are on the Brexit related legislation and there is much to get through parliament there is still the Queen s speech which last week laid out the government s legislative agenda A vote on that agenda is expected in the coming week and without a majority of MPs Johnson could lose again In the past such a defeat has tended to result in the prime minister resigning but with Johnson and his chief adviser Dominic Cummings in No precedent and convention are out of the window  What Letwin has achieved with his amendment will only hold off no deal or the hardest of Brexits in the short term
OCT20	How do we produce our magazines? Here is some of the daily decision-making	In the life of every publication there is a rhythm For readers it is felt when the fresh edition arrives and is quiet until the next one But for those who produce the publication the beat is incessant To help convey to readers something of the pulse rate inside a major journalism organisation I asked two editors to describe their typical week day by day  Melissa Denes edits Weekend the magazine accompanying your Saturday Guardian and Harriet Green edits the Observer Magazine which arrives with that paper on Sundays As they gave me their finished accounts both independently remarked on how exhausting it was to think about and chronicle all their weekly processes 
OCT20	Boris Johnson’s Saturday drama turns to farce – and it was all his own fault	Everything that could be done had been done to secure a victory for Boris Johnson on what had been billed as Super Saturday He had come back from Brussels with his so called new deal to the sound of the massed brass bands of the pro Brexit media trumpeting praise for a stunning achievement personal triumph insert more sycophantic hyperbole here Some European leaders tried to help him frame the choice before parliament as new deal or no deal Suggestions that the EU might not grant another extension to the withdrawal date were designed to spook MPs into voting yes for fear of hurling Britain into a crash out Brexit  Cabinet ministers were deployed to man mark any Conservative MP whose vote was doubtful Heavy breathing Tory whips said they were going to get medieval with rebels The self styled Tory Spartans who would have spat out the Johnson deal as treachery if it had been presented by Theresa May had fallen into line Some of them had begun to see the ridiculousness of being Brexiters who never actually vote for Brexit 
OCT20	Have you heard of the catastrophic men theory of history? Step forward Boris Johnson...	Boris Johnson concludes his Churchill biography with splutters against historians who insist the story of humanity is not the story of great men and shining deeds The story of Winston Churchill he cries is a pretty withering retort to all that malarkey He and he alone made the difference  The story of Boris Johnson withers too He is shrivelling Britain making it cramped poor and irrelevant Modern historians may sniff at the th century notion that the history of what man has accomplished in this world is at bottom the History of the Great Men to use Thomas Carlyle s words The rest of us should not be so complacent and register the capacity of catastrophic men and women to change the world for the worse 
OCT20	The Extinction Rebels have a noble cause. What they don’t need now is tactical stupidity	Considering its rapid expansion formal commitment to causing chaos and decentralised approach to mobilising Extinction Rebellion has been certainly until last week s underground setback a triumph of non violent direct action  Polls have suggested impressive levels of support from non protesters As for the rebels name calling including by the prime minister dredging up a s term from his insult back catalogue only underlined their organisational flair These same uncooperative crusties have persuaded a previous parliament to declare a climate emergency changed the national conversation and initiated policy change 
OCT20	At least England’s footballers lead by example in the face of racism	If you want to feel good about Britain right now or at least England where do you look Not to our parliament in the latter stages of its descent into something close to chaos the green spaces around the Palace of Westminster slowly being churned into mud by ceaseless protests And there is little comfort to be had turning to our prime minister a man so renowned for dishonesty that the likelihood that he will break his word is baked into the political calculations of his opponents  Across the world our reputation as a serious minded pragmatic even perfidious nation is in tatters and our former sense of ourselves as a reasonable level headed no nonsense people is difficult to sustain after the past three and half years of political turmoil 
OCT20	Harold Bloom was right to extol great literature, but was often blind to who was neglected	There are good ways of being old fashioned and there are bad One may seek to preserve important practices or ways of thinking in the face of fashion One may also be blind to the ways in which tradition can work to protect certain forms of power or marginalise certain groups of people The US literary critic Harold Bloom who died last week aged was a classic example of someone old fashioned in both ways  One of the most influential critics of the past half century Bloom was also one of the most divisive He railed against what he called the school of resentment the Feminists Afrocentrists Marxists Foucault inspired New Historicists or Deconstructors who were not interested in literature but only wanted to advance their programs for social change 
OCT20	Farewell the ‘porn block’ – a PR exercise and lousy policy	The UK government s porn block was a dead man walking for months if not years It is long overdue that this attempt to curb children s access to online pornography is scrapped Almost two years ago a close colleague and I sat in a meeting with one of the policymakers who had recently been asked to implement the proposal The pained look on his face when we queried his progress confirmed our suspicions that it was an impossible task It was clear to many that the block could and would never come to pass  The plan did not have just one achilles heel it had many 
OCT20	Grassroots loyalists think this Brexit deal is a sell-out. That’s why tensions are running so high	There has been much talk of late about Irish border communities being threatened by a hard border But not about border unionist communities which by and large have been ignored by visiting camera teams and have a completely different narrative while talk of a hard border has a less negative ring in their ears  The reason is simple and it is summed up by the common use of two terms by border unionists to describe the IRA campaign and the role that they see the Irish Republic to have played during the Troubles ethnic cleansing and safe haven 
OCT21	Labour MPs who help Boris Johnson to victory will not be forgiven	Get it done Move on The government expects sheer Brexit fatigue to carry it over the line in this war of attrition Disingenuous and dishonest it blames everyone but itself for this purgatory The other side must back down but it won t give way on a single amendment in this week of votes  The prime minister could get a deal agreed instantly but instead of compromise on customs union or referendum he presses on for the hardest of Brexits even more brutally damaging than Theresa May s oft rejected deal Dithering Labour MPs toying with getting it done may hold the balance Here s the question why would anyone who rejected May s lesser evil as too hard vote for Boris Johnson s 
OCT21	Spanish politicians are spinning the Catalan crisis to suit their own interests	All last week Barcelona went to sleep to the sound of police helicopters hovering overhead as smoke rose in columns from burning barricades in the city centre Each day brought new images of riot police firing foam and rubber bullets into large crowds and swatting stragglers with batons Each day too brought news of angry young people in hooded hordes sowing chaos in the streets Helmeted television journalists scrambled behind them broadcasting a shaky live stream The background noise evoked war films and video games  Things have become messy in Catalonia The harsh sentencing of pro independence politicians and civic leaders has unleashed a tidal wave of indignation On the day it was announced thousands of protesters shut down the Barcelona El Prat airport the action called via an anonymous highly centralised app called Tsunami Democr tic Over the next several days roads were blocked railways sabotaged and demonstrations held and pro independence mayors announced they would march into the capital to protest 
OCT21	Poland's rightwing populist win should be a wake-up call for democrats worldwide	The Polish parliamentary elections last Sunday will have profound national consequences but also include political lessons that go well beyond Poland s borders The elections disprove important received wisdom about far right and populist politics and the results should cause reflection among liberal democrats around the world  First and foremost the ruling rightwing populist Law and Justice party PiS increased its vote share by from to and regained its majority in the lower house of parliament Sejm However because of a different electoral system and strategic collaboration by the main opposition parties PiS lost its majority in the upper house Senat While the Sejm is the more powerful house the Senat can veto legislation and plays a major role in the appointment and removal of some key political figures including the president of the supreme chamber of control who supervises the bureaucracy 
OCT21	Little by little, big tech’s veneer of invincibility is starting to crack	Just for a moment let us pull our eyes away from Brexit and focus instead on two interwoven stories about how the world has gone wrong and what it might take to start to put it right At the centre of each is a woman who has set herself against the male dominated corporations we collectively know as big tech What is happening is about high politics and the grind of government rather than street level noise and mass activism which is maybe why it still seems overlooked  The frontrunner in the US Democratic party s crowded nomination contest seems to be the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren Over the past couple of years she has hardened her intentions to tackle the power of Apple Google Amazon and Facebook Thanks to leaked recordings of Mark Zuckerberg addressing a meeting of his staff we know he seems to consider her plans an existential threat that would suck for us and that he would go to the mat to fight them 
OCT21	Meghan just wants to be treated fairly by the press – and I don’t blame her	Once upon a time there was a beautiful little girl who grew up in a sunny place far far away This little girl grew up thinking that with passion and hard work she could change the world Then one day she met a prince and fell in love and everyone thought she would live happily ever after Especially her  It was hard not to watch Sunday s ITV interview with Meghan or the Duchess of Sussex in our fairytale version and not feel sympathy for a woman who has found herself alone with a new baby in an alien environment After all the year after having your first child is a challenge for most mothers soreness lack of sleep the loss of self the list goes on Most of us keep it together by bingeing on crap TV while reminding ourselves as we slap frozen cabbage leaves on our boobs just how lucky we are And we are of course so so lucky Then a friend or colleague stops and asks how we are you know how we really are and we have a bit of a weep and apologise for being self pitying and ridiculous and carry on 
OCT21	Mark Zuckerberg's plea for the billionaire class is deeply anti-democratic	Hitting back against presidential candidate Bernie Sanders s assertion that billionaires should not exist and his calls to tax their wealth at much higher rates Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg worth bn took to Fox News to defend his beleaguered class Billionaires he argued should not exist in a cosmic sense but in reality most of them are simply people who do really good things and kind of help a lot of other people And you get well compensated for that He warned too about the dangers of ceding too much control over their wealth to the government allegedly bound to stifle innovation and competition and deprive the market of his fellow billionaires funding for philanthropy and scientific research   Some people think that okay well the issue or the way to deal with this sort of accumulation of wealth is Let s just have the government take it all Zuckerberg said And now the government can basically decide you know all of the medical research that gets done What he didn t mention is that Sanders s tax would cost him bn in its first year 
OCT21	If Johnson adds a customs union, remainers should finally accept his deal	Those still fighting to keep the United Kingdom in the EU are doing themselves no favours Despite Saturday s protests for a second referendum and Commons manoeuvring a significant portion of the public backs the UK s vote to leave the EU and democracy requires it to do so  The terms of exit previously negotiated by Theresa May were rejected by remainers but without any coherent strategy to push that rejection to a satisfactory conclusion The new deal from Boris Johnson is worse but even Magna Carta was not perfect The deal available is serviceable for withdrawal on October It should be passed and the nation put out of its misery 
OCT21	The spectre of Syria silenced Arab protest. But now it’s finding its voice	There is a bogeyman that haunts the Arab world Its spectre looms large and sinister over Arab politics Its arrival is threatened like a curse as a warning by parents to precocious children when they misbehave Its name is Syria A suppurating wound that will not heal the Syrian civil war continues to bleed lives and draw in neighbours and allies involved in their own proxy battles  Just as it seems one front is closed a twist restarts hostilities the latest involving a capricious US president and an insecure Turkish one with the Kurds in northern Syria bearing the brunt An abrupt American withdrawal paved the way for yet another conflagration yet another power calculus as Bashar al Assad extends support to the Kurds and yet another lease of life for Islamic State More than people are on the move in northern Syria And at least people with suspected links to Isis have reportedly broken out of a camp in north east Syria raising the possibility of a new shot in the arm for the terror group 
OCT21	Why is Elizabeth Warren vague on healthcare? To allow herself wiggle room	A lot of people are gunning for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as she runs the gauntlet to the top of the Democratic presidential field  So many wonder why Warren is vague on healthcare financing as Senator Amy Klobuchar enunciated emphatically during the last TV debate 
OCT21	Europe is fed up with Brexit, but it’s still best for all if Britain stays in	Granted Brexit is driving everyone mad We Brits owe all our European friends a sincere apology a bottle of whisky and complimentary tickets to a Royal Shakespeare Company performance of Hamlet For Britain is now Hamlet forever agonising over whether Brexit is to be or not to be  So I can perfectly understand why Europeans such as French president Emmanuel Macron just want to be shot of us so as to push ahead with an important ambitious agenda for the whole European Union Nonetheless it remains in Europe s own enlightened long term interest to go the extra kilometre This means concretely that if the British parliament does not approve Boris Johnson s new deal this week the EU should offer an article extension as formally requested in the letter sent though childishly not signed by Johnson 
OCT22	Don't buy the hype: Boris Johnson's Brexit deal did not win approval	It s not over For a few anxious or jubilant depending on which tribe you belong to minutes between pm and pm it seemed as if the Brexit saga might just be on the verge of resolution after three and a half agonisingly long years The House of Commons voted to allow Boris Johnson s withdrawal agreement bill to advance to the next stage a prize that had eluded Theresa May not once not twice but three times  What s more MPs gave it a green light more emphatically than even the most ardent Brexiters had dared hope While May had been crushed by triple figure majorities Johnson won his meaningful vote by to votes a majority of Put another way and as if to reflect this divided nation through what have become the defining numbers of the Brexit era he won by to 
OCT22	Remain is now a political identity that will shape Britain long after Brexit	A remainer was once defined as a voter who wanted the UK to stay in the EU Then the term got looser scooping up politicians who pledged to fulfil the referendum mandate while failing some other test of Eurosceptic rigour  Even some of the MPs who endorsed Boris Johnson s deal on Tuesday night bringing Britain far closer to the Brexit point of no return than it came when Theresa May was in Downing Street will not qualify for True Leaver status not in the eyes of zealous anti Brussels puritans 
OCT22	Remember Thatcher’s Britain? That’s where this Brexit deal would take us	Hopes for a second referendum on Brexit are receding as more and more Tories show their true colours and fall in line behind Boris Johnson and his controversial deal They have passed through all the stages of grief to arrive at acceptance of a Brexit that they know will make Britain poorer and weaker One of their leading lights the former home secretary Amber Rudd explicitly acknowledged that the deal would hurt the economy but she said it s the right thing to do because we had a referendum  Pursuing an economically devastating Brexit is a choice not a necessity The referendum was a mandate to change the political basis of our relationship with Europe not to terminate all our economic cooperation altogether as envisaged in the new withdrawal agreement The proposal would give Britain the same economic relationship with the EU as distant countries such as Mexico or Canada That s why the extremist interpretation of the referendum that was begun by Theresa May and accelerated by Johnson can and must be resisted If that cannot be achieved by a second referendum even the most ardent campaigners now accept they don t have the numbers then it is vital that politicians return to the arena of compromise 
OCT22	I work on Operation Yellowhammer. We all know what we’re doing is for show	The many thousands of civil servants who like me work on no deal Brexit preparations know that Twitter is increasingly a more reliable guide to what s about to go down than anything our bamboozled civil service bosses pass on to us This is partly the result of a prime minister whose showmanship has turned zombie and started gorging itself on our institutions and partly the result of the fact that we just can t seem to get enough of it The conventions of political theatre not proper risk management are now ensorcelling hundreds more staff into Operation Yellowhammer the government s planning for a no deal Brexit as Michael Gove so portentously announced to Sky News Sophy Ridge on Sunday  The official reason we are given for this new phase is that the UK thanks to its self hating parliament can t be sure that the EU will grant a Brexit extension thus making no deal more likely But the real reason of course is to help to terrify craven MPs into voting for the deal by carrying out a pre Halloween dress rehearsal of what no deal will actually feel like 
OCT22	The most shocking thing about today’s Brexit debate? The lack of information	There s more to life than money Or to be more specific your money along with your job and any public services you may be unlucky enough to rely on  That was the gist of Sajid Javid s extraordinarily ill judged letter to the Treasury select committee in which he grandly declined to provide it with a proper analysis of how Boris Johnson s last minute Brexit deal will affect the economy There is more to delivering Brexit than spreadsheets or impact assessments said the man whose actual job is making such assessments so the rest of us know where our money s going because really this is about securing voters trust in politicians What happens to trust if the economy craters because MPs were intimidated into blindly backing Brexit without understanding the consequences Well let s hope we re not about to find out 
OCT22	Deborah Orr was unflinchingly true to herself. Who among us can say that?	When Deborah Orr rang me up to ask me to write a piece for the now defunct arts magazine City Limits in the star spot I was shocked I wouldn t be asking you if you weren t capable of doing something great she said So don t be stupid I really didn t want her to think I was stupid Then I met her She was in leather trousers fag in one hand scotch in the other with a huge dog  Effortlessly cool Absolutely singular We became lifelong friends I informed her I was a feminist and she said she had never heard anyone say that before We would argue about that over the years but whatever she identified as it didn t matter to me She broke conventions and boundaries as easily as others breathe doing things in her inimitable Deborah way Scary Thrilling Shocking 
OCT22	Hillary Clinton's attacks on Tulsi Gabbard are embarrassing	Hillary Clinton has kept a relatively low profile since her embarrassing election defeat popping up only occasionally to make out of touch elitist comments that confirm why she lost So it was somewhat surprising to hear her weigh in on the Democratic primary with a truly bizarre comment about of all people Tulsi Gabbard  Clinton accused the Hawaii congresswoman of being groomed by outside forces saying I think they ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third party candidate She s the favorite of the Russians There is some dispute about whether Clinton meant it was the Russians or Republicans who were pushing a third party Gabbard candidacy but a Clinton spokesman asked about the comments replied if the nesting doll fits clearly implying it was dastardly Russians 
OCT22	Kurdish female fighters are once again pawns in a bigger political game	In August Marie Claire published an unusual photo shoot The women in the stylised images were not in fancy haute couture but instead wore khaki jumpsuits and held machine guns These were the female fighters of the YPG the main Kurdish group of the Syrian Democratic Forces in Rojava a de facto autonomous region in northern Syria  These women were praised for their bravery in fighting against the most unfathomable evil of our times Isis The world championed them as an antidote to the death cult originating from the Middle East which spread its ideas to Europe and the US At the same time the women remained quite invisible to Turkish audiences because of their connection to the PKK Kurdistan Workers party which has been designated a terrorist group by Turkey the US and the EU 
OCT22	Gene editing like Crispr is too important to be left to scientists alone	Two little girls called Lulu and Nana celebrate their first birthday this month The Chinese twins are the first humans to have every cell in their body genetically modified using Crispr Cas a revolutionary gene editing process that allows the DNA in embryos to be edited to carry certain characteristics that can be passed down to their children and grandchildren  When the twins birth was announced to the world by the US trained biochemist He Jiankui he described how he and his Chinese and American colleagues had used Crispr to introduce genetic mutations into otherwise healthy embryos in an attempt to minimise the girls susceptibility to HIV infection Such an intervention was both unnecessary and possibly ineffective and in direct defiance of scientific consensus and established ethical norms As a molecular biologist who has spent over a decade in laboratories I was horrified by the experiment 
OCT22	The end to Northern Ireland’s abortion ban is a triumph for grassroots activism	It has been days since the Stormont government in Northern Ireland collapsed in January While the building on the Belfast Hill has gained some mothballs and a politician here and there has been chided for morally and politically dubious holidays Northern Irish citizens human rights have been dug from the bedrock of a patriarchal religious gilded state  In June Belfast s court of appeal ruled that it was up to the Northern Irish assembly to decide on the country s restrictive abortion law That same day the British government monumentally announced funding for pregnant Northern Irish women to access abortion in England pressured by Labour MP and ally Stella Creasy 
OCT23	Johnson’s Brexit is in sight. But he’ll still have to make concessions to parliament	It is almost as easy to lose your bearings amid the furious churning of the Brexit crisis as it is to get lost in the fog of battle Fresh Brexit preoccupations succeed one another chaotically and with dizzying speed  Tuesday s votes at Westminster exemplified this mercurial and even hysterical quality in our politics A major victory for Boris Johnson on his EU withdrawal agreement bill was instantly followed by a defeat on the tight timetable for debating it Within seconds the talk was of an entirely new subject a general election 
OCT23	It’s time for Labour to bite the bullet and embrace an election	Tis the season to be canvassing The odds on the first December election for nearly a century have dramatically shortened With Boris Johnson s commitment to Brexit happening by October now dead in a ditch the Vote Leave faction of his administration is pushing hard for the parliament versus the people contest they have always craved The political calculations now made by Labour will prove critical to the prospects of the embattled Corbyn project  It was a strategic blunder for Labour and other opposition parties not to accept the election gauntlet when it was first thrown down in September There were two reasons the first was a genuine fear that no deal could be engineered mid campaign This was not baseless paranoia the Johnson administration had proved itself to be devoid of trustworthiness and the prime minister s special adviser Dominic Cummings had fed the prospect to the media The second was driven by those who believed a pre election people s vote was possible potentially facilitated by a so called government of national unity 
OCT23	Russia has been playing a canny game in the Middle East, but can it continue?	Recent events in Syria suggest that Russia isn t just taking Washington s place as the Middle East s power broker it seems to be doing a more effective job of it too  The latest evidence came yesterday when Vladimir Putin held a meeting with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdo an As a US brokered ceasefire in Syria s north east expired they struck a deal to evacuate the People s Protection Units YPG a Kurdish led militia from a buffer zone near Turkey s border Russian and Turkish troops will begin patrols of that area giving them joint control But while Russian diplomatic skill is to be commended America s loss may yet prove Russia s headache 
OCT23	The Essex lorry deaths throw up so many questions. It’s vital we ask the right ones	There are several ways a person who doesn t want to be found can conceal themselves in a lorry If you are able bodied and strong enough you can crawl between the wheel axles and the base and hang on for as long as your arms hold out If not you can try to cram yourself into the tiny storage box that sits between the wheels a feat of contortion as well as endurance Or if you have the means you can unlock and climb inside the main container which may or may not be airtight You do these things because you want to cross an international border you do not have permission to cross  Every so often as with today s news that people have been found dead in a lorry in Essex the risks of this mode of transport become impossible to ignore I have met people who have travelled by all these means and all of them were taking a leap into the unknown Jamal a young man from Sudan who spent time in Calais kept hiding underneath lorries he thought were bound for Britain then having to jump off on the motorways of France and Belgium when they turned out to be heading elsewhere A Kurdish man I know who made his way from Iran to Europe a decade ago had to watch the smugglers who offered him safe passage beat up other travellers and wonder if they would do the same to him Zainab an Iraqi mother of three climbed into a refrigerated lorry with her children one night in France in the autumn of expecting the driver to set off for the Channel Instead he remained parked and switched off the ventilation The police arrived just as other passengers began to suffocate 
OCT23	Jack Thorne is right about disability prejudice – but TV bosses aren’t listening	 I felt a strange mix of shock and weariness when reading comments by Jack Thorne the screenwriter behind the new BBC adaptation of Philip Pullman s His Dark Materials adaptation who spoke out this week about what he called the invisible prejudice in the industry towards disabled people 
OCT23	Republicans are finally realising Trump is his own worst enemy – and theirs	There was a time not so long ago when it was widely considered suicidal for an American politician to pay hush money to porn stars cosy up to Russian leaders or use national security dollars to buy foreign interference at election time  In those quaint days of yore an experienced politician might have steered well clear of anything that smacked of being on the wrong side of civil rights 
OCT23	How did the ERG go from hating any Brexit deal to loving Boris Johnson’s?	It has been a week for screeching U turns No matter how he likes to dress it up Boris Johnson has been forced to apply for an extension to article which the EU will decide on whether to grant in the coming days Clearly no ditches were available Yet Johnson wasn t the only one compelled to backpedal on previous commitments The self styled plucky warriors of the European Research Group have traded in noisy opposition for relatively mute quiescence gone are the days of Steve Baker and Mark Francois angrily stomping through the corridors of Westminster As shown by last night s vote the ERG are now cheerfully cantering through the aye lobbies instead  Their earlier intransigence had the makings of a legend to be handed down from one generation of dwindling members to the next on slow evenings in the local association bar Of principled plucky honourable members who sacrificed ambition and career to free the UK from Brussels tyrannical grip and then courageously resisted the efforts of the remainer prime minister bent on hiving off parts of the country to placate the socialist monster across the Channel They withstood the pressure of the whip s office and the full weight of liberal opinion and prevailed Theresa May then gave up the ghost and our self regarding Spartans for the most part rallied around Johnson and helped deliver the Tory grassroots votes to whichever door he was living behind at the time 
OCT23	Bill Taylor’s testimony removes any last plausible line of defense for Trump	On Tuesday Donald Trump dismissed the impeachment inquiry into his conduct towards Ukraine as a lynching This proved unsurprisingly that the president doesn t know much about history for a start victims of lynching couldn t look forward to a trial heavily stacked in their favor which is probably what awaits Trump in the Senate It also showed that there is no depth to which Trump will not stoop in an attempt to distract attention from his wrongdoing  It was no surprise that Trump wanted to create a distraction on the day that the impeachment inquiry heard its most explosive testimony yet But we shouldn t let him Stunning new details were provided by Bill Taylor the top US diplomat in Ukraine who the state department tried to block from testifying before Congress He went anyway and what he said provided the most direct evidence yet that Trump ordered military assistance to Ukraine to be withheld until Kyiv agreed to take action that would benefit the president s re election campaign 
OCT23	Don't buy the hype: Boris Johnson's Brexit deal did not win approval	It s not over For a few anxious or jubilant depending on which tribe you belong to minutes between pm and pm it seemed as if the Brexit saga might just be on the verge of resolution after three and a half agonisingly long years The House of Commons voted to allow Boris Johnson s withdrawal agreement bill to advance to the next stage a prize that had eluded Theresa May not once not twice but three times  What s more MPs gave it a green light more emphatically than even the most ardent Brexiters had dared hope While May had been crushed by triple figure majorities Johnson won his meaningful vote by to votes a majority of Put another way and as if to reflect this divided nation through what have become the defining numbers of the Brexit era he won by to 
OCT23	Facebook isn't going to influence the next election – until it does	If you live in the US or UK Facebook wants you to know that it isn t going to influence who wins the next election  But the company also wants you to know that it s going to do its best to make sure that no one else exploits its platform to tilt the elections through attacks on democracy deliberate misinformation or foreign interference 
OCT24	An election would liberate Boris Johnson. But first he must get his deal through	The remainers have screwed up After three years of dithering since the referendum this last gasp of Britain s liberal establishment once so confident and unassailable has become a drawn out howl of anguish Ever since one of its former members Boris Johnson turned Caliban he has roamed the political landscape taunting his old associates at every turn He threatens them with no deal Brexits and general elections and they shudder He may be the weakest prime minister in recent history But remainers have no idea how to respond  The prime minister now faces almost certain defeat over his rock solid pledge no ifs no buts to leave the EU by October Assuming Brussels allows him to postpone Brexit to give him time to pass his withdrawal bill through parliament he has two options He can press ahead with that bill and risk delays and hostile amendments or he can pause it and attempt instead to get a pre Christmas general election which should give him more room for manoeuvre For that under the Fixed term Parliaments Act he needs Labour cooperation 
OCT24	Don’t be fooled – the EU is no defender of workers’ rights	Jacques Delors did one heck of a job when he showed up at the TUC conference in Britain was a year into Margaret Thatcher s third term and the mood on the left was despondent Organised labour had been weakened by a combination of mass unemployment a hollowing out of manufacturing defeat in the miners strike and legal curbs on trade union power  Fear not Delors said The domestic political outlook may be bleak but Thatcherism can be circumvented by action at a European level Brussels has a plan for a social Europe that will protect workers tame capitalism and prevent a race to the bottom 
OCT24	Why ‘the will of the people’ is a myth in British democracy	They promised sovereignty but at first it was unclear which variety of sovereignty they meant Were the politicians who swore we would regain it when we left the European Union referring to parliamentary or popular sovereignty Now we know they didn t mean parliamentary sovereignty Boris Johnson s government has sought to trick rush ignore and prorogue parliament at every turn   People v parliament is Johnson s pitch to the nation So where do the people come in If he is a champion of popular sovereignty why does he propose no improvements to a th century model of democracy that permits no popular engagement other than an election every few years and a referendum every few decades There is a tension between parliamentary and popular sovereignty A lively meaningful democracy would achieve a balance between the two It would combine parliamentary representative democracy with participatory democracy But no such balance is sought 
OCT24	The Essex lorry deaths throw up so many questions. It’s vital we ask the right ones	There are several ways a person who doesn t want to be found can conceal themselves in a lorry If you are able bodied and strong enough you can crawl between the wheel axles and the base and hang on for as long as your arms hold out If not you can try to cram yourself into the tiny storage box that sits between the wheels a feat of contortion as well as endurance Or if you have the means you can unlock and climb inside the main container which may or may not be airtight You do these things because you want to cross an international border you do not have permission to cross  Every so often as with today s news that people have been found dead in a lorry in Essex the risks of this mode of transport become impossible to ignore I have met people who have travelled by all these means and all of them were taking a leap into the unknown Jamal a young man from Sudan who spent time in Calais kept hiding underneath lorries he thought were bound for Britain then having to jump off on the motorways of France and Belgium when they turned out to be heading elsewhere A Kurdish man I know who made his way from Iran to Europe a decade ago had to watch the smugglers who offered him safe passage beat up other travellers and wonder if they would do the same to him Zainab an Iraqi mother of three climbed into a refrigerated lorry with her children one night in France in the autumn of expecting the driver to set off for the Channel Instead he remained parked and switched off the ventilation The police arrived just as other passengers began to suffocate 
OCT24	The ‘risk to democracy’ in Chile isn’t from protesters. It’s from Piñera and the 1%	 We re at war against a powerful enemy declared President Sebasti n Pi era live on Sunday night TV from the Chilean army headquarters Democracy not only has the right but the duty to defend itself using all instruments and the rule of law to fight those who would destroy it You may be forgiven for thinking Chilean democracy is besieged by some terrifying force a foreign army or even an invader from outer space Nothing could be further from the truth Pi era s statement is doublethink a lie travelling the world while truth is still putting on its boots  Pi era then did what they all do the Trumps the Bolsonaros the Johnsons of this world He stamped his authority
OCT24	Westminster should hand over tax-raising powers to councils. We would all benefit	Tax is a fundamental issue for any nation It s how we fund investment in public services and infrastructure and redistribute wealth Throughout history the question of who makes decisions about tax has been synonymous with where power lies And there s no better example of Westminster s power over us than local government s measly ability to raise taxes  The devolution revolution that was started under George Osborne and is now being reheated by Boris Johnson was meant to give more control to our major city regions Yet it has very little to say about which tax raising powers should be handed over instead devolution has been more about granting flexibility over where public spending goes rather than how much money there is to begin with Labour likewise has been keener to talk about regional investment banks than about local taxes 
OCT24	Hillary Clinton called me a 'Russian asset'. The establishment is losing its grip	Like her attack on Tulsi Gabbard Hillary Clinton s accusation that I am a Russian asset is a ludicrous unhinged conspiracy theory with no basis in fact It s also an attempt to deflect attention from the role of Clinton s campaign in her own defeat This desperate blame game is not an encouraging sign that the Democratic party will muster a winning strategy to oust the disastrous Trump administration in Equally alarming the Clinton camp s attempts to shift responsibility for their electoral failure to Russian assets has fueled a new era of McCarthyism a toxic brew of warmongering political repression and censorship now poisoning our public discourse  By continuing to blame everyone else for their loss the Clinton camp is suppressing serious reflection on the problems with their own campaign These ranged from the Pied Piper strategy of urging media allies to elevate Donald Trump to front runner status to the sabotage of Bernie Sanders by Clinton surrogates in the DNC 
OCT24	Johnson’s Brexit is in sight. But he’ll still have to make concessions to parliament	It is almost as easy to lose your bearings amid the furious churning of the Brexit crisis as it is to get lost in the fog of battle Fresh Brexit preoccupations succeed one another chaotically and with dizzying speed  Tuesday s votes at Westminster exemplified this mercurial and even hysterical quality in our politics A major victory for Boris Johnson on his EU withdrawal agreement bill was instantly followed by a defeat on the tight timetable for debating it Within seconds the talk was of an entirely new subject a general election

OCT24	Without youth theatre, I would never have won the Booker prize	At the age of I discovered Stage Centre a former church in Plumstead south east London where a co operative called Greenwich Young People s Theatre put on drama workshops for children I went with a friend who horrified at being asked to prance around pretending to be an animal spent the evening in the lavatory I plunged in loved it and the next week went back alone continuing at least once a week until I was  I learned that the arts world cherished difference unlike the conformist expectations of my predominantly white girls school
OCT25	Pity our Conservative MPs, forced to go on strike to protect their way of life	It was the worst of times it was the worst of times On the one hand inflatable reservist Mark Francois MP has previously promised that we will leave the EU on October or this country will explode On the other hand Devon based extremist Katie Hopkins has previously tweeted that we will leave the EU on October or I will drink a pot of tea naked in the Apprentice losers cafe with Farage s face on each nipple  We will not be leaving the EU on October 
OCT25	The question for Labour: why are you sticking with Jeremy Corbyn?	In all this talk of early elections of dates and delays there is one common if for some uncomfortable premise It is the constant factor in the calculus run by all the political parties and by the warring factions within them Put simply it is the fact that vast swathes of the electorate are unprecedentedly hostile to the idea of making Jeremy Corbyn their prime minister  The Labour leader has the lowest poll numbers of any leader of the opposition since records began His net satisfaction rating is minus outstripping the previous negative record held since by Michael Foot He is less popular than Boris Johnson among both men and women in every socioeconomic category whether richer or poorer in London and Scotland as well as the Midlands and Wales and remarkably in every age group Perhaps it s no surprise that the over s prefer Johnson to Corbyn by to but it s arresting that even among the youngest voters aged to those once seen as the Labour leader s base Corbyn is less popular than the prime minister albeit by three points 
OCT25	A December election is Labour’s least-worst option	Labour must agree to a December election and in exchange it should get the government to abandon its Brexit deal Anything else will be a huge political error Boris Johnson s current offer more time to debate his woeful deal in an attempt to triumphantly ram it through parliament before an election is clearly unacceptable  It is in part an attempt to deflect from his failed commitment to die in a ditch if Britain did not leave the EU by the end of the month More significantly it reflects an attempt to bridge his own internal split between the old Vote Leave crew headed by Dominic Cummings who are gunning for a general election and ministers and MPs who fear it may not pan out too well with the Tories vulnerable in Scotland the south west and English commuter constituencies 
OCT25	A 'No 10 source' is the voice of power. Too many journalists simply parrot it	 The th century fetishism of facts was justified by a fetishism of documents EH Carr wrote in his book What is History But no document can tell us more than what the author of the document thought what he thought had happened what he thought ought to happen or would happen or perhaps only what he wanted others to think he thought The facts whether found in documents or not have still to be processed by the historian before he can make any use of them  For journalists the st century fetish appears to be with quotes When powerful people say things too many journalists simply convey them acting not as critical interlocutors but convenient conduits The fact that a politician has said something apparently makes it news This is all too often conveyed neat uncritiqued unfiltered and unprocessed It is then injected into the conversational bloodstream caffeinated by social media It s as though the act of journalism is limited to getting the quote and distributing and does not extend to verifying it contextualising it and making sense of it 
OCT25	I was harassed at Cambridge: the Dr Peter Hutchinson case is part of a wider problem	It s a Saturday morning and I m still in bed My partner is downstairs reading We are house sitting for some friends in a small village outside of Cambridge it s a nice break given the hectic last few months of our lives I roll over check my phone open Twitter Oh no I think again  It had just been reported that Trinity Hall college at Cambridge University had changed its agreement with former lecturer Dr Peter Hutchinson Previously it had been agreed that he would not attend undergraduate social events and retire after women submitted complaints of sexual harassment against him Hutchinson apologised for his inappropriate behaviour Hutchinson has now had his dining rights as an Emeritus fellow reinstated and is allowed to attend certain college events once more 
OCT25	British police spied on grieving black families for decades. Now we want the truth	How many black families have been targeted by undercover police officers This is the simple question we are still waiting for authorities to answer  More than five years have passed since Theresa May then the home secretary announced a public inquiry following profoundly shocking evidence that Met police undercover officers had spied on the grieving parents of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence as well as their campaign to get justice for their son 
OCT25	Revenge porn is being used to smear and discredit a sitting congresswoman	The conservative website RedState published revenge porn of a sitting congresswoman last week  Katie Hill of California s th district found the naked picture of herself published online while she is in the midst of an acrimonious divorce In an email to supporters Hill who was elected as a freshman Democrat in the midterms acknowledged a consensual relationship with an aide during her congressional campaign But she denied another alleged relationship with a different aide on Capitol Hill that her ex husband claims she had 
OCT25	These brutal cuts to the NHS will haunt the Conservatives	The grindstones of Brexit pound everything else into the ground Boris Johnson claims day after day that if only parliament would get it done the country would be free to focus again on the NHS police and schools  But when the searchlight eventually does fall again on public services as it likely will in a general election that may do Johnson and his party no favours Take Brexit out of the immediate battleground and what s left Only the true state of the country and its services after nine long years of funding starvation perpetrated by Conservative governments Airy promises of shedloads more money from a man not even Tories regard as trustworthy may carry less conviction than the evidence of everyone s eyes in their own neighbourhoods As ever the NHS is the standard bearer for public perceptions of much else Two particular NHS items stand out as political emblems of this Tory era the record shortage of nurses and a particularly bad case of privatisation 
OCT25	An election would liberate Boris Johnson. But first he must get his deal through	The remainers have screwed up After three years of dithering since the referendum this last gasp of Britain s liberal establishment once so confident and unassailable has become a drawn out howl of anguish Ever since one of its former members Boris Johnson turned Caliban he has roamed the political landscape taunting his old associates at every turn He threatens them with no deal Brexits and general elections and they shudder He may be the weakest prime minister in recent history But remainers have no idea how to respond  The prime minister now faces almost certain defeat over his rock solid pledge no ifs no buts to leave the EU by October Assuming Brussels allows him to postpone Brexit to give him time to pass his withdrawal bill through parliament he has two options He can press ahead with that bill and risk delays and hostile amendments or he can pause it and attempt instead to get a pre Christmas general election which should give him more room for manoeuvre For that under the Fixed term Parliaments Act he needs Labour cooperation 
OCT25	The Tribe Next Door feeds a cult of simplicity that eases the guilt of wealth	There are so many ways in which The British Tribe Next Door is offensive that it s arguably amazing the TV programme ever made it to the screen  The first episode of Channel s series which sends the British reality TV star Scarlett Moffatt and her family to live with a traditional Namibian tribe and both sides examine the material excesses of the family s western lives has aired to a chorus of outrage from activist groups such as the anti colonialism group No White Saviors Chief among its sins is peddling the spectacularly dated myth that all Africans live in mud huts and wear tribal dress But the crassness of building a replica of the Moffatts suburban semi complete with running water and wifi in the middle of a tribal village comes a close second Is the house going to stay after filming a strange monument to the days when someone thought this was a good idea Or will the producers simply demolish it 
OCT26	What happened when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came face to face with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg	It was am the night before we published the Cambridge Analytica files in March last year and I got an urgent message from my fellow reporter Emma Graham Harrison Facebook which that day had sent us a letter threatening legal action if we published had issued a press release saying it had kicked Cambridge Analytica off its platform  It was a last gasp attempt to get ahead of a story that Facebook knew was set to break But it was too late We worked through the night brought forward our publishing time and then the story was out there 
OCT26	All aboard the Holyrood gravy train, next stop a land of rich pickings	Earlier this year when Scotland paused to reflect on two decades of the Scottish parliament we sought to evaluate its impact on the business of living Had devolved government improved the lives of most Scots Did we feel better informed about the decisions taken on our behalf at Holyrood and thus more engaged with the political process More importantly did we feel more empowered to scrutinise and influence the legislative process  It s at this point you re tempted to recall the wry response of Chinese premier Zhou Enlai in when asked about the effects of the French Revolution two centuries earlier It s too early to say he replied Later it emerged that he may have been responding to a question about the civil unrest and student protests in France four years earlier 
OCT26	Grief is not enough. We must open our doors as well as our hearts	Who knows why those victims were heading our way last week only to die before reaching their destination Were they driven by fear hope or both Were they refugees or naive victims of criminal opportunists who were trafficking them At what point did it dawn on them that their cries for help in that grim container were going unheard  Essex police reported that eight of the victims were women and were men The National Crime Agency says it is trying to identify any organised crime groups who may have played a part Most of our questions will have to wait a long time for an answer 
OCT26	A welfare system that drives mothers into prostitution is not a safety net	Is it really such a surprise that survival sex has become normalised by years of Tory austerity  Last week a group of women told the work and pensions committee how they sold sex to survive Everything from being coerced into giving oral sex after being caught shoplifting food for the kids to turning to sex work full time While the cliched image of sex work women on drugs remains sadly true there are also welfare sex workers supplementing their benefits to buy not heroin but groceries or clothes for their kids 
OCT26	Katie Jarvis: was it necessary to shop her for working in a shop?	You can understand why seeing someone you know from EastEnders working in a shop might make you look twice If I nipped to the post office and Kat Slater was selling stamps I d probably go back She ain t my muvva But she might be able to offer me a competitive rate on euros  Even so there was something sour and not quite end of episode bong worthy about a tabloid s decision to put the actress Katie Jarvis on its front page after she was spotted working as a security guard I woke up really embarrassed and really made to feel quite ashamed to be honest she told Victoria Derbyshire last week 
OCT26	About 41% of the global population are under 24. And they’re angry…	A spate of large scale street protests around the world from Chile and Hong Kong to Lebanon and Barcelona is fuelling a search for common denominators and collective causes Are we entering a new age of global revolution Or is it foolish to try to link anger in India over the price of onions to pro democracy demonstrations in Russia  Each country s protests differ in detail But recent upheavals do appear to share one key factor youth In most cases younger people are at the forefront of calls for change The uprising that unexpectedly swept away Sudan s ancien regime this year was essentially generational in nature 
OCT26	Pity our Conservative MPs, forced to go on strike to protect their way of life	It was the worst of times it was the worst of times On the one hand inflatable reservist Mark Francois MP has previously promised that we will leave the EU on October or this country will explode On the other hand Devon based extremist Katie Hopkins has previously tweeted that we will leave the EU on October or I will drink a pot of tea naked in the Apprentice losers cafe with Farage s face on each nipple  We will not be leaving the EU on October 
OCT26	I feel sorry for Meghan and Harry, but being a royal comes with a price	Many years ago I spent some time following Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall around including on a tour of Pakistan It was a weird experience not least for the dynamic between us journalists and the royals There are two types of royal press coverage the official type governed by rules set down in more deferential times compels reporters to cover the royal family while abiding by a strict set of protocols the unofficial type often written by the same people in the same publications serves as a kind of release mechanism for resentment generated by the former The country s entire push me pull you relationship with the royals is contained within these modes of discourse co dependent and neither acknowledging the other  The fact that the focus of negative coverage has been on Meghan not Harry doesn t smell quite right
OCT26	The question for Labour: why are you sticking with Jeremy Corbyn?	In all this talk of early elections of dates and delays there is one common if for some uncomfortable premise It is the constant factor in the calculus run by all the political parties and by the warring factions within them Put simply it is the fact that vast swathes of the electorate are unprecedentedly hostile to the idea of making Jeremy Corbyn their prime minister  The Labour leader has the lowest poll numbers of any leader of the opposition since records began His net satisfaction rating is minus outstripping the previous negative record held since by Michael Foot He is less popular than Boris Johnson among both men and women in every socioeconomic category whether richer or poorer in London and Scotland as well as the Midlands and Wales and remarkably in every age group Perhaps it s no surprise that the over s prefer Johnson to Corbyn by to but it s arresting that even among the youngest voters aged to those once seen as the Labour leader s base Corbyn is less popular than the prime minister albeit by three points 
OCT26	Brexit is like Bear Grylls’ Island: to survive, you’ve got to fake it till you don’t hate it	I did Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls a couple of years ago I was dropped off on a desert island with nine people I didn t know with no food no clothes except the ones we were wearing no shoes no mobile phone no bra and no mayonnaise For one month There were five men and five women single parents divorced married black mixed race white working class white middle class Arab American and one person with a disability  There were people I didn t like and I knew there were people who didn t like me The conditions were harsh We hadn t eaten for six days and were severely dehydrated and constantly bitten by sandflies and mosquitoes We were lying in ditches suffering from hypothermia It wasn t Glastonbury it was Vietnam 
OCT27	The long Brexit ordeal will finish off the break-up of Britain	This is the sound of British politics A crescendo rumble a deafening crash a four letter word The blond skateboard king from behind the cycle shed his shirt tails flapping has fallen off yet again Unfortunately the cracked pavement under his wheels is called Britain or optimistically the United Kingdom and he and his mates have been pounding it to destruction for more than three years  In that time the Brexit ordeal has changed Britain Not as much as some think Many of these changes above all the English sense of powerlessness and resentment of elites were already gathering speed years ago as Europe and the world crawled out of the banking disaster Brexit disputes only accelerated them The referendum didn t so much create new divisions within England as rediscover old ones especially in its aftermath It was almost laughable that so few remain voters knew a leaver or vice versa England is still a country astonishingly segregated by class by location by attitudes towards power and privilege Before the last war ended the doomed fighter pilot Richard Hillary asked Was there perhaps a new race of Englishmen arising out of this war a harmonious synthesis of the governing class and the great rest of England No there wasn t 
OCT27	The housing crisis is at the heart of our national nervous breakdown	Over the past three years commentary about the nervous uncertain condition of Britain has repeatedly veered into questions of belonging and community These things tend to be framed in terms of culture conversations about whether liberals and leftwingers can speak to people attached to nation and place angst about flags understandable fears about the point at which such things blur into nastiness and bigotry In the process one crucial point is rather missed If you are going to talk about whether people feel rooted and the absolute basics of community there is one subject that ought to command your attention that of the basic primal idea of home and the fact that far too many people in this country either do not have one or worry that the one they possess might be about to get snatched away  It is in other words time we talked about our national predicament and indeed what might be at stake in the election whenever it arrives by acknowledging that housing is a central issue and always has been The nitty gritty of politics is often reduced to the cliche of schools and hospitals But think of the aftermath of each world war and the great steps forward marked by the concerted building of council houses Or the way that post Thatcherism became hegemonic via the right to buy scheme and the sale of many of those same homes to their occupiers and then in turn to private landlords a fact that defines a lot of the dysfunction of modern Britain And let s not forget it was housing that tipped the world into the crash of when the banks finally confronted the lunacy of sub prime mortgages essentially a replacement for the public housing the US and the UK had forgotten how to build 
OCT27	If Beijing does not budge, the struggle for Hong Kong will last decades	 Is there any way that Hong Kong can avoid becoming another Northern Ireland  This was the first question posed by a well known Hong Kong activist at the start of a recent interview A few months ago the comparison to decades of civil unrest would have seemed absurd But after weekends of protests the endgame seems further away than ever before The escalating weekend insurgency and the police brutality deployed in response have marooned the territory in a cycle of violence that is doing serious damage to its economy rule of law and public trust in its institutions 
OCT27	The WeWork debacle should be an indictment of modern finance	It happens every few years not quite with the regularity of the seasons but with the inevitability of a natural disaster A new company is founded on the basis of a new and seemingly ingenious concept and then rocket fuelled by growth boosting investor capital It briefly burns bright and then implodes collapsing under the weight of its own balance sheet  The latest tech financial calamity is WeWork an office space and workplace solutions operator that is now shrinking rapidly after a planned initial public offering IPO was scrapped when potential investors rejected its absurd bn bn valuation WeWork s collapse is a business school study in the excesses of private capital in an unregulated market that fetishises the wealth creating genius of the lone pioneer 
OCT27	Turkeys won’t vote for Christmas when the polls are telling them they’ll be stuffed	When Australia sneezes the world catches a cold So be warned that they had an unusually early and quite nasty flu season down under this year I mention this because fear of the flu is one of the hidden reasons why Boris Johnson craves a pre Christmas election  Senior NHS officials have warned ministers that the severe flu season in Australia is likely to be a harbinger of the same here That will compound what already threatens to be a grim winter for a stretched health service Better then from a Conservative perspective to have an election in the first half of December rather than wait until January or February when news bulletins may be nightly leading with reports of a winter crisis putting more pressure on intensive care and high dependency units than the NHS can cope with The thing most worrying to ministers is a repeat of the winter of when a bad flu season in Australia was followed by a killer one in Britain which saw deaths hit a year peak after the flu jab failed to work in the majority of cases 
OCT27	Trust is becoming the principal casualty of Britain’s raging political war	Britain is in a revolutionary crisis Its economy constitution place in the international order and sense of who it is and what it can become will be battlefields at the next election The high stakes alone will ensure that a red mist descends To heighten the rage the wilful failure of the Conservative government to prevent the corruptions of the electoral process brought by the age of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will sharpen every grievance  Put yourself in the place of Britain s competing factions and you get a fair idea of how angry and desperate all sides will become The leaders of the Brexit movement must know they are on borrowed time They may condemn liberals who have the bad taste to point out that Leave voters are dying and Remain supporting teenagers are joining the electoral roll as each year passes But the intelligent among them understand that demography is destiny and they have to get out of the EU while they can 
OCT27	English Tories have lost the slightest reason to care about the union	A miniature sporting curiosity is re enacted each year that conveys integrity and stewardship in the face of shallow commerce It s when the gnarly hand of an engraver is seen to inscribe the name of golf s Open champion on to a sacred claret jug At what point does this master craftsman get the nod to begin his work His is a task that doesn t reward haste and yet he can t tarry too long This little ritual sprang to mind when Boris Johnson became Britain s latest prime minister In it the silent engraver is beginning to inscribe the words Scottish independence even as Johnson s name is being announced  In the weeks since it almost seems as though Johnson is eager to fulfil one of the expressed wishes of England s Brexit supporters In several polls they signalled their willingness to sacrifice Scotland as a price worth paying for securing Brexit This seems to have lodged itself subliminally in the minds of Tory MPs at Westminster In recent weeks they have been seen to observe a rather less edifying ritual of their own Thus whenever Ian Blackford rises to respond to the latest convulsion on the withdrawal agreement a signal is emitted at a pitch that can only be picked up by English Tories As soon as the SNP s Westminster leader opens his mouth to speak they rise as one and depart the chamber At other times they talk loudly over him in an adolescent attempt to convey indifference and disdain 
OCT27	What happened when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came face to face with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg	It was am the night before we published the Cambridge Analytica files in March last year and I got an urgent message from my fellow reporter Emma Graham Harrison Facebook which that day had sent us a letter threatening legal action if we published had issued a press release saying it had kicked Cambridge Analytica off its platform  It was a last gasp attempt to get ahead of a story that Facebook knew was set to break But it was too late We worked through the night brought forward our publishing time and then the story was out there 
OCT27	Greta Thunberg is old enough to scare the world. Are teens like her really too young to vote?	Despite being effectively exiled by a Conservative government Shamima Begum who joined Isis aged and whose withdrawn citizenship is currently the subject of appeal now finds herself a Tory asset As well as being inhumane Sajid Javid s continued resistance to her return appears considering her proved cautionary value singularly ungrateful  Who else recently has done as much as Begum former teenage delinquent to supply his party with an argument whose effectiveness so long as it is not examined for more than a couple of seconds could contribute to the outcome of the next election Ken Clarke has already threatened amendments to the withdrawal agreement bill that would reduce the voting age perhaps fatally for Johnson to If future electoral success depends for the presiding sociopaths on keeping young adults away from decisions afflicting their futures the party needs to put together if only for appearances sake something resembling a reason why Much of what could once be claimed year olds are too flighty apathetic biddable etc looks threadbare now that Scottish teenagers enfranchised in have proved they could be competent and enthusiastic voters 
OCT27	This battle to become West Midlands mayor reminds us women of colour face a double oppression	I was on a train by myself on a warm summer day wearing a knee length skirt An Asian male guard in his s was walking down the train You shouldn t sit like that I can see everything he hissed at me The implication was that I was some kind of hussy for sitting in a skirt legs bare and uncrossed It s far from my only run in with rank misogyny but I bawled when I got home I knew the guard wouldn t have said that to me had I been white that he felt he had the right to police me because of our shared skin colour It made my sense of disgust at his behaviour more acute  I was reminded of this last week when I read Labour MP Naz Shah s powerful account of Salma Yaqoob s complicity in the toxic misogyny directed at her by a vocal minority of Muslim men in the Bradford West election Yaqoob the former leader of the Respect party has just been shortlisted by Labour as a candidate for West Midlands mayor Her campaign created a platform which allowed men to literally slut shame me Shah says leaving her feeling suicidal 
OCT28	Even if the Tories win an election, they’ll be finished	Stop all those clocks in Downing Street counting down to the Halloween Brexit Stop Operation Yellowhammer cancel emergency medicine stockpiling ferries warehouses and freezers Stop this morning s Operation Brock diverting HGVs on the M Melt down those shamelessly triumphal commemorative p coins and halt the m splashed on Get ready for Brexit information Gross maladministration must surely be the National Audit Office verdict when the day comes to tally the cost along with those hundreds of thousands of wasted civil servant hours on the Brexits that never were  Boris Johnson may not be dead in a ditch just sunk into the Theresa May memorial Brexit quicksands The more he thrashes around the deeper he sinks quixotically abandoning his withdrawal agreement bill just as it won a vote majority No wonder he dare not give MPs time to scrutinise its pages of notes for more than three perfunctory days many were ready with Philip Hammond to append a customs union and a confirmatory referendum was still on the cards 
OCT28	It’s the People’s Vote of Judea v the Judean People’s Vote	This week Boris Johnson breaks his die in a ditch pledge to leave the EU on Thursday and parliament is voting on whether to hold a general election It is then next level strategic genius to choose this moment to implode the People s Vote campaign Roland Rudd who when he s not doing PR for financial firms moonlights as chairman of Open Britain one of the organisations that makes up People s Vote has led moves to sack the campaign s director James McGrory and its head of communications ex Labour adviser Tom Baldwin Blood is being spilt and very publicly staff have staged a mass walkout Rudd s faction is threatening to prosecute McGrory and Baldwin for trespassing and both sides are fighting it out on Sky News while claiming everything is fine  Here is a salutary lesson that should have been heeded long ago During the referendum the official remain outfit Britain Stronger In Europe waged a corporate backed campaign that lacked any appeal to the electorate To borrow an expression they brought a calculator to a knife fight They could have learned from this lesson They clearly have not 
OCT28	How to replace Kate Hoey? My local party showed that stitch-ups aren’t working	They called it Labour s super Sunday as prospective parliamentary candidates were chosen in the so called defector seats Nottingham East Liverpool Wavertree retirement vacancies Bassetlaw Poplar and Limehouse Vauxhall and Blyth Valley the Tory held South Thanet and Finchley and Golders Green and the Lib Dem held North Norfolk You could say that every result bar Wavertree delivered surprises though it would depend on how easily you are surprised  In this context remain versus lexit is no more than a contemporary gloss over a tug of war that has existed forever
OCT28	The polls may seem dismal. But here’s how Labour could win a general election	Today Labour MPs will decide whether the country will head to the polls in December Many are hostile towards the idea fearing that they are facing an electoral wipe out Instead they cling to the prospect of securing a second referendum as an alternative means to stopping Brexit With the polls where they are it is understandable that Labour MPs are fearful of facing the electorate  But this election could be far closer than is commonly imagined The ascendancy of the SNP in Scotland the rise of the Liberal Democrats in England and the schism between the Tories and the DUP means that there are fewer seats in play for the major parties Labour and the Conservatives must compete for around seats with no viable coalition partners the Tories must secure seats for a majority of one For that to occur Labour must get no more than seats far below either its performance in either or and seats respectively Conversely if Labour can defend its current seats it would enable an anti Tory majority to be formed 
OCT28	Boris Johnson’s betrayal will leave the DUP with one option – to back remain	Northern Ireland has long been viewed as a place apart within the United Kingdom Now unionists fear it is about to become a place apart outside the UK separated from Great Britain by a new border in the Irish Sea pushed closer to the EU and eventually into a united Ireland That s why they are unsettled right now and indeed fearful  Unionists have been here before In their parliament at Stormont was prorogued and direct rule imposed from Westminster In the British and Irish governments with limited input from unionists concluded the Sunningdale agreement which replaced majority rule with mandatory power sharing and an Irish dimension A little over a decade later the British and Irish governments signed the Anglo Irish agreement which unionism regarded as a form of joint sovereignty And in the Downing Street declaration stated the British government has no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland 
OCT28	The long Brexit ordeal will finish off the break-up of Britain	This is the sound of British politics A crescendo rumble a deafening crash a four letter word The blond skateboard king from behind the cycle shed his shirt tails flapping has fallen off yet again Unfortunately the cracked pavement under his wheels is called Britain or optimistically the United Kingdom and he and his mates have been pounding it to destruction for more than three years  In that time the Brexit ordeal has changed Britain Not as much as some think Many of these changes above all the English sense of powerlessness and resentment of elites were already gathering speed years ago as Europe and the world crawled out of the banking disaster Brexit disputes only accelerated them The referendum didn t so much create new divisions within England as rediscover old ones especially in its aftermath It was almost laughable that so few remain voters knew a leaver or vice versa England is still a country astonishingly segregated by class by location by attitudes towards power and privilege Before the last war ended the doomed fighter pilot Richard Hillary asked Was there perhaps a new race of Englishmen arising out of this war a harmonious synthesis of the governing class and the great rest of England No there wasn t 
OCT28	The 'AOC effect' is real – and it's helping wean the Democrats off corporate donors	Earlier this month Tiffany Cab n stood on a stage in Queensbridge Park New York City and told roughly Bernie Sanders supporters that Alexandria Ocasio Cortez had inspired her to run for office This year Cab n a year old public defender ran in the Democratic primary for Queens district attorney on a platform calling for serious criminal justice reform Cab n lost by the slimmest of margins votes to the Queens borough president Melissa Katz the favorite of the Queens political machine and its real estate developer patrons  The massive crowd had gathered in Queens because Ocasio Cortez had endorsed Bernie Sanders for president The Sanders campaign had bet on the so called AOC effect buoying his candidacy and Ocasio Cortez s political clout was on full display that afternoon But the real evidence that the AOC effect will deliver returns for Democrats and progressives in coming years is not in Sanders resilience but in the power of local progressives like Cab n who are changing expectations about what is possible in their cities and states nationwide

OCT28	Talk of ‘anti-white sentiment’ distracts from the fight against institutional racism	In March student officers and activists from varying backgrounds and cities across the UK sat in a room for an important discussion We were all people of colour  Why can t the EHRC supposedly responsible for the enforcement of equality understand that racism is about power 
OCT28	The right’s use of trolling is so predictable, why do we keep falling for it?	On Tuesday the official Conservative Twitter account made what looked like a classic design error using comic sans to deliver a serious message about Brexit The response was predictable the tweet prompted guffaws and mockery  Yet this was hardly the gaffe it seemed In an attention economy the currency of every successful player is engagement Paradoxically the more people howled with laughter or improvised cute putdowns the more value the message had The algorithms would ensure it appeared in more feeds The words Get Brexit done and the Conservative party logo would be distributed as widely as possible In itself this is minor social media froth But the Tories employ the same tactic in dealing with the mass media getting attention with false or absurd claims which they then use to advance their narrative 
OCT29	Even Tories think an election is risky – because of Boris Johnson	Viewed from a distance Brexit Britain has resembled a fly hurling itself at a pane of glass next to an open window It is nearly a year since Theresa May negotiated a route out of the European Union But the window wasn t good enough for leavers who thought they should shatter the glass instead On it went buzz thud buzz thud a country going nowhere in a frenzy  Then Boris Johnson took over pledging deliverance by October do or die Buzz buzz thud Exhaustion frustration and failure of imagination have finally brought parliament to the brink of dissolution 
OCT29	Don’t let the drama of an election distract us from the billions wasted on Brexit	If you really want to know how a magic trick is done then stop looking where the magician wants you to look  Ignore the spectacle and the theatre designed to distract the audience don t listen to the patter but watch what the hands are doing And what is true for magicians is doubly so for politicians Boris Johnson has the nation focused on the drama of a Christmas election rather than on this week s humiliation over Brexit but we should have learned by now to look at what the government is doing rather than what the great showman is saying 
OCT29	I’m the dad who took on Boris Johnson over the NHS. I can’t stand by as he runs it down	A few days after my daughter was born she nearly died During this time she had to wait for hours on a ward at Whipps Cross hospital in east London just to see a doctor  One morning amid this ordeal Boris Johnson visited the ward my daughter was staying on during his trip to the hospital Sightings of doctors and nurses on that ward had been rare previously but suddenly they were everywhere while the floors sparkled and flowers decked the corridors 
OCT29	This wave of global protest is being led by the children of the financial crash	 I m years old and this is my last letter the young man begins Most of his face is masked with black fabric only his eyes tired and steely are visible below a messy fringe I m worried that I will die and won t see you any more he continues his hands trembling But I can t not take to the streets  The nameless demonstrator one of many in Hong Kong who have been writing to their loved ones before heading out to confront rising police violence in the city was filmed by the New York Times last week in an anonymous stairwell But he could be almost anywhere and not only because the walls behind him are white and characterless left blank to protect his identity 
OCT29	The 39 people who died in the lorry were victims. Why does the law treat them as criminals?	What leads someone down the route where they find themselves locked into the back of a lorry a beating heart in a metal box What choices or lack of them have led someone to be reduced to a piece of human cargo Can anyone who read the story of the bodies found in the back of a lorry last week not feel the visceral terror of that cold dark death and wonder at how we live in a world where a business model exists that thrives off this level of human desperation  At the moment it is unclear whether this tragedy is the work of smuggling gangs who are in a transactional arrangement with the people they are moving from place to place or human traffickers who are exploiting and profiting from their human cargo In the end does it even matter Both are looking to profit from the very human desire to not only survive but to thrive Across the world trafficking and smuggling gangs are flogging promises and dreams and then using fear of pain of the authorities of their debts of their failure to make vast amounts of money in the knowledge that they re unlikely to get caught and in the certainty that their victims are expendable 
OCT29	Shrink the City. It’s the only way to stop the world’s criminals flourishing in the UK	The trouble with getting into a rat race the American comedian Jackie Gleason once said is that even if you win you re still a rat  Influential people in the UK are cheerleading for a Singapore on the Thames economic model after Brexit a strategy to win the great global race to attract financial capital by lowering taxes loosening regulations and turning a blind eye to the world s dirty money Britain is already on some measures the biggest player in the global tax haven game A spider s web of satellite havens from the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands to Jersey captures wealth from around the world polishes it and feeds it to the City of London The world s best known independent rankings of tax havens by importance the Tax Justice Network s financial secrecy index and its sister publication the corporate tax haven index both show that the UK considered together with its satellites is the biggest player in the offshore world

OCT30	A children’s book about food banks is a grim sign of our failure as a society	I have just read a beautiful book about something truly obscene Full of lovely pictures and occasional bits of text it s the kind you might read with your four year old It shows a little girl and her mum as they visit a food bank  It s a No Money Day is narrated by the daughter who sees how her mother worries over every penny while shielding her from the painful stuff There s no more cereal so I have the last piece of toast Luckily Mum isn t hungry the girl says and you know the biggest thing Mum will have for breakfast is her own little white lie When they reach the food bank the child tucks into biscuits and squash while her mother sags like a balloon from which the air has escaped 
OCT30	People are passionate about politics again – and they want radical solutions	For two and a half years British politics has been a pantomime played out in the corridors and boardrooms of Westminster and Brussels The electorate has barely managed to press their noses against the glass and peer in much of the Brexit debacle has unfolded out of sight and scrutiny Instead ever since Boris Johnson s ascent to the premiership the country has effectively been treated to a one sided general election campaign the opposition has been all but squeezed out of media coverage All of this now changes the spectators can storm the stage  In the s it was often claimed that political apathy had replaced political participation Membership of political parties and electoral turnout were both said to be in irreversible decline Who can bemoan the lack of political participation now This is our age of mass politics the Scottish independence movement Farageism and Brexitism a youth led climate emergency movement and Jeremy Corbyn s Labour which began as a husk and flowered into western Europe s biggest political party And it is this in large part that makes the election so unpredictable so volatile There is a politicised populace united around a single but fundamental point desire for rupture with a status quo that never enjoyed enthusiastic support and now has lost popular acquiescence If Johnson triumphs his government will wrench Britain out of the EU with a deal that threatens to punch a hole the size of Wales in the economy and use Brexit to remake British society in a hyper Thatcherite mould Labour s mission on the other hand is to up end a generation long experiment in market fundamentalism and redistribute wealth and power away from its principal beneficiaries Each represents an abandonment of the old order even though the Tories version will benefit the vested interests who bankroll them 
OCT30	My uncle died at Grenfell. This report must lead to action	It was a simple kitchen fire Sir Martin Moore Bick chair of the Grenfell inquiry repeats this small but devastating finding throughout his phase one report a simple kitchen fire that killed people and for ever changed a community  My uncle was one of the people who died in Grenfell Tower Reading the inquiry report has been difficult It is so detailed It recounts all the movements my uncle made that night the phone calls he made for help the times he was told to stay put He was so polite in the phone calls trusting that help was on its way Every time I read it I pick up something new and it hurts even more I imagine everybody who lost someone that night feels similar These are our loved ones last moments retold minute by minute 
OCT30	If we’re serious about changing the world, we need a better kind of economics to do it	In a poll in the UK asked Whose opinion do you trust the most when they talk about their field of expertise Nurses came first trust them Politicians came last Economists were second from bottom on This trust deficit is mirrored by the fact that the consensus of economists when it exists is often systematically different from the views of ordinary citizens The Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago regularly asks a group of about prominent academic economists their views on core economic topics Working with the economist Stefanie Stantcheva we ran a survey we selected of the questions that were asked of the Booth panel and put them to Americans  On most of these issues our respondents were sharply at odds with economists For example every single member of the Booth panel disagreed with the proposition that imposing new US tariffs on steel and aluminium will improve Americans wellbeing Only a third of our respondents shared their view And the gap is not only because people are not informed of what economists think telling them does not seem to change their opinion one bit 
OCT30	The only reason we’re having an election is because of MPs’ cynicism	Battle stations The coming election is just the prelude This month should have seen Britain s formal withdrawal from the EU on Boris Johnson s deal prior to serious trade talks with Brussels next year The election should have taken place after not before formal withdrawal to elect a parliament to conduct those negotiations and with the outcome of those talks then validated by a referendum That would have been dignified and sensible  In theory that could still happen The House of Lords could this week delay the election bill which tears up a constitutional measure the Fixed term Parliaments Act without even bothering to repeal it If the Lords were not so bloated and gutless it would delay the bill In truth the upper house is not fit for the job 
OCT30	Polls show voters aren’t sick of politics – they’re eager to have their say	In politics feelings are powerful We are used to the idea that politicians can harness our anger or our fear to get us to believe certain things and behave in certain ways But more and more it is not our anger or fear that politicians appeal to but our exhaustion  Exhaustion has become a rhetorical weapon for both sides of the Brexit divide from some Brexiteers embracing the slogan Bored of Brexit Pass The Deal to the remainers claiming that only revoking article will avoid years of wrangling over our new relationship with the EU Equally it is a political cudgel against MPs remain or leave who refuse to take an easy way out of Brexit demanding more time for scrutiny of the deal or a more careful deliberative process for the public to have their say 
OCT30	Vietnamese migrants are not ‘lured’ by traffickers. They just want a better future	Thirty nine bodies found in the back of a refrigerated lorry in an Essex industrial park Apart from shock and rage this tragic news feels like deja vu Almost two decades ago in Chinese people were found suffocated to death in Dover in similar horrific circumstances Those men and women banged on doors and screamed for their lives the only two survivors revealed The tragic deaths left families behind and communities back in Fujian province devastated  Today many of the people eight women and men are believed to have come from Vietnam as families there desperately look for their missing loved ones

When something has been done one way for many years and when doing things that way has made a certain group of people fat and happy it is natural that that group of people will want to continue doing things that way It is also natural that the much larger group of people who have been hungry and neglected for all those years as a result of the way things have been done will want to do something different Eventually the larger group full of righteous anger will win But the fat and happy class will cling tightly to what they have for as long as their swollen fingers can hold on This is essentially what s happening within the Democratic party right now The weak grip of the old guard is being broken one finger at a time  The election of Donald Trump and the sudden viability of Bernie Sanders as a candidate in were both enormous flashing billboards reading THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW To fail to read these signs amounts to active willful ignorance Many people were surprised by the way things went in the last presidential election but there is no excuse for being surprised by the same things again 
OCT30	My minor role in Morrissey’s latest outburst	Back in June I wrote a piece for the Guardian recounting how Morrissey had once been my greatest inspiration As one of his very few black fans I described how after years of giving him the benefit of the doubt buying every record he ever made and leaping on stage to kiss him at shows I felt personally betrayed by his repeated demonstrations of intolerance  Fast forward a few months and on Sunday I woke to friends sending me pictures of Morrissey wearing a T shirt emblazoned with the words Fuck the Guardian One message was accompanied by expletives another by the eye roll emoji Another simply said You did this 
OCT30	Democracy is under attack in post-Wall Europe – but the spirit of 1989 is fighting back	Imagine someone who had witnessed the liberation of western Europe in returning in only to find the dictators coming back That s ratherhow it feels revisiting central Europe years after the velvet revolutions of  Earlier this year I sat in a hotel bar in Budapest with an old anti communist dissident friend J nos Kis who calmly described the regime of prime minister Viktor Orb n to me as an autocracy Yet it was Kis who first introduced me to Orb n back in presenting the then year old student as a bright light of a new generation of young liberal democrats At a rally in Gda sk in June I heard European council president Donald Tusk call on his fellow Poles to learn from the example of the Solidarity movement of the s in opposing the country s nationalist populist Law and Justice party government Yet Law and Justice triumphed again this month in a general election 
OCT31	Boris Johnson said this was die in a ditch day. Now it’s proof you can’t trust him	We know Halloween is overhyped but it did promise to be genuinely terrifying this year Jacob Rees Mogg warned that the Conservative party would cease to exist Boris Johnson declared that he would die in a ditch Mark Francois informed daytime television viewers that the country would explode In the end the day s most dramatic event was a row about handshaking between Sajid Javid and Hugh Grant  I speak of course of the third Brexit extension Just as we did not leave the EU on March or on the second deadline of April we will not leave on October Incredibly staying in the EU beyond an entirely arbitrary deadline did not prove especially frightening after all The Tory Nostradamuses fears or secret hopes of social and political chaos came to nothing Life after the latest missed deadline will continue exactly as before 
OCT31	Ignore Zuckerberg’s self-serving rubbish. Facebook must be regulated	Let us be grateful for small mercies Thank you Twitter for banning political advertising Given that such advertising is by its nature biased tendentious and hard to check Twitter is behaving as a good publisher should Politicians may make full use of its outlet That is democracy But as the organisation s chief Jack Dorsey points out with social media awash in micro targeting deepfakes manipulated videos and misinformation those who control it should keep it as clean as possible Money may not buy truth but it should not drown fairness  Facebook disagrees Its boss Mark Zuckerberg declares it not right for private companies to censor politicians or the news He subscribes to the romantic view of social media as the yellow brick road of digital s global village The road should not dictate who travels along it it should just collect the tolls That includes advertisers the sustenance of Zuckerberg s bn empire This argument reruns the celebrated or notorious US supreme court ruling on Citizens United in which overturned restrictions on campaign finance as being an offence against free speech From then on lobbyists corporations tycoons anyone with money could spend what they liked during an election It declared open season for fake news targeted ads and dark money Super Pacs That season gave us Donald Trump and has yet to close 
OCT31	Nicky Morgan has gone – and with her, what was left of moderation in the Tory party	The shock resignation of the cabinet member Nicky Morgan last night speaks volumes about the nature of this Conservative government present or prospective that she no longer wishes to be a part of The rightward march of a Boris Johnson led party is something a surprising number of Tory MPs have decided they can no longer stomach as they jump ship with unconvincing mumblings about spending more time with their families  Standing down suddenly not just from the cabinet but from her seat and from politics altogether at age in the prime of her career is a drastic act that has taken her colleagues by complete surprise Politics is not a job but a way of life a mode of thinking and being a social world a friendship group almost a cult It s an addictive activity that can take years to get over in the rehab of normal life The yearnings of MPs ejected or retired can last a lifetime especially those not lucky enough to slip into the rest and recovery zone of the House of Lords 
OCT31	The Grenfell families have been vindicated. Now they need justice	Behailu Kebede did everything correctly He woke to the beeping of a smoke alarm in his flat in Grenfell Tower just before am and saw light white smoke coming from the Hotpoint fridge freezer in his kitchen He dialled asking the operator to send someone quickly He knocked on his neighbours doors alerting them to the fire before turning off the mains electricity switch at the fuse box in the hallway of his flat and leaving his home for the last time closing the door behind him Within minutes of his call flames reached the roof of the storey building in west London with devastating consequences  How an ordinary kitchen fire failed to be contained and how a modern building could have been engulfed by flames and destroyed is the question at the heart of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry Phase report released on Wednesday The report sets out details of what happened on the night charting the actions of emergency services the local authority and the deceased It unequivocally exonerates Mr Kebede someone who has been harassed by both tabloid and reputable news outlets in false narratives 
OCT31	Workington Man is London’s latest stereotype for the northern voters it neglects	In elections past we have met Essex Man and Worcester Woman Now journalists are pouring out of London again in search of another stereotypical swing voter Workington Man apparently an older white man who voted leave has no degree and lives in a rugby league town He is the Tories new target voter according to a report by the thinktank Onward and much of the national media has gone wild in response The reaction back home in Wigan could not be more different  Voters outside London are wearily resigned to suddenly being subjects of much interest during election time after years of events that loom large in our villages towns and cities extreme weather transport chaos drug problems and broken government promises going largely unreported Since the Brexit referendum in we ve also got used to journalists channelling their inner David Attenborough to travel to our towns to interview leave voters that strange species that must apparently be observed in its natural habitat before hopping on the train back to London We have become used to being reduced to homogenous stereotypes and to dismal language about our towns as left behind places and wastelands where people have nothing left to lose and entire communities have apparently been slung on the slagheap 
OCT31	US-style healthcare would be a disaster for our NHS patients – so don’t vote for it	 As a GP working in London it is not uncommon for me to hear people say they can t afford prescription charges or that they don t have the money to buy their medication until they get paid at the end of the month Some drugs are so expensive they are wholly out of people s reach But if this is such an effective treatment why isn t it available free on the NHS patients ask me 
OCT31	The giant hole in government finances is more proof that austerity has failed	While much of the talk this week has been about the election far less reported was the news that government coffers will probably be a massive bn worse off than expected This would wipe out the often quoted bn headroom built up by the former chancellor Philip Hammond to cope with the costs of Brexit and overshoot the government s deficit target by bn  In a break with recent tradition the Treasury has refused to publish the Office for Budget Responsibility s autumn check of the economy and public finances The planned budget has been cancelled too But the Resolution Foundation crunched the numbers and has now reached this stark figure The government s fiscal rules in effect have been shot to pieces rules that have been a centrepiece of successive budgets that have driven cuts in public spending for nearly a decade 
OCT31	A children’s book about food banks is a grim sign of our failure as a society	I have just read a beautiful book about something truly obscene Full of lovely pictures and occasional bits of text it s the kind you might read with your four year old It shows a little girl and her mum as they visit a food bank  It s a No Money Day is narrated by the daughter who sees how her mother worries over every penny while shielding her from the painful stuff There s no more cereal so I have the last piece of toast Luckily Mum isn t hungry the girl says and you know the biggest thing Mum will have for breakfast is her own little white lie When they reach the food bank the child tucks into biscuits and squash while her mother sags like a balloon from which the air has escaped 
OCT31	Boris Johnson has inadvertently taught us the greatest skill in politics: compromise	Before we all charge off into the electoral unknown let us remember some realities that are at risk of being left behind in the rush In the years before no British general election produced a hung parliament In the nine years since two have done so Nothing about this is predictive for December But it is clearly within the bounds of possibility that there could be a third hung parliament and a fourth Conservative government in this decade without an overall majority   Single party government is the British norm wrote the political scientist David Butler in a book Coalitions in British Politics that presciently considered what might happen if that norm were ever to change Forty years on change has come In this election at least seven British parties and three more in Northern Ireland could win seats So the new norm could easily continue recur or perhaps even become more entrenched 
OCT31	The bedroom tax is still ruining lives. Its victims need to know they matter	 Today s news is tomorrow s fish and chip papers is a saying long used to soothe celebrities facing scandal but increasingly it s one that could just as easily describe British politics In this era of Brexit mania a headline declaring major breaking news is barely published before a new turn of events makes it instantly out of date But as the nation and the media prepares for what will be the most febrile election campaign in a generation it means some of the most serious issues facing the country are being forgotten  I d call it a kind of political amnesia Millions of families endure turmoil at the hands of government polices yet as the years pass those policies barely get a mention in news reports any more 
NOV1	Johnson, Corbyn and Farage are all for ‘the people’ against ‘the elite’. This could end badly	Imagine our collective surprise to wake up today and discover that prime minister Boris Johnson wasn t deceased in a ditch And yet we hadn t left the EU as he promised on October no ifs or buts Like so many of Johnson s vows I m sure he d bluster that it was true when he made it  Alas as predicted vast numbers of Britons took to the streets On the night of October I myself beheld scores perhaps hundreds of small black clad and increasingly deranged beings roaming around house to house making demands 
NOV1	A disgrace? Not at all: we’ll miss this House of Commons	Say it like a catechism every morning every evening and twice before meals no one knows what will happen no one knows what will happen no one knows what will happen This is as unpredictable an election as there s ever been with voter volatility at record highs and party allegiance at record lows No one knows how the divisions within the competing tribes of leave and remain will play out will Nigel Farage hive off pro Brexit voters from the Tories and so boost Labour or could it be the other way around As the late screenwriter William Goldman so famously said of Hollywood Nobody knows anything  But if we won t know who s won till December and maybe not even then we already know what s been lost The current parliament is about to breathe its last its final act will be the election of a new Speaker on Monday As they leave transformed from MPs back into mere candidates the members of the old House will have ringing in their ears the booming voice of the attorney general Geoffrey Cox who in a pantomime performance in September told them they were a disgrace that they had lost the moral right to sit on these green benches Echoing too will be the words of both this prime minister and the last one denouncing them as saboteurs of the popular will even as agents of surrender to a foreign enemy 
NOV1	I never expected to go viral just for saying billionaires shouldn’t exist	It was a surprise to say the least when a clip of my appearance on BBC Radio Live yesterday went viral prompting a row on social media and beyond about the existence of billionaires But perhaps such an outcome should be expected when politicians start talking about other people s money  During an interview on the Emma Barnett Show I said that I that don t think anyone in Britain should be a billionaire The host met my remark with performative incredulity Why on earth shouldn t people be able to be billionaires she countered 
NOV1	My time on The Apprentice taught me a lot about black men in business	How many black British businessmen can you name Take a minute I ll wait I m not dismissing the accomplishments of any black men who have reached the heights in the corporate world But I guarantee many people will struggle to think of more than names Of FTSE chief executives there are currently more white men called Steve than there are ethnic minorities in total just five Of those five only one is a black male  A lack of recognised black businessmen was one of the reasons I applied to BBC One s The Apprentice in for which I was selected as a candidate I was then using an old family surname Boateng Since Tim Campbell won the first ever series in only one other black man apart from me has reached the seventh week Seeing Lord Sugar s you re fired finger point at me was surreal though with the disappointment came a sense of relief that I could finally get a good night s sleep However having sold the most in every task up until that point I didn t feel it was my time to go This got me thinking why have black men struggled to succeed on the show and more importantly in business in the UK This year for example by the third week of the show the only two black male candidates had already been fired 
NOV1	The People’s Vote campaign has run aground – but it has one last chance	The polls have barely moved Not the polls for the general election but the ones on voting intention in a second referendum They show a country as sharply divided on the question as last time Now remain has shaded a few points into the lead but most polls find don t know stubbornly high The conventional wisdom in was that these voters would break for remain in the final days Conventional wisdom was confounded  Leaks from the People s Vote campaign as it has crumbled into infighting show it to be still in thrall to that conventional wisdom certain that all we have to do is wait and remain will triumph Thin on ideas complacent on strategy it seems to have little in the way of targets even the most obvious of all converting the split electorate into a social majority 
NOV1	Rugby league is a rebel sport – its northern strongholds will never turn Conservative	Will the decisive battles of the general election be fought on the playing fields of the north of England Maybe so now that the Conservative thinktank Onward has identified so called Workington Man and his strong rugby league traditions as a key target for Boris Johnson s election campaign  The idea that rugby league traditions have anything in common with the Old Etonians in charge of Britain is laughable Rugby league was actually born out of a radical revolt against the stranglehold of the privately educated over rugby When huge numbers of industrial workers in the north of England took up rugby in the s the privately educated leaders of the Rugby Football Union tried to restrict access to the game by making it an amateur sport Why should we hand it over without a struggle to the hordes of working men players who would quickly engulf all others asked rugby and cricket international Frank Mitchell in 
NOV1	It's voters, not pollsters, who will write the story of this election	Election night at Harrow leisure centre was a tense affair I had been in the borough for more than a month covering the battle for Harrow West a Labour held marginal that was th on the Tories target list Labour won it in with a slim majority and had clung on to it ever since  The tension however related to next door Harrow East a Tory constituency It went to recounts sending the Tory candidate pacing nervously in every direction He had considered his seat safe the Labour MP for Harrow West believed his was at risk Yet Labour won Harrow West by votes increasing its majority fivefold while in Harrow East the Tory majority was reduced to just I had been in the area to write about a seat that Labour might lose It hadn t occurred to me they might gain one 
NOV1	Middle-aged people are the new swing voters	An election is coming You may have noticed The early phase of any campaign is the contest about what the election will actually be about where the battle lines will lie If you re gunning for the Conservatives or Liberal Democrats you probably want it to be all about Brexit if you re backing Labour probably anything but Either way we know with certainty that underlying the tactical battles of this election will be a crucial issue age  In the same way that class dominated many elections of the th century age has increasingly come to dominate in the st A voter s age wasn t a decisive factor in which party they opted for in the s but it has become increasingly important as a predictor in recent decades In a year old was twice as likely to back Labour as a year old The latter in turn was more than twice as likely to vote Conservative Come polling day our age will do a lot of work in explaining who we vote for 
NOV1	Japan’s rising sun flag has a history of horror. It must be banned at the Tokyo Olympics	Imagine if at the opening ceremony of the Los Angeles Olympics the stadium were filled to capacity with fans waving the American Confederate flag A similarly hurtful scene could become reality at the Tokyo Games next summer if the Japanese rising sun flag is on display  Japanese athletes and fans regularly sport their national flag a red ball centred on white The rising sun symbol is different however A red ball with red rays it is sometimes used by companies in advertisements yet it is technically a military flag from until the end of the second world war it was imperial Japan s war flag Since a renewed version of the rising sun has been the banner of the Japanese navy known as the Japan Maritime Self Defence Force 
NOV1	I quit Twitter and haven’t looked back – my fellow MPs should do the same	For over three years parliament has been going around in circles progressing to nowhere consumed by debate about how to respond to the referendum decision to leave the European Union Despite a majority of current MPs voting in support of invoking article and standing for election in on manifesto commitments to leave a majority of them have been unwilling to allow Brexit to be delivered  This impasse has led to deep frustration in parliament and in wider society creating divisions within communities and families as well as among politicians Brexit has poisoned civil debate It s a boil that needs to be lanced which is why I ve supported the prime minister s decision to hold a general election even though I d like to have seen Brexit delivered first 
NOV2	It’s time to throw the kitchen sink at Trump, and the cutlery too	It would be unfair to pre judge the impeachment case against Donald Trump But let s do so anyway When Richard Nixon faced impeachment in he was charged with abuse of power obstruction of justice and contempt of Congress Given the evidence against him Nixon resigned rather than risk being thrown out of office  It s unlikely that Trump will quit voluntarily He believes the Republican controlled Senate will save him But the impeachment process is accelerating amid an impressive accumulation of incriminating testimony The Democrat led House of Representatives voted to formalise proceedings last week As matters stand Trump will probably face similar charges to Nixon 
NOV2	The more Nigel Farage plays Brexiters for fools, the more they seem to like it	Brexit supporters expect the elite the establishment the Westminster bubble to rig the system to stop them taking our country back The enemy imposed metric measurements drink driving laws immigrants and smoking bans and now it wants to stop Brexit They take us for fools They think we are stupid  And yet their actions show that cynics who doubt everything trust Nigel Farage even though he takes them for absolute idiots It was an education to watch him make his offer of a Leave alliance to Boris Johnson on Friday Farage s warm up acts played all the old tunes Richard Tice a property investor who has the well cut suits and fading good looks of the type of charmer who cons widows out of their savings said the Tories lived in the stinking rotten borough of Westminster Claire Fox who satisfyingly looks as malicious in the flesh as you would expect a member of the Revolutionary Communist party who ended up on the hard right via a spell denying the massacre of Bosnia s Muslims to look followed up The Tories were among the elitists scoffing behind their manicured hands and calling Brexiters xenophobes ignorant and far right Ann Widdecombe came next I won t pretend to understand all or most of what she said But her drift was that the Tories were a pack of liars who would betray Brexit and all who believed in it 
NOV2	Obama’s right – you don’t change minds by damning your opponents	Cancel culture has been cancelled by Barack Obama Rejoice Now a long established ritual of social media to be cancelled or called out means to be subject to severe public contempt on account of some infraction against morality  It can spill into lost jobs broken friendships and public protests ultimately it amounts to an effort to declare the victim a non person someone intolerable to decent society No appeals and no rehabilitation 
NOV2	Is this the end for TV shows that goad the vulnerable for laughs?	Is it possible to be cautiously optimistic that the not so golden TV era of bear baiting people in the name of entertainment is finally passing  The digital culture media and sport committee viewed leaked backstage footage of The Jeremy Kyle Show as part of an inquiry into reality TV going on to condemn the programme s bullying methodology and complete abdication of the duty of care The committee was set up after the death of Steve Dymond who killed himself after appearing on the Kyle show to take a lie detector test and the suicides of two Love Island contestants However while television networks have long been guilty of putting good television before participant welfare this is also about us the viewers and the wider culture of dehumanisation that made exposing and goading often uneducated generally skint people feel like acceptable telly 
NOV2	Olivia Wilde: blunting the scissors of the in-flight movie censors	A few years ago in an all too brief interlude between conquering a severe fear of flying and the advent of buzzkill flight shame I settled into a transatlantic journey stuffed with cheesy pasta flanked by an adorable number of miniature wine bottles and prepared to watch the ultimate comfort film Bridesmaids  In my happy carby stupor I had forgotten that it opens with Kristen Wiig jiggling around on top of Jon Hamm for far longer than the woman next to me felt comfortable with I saw her glance over and glance back then repeat the manoeuvre her disapproval silent but deadly I looked down at my abandoned bread roll hoping to convey the message that I was only there for Maya Rudolph s food poisoning in a wedding dress Somehow to acknowledge it by turning it off would have been worse so I left them to bounce on unwatched yet judged 
NOV2	Johnson’s populism has given the Tories a lifeline – but they are running out of ideas	Since Boris Johnson became prime minister there s been a quiet dread on the left and a less quiet excitement on the right that the Tories have found a new magic formula one that will renew their nine year old government A cartoonishly charismatic leader a shameless softening of austerity populist attacks on liberals and the nationalist adventure of Brexit all this has been carefully calculated the fear goes so that the Conservatives can sweep out of their southern English heartlands and into the electorally decisive north and Midlands  Predictions of an imminent Tory breakthrough and new ascendancy are familiar in British politics it s arguably the commentariat s default analysis Only two years ago Theresa May s combination of tut tutting provincial conservatism and disapproval of the worst aspects of capitalism briefly persuaded many observers from the editor of the Daily Mail Paul Dacre to the usually reliable political scientist David Runciman that she could dominate politics for years to come 
NOV2	Johnson, Corbyn and Farage are all for ‘the people’ against ‘the elite’.

NOV2	Netflix may have found an answer to our ‘too much to watch’ age	Things in life that could be improved by being speeded up work meetings telephone banking golf the sandwich queue at my local deli Films Well it s tempting The new Martin Scorsese movie is three and a half hours long and some of us like to be in bed before midnight  This week we learned that Netflix has been testing a new feature that allows users to speed up their viewing without sacrificing the dialogue making it different from the fast forward button prompting outpourings of fury from filmmakers on social media Don t fuck with our timing frothed Judd Apatow the director of Trainwreck and Knocked Up We give you nice things Leave them as they were intended to be seen Another spectacularly bad idea and another cut to the already bleeding out cinema experience raged Brad Bird he of The Incredibles and Ratatouille

NOV3	Weinstein’s reappearance showed he has no shame. I had to call him out	I had one of the most surreal nights of my life a couple of weeks ago A friend of mine invited me to attend an event for emerging actors a space to collaborate network and support other artists doing the work we all have chosen to devote our lives to We were promised an evening of exciting new work raw and vulnerable comedy performances and endless networking Instead we were met with Hollywood s most notorious alleged serial rapist Harvey Weinstein More daunting than that though was that we were met with a room full of artists who prioritised the comfort of a suspected abuser over the safety of the community they claimed to uplift  As a smile stretched across his face all I could think of was the faces of the abusers I ve encountered in my own life
NOV3	Elections are changing: broadcasting rules are stuck in the last century	In election campaigns attention returns to broadcasting standards Stopwatches re emerge to count the airtime the rival parties and candidates receive A thorough rethink of these mostly pointless rituals is overdue especially as pressure grows for legislative action to tackle the harms to democratic processes for which social media giants are blamed though they are not wholly responsible  Lawmakers tend to build new sector specific regulation on the old adding to and tweaking a familiar model But th century broadcasting regulation is not fit for the purposes that regulation co regulation and or self regulation of communication must fulfil if notions such as an informed electorate are to survive 
NOV3	British farmers are not the enemy in the battle against the climate crisis	I am a farmer the third generation to grow crops and pedigree beef cattle on my family s modest farm on the edge of the picturesque Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire Summer and autumn is primarily given over to long days of harvesting and planting crops while our traditional longhorn cattle munch at grass in the long winter nights they come indoors to shelter and chew at hay harvested and stored in the spring  Most of you reading this I would wager are not directly associated with agriculture It might therefore be assumed that there s a gulf between our plains of existence that we do not and cannot understand each other I believe this is a false assumption 
NOV3	It’s time to throw the kitchen sink at Trump, and the cutlery too	It would be unfair to pre judge the impeachment case against Donald Trump But let s do so anyway When Richard Nixon faced impeachment in he was charged with abuse of power obstruction of justice and contempt of Congress Given the evidence against him Nixon resigned rather than risk being thrown out of office  It s unlikely that Trump will quit voluntarily He believes the Republican controlled Senate will save him But the impeachment process is accelerating amid an impressive accumulation of incriminating testimony The Democrat led House of Representatives voted to formalise proceedings last week As matters stand Trump will probably face similar charges to Nixon
