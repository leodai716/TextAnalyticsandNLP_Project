JAN1	Politicians could ease refugee suffering, but instead they stoke fear	The major incident is well and truly under way Sajid Javid has signalled just how seriously he is taking the recent spike in refugee crossings across the Channel by interrupting his holiday to deal with the crisis  All manner of plans are now being devised to shore up our borders Around people have crossed the Channel since Christmas Day but while the government ramps up concern about this sudden new development actually something that has been occurring since context is lacking 
JAN1	If we must look to the past, let’s make it 1989 – a year of transformation	Whatever happened to the future Brexiteers cling on to a fantastical mixture of empire war and an England whose genius was supposedly embodied by Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher In the United States Donald Trump harks back to an America of economic might musclebound men toiling in car factories and coalmines and splendid isolation A recent issue of the Economist surveyed politics in Europe and the US and observed an orgy of reminiscence partly traceable to the fact that millions of westerners cannot shake off a deep and understandable sense of decline  There s an obvious irony in having to look back to find something better but marks the th anniversary of a run of events that embodied pretty much the polar opposite optimism faith in the future and a sense of shared humanity that could not be more different from the polarised rancorous mood of today As this year unfolds the events of a year as replete with significance as or will be celebrated and picked apart in Berlin there will be an impressive run of commemorative events Leafing through histories of the time and thinking back to what happened what most sticks out is a set of emotions and impulses that we would do well to revive defiance joy an urge to run headlong into whatever happened next 
JAN1	Brexit is not an end to Britain’s liaison with Europe. It’s just a new beginning	They are sick of the whole thing They just want it to be over No more uncertainty Brexiteers want resolution They will be disappointed Willing something does not make it so Aethelred wanted Viking raids to stop The kingdoms of Wales Scotland and Ireland wished the Norman and Plantagenet monarchs of England would cease their predatory lunges into their territory Neville Chamberlain hoped that Hitler would be content with Czechoslovakia Oliver Letwin wished there was an island we could send all migrants to The hopes of politicians and rulers are whispers in a gale  There is no end state in our relations with Europe There is only millennia of collaboration conquest disputes exchange competition and alliance 
JAN1	Louis CK’s rant shows abusers are still casting themselves as victims	One of the more idiotic if not wholly surprising byproducts of the MeToo era is how men who have been exposed as misogynists and abusers have recast themselves as victims Lost livelihoods and broken reputations are they tell us an excessive price to pay for their transgressions Lately though going hand in hand with this victim status is a new hardened persona one that comes bathed in fury and self righteousness You thought that was bad they seem to say You ain t seen the half of it  Take Louis CK the comedian who in November admitted to repeatedly exposing himself to and masturbating in front of unconsenting women and on being found out declared I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want I will now step back and take a long time to listen For CK a long time meant nine months after which he was back on stage at the Comedy Cellar in New York doing what comics tend to do talking and saying what he wanted Now new audio has emerged from a fortnight ago featuring a lengthy Louis CK rant I would call it a comedy set but that would give it a credence it doesn t deserve recorded at a Long Island club It finds him jokingly bemoaning the money he has lost in the past year mocking the survivors of the shooting in Parkland Florida in which students and staff members were killed and lamenting the new political correctness that champions gender neutral pronouns and frowns on the use of words like retarded Presumably sensing disapproval from his audience he says What are you going to take away my birthday My life is over I don t give a shit You can be offended it s OK You can get mad at me Anyway So why do black guys have big dicks Let s talk about that for a minute 
JAN1	I used to defend smacking children. Now I see it as an abuse of power	Brats do not endear themselves Even when insulated from children we nevertheless encounter our fair share of adults whom we suspect got their own way too much of the time as kids The recent behaviour of some Conservative MPs could be a case in point The foot stamping of fanatical Brexiteers unable to reconcile what they wish for with reality is not unlike that of a child screaming their insistence that they won t wear a coat even though it s C outside  It s not hard to imagine that they were rarely told no when they were young Or that the finality of the word was seldom made concrete to them They have become grandiose and overindulged and we re collectively suffering the consequences of their tantrum 
JAN1	Don’t expect Brexit to give us a British Alexander Hamilton	I spent most of hearing the same story of revolution ambition and factional rivalry played on a loop And when I wasn t listening to the Hamilton soundtrack I wrote about Brexit  I m late to the Hamilton party I know Lin Manuel Miranda s musical about the first US Treasury secretary opened on Broadway in I only got tickets to see it in London a few weeks ago but by then I was word perfect on the score For the uninitiated Hamilton tells the story of an orphan immigrant s climb up the social and political ladders of newly independent America culminating in a death that well let s just say it puts the modern Twitter spat into perspective Plus singing dancing rapping 
JAN1	Human dignity is in danger. In 2019 we must stand as one to survive	What does it mean to be human That question sits at the core of human rights To be human has specific implications human self awareness and the actions taken to uphold human dignity these are what gives the concept of humanity a special meaning  Human self awareness and human actions determine the interplay between individual thought and language and the wider society It is our actions as humans that deliver economic security the right to education the right to free association and free expression and which create the conditions for protecting expression and encouraging bold thinking When we abandon efforts to uphold human dignity we forfeit the essential meaning of being human and when we waver in our commitment to the idea of human rights we abandon our moral principles What follows is duplicity and folly corruption and tyranny and the endless stream of humanitarian crises that we see in the world today 
JAN1	There is a path to a second referendum – and only Labour can win it	If it was the season of peace and goodwill towards all then politics failed to get the memo Not only did hostilities continue through the Christmas period some of the main protagonists announced in advance that they were incapable of taking a break If anything the holidays provided more opportunities for irate booze fuelled Twitter rants One particular object of ire was Jeremy Corbyn s pre Christmas interview in the Guardian where he appeared to dash the hopes of many on the left that Labour would immediately become the party of remain  As the political class sobers up in January and returns to Westminster it will become apparent that little has changed The size of the majority against the prime minister s deal will have diminished but as No briefed in the run up to the internal confidence vote in her leadership it only takes a majority of one Bizarrely Downing Street has chosen to amplify the threat of no deal by announcing more money and even the deployment of troops But this strategy seems set to backfire it will only give comfort to the European Research Group hardliners that there can be a soft landing to jumping off the cliff edge 
JAN1	Was 2018 a turning point for women? Yes, it exposed what we’re up against	A pale slouching Harvey Weinstein has so far escaped criminal charges for the allegations of sexual assault against him A millionaire is given a three year jail sentence for killing a woman who died from the horrific injuries he inflicted on her including having bleach poured over her face because this was said to be consensual rough sex The incredibly brave Kurdish women who have faced down Islamic State have now been totally abandoned by Trump s policy on Syria This is how we end the year and though there are those reluctant still to give up the narrative of sunlit progress it s not been a great one for women  But there are so many great and good women out there who shine light into the darkness I raise a glass to you for 
JAN1	Brexiteers want Britain to ‘look east’. But their idea of Asia is a fantasy	In a few weeks Singapore observes the th anniversary of Sir Stamford Raffles arrival The spot where he landed is marked with a statue arms folded looking out to sea while the storey headquarters of a local bank towers behind him It s a popular selfie spot  Singapore s government plans a series of exhibitions and historic walking trails that will turn the spotlight on the island s long and successful history both before and after the imperial adventurer strode ashore and planted the union flag in January 
JAN2	May has run down the Brexit clock. It must be stopped	Theresa May thought her Brexit deal was an offer MPs could not refuse Not because it would bring our constituents anything useful Quite the opposite it will make us poorer our economy less certain and our outlook less hopeful Take the prime minister s Brexit deal or crash out of Europe with no deal at all she declared  But far from being the Don Corleone of British politics Theresa May is more the emperor with no clothes Explicitly keeping the option of a no deal on the table is an act of supreme economic sabotage It is also delusional The prime minister has long preferred the support of hard right Brexiteers over more reasonable voices within her party Now she is seeking the votes she needs by threatening these same Brexiteers with something they actually want a no deal Brexit Her attempt at blackmail is both stupid and venal 
JAN2	Sajid Javid’s bluster on Channel crossings has an ugly Australian precedent	Britain is in the grip of a crisis Apparently Last week the home secretary Sajid Javid declared the number of people attempting to cross the Channel a major incident though the numbers don t support such a claim But that didn t deter the newspapers   Home secretary brings back two Border Force cutters to tackle migrant crisis says the Metro Sajid Javid recalls two Border Force boats to patrol English Channel amid migrant crisis the Evening Standard reports Migrant crisis the Sun shouts in capitals Two Border Force boats redeployed from the Med to patrol the Channel for migrants The Daily Express joined in Migrant crisis migrants detained at Kent beach ahead of Sajid Javid talks And the Times Migrant crisis Sajid Javid sends extra boats to Channel 
JAN2	Here, in the bloodlands of Belarus, I found hope for the future of Europe	In December I travelled to Minsk for a seminar with a group of European historians A few miles outside the capital of Belarus we visited places where both the Nazis and Stalin s secret police had committed some of the worst crimes of the th century During those few days I also spoke with some young locals who offered glimmers of hope as to what a truly united Europe could one day look like  It was the most instructive trip I ve made in years a deep dive into conflicting European memories highlighting the difficulty of overcoming stereotypes and ideological narratives as well as the legacy of the cold war in people s minds 
JAN2	Theresa May has broken her promise to the over-75s	Imagine for a second the BBC taking a frail housebound elderly pensioner to court for not possessing a TV licence that for years she has had for free Then imagine fining her the standard penalty with legal costs on top and if she doesn t pay or can t pay sending her to prison  Unthinkable In fact one in every court cases is over non payment of TV licences And from next year millions of people aged over could lose their right to a free TV licence and if they don t pay up end up being taken to court despite a Conservative election promise they would not have to pay 
JAN2	I thought online fakes would cause an infopocalypse	Remember when Barack Obama called President Trump a total and complete dipshit No me neither But if you search for it there s a video on YouTube where he appears to be saying just that I used to think that deepfakes would change the world These clips created using off the shelf AI systems take advantage of new capabilities to near perfectly edit video swapping faces altering expressions and synthesising speech without any artistic expertise  The technology burst into the public consciousness around Christmas when a small batch of perverts cottoned on to the possibilities of using it to insert their favourite celebrities into pornography But others were quick to see the wider ramifications of the tech a well timed deepfake of say a world leader declaring war or an FTSE chief executive openly discussing their company s impending bankruptcy could send shockwaves through the world s media

JAN3	Donald Trump has a point – the world should start solving its own problems	For a Briton to spend time in the US just now is a blessed relief Whole days pass and no talk of Brexit It is as if a pall has lifted from the art of conversation But the US has its own deep divide slashing through the populist body politic It is Donald Trump and America first  Trump has become a phenomenon Like Samson in the temple he seems able to topple the entire edifice of policy Down crashes America s government machine for the sake of a wall world trade is devastated stock markets plummet alliances lie in ruins It is astonishing what one man can do to the world virtually alone 
JAN3	Elizabeth Warren’s ‘likability’? The US media has learned nothing from 2016	The countdown to the US election has only just begun but it s already starting to look like a hellish repeat of  On Monday senator Elizabeth Warren became the first major Democrat to announce her intention to run for president As you may be aware Warren is a woman which means that it is basically illegal not to compare her with Hillary Clinton despite the two being very different politicians It is also mandatory to analyse her likability which we all know is the most important issue when it comes to female candidates Indeed less than hours after Warren had announced her bid Politico published a story headlined Warren battles the ghosts of Hillary They publicised the story with a widely derided tweet asking How does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground 
JAN3	Charging forced marriage victims rescue fees is a Foreign Office racket	In recent days the abhorrent practice of the Foreign Office whereby it forces British nationals who are victims of forced marriage abroad to pay for their protection and rescue has again hit the headlines It is left to the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt to say he wants to get to the bottom of the issue  But this is not a new issue that has only just come to light Southall Black Sisters the charity I run has sounded the alert about this for some time but without success The Guardian reported that this was happening over years ago This is why Hunt s appeal to British embassies for more humanity and compassion appears disingenuous 
JAN3	Fiona Onasanya is lucky. She’d be out of a job were it not for Brexit	It seems a strange thing to say about the disgraced Labour MP for Peterborough but Fiona Onasanya is a lucky woman Onasanya was found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice last month She faces a prison sentence She is contemplating the ruin of a career that included her public aspiration to become Britain s first black female prime minister I m not sticking my neck out very far to say that this last is not now going to happen  Onasanya s offence she repeatedly denied to police that she was behind the wheel when her car was caught speeding in Cambridgeshire in She refused to say who was driving In fact it was Onasanya who is a qualified solicitor as well as an MP After a first trial failed to agree a verdict Onasanya was found guilty at the retrial She will be sentenced soon 
JAN3	It’s not just Windrush. Britain’s immigration scandal will grow in 2019	Tasfin came to the UK in from Bangladesh or what was then called East Pakistan He was years old Orphaned during the brutal partition of India by the departing British he had been working since the age of for an American company in the port city of Chittagong He made tea unloaded containers repaired cars and swept floors And he eventually concluded that the only way to ensure a better life for himself was to scrape together the fare for a one way ride to the Tilbury Docks As a citizen of the Commonwealth he enjoyed this right to move to the United Kingdom as did all those now fondly referred to as the Windrush generation  Now Tasfin lives in Tooting south London with the eldest of his three sons surrounded by grandchildren the youngest of whom will be sitting her GCSEs in a few months time After working for over years on the London Underground he retired a few months after his wife passed away and struggles with chronic arthritis 
JAN3	Indian women just did a remarkable thing – they formed a wall of protest	On January in one of the biggest movements for women s rights in India million women lined up across the length of the southern state of Kerala to uphold Renaissance values What they were demanding was an end to violent agitations against women trying to enter Kerala s Sabarimala temple a popular Hindu pilgrimage site This followed a ruling by the Indian supreme court in September which forced the temple s doors open to women of all ages in a sensational blow to religious tradition   Where a man can enter a woman can also go What applies to a man applies to a woman the bench said in its judgment Since the temple has accepted only men and older women in their millions every year to preserve the mythological celibacy of the ruling deity Ayyappa In theory the court order only reinforced Indian women s constitutional right to enter places of worship as freely as men but in practice it wreaked mayhem Between November and December more than a dozen women of menstrual age including reporters tried to enter the temple but were stopped shoved and stoned by mobs of male devotees None of the women could make it in despite police protection and prohibitory orders Both sides are far from giving in Protests have since continued though most women who were sent back by the mobs have vowed to return 
JAN3	The space race is back on – and is China in the lead?	China s achievement in landing a spacecraft on the far side of the moon announced by Beijing s state media this morning has ramifications that go far beyond the simple statement of this being a first for mankind It puts China on the map of international space exploration on a par with the existing space powers of the United States and Russia the European Union to a lesser extent but also adds a new dimension It is the first time a landing has been attempted on the far side of the moon with the particular communications challenges this entails and it has been a success  The first response from the US space agency Nasa was generous as scientists to scientists what China had managed was a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment The response in political and military quarters in Washington as in Moscow however is likely to reflect trepidation There is now a serious newcomer to be considered 
JAN3	Labour members want another vote. Jeremy Corbyn shouldn’t fear that	At the outset of the Labour left faces both an unprecedented set of opportunities and potentially an unprecedented crisis As Theresa May hurtles towards what should be certain defeat on her Brexit deal and the divisions within the Conservative party deepen the prospects for a transformative leftwing government this year look good Even under the Fixed term Parliaments Act it is entirely plausible that the Tories will lose control and be unable to prevent an election  The problem that the left has is the gap between the apparent position of Labour s leadership and that of its rank and file In the most authoritative poll yet done research published this week by Queen Mary University shows that a whopping of Labour members back a fresh Brexit referendum substantially more than Jeremy Corbyn received in either leadership election 
JAN3	The Channel migrant ‘crisis’ is really a tale of British hypocrisy	A lot of us have spent the past few weeks telling our children some fairly problematic stuff That there s an old man with a beard who breaks into our homes with a reindeer and watches them while they sleep That it s acceptable to talk about the ins and outs of a virgin s womb That there was a genocidal king who murdered newborn boys I can t think of any context in which we would tell these stories other than Christmas but I suppose we feel they are balanced out by their happy endings Santa is a creepy idea but he does leave presents The traumatic experience of being homeless in another town with a birth imminent ends with a baby swaddled happily in a manger We don t tend to dwell on the next part in which the holy family went on to become refugees in Egypt although the Pope is among the religious figures who has suggested we should think about that more  You don t even need to go that far to see what is wrong with this year s Christmas message though which courtesy of Sajid Javid is that there is officially No Room at the Inn The home secretary cut short his a night luxury safari holiday in South Africa to appear to us as a Tory Ghost of Christmas Present with the message that Britain is now facing a full on crisis 
JAN3	The first lesson from my life as a carer? There is such a thing as society	It s leaflets at the moment If my son sees any in a cafe for instance he wants them all Later he will want to go through them and then destroy each one tearing them into tiny pieces We ve got him down to a maximum of three This is progress When he lived at home it was books each one to be looked through swiftly then reshelved on the other side of the room If we went outside every item on display in the two village shops had to be named three times I stopped going outside I stopped trying to speak to anyone on the phone because my son knew that if he stood next to me and shrieked like an agonised seagull no one could hear a thing  I have spent a large part of my life as a carer for my son whom I shall call Huw he is now a vulnerable adult who has severe autism and obsessive compulsive disorder OCD I was helped for part of that time by my daughter Rhiannon There are around million carers in the UK that s one in people and that doesn t include parents whose children aren t sick or disabled So many carers stories go untold Why Probably because it s exhausting especially if lack of sleep is part of the picture typical in cases of autism It may be because unaffected people feel uncomfortable thinking about it but it s possible that they just don t think about it full stop because our stories aren t out there And yet it s possible we will all be carers at some point 
JAN4	No-deal Brexit is like Dragons’ Den. No ferries, Chris? Sorry, I’m out	There s a certain type of movie character that finds time to suggest a shag even in the midst of a crisis If anything the fact the bomb clock is ticking or planetary destruction is pending gets them in the mood The Tories are like that but with backstabbing There are days until Brexit Theresa May s deal is about to get voted down heavily and bump the UK a few weeks closer to a calamitous no deal exit and the first thought of certain Tory leadership hopefuls is Ooh how can I do over the Saj  If you missed this latest flurry of displacement activity a report claimed the home secretary refers to himself in the third person during meetings According to what a source told the Sun and which Javid hotly denied He uses phrases like Just you watch what the Sajid is going to do about this or the Saj will sort that out Oof These drive bys made a charming companion piece to the articles suggesting that Javid was failing to get a grip on Britain s nonexistent migrant crisis and the very detailed articles about Javid s very luxurious South African holiday 
JAN4	Democrats are battling Trump. But on Brexit, Labour is tongue-tied	I m suffering from a bad case of opposition envy Perhaps you missed this only recently discovered malady among all the new year detox supplements and guides to a new you In which case let me fill you in  Spool back to the early summer of when twin horrors loomed on the horizon Brexit and Trump I imagined back then the devil offering progressive types one wish they could either have Britain stay in the European Union or see Donald Trump lose the US presidential election But they could not have both I wrote then that forced to make that diabolical choice I d opt for a remain victory in the referendum Though four years of Trump would be a nightmare Brexit would haunt us for generations 
JAN4	Think Riyadh’s Netflix ban was bad? Imagine if Hasan Minhaj was a Saudi citizen	The government of Saudi Arabia makes it very clear that resistance to its regime is futile It will not tolerate dissent it is untouchable  The kingdom has never claimed to be a democracy or that it believed in free speech the right to protest or the right to collectively bargain for rights There is no independent press 
JAN4	Beware the clever lie of a 'clean break Brexit'	Some days it can be hard to believe but Brexit hasn t actually happened yet Until pm on March when we leave the EU without a deal enter into the transition period envisaged by Theresa May s withdrawal agreement or don t leave at all because the article period has been extended the fight over our future remains a battle of ideas  Such battles are won largely with words in the absence of facts on the ground we are swayed by assertions characterisations and attempts to define sorry Theresa often rather nebulous concepts 
JAN4	All aboard Chris Grayling’s Brexit pizza ferry – what could possibly go wrong?	We re about to give back control to a government that can t tell the difference between P O and Papa John s pizza I know you think that sounds good but one day you ll want insulin or a functioning health service rather than a pepperoni stuffed crust  In case you ve missed everything here s a quick recap In government members insisted that Brexit was easy and no deal was better than a bad deal After realising that was shite they discovered they had to do quite a lot of planning for no deal This left them in the awkward position of going back to a public they d just told that Brexit would improve their lives and assuring them there d be food 
JAN4	Fat Cat Friday should shatter the myth that Britain’s bosses deserve their pay	Please raise a glass if you re not doing Dry January of course to our nation s exceptionally talented CEOs and their superhuman work ethic and skills For the average executive to have earned the equivalent of a worker s average annual salary by January is surely testament to an unimaginable amount of hard work and graft They must truly deserve the hike in their salaries since last year unlike millions of good for nothing slackers like nurses and teachers who have endured years of stagnating pay  It is worth taking a moment to absorb how great the gap now is between the worker and the boss Top executives now earn times more than the average worker in the ratio was The salary of the average FTSE chief executive is the same as that of Britons on minimum wage combined This in a country where workers have suffered the worst squeeze in wages for generations where most Britons languishing in poverty are actually in work where child poverty has increased at its fastest rate for three decades and where one in every people are classed as homeless or in inadequate homes It is not a trend restricted to Britain of course US top bosses earn times the average worker s wage 
JAN4	An invisible Irish border is crucial. That’s why we support the backstop	Life has become pretty normal for most people in Northern Ireland over the past years or so Like anyone else in the UK people go to jobs near to them or in the next town They go to doctors chemists and hospitals near to them They buy local fresh food They use trains buses and roads to get around  But if we in Britain get Brexit wrong our friends in Northern Ireland will find all of these things harder to do Why Because of the border with Ireland which is crossed million times a year as people on either side go about their daily lives 
JAN4	Cheap rail fares would mainly benefit the rich? That’s muddled thinking	One of the most depressing things about politics in the UK is realising how easy it is for total nonsense to become common sense and received wisdom  Take this tweet from YouGov following the recently announced rise in fares There will be calls for train fares to be frozen the main beneficiaries will be those in wealthier households of those who made more than train journeys last year are in households earning k Just are in households on less than k Most of the poor YouGov sagely intones take the car or bus or walk Therefore we should not lower the price because that means only rich people will benefit 
JAN4	Run, swim, cook: the new prescription for happiness	When Ella Risbridger was at her lowest ebb sitting with a psychiatrist trying to explain why she had wanted to throw herself under a bus help came from a wholly unexpected source Her mind was looking for a puzzle to occupy itself as she put it something to take her outside the horrible thoughts she was having And it settled most unexpectedly on baking  She came home from hospital and made a pie and from then on cooking became a sort of comfort and salvation For her the rhythmic and predictable act of making meals became a self soothing ritual a way not so much of curing her chronic anxiety as living through it Even the recipe that provided the title of her wholly unconventional cookbook Midnight Chicken came from an afternoon spent lying on the floor wondering if she would ever be able to get up 
JAN4	Women of colour fleeing violence need help – not penalties for who they are	Rotherham is a town now made infamous by grooming gangs and government agencies that assumed children as young as could consent to sex with men old enough to be their fathers Five minutes from a city centre that has perhaps seen better days sits the black and minority ethnic BME violence against women and girls VAWG charity Apna Haq Nestled behind a large mechanic s garage its location provides an apt visual metaphor Not unlike wild flowers that bloom by busy roadsides the charity exists and flourishes in spite of it all  Apna Haq which in Urdu means our right was set up in by manager Zlakha Ahmed Back then in her work as an English language tutor and then later as a youth worker Ahmed had come across countless beautiful intelligent women whose experiences of abuse and social isolation would stay with her In the end her frustration a word she uses frequently over men controlling women s behaviour kickstarted the charity Rooted in the community it exemplifies the importance of specialist organisations in the women s sector that cater for women from black and ethnic minority communities Yet just five years into Tory austerity Ahmed s year legacy was under threat after their contract to deliver domestic violence services was instead awarded to a generic provider 
JAN5	Brexiters ache to dish out a severe spanking, whether we like it or not	Wide eyed foreigners long ago concluded that masochism was le vice anglais Impressed by the volume of Victorian spanking pornography the Italian critic Mario Praz wrote in the s It seems to be an assured fact that sexual flagellation has been practised in England with greater frequency than elsewhere Or as a successful lawyer once declared on the theme Most people probably think S M spanking bondage whipping role play like doctors and nurses sheikhs and harems guards and prisoners is harmless and private and even funny  The late Christopher Hitchens who claimed with pride that Margaret Thatcher once smote me on the rear with a rolled up parliamentary order paper explained it thus There is almost no English surname however ancient and dignified that cannot be instantly improved by the prefix Spanker 
JAN5	Churchill and the film-maker: sadly, their dream of England persists	My older brother took me to see the original version of The Four Feathers when I was nine or He had seen it several times already had once sat through it twice when thanks to the principle of continuous performance it was possible to stay put in your seat and watch the programme all over again at no extra cost  Films about war weren t new to me The Four Feathers stood out on two counts Surprisingly given its date and in contrast to the usual British monochrome it was in Technicolor and the war it featured was older and more obscure than the familiar one which had ended in In it an army led by General Kitchener fought the Muslim revivalist leader the Mahdi and his followers in Sudan in the late s 
JAN5	Ruth Wilson’s gleeful villainy makes must-see TV of Luther	Is there a helpline for people disturbed out of doing everyday activities by Luther induced nightmares I only ask because I found myself alone on the top deck of the bus last week and instead of being grateful for that rare moment of feeling like a public transport VIP I wondered how likely it might be that a serial killer was waiting underneath the back seat ready to slither down the aisle and do me in  I ve had more are you watching it conversations about Luther s return than I have since Bodyguard was on It continues to amaze me that a show can be so duff in so many ways fundamentally nonsensical a plot entirely reliant on Luther having convenient sudden feelings about things and that grotesque dare you to flinch violence and yet it doesn t matter one bit because it s so entertaining that you barely have time to catch a breath 
JAN5	No-deal Brexit is like Dragons’ Den. No ferries, Chris? Sorry, I’m out	There s a certain type of movie character that finds time to suggest a shag even in the midst of a crisis If anything the fact the bomb clock is ticking or planetary destruction is pending gets them in the mood The Tories are like that but with backstabbing There are days until Brexit Theresa May s deal is about to get voted down heavily and bump the UK a few weeks closer to a calamitous no deal exit and the first thought of certain Tory leadership hopefuls is Ooh how can I do over the Saj  If you missed this latest flurry of displacement activity a report claimed the home secretary refers to himself in the third person during meetings According to what a source told the Sun and which Javid hotly denied He uses phrases like Just you watch what the Sajid is going to do about this or the Saj will sort that out Oof These drive bys made a charming companion piece to the articles suggesting that Javid was failing to get a grip on Britain s nonexistent migrant crisis and the very detailed articles about Javid s very luxurious South African holiday 
JAN5	Democrats are battling Trump. But on Brexit, Labour is tongue-tied	I m suffering from a bad case of opposition envy Perhaps you missed this only recently discovered malady among all the new year detox supplements and guides to a new you In which case let me fill you in  Spool back to the early summer of when twin horrors loomed on the horizon Brexit and Trump I imagined back then the devil offering progressive types one wish they could either have Britain stay in the European Union or see Donald Trump lose the US presidential election But they could not have both I wrote then that forced to make that diabolical choice I d opt for a remain victory in the referendum Though four years of Trump would be a nightmare Brexit would haunt us for generations 
JAN5	Yes to culture. But the whole nation needs a boost, not just our cities	Another year over a new one just begun sang one of Liverpool s great songsmiths And with each one that passes a new anniversary is formed Last year was significant for me as it was not just the th anniversary of Grange Hill but also the th anniversary of what will probably soon be known as the UK s one and only European capital of culture  This year will mark a decade since having seen the impact on Liverpool I suggested and began shepherding the UK city of culture project Last week the Labour MP Yvette Cooper suggested there should be a town of culture award to sit alongside it 
JAN5	Think Riyadh’s Netflix ban was bad? Imagine if Hasan Minhaj was a Saudi citizen	The government of Saudi Arabia makes it very clear that resistance to its regime is futile It will not tolerate dissent it is untouchable  The kingdom has never claimed to be a democracy or that it believed in free speech the right to protest or the right to collectively bargain for rights There is no independent press 
JAN5	Beware the clever lie of a 'clean break Brexit'	Some days it can be hard to believe but Brexit hasn t actually happened yet Until pm on March when we leave the EU without a deal enter into the transition period envisaged by Theresa May s withdrawal agreement or don t leave at all because the article period has been extended the fight over our future remains a battle of ideas  Such battles are won largely with words in the absence of facts on the ground we are swayed by assertions characterisations and attempts to define sorry Theresa often rather nebulous concepts 
JAN5	All aboard Chris Grayling’s Brexit pizza ferry – what could possibly go wrong?	We re about to give back control to a government that can t tell the difference between P O and Papa John s pizza I know you think that sounds good but one day you ll want insulin or a functioning health service rather than a pepperoni stuffed crust  In case you ve missed everything here s a quick recap In government members insisted that Brexit was easy and no deal was better than a bad deal After realising that was shite they discovered they had to do quite a lot of planning for no deal This left them in the awkward position of going back to a public they d just told that Brexit would improve their lives and assuring them there d be food 
JAN5	Fat Cat Friday should shatter the myth that Britain’s bosses deserve their pay	Please raise a glass if you re not doing Dry January of course to our nation s exceptionally talented CEOs and their superhuman work ethic and skills For the average executive to have earned the equivalent of a worker s average annual salary by January is surely testament to an unimaginable amount of hard work and graft They must truly deserve the hike in their salaries since last year unlike millions of good for nothing slackers like nurses and teachers who have endured years of stagnating pay  It is worth taking a moment to absorb how great the gap now is between the worker and the boss Top executives now earn times more than the average worker in the ratio was The salary of the average FTSE chief executive is the same as that of Britons on minimum wage combined This in a country where workers have suffered the worst squeeze in wages for generations where most Britons languishing in poverty are actually in work where child poverty has increased at its fastest rate for three decades and where one in every people are classed as homeless or in inadequate homes It is not a trend restricted to Britain of course US top bosses earn times the average worker s wage 
JAN6	Our uncivil war over Brexit was fuelled by deceit, not one oddball	Right on cue as the witching hour of Brexit closes in we are offered an opportunity to reflect on the forces that brought us to this state of national disarray and division One of the most eye catching things about James Graham s drama Brexit The Uncivil War screened on Channel tomorrow evening is that David Cameron proved too dull to make the final draft The author of this whole catastrophe the man who in the interests of party management put the referendum commitment into the manifesto and as prime minister made it happen is thus reduced to the status of Gavrilo Princip the assassin who unwittingly triggered the first world war  James Graham s genius is for poking about in the stomach of the beast
JAN6	Will it be a black woman who turfs Trump out of the White House?	Life as Donald Trump has known it for the last two years has just changed forever Quagmired in a government shutdown of his own making Trump s ability to manipulate his world is already severely constrained in this very new year The more he struggles against his new surroundings the more he sinks  Last week the president could only watch his beloved cable news channels as a bystander to the biggest tectonic shifts as the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first candidate to officially emerge to run against him next year And it won t be long before the House launches several investigations into corruption and incompetence while the Mueller investigation continues to tighten several nooses around all things Trumpian 
JAN6	‘Managed no deal’? That’s just more Brexit snake oil	Here we go again As we return haggard and hungover from the Christmas break the Brexit deal is heading back to parliament And presumably the debate will also continue where it left off Prepare for a succession of Brexiteers touting the idea of a managed no deal as an appealing alternative to either the deal on offer or the prospect of a no deal outcome They re wrong  It s worth tracing the logic deployed by proponents of this approach because it has gone through three distinct stages 
JAN6	Our out-of-step press demonises desperate refugees	Where is our humanity More to the point where is the compassion that should inform the editorial agendas of our major news outlets  For the past couple of weeks in a period we like to call the season of goodwill Britain s newspapers and broadcasters have been reporting the arrival of desperate men and women on our shores as if they are criminals unworthy of charity or understanding 
JAN6	I dislike the link to empire, but it felt wrong to turn down an OBE	Very occasionally I wish I was French The fantasy usually materialises just after a holiday when I dream of living by the warmth of the Mediterranean or after a trip to Paris during which I indulge fantasies of being a Left Bank cafe bohemian  Such daydreams evaporate when I remember that my French is sub GCSE standard that as a strict vegetarian I am routinely the target of tutting derision by French waiters and that even the faintest waft of Gauloise smoke leaves me fumbling for my asthma inhaler But at the end of last year I stumbled upon a new reason to indulge this fantasy 
JAN6	To stop Brexit, Labour supporters will have to revolt against their leader	Since nearly all of his career has been spent in rebellion against his own party I guess we should not be too surprised that Jeremy Corbyn seems so determined to defy it over Brexit Labour members hate Brexit and they want it reversed With parliament deadlocked and growing public support for taking the question back to the people a large majority of Labour voters and an even larger majority of Labour members wants the party to throw its weight behind another referendum Compare and contrast with a Labour leader who doesn t hate Brexit doesn t want it to be reversed and will not help facilitate another referendum if he can possibly avoid it  That divide between leader and members has been pretty obvious for a long time to anyone who contemplated Mr Corbyn with clear eyes rather than wearing soft focus lenses The split has become more evident as the Labour frontbench has run through various tactical ruses to try to mask the tension between its members and its leader He is what he is and that is a lifetime opponent of the EU He has not once expressed a flicker of remorse about the result of the referendum and treats the momentum behind a second referendum not as an opportunity to be seized but as a threat to be smothered 
JAN6	Power politics always drives space conquest. China’s coup is no different	Nasa rejected it as too difficult and costly an undertaking Last week China declared mission accomplished after landing a spacecraft Chang e on the far side of the moon  It was a remarkable endeavour As the far side of the moon never faces the Earth mission control cannot communicate directly with the spacecraft but only via an orbiting satellite The terrain is more broken and cratered than the near side so landing a craft is that much more difficult Even Nasa was impressed a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment the administrator tweeted 
JAN6	This is the Nancy Pelosi moment and Donald Trump should be very afraid	The Trump White House has frequently been called chaotic wild undisciplined disorderly But a better word might be unruly because if there s one thing Donald Trump can t abide it s rules Not only has the Trump administration signally failed to follow the rules it s not clear it ever bothered to learn them But as the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives last week that abruptly changed Trump is about to get schooled in the rules of the game  For two years thanks to a Republican Congress that chose not to honor its constitutional duty to maintain oversight of the executive branch the American political drama has centred on special counsel s Robert Mueller s investigation But that focus is about to widen as Nancy Pelosi the once and future Speaker of the House reclaimed the gavel promising to show Americans its power the picture of her smiling as she wielded it went viral for good reason 
JAN6	Brexiters ache to dish out a severe spanking, whether we like it or not	Wide eyed foreigners long ago concluded that masochism was le vice anglais Impressed by the volume of Victorian spanking pornography the Italian critic Mario Praz wrote in the s It seems to be an assured fact that sexual flagellation has been practised in England with greater frequency than elsewhere Or as a successful lawyer once declared on the theme Most people probably think S M spanking bondage whipping role play like doctors and nurses sheikhs and harems guards and prisoners is harmless and private and even funny  The late Christopher Hitchens who claimed with pride that Margaret Thatcher once smote me on the rear with a rolled up parliamentary order paper explained it thus There is almost no English surname however ancient and dignified that cannot be instantly improved by the prefix Spanker 
JAN6	Keeping up with the Kardashians means paying other women to have your babies	Behold the handmaid of the Kardashians Or at least that of Kim the celebrity and Kanye artist and Trump loyalist The couple have just announced the commissioning of their fourth child using the womb of a gestational carrier who will since this is the US be paid for the rental  In details shared after their previous carrier delivered last year Kim Kardashian explained to her millions of fans that she was the first person to have skin on skin contact with her baby and that the experience from carrier vetting to the carrier s organic diet to delivery had gone so brilliantly she would recommend surrogacy to anybody presumably as the purchaser rather than the provider One of the few problems was remembering she was having a baby I m totally gonna forget and then a month before I m gonna be like holy shit we need to get a nursery For the surrogacy industry then this ongoing Kimye promotion may be the most valuable publicity since Elton John and his partner acquired two delightful sons via a similar route far more so in fact since Kardashian though it could be risky for her to give birth again at least had the not entirely tragic alternative to gestational assistance of remaining a mother of two healthy children Conventionally the attribution of desperation to infertile or gay would be parents has been critical in eclipsing the other sorts of desperation that might make impoverished Indian Greek or Ukrainian women consider becoming incubators for rich couples they are unlikely post baby handover to see again 
JAN7	Ten years after the first war on Gaza, Israel still plans endless brute force	This month marks the th anniversary of the first major military assault on the million Palestinians of the Gaza Strip After its unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in Israel turned the area into the biggest open door prison on Earth The two hallmarks of Israel s treatment of Gaza since then have been mendacity and the utmost brutality towards civilians  On December Israel launched Operation Cast Lead pounding the densely populated strip from the air sea and land for days It was not a war or even asymmetric warfare but a one sided massacre Israel had dead the Gazans had dead including children and more than wounded According to one estimate of the casualties were civilians Israel claimed to be acting in self defence protecting its civilians against Hamas rocket attacks The evidence however points to a deliberate and punitive war of aggression Israel had a diplomatic alternative but it chose to ignore it and to resort to brute military force 
JAN7	At the heart of this NHS cash boost lies a dishonesty: tax	Something about a big government launch in January invites suspicion It feels like one of those doomed new year resolutions that is all optimistic intent and no staying power It smacks of a prime minister desperate to turn over a new leaf yet fated to relapse into bad old habits  Theresa May wants the new political season to kick off with a conversation about the NHS She visited a children s hospital in Liverpool bearing a long term plan and a suitcase full of Treasury cash 
JAN7	A no-deal Brexit would be disastrous. My amendment will help prevent it	Just because most people don t want something to happen doesn t mean it won t So it is with a no deal Brexit I believe the majority of MPs ministers and most people across the UK are opposed to the self inflicted damage to our economy and security that would result from crashing out of the EU But there are just days left and there is a growing danger that a combination of brinkmanship political paralysis siren voices and drift will push us over the cliff edge  This is too serious for parliament to stand by That is why I have tabled an amendment to the finance bill with a group of other cross party committee chairs to put safeguards in place against no deal 
JAN7	Britain is crippled by record personal debt while the Tories boast of a boom	With a government torn apart by Brexit and a country falling to pieces because of that government Conservative MPs have a fallback they sometimes like to use as proof of their success the UK has record employment levels It s a proud badge of honour they wear fetishising work it doesn t matter what that work looks like or how much it pays because it s supposedly a sign that the economy is doing well The thing is people might be in work but they re also in debt  Britain s household debt has reached a new high According to the TUC UK households now owe an average of to credit card firms banks and other lenders There might be some quibbling over what s included in these figures Unlike the Bank of England in its calculations the TUC includes increasingly exorbitant student loans which have eye wateringly high interest rates But even if we were to take those out of the equation leaving debt at half that estimated by the TUC the level of debt the nature of that borrowing and why it s being accrued spells trouble In academic Johnna Montgomerie called it one of the biggest problems facing the United Kingdom s economy and society 
JAN7	No more tribal politics: MPs must be allowed a free vote on Brexit	Has anything changed over the holiday Yes March is two weeks nearer Like the imminence of death it concentrates the mind  Parliament now moves into that darkly hallowed chamber known as the short term its walls moving ever inwards A few things are clearer One is that Theresa May has the best deal on offer Another is that only a sizeable handful of Tory last ditchers and industrial anarchists believes a no deal Brexit is in the nation s interest Yes it may have been overlaid with hysteria understandably in the case of farmers But it does not add up 
JAN7	Caroline Lucas is wrong – a meat tax would only hurt the poor	Caroline Lucas called for a meat tax last week something the environment secretary Michael Gove has suggested is the worst example of a nanny state He is wrong The idea isn t authoritarian it s regressive Like other proposals to impose taxes on dangerous products to save people from themselves it is well intentioned But the inevitable consequence is that poor people will suffer  This is by no means an argument that meat is good for people or even necessarily cheaper Red meat is associated with a host of health issues such as heart disease cancer and diabetes and chefs such as Jack Monroe have shown how people can eat healthy vegan meals on a tight budget But to incentivise behaviour by making things more expensive is to say that the rich can do whatever they please while the poor should go without The weight of environmentally conscious decisions falls on those who can t afford to pay rather than on society as a whole It s reverting to th century rules the poor can eat beans while the rich eat meat Choice becomes something only the rich deserve 
JAN7	There is no leftwing justification for Brexit. We must fight it to the last	Perhaps the only success of David Cameron s reckless EU referendum gamble was that it took the Tories toxic split on Europe and shared it with the rest of the country At least they are no longer the laughing stock now we all are  Yet among the cluster of possible solutions around Norway this or Canada that or a customs union of sorts the danger remains that the bigger picture is being missed the political effect of Brexit on the UK and our foreign relations Brexit is one part of a project to reshape the politics of the west and set it in concrete And too many on the left are happy to sleepwalk into that oblivion 
JAN7	A message to the mob: behave on social media as you would in real life	I love social media I really do I relish any opportunity to interact with people I may never meet in person strangers with similar interests Sadly I am usually boring sharing articles posting about social issues art occasionally music and increasingly ornithology I have relatively few followers and do not actively seek more by being self consciously witty I follow only those I know or find interesting If I consider someone to be a septic pustule Donald Trump for example why would I follow them when I would walk away if they joined my mates in a pub I ve made friends have even met some in person social media has provided an overwhelmingly positive experience  Recently however that changed An article I had written went live at pm By pm I realised a storm was brewing Notified by Twitter which mercifully and to my surprise did a great job I applied all suggested filters locking my account just in time to shield myself from the worst of the personal and spiteful abuse Even so still I felt isolated as if I was buried beneath a pile of manure It was intimidating when men yes it was mostly men with few friends but a keen interest in wrestling requested to follow me 
JAN7	Together we can thwart the big-tech data grab. Here’s how	Our family got a Google Home Hub for Christmas As comparative lifestyle Neanderthals we have so far only used it as a glorified digital picture frame and music player though this is clearly not what it was built for Say Hey Google tell it what you want and a whole universe of entertainment advice and help can be supplied up to and including instant control of internet connected doorbells thermostats and more  Contrary to their branding as assistants the primary purpose of these devices is not to devotedly help the people who use them At the risk of stating the blindingly obvious once we have paid for the hardware we get the services they can deliver largely for free in return for limitless access to the small details of our lives Big tech is therefore able to carry on making advertising more and more precisely targeted and vastly increase the mountains of data that power its development of artificial intelligence Smartphones tablets and computers have been helpful but evidently not helpful enough Build data gathering machines into the domestic sphere and you break open whole streams of personal information 
JAN7	Detained at US immigration, I felt frightened. And very lucky	I flew back to the US from London last week and after waiting for two hours at immigration I stood by as the officer frowned at my documents My children s US passports had been scanned without a problem But looking at my green card the officer asked Was this lost or stolen in the last year As it happens it was Then I m sorry he said glancing down at my three year olds After a seven hour flight and all that waiting in line they were doing breaststroke across the JFK floor You ll have to step this way  I have heard about the Congratulations You Have Problems With Your Paperwork room at JFK but until that moment had never actually seen it It is a small windowless room dominated by a raised bank of desks behind which six or so officers sit with several more patrolling the room No cellphones snapped a woman as I knelt on the floor restraining a child with one hand while trying to text the cab driver waiting for us outside with the other 
JAN8	The Guardian view on Brexit: the government has failed – it’s time to go back to the people	Next week the House of Commons will take what is probably the most consequential vote of our era Unless the government again gets cold feet key aspects of this country s economic model social cohesion and international future will be shaped in the so called meaningful vote over Theresa May s Brexit deal It will define what Britain is more than any other political event in modern times It poses questions and choices that cannot be shirked  This newspaper supported Britain s entry into the European Community in the s We opposed Britain s departure from the European Union in We took these positions on the basis of the same long term principles Britain is a European nation by virtue of its geography and history It shares enduring economic and cultural ties and values with the rest of Europe Above all Britain has a direct interest born from the suffering of our peoples in decades of war in the peace and harmony of Europe from which all can prosper In the era of Donald Trump and Xi Jinping Britain s engagement in Europe is freshly urgent 
JAN8	The murder of my wife, Jo Cox, is being used to cow MPs. That’s not her legacy	I ve spent the past few weeks desperately sorting hundreds of pictures of Jo to archive print off and put in albums My objective was to have finished the project by the new year so that the kids have access to as many pictures of their mum as they want playing with them dashing around on the campaign trail on holiday together  Having spent way too long looking at pictures of her in the past few weeks the thing that comes out in almost every photo is her spirit of generosity and kindness Her smile is unmissable and unforgettable even in the face of awful weather precipitous rock climbs or on tough days We miss her energy and positivity in our lives as much as anything 
JAN8	To accept an OBE is to condone the brutality of empire	Acentury ago the eminent Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore returned his knighthood to the viceroy of India The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in their incongruous context of humiliation Tagore wrote in outrage as scores of peaceful protesters were massacred in Jallianwala Bagh He would now stand shorn of all special distinctions by the side of my countrymen  In accepting the knighthood Tagore had been unfairly accused of being a colonial flunkey partly because he had expressed justifiable reservations about aspects of Indian nationalism The atrocities in Amritsar jolted the Nobel laureate into accepting that that his Knight Commander of the British Empire the KBE still in use today could not be treated as unconnected to the bloodied realities of that empire s operations 
JAN8	Vote Leave relied on racism. Brexit: The Uncivil War disguised that ugly truth	At the beginning of Channel s drama Brexit The Uncivil War the ex Tory Ukip MP Douglas Carswell tells Matthew Elliott and Dominic Cummings newly appointed to run Vote Leave that they will offer a respectable alternative to the rightwing thugs Nigel Farage and Arron Banks Cummings the strategist and anti hero of this semi biopic soon returns to the theme the Conservative led and soon to be officially recognised campaign needs to be respectable appealing beyond Ukip s base if it is to win plus one and the referendum Elliott drums the point home We need to get them Farage and Banks Leave EU to do the heavy lifting on the migration stuff then we keep our hands clean  However Cummings has a problem The EU s supranational institutions demonised by Brexiters are too complicated too remote to be the focus of the campaign It needs a simple message repeated over and over and over if it is to appeal to the three million extra voters that the other side have no idea exist who Cummings new friend Zack Massingham of the shadowy AggregateIQ promises can tip Vote Leave over the line 
JAN8	Are the men in the news adults – or attention-seeking five-year-olds?	This could just be me showing my age but watching the news at the moment is like tuning in to a particularly fraught episode of The Secret Life of Year Olds One little boy is feeling ignored by a girl he likes so he s pulling her hair and telling her that he wouldn t be her friend anyway because he s found out that she s going to be six in a minute Another can t get the attention of the teacher by being a good boy so instead he is loudly spitting out his dinner under his desk One of the older boys has noticed that the younger kids get more attention so he s regressing to baby talk and throwing all the toys out of a pram Meanwhile over by the Wendy house a group of bullies is chasing after a little bossy girl and shouting in her ear that she is a big bum face Oh for sensible Dr Laverne Antrobus to appear in a secret viewing room and explain that this is a crucial but brief period of radical attention seeking and it will all be OK again once the children have had a good night s sleep and a cuddle  In the grownup world however attention seeking behaviour is increasingly hard to ignore This week a year old French author hardly anybody had heard of decided to rattle a few cages by announcing that he just can t fancy a woman his own age French feminists threw up their hands in horror one of them publishing a photo of a year old derriere on Instagram which only seemed likely to reward his silliness Fortunately the British media and anyone who has ever using a dating website in the st century just rolled their eyes and turned to the next story elderly bear shits in woods see photos pages 
JAN8	This radical plan could be the way to get social housing back on track	Home should be a sanctuary Warm and safe it is a place where a door can be firmly closed on the trials threats and stresses of the outside world A place you can rest and enjoy your leisure time  For as long as there have been people they have needed homes In Abraham Maslow s hierarchy of needs warmth and rest sit alongside food and water at the base of the pyramid In his theory only when those basic needs are met can we concern ourselves with higher goals 
JAN8	It’s time for May to pull the emergency brake and extend article 50	In a jam like this when parliamentary discipline has broken down No has two last ditch tactics up its sleeve The first is to try to pull off the psychological trick of persuading MPs that the mood is changing and that they had better fall in line before they miss the bus The second is to blackmail them by painting a picture of how awful the alternative to the prime minister s deal is underlining that the responsibility for the ensuing chaos will lie with MPs who vote against her  Unfortunately for Theresa May neither of these ruses is likely to work this time No has been briefing since before Christmas that it is making progress with the European Union on the backstop and will soon be able to unveil changes that will make the plan acceptable to the rebels Downing St also says it is in talks with the Democratic Unionist party and if the DUP changes position on her deal so will most pro Brexit Tory rebels This is either whistling in the wind or more likely deliberately misleading 
JAN8	The sexism in surgery is shocking – from 'banter' to discrimination	In of people applying to medicine and dentistry courses were women However according to the Royal College of Surgeons of England only about of consultant surgeons in were women Why A small survey in the BMJ medical journal points to the level of discrimination As a general surgical trainee I have been shocked by the experiences reported by some female colleagues The discrepancy in the number of women applying to medicine and those going on to become consultant surgeons can partly be explained by the higher dropout rate Could inherent gender discrimination within surgery itself play a part in that  Female colleagues with children have struggled to be accepted and are seen as less than full time surgeons despite working similar hours in hospital to those surgeons with part time hospital and research commitments A female surgeon returning from maternity leave didn t dare tell colleagues that she had a month old baby at home fearing that she would be viewed as lacking commitment to speciality Female surgeons are continually asked about their family plans I was even asked at an international conference if colorectal surgery would be the correct career path if I plan to have children These aren t challenges that are unique to surgery or to women with more men taking longer paternity leave yet the stigma seems more entrenched in surgery than other specialities 
JAN8	Theresa May is taking us to the no-deal cliff but won’t march us over	They re back but nothing has changed so happy Groundhog Day Ahead lies more perpetual Brexit hell so get used to it Don t imagine the next fortnight of high parliamentary drama will lead to an ending where we can all return to politics as usual This won t end with the January vote on the prime minister s deal nor with reprised attempts to revive it soon after It won t end by the supposed January deadline either nor will it all be over on March exit day Barring extraordinary and dangerous shocks yes dreadful things are possible Brexitry will go on and on for the foreseeable future Awful prospect Yes but all alternatives are frighteningly worse than extending the process as we back off the precipice  For now this push me pull you directionless government is leading us to the very edge They want us to take a good look at the no deal Tarpeian rock below which we will be dashed to pieces by the likes of Boris Johnson who on Monday ditched his old Canada deal to back a naked no deal as soon as he saw the Tory membership swing that way 
JAN8	Carcinogens in your cosmetics? Welcome to Brexit Britain	How would you feel about putting a lovely dollop of formaldehyde on your nails No Well perhaps I could interest you in a sprinkling of asbestos for your skin Hmm tricky customer eh OK surely you couldn t object to some coal tar on your eyelids to really make them pop Oh come on who wouldn t risk a little light cancer for a really banging shade of eyeshadow You wouldn t Too bad In our brave new Brexit world where EU legislation is no longer in force and we are forced to accept trade deals on Trump s terms expect all these known carcinogens and more to be appearing on a beauty shelf near you  Since UK consumers have been protected by the EU s precautionary principle Essentially the EU doesn t think that chemicals that have been linked to cancer and birth defects belong in cosmetics and so they are banned from use in consumer products And who could argue with that 
JAN9	This was the great political power struggle of our times – and ministers lost	John Bercow can sometimes seem to be auditioning to play Shakespeare s Malvolio The House of Commons Speaker has at times a comic degree of self esteem that is the equal of the arrogant steward in Twelfth Night Like Malvolio Bercow can also drive colleagues to distraction as he did today Today though Bercow took a brave stand to empower Britain s parliament against Britain s government on Brexit And that qualifies him to be considered the most radical holder of his office in generations Like Malvolio a version of greatness has been thrust upon him  The vast majority of people are understandably not well versed in Commons procedure So it may seem strange to claim that a decision to allow an amendment to be moved on a Commons timetable motion and with no debate is in any way immense Nevertheless Bercow s decision to allow the all party effort led by the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve to tie the government s hands it must come back with a plan B within three days if the Brexit deal is defeated next week deserves such accolades 
JAN9	Trump’s border wall address was so lame, was it in fact a distraction?	Donald Trump is a master at manufacturing faux crises He is not a master at faking humanitarian concern  He thought that speaking from the Oval Office and sitting behind the Resolute desk would help him invoke a grave national crisis It s the setting that JFK used to tell the country about life threatening Cuban missiles It s where George W Bush tried to calm the country after 
JAN9	Never mind her politics, Kate Bush’s music speaks for itself	What does a Tory look like Do they automatically come attired in Charles Tyrwhitt shirts and Barbour jackets and have naturally booming voices Does membership of the Conservative party automatically make you a subscriber to Horse Hound magazine Clearly such assumptions are ludicrous but there is a sense among some music fans that Tory loving pop stars should identify themselves a badge perhaps or a special hat in order that we may judge their acceptability  This certainly would have prevented a world of grief for Kate Bush who has just ended two years on the naughty step when she released a statement clarifying her political views In an interview with the Canadian magazine Maclean s in Bush was reported as having expressed support for the new British prime minister Theresa May prompting a fit of the vapours among her admirers Taken in context the meaning of Bush s quotes was obvious During a discussion about Hillary Clinton and the fear of women s power she voiced enthusiasm for having a woman in charge But nuance rarely being a characteristic of st century discourse this was lost in translation and our Kate was branded a Tory More heartache ensued in the flurry of press around the release of her remastered back catalogue and a book of lyrics late in prompting finally clarification on her website 
JAN9	When free societies copy Russian media tactics, there’s only one winner	How do you respond when a principle that forms part of the bedrock of your society is used to undermine it  This is the question facing liberal democracies across the world as Russia and others exploit free speech and its institutions especially traditional and social media through misinformation and electoral interference 
JAN9	Want to stop prisoners reoffending? Start by allowing phones and photos	These are dark days in a country torn by Brexit and years of austerity which have widened the gap between rich and poor  And few places are as gloomy as the prison system where shocking levels of violence and drug abuse mean there is little in the way of positivity for those tasked with inspecting the penal estate 
JAN9	Surviving R Kelly is a watershed moment for women of colour	It s been several days since the Surviving R Kelly docuseries began on January reaching a channel record of million viewers and the hashtag is still trending Conversations and debates about Lifetime s intense six part series are still evolving as people digest the stories shared by Kelly s survivors And on Tuesday news broke that investigators are looking into allegations in both Chicago and Atlanta as a result of the series  One could assume that the reason for the series success is a combination of good promotion curiosity outrage and excitement But for many women particularly black and brown women who have experienced sexual violence I believe the premiere was both a long awaited public moment of vindication for those Kelly has allegedly hurt and for those fighting to hold him accountable and a sign of the ever growing resistance against him and others who inflict this kind of harm of women and girls in our communities 
JAN9	The botched Alex Salmond harassment inquiry could stop women speaking out	You would assume that civil servants faced with allegations of sexual assault by a former first minister of Scotland would proceed with the utmost caution that they would fireproof themselves against a future appeal by making sure the procedure used to investigate those allegations was robust and that it was followed to the letter With the MeToo campaign in the headlines and a report suggesting that despite its conceit of itself as family friendly Holyrood has the same level of sexual harassment as Westminster the stakes surrounding the inquiry into Alex Salmond s alleged behaviour towards two female members of staff in could scarcely have been higher  Knowing the former SNP leader would pore over every detail as he had every right to do they owed it to the women involved to ensure their handling of the complaints was beyond reproach Instead it emerged at Salmond s judicial review one aspect of the process was so flawed as to invalidate the entire investigation 
JAN9	Brexit proved our economy is broken, but our leaders still have no clue how to fix it	Just after midnight on May a senior staffer in the remain campaign sent colleagues an urgent message Voters are very sceptical about our warnings on the economy began his email They don t trust the numbers They don t trust the Treasury As head of strategy for Britain Stronger in Europe Ryan Coetzee had bombarded Britons with evidence of the economic damage they would do to themselves if they didn t stay in the EU He and his team enlisted the Bank of England the IMF the OECD and pretty much every acronym that mattered They d wagged fingers flung numbers around and pointed out the danger signs  From David Cameron down leading remainers considered the economy their trump card In the biggest single choice Britain had had to make for four decades they were sure economics would be the deciding factor But with less than a month to go before the vote seasoned operative Coetzee could see the strategy was failing Why just a few days earlier George Osborne had produced Treasury analysis that Brexit would send house prices plunging by as much as and BBC journalists reported being deluged with calls from would be buyers asking where they could sign up 
JAN9	I was harassed outside parliament. These thugs must not stifle Brexit debate	The Brexit result split those who support it The darker politics that was mixed in with the mainstream leave vote no longer feels the need to hide On Monday Anna Soubry Owen Jones and I were confronted by it But those who verbally attacked and physically harassed us do not speak for ordinary leave voters or the disadvantaged They have nothing to do with the pro Brexit protesters with whom I respectfully disagree  I ve encountered them before talking to people around the country is what I do I ve engaged with them at People s Vote marches in Sunderland and outside parliament I even attended a rally led by the English Defence League s so called Tommy Robinson A figure close to Robinson admitted to me believing I was pro Brexit that they knew Brexit would make the country poorer Knowingly going ahead with a policy that leaves desperately squeezed people even worse off is a betrayal of those they claim to represent 
JAN9	Britain must rid itself of the delusion that it is big, bold and in charge	 Being powerful Margaret Thatcher once said is like being a lady If you have to tell people you are you aren t It s a lesson that could usefully be learned by Gavin Williamson the elfin defence secretary who longs to inherit her job  Like a one man military band Williamson spent the Christmas period blowing the trumpet twirling the baton and banging the drum for Brexit Britain Leaving the EU he told the Daily Telegraph would restore Britain as a truly global player determined once again to play the role on the world stage that the world expects us to play Post Brexit Australia Canada New Zealand Caribbean countries and nations right across Africa would look to us to provide the moral leadership the military leadership and the global leadership of which they had been too long deprived 
JAN10	Trump and the Brexiters must own the mess they lied us into	Three years ago shortly after I arrived back in Britain after years in the US my gas meter was stolen When the new one arrived it bore a note insisting that it should not be stolen It reminded me of the poster in the window of the Boys and Girls club at the top of my street in Chicago that read Stop killing people Some things should not need to be said  So it was on Wednesday as MPs passed an amendment demanding the government come back with a plan B within three days if the Brexit deal is defeated next Tuesday The real scandal was not that the Speaker John Bercow had to creatively interpret parliamentary rules so that the vote could take place but that the vote was necessary at all Plan A isn t up to much It was withdrawn last month at the th hour because it was clearly going to be voted down Nothing has changed It will almost certainly be rejected next week Time is running out We have no hat and the EU wouldn t lend us a rabbit to pull out of it even if we did Under these circumstances the government shouldn t be forced to come back with a plan B in a timely fashion When it comes to backups they should be well down the alphabet by now 
JAN10	Cutting tuition fees will turn universities into vassals of the state	Meanwhile back at the ranch or in this case the campus the mice are running riot Ignored by Brexit Britain s universities are facing financial meltdown I predict that within a decade they will become institutions wholly owned by the state their academic autonomy unrecognisable  A few weeks ago three universities were reported to be on the brink of bankruptcy University debt has soared by bn in the past decade Cardiff has borrowed m over years with experts suggesting it would take years to repay if its current surplus does not improve The backing for these loans is supposedly the ballooning scale of student fees which David Cameron almost tripled to in in England and the removal of the cap on student numbers Fees rather than grants now comprise the vast bulk of all university income for teaching undergraduates 
JAN10	London’s gangs have changed, and it’s driving a surge in pitiless violence	The murder of year old Jayden Moodie on Tuesday night highlights how youth violence continues to devastate the lives of young people families and communities in London Jayden s death marks a new low point as he is the youngest victim to die on London s streets so far this year  We don t know whether Jayden was himself involved in gangs or if his death was gang related All we know is that he was struck by a vehicle while riding a moped then chased by a group of three men and stabbed to death in what police believe was a targeted attack However Jayden was killed in Leyton part of the east London borough of Waltham Forest where the threat of gangs and gang violence looms large 
JAN10	‘Do I look pretty?’ is my daughters’ favourite question and it’s worrying me	As I do most years I watched the Golden Globes red carpet show last week I like red carpet shows Among other things I like the parade of pretty frocks and the awkwardness of one group of adults milling around shouting the names of another group of adults nearby This year however the entertainment was impaired by the sense that as the parenting manuals like to say I was showcasing bad behaviour for my daughters Along with can I have a treat and when is it going to be my birthday the question do I look pretty now comes up regularly in my house and the attraction of the rote answer yes has started to pall  I can t put all the blame on the Disney princesses although God knows they don t help The present generation of animated heroines have been given feisty attitudes and desires beyond marriage but with the exception of Moana they still have tiny waists tinier noses and in the case of Elsa from Frozen an amazing Dolly Parton chest that busts out at the climax of Let It Go to the ongoing amazement of her four year old fans 
JAN10	An election would be a headache for Labour – and all-out war for the Tories	Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election in a speech in Wakefield on Thursday morning That s what oppositions do so what s new The government s essential all consuming defining policy of our era is about to be voted down in parliament The shadow of the loss of Jaguar Land Rover jobs sharpens the immediacy of the nightmare with Brexit said to be partly to blame As Corbyn declared A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all  That used to mean a government fell and a prime minister resigned with an election inevitable No longer Instead here is a government with no majority surviving only on bungs to a handful of unionist extremists who don t represent remain voting Northern Ireland Even then it still loses vote after humiliating vote with no intention of resigning in the honourable old fashioned way If John Bercow this morning called speaker of the devil by the Sun is stretching the rules he is only responding to this extraordinary constitutional crisis The spirit of his role is to stand up for parliament as this majority less government makes serial attempts to deny MPs any say 
JAN10	Ocasio-Cortez has shown ‘shameless’ women are a powerful force	Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has feet And she washes sometimes In order to do this she takes off her clothes the brazen hussy I presume this to be the case although the picture of feet in the bath that the Daily Caller published seems to have been falsely ascribed to her Experts have been brought in to analyse the length of the toes in the image because this is clearly the biggest issue in America right now  This quite insane attempt to shame her is so bizarre after the video of her dancing on a rooftop at college backfired and she responded by dancing into her congressional office She is more popular than ever She excites the left because of her youth her passion and her politics She excites the right because she has a body and God knows she may even enjoy that fact This must be highlighted as sinful over and over again 
JAN10	By mollycoddling our children, we're fuelling mental illness in teenagers	We talk incessantly about how to make children more resilient but whatever we re doing it s not working Rates of anxiety disorders and depression are rising rapidly among teenagers and in the US universities can t hire therapists fast enough to keep up with the demand What are we doing wrong  Nassim Taleb invented the word antifragile and used it in his book by the same name to describe a small but very important class of systems that gain from shocks challenges and disorder Bones and the banking system are two examples both get weaker and more prone to catastrophic failure if they go for a long time without any stressors and then face a major challenge The immune system is an even better example it requires exposure to certain kinds of germs and potential allergens in childhood in order to develop to its full capacity Parents who treat their children as if they are fragile for example by keeping them away from dirt and potential allergens such as peanuts are depriving their children s immature immune systems of the learning experiences those systems need to develop their maximum protective capacity 
JAN10	Why your chicken wings mean we’ve entered a new epoch	Have you ever thought much about the bones that remain littered in front of you after finishing a plate of chicken wings New research suggests that Gallus gallus domesticus the modern factory farmed chicken might not be just a Sunday lunch staple but instead a marker of a new age in Earth s history  The or so years following the last major ice age are collectively called the Holocene a geological chapter in earth s biography that includes the development of all human civilization Some experts argue that humans have fundamentally altered the earth s biosphere to the point where we now live in a new age called the Anthropocene an amalgamation of the Greek words for new and human Copernicus was wrong the earth doesn t revolve around the sun anymore It revolves around us 
JAN10	Social care is ageist – and the new NHS plan doesn’t even try to fix it	 We are taking a big step to secure the future of the NHS for our children and their children Theresa May told an audience in Liverpool on Monday as she launched the NHS year plan May s emphasis on generations of NHS users may be cliched political rhetoric the children as they say are our future but by pitching public services as a deal between the generations she quite unintentionally landed on something important  This country s health and care system is currently riddled with a damaging generational divide one that manifests itself in anything from a deficit in joined up services to outright bad feeling 
JAN10	It’s not perfect, but Norway plus may be Labour’s least worst option	There are no good options for Labour on Brexit Accepting this fact is both depressing and liberating Being on the left is supposed to be about unbounded optimism a belief that what is deemed politically impossible by the sensible grownups of politics can be realised with sufficient imagination and determination But recognising that there is no magic button that will end the Brexit debate is to be freed of the stress of searching for the impossible  Supporters of every position on Brexit should be honest about the downsides of their chosen strategies Labour s priority is rightly a general election When Theresa May declared from a Downing Street podium that she was seeking to dissolve parliament in April she wanted to make the election entirely about Brexit Labour did not allow her to do so shifting the conversation on to domestic issues where it was strong from hiking taxes on the rich to investing in public services to public ownership issues that unite remainers and leavers Even though voters have priorities other than Brexit such as stagnating wages housing and the NHS repeating the strategy this time would be far more challenging to put it mildly Labour s electoral coalition which encompasses both pro remain Kensington and pro leave Ashfield will be placed under severe strain The fact that Brexit dominates political debate is bad for Labour because it suppresses its anti establishment politics its leading figures are left looking like triangulating politicians the same as the all the rest 
JAN11	Brexit disaster looms. Can MPs unite quickly enough to save us?	The iceberg is approaching and now the scramble for the lifeboats begins The iceberg in question is the catastrophe of a no deal crashout from the European Union its contours and texture becoming ever sharper as March gets closer For now most MPs are vehement in their insistence that they dislike the iceberg very much and that they are passionately opposed to sailing right into it But the law is clear Britain leaves the EU on that date unless another law is passed to change course In other words standing on the deck shouting at the berg will not help MPs have to agree a plan to get out of the way and they have to do it very soon  Here s how fast things are moving On Tuesday night Theresa May will watch as her deal sinks in the Commons It might not take the battering predicted by BBC News which projects a defeat by more than votes Indeed it might end up being much narrower That s thanks to an amendment tabled by Labour s Hilary Benn which will give MPs the chance simultaneously to reject both May s deal and a no deal Jacob Rees Mogg s crowd won t want to do that they think a collision with the iceberg will be bracing shake things up a bit so May might suffer a milder humiliation than was otherwise looming 
JAN11	Even Mordor was less toxic than Brexit Britain, this nation beyond parody	Well there you are then Another epic political week has passed in off brand Westeros a septic isle from which there is no real escape only a bloodstained booth where Chris Grayling is offering to sell you a ferry ticket  Every few days I change my mind about what I d pop in the time capsule to explain to future generations just how inspirational this era was This week though the choice could only be Wednesday s parliamentary exchange between House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and Tory MP Adam Holloway which I have lightly edited for space reasons 
JAN11	Theresa May is about to find out that Brexit is bigger than her	Whatever else happens with Brexit no one in British politics will ever again underestimate the power of a timetable The pressure of the article clock ticking down forced Theresa May into the compromises that make her deal unpalatable to MPs She has tried to pass the pain on to MPs hoping that the grim consequences of missing the deadline would force them to settle for her plan Earlier this week in an act of parliamentary jujitsu the former attorney general Dominic Grieve turned the timetable weapon back on May securing an amendment that sets a limit of three days for the prime minister to say what comes next if her deal collapses  Running down the clock should eliminate options and force decisions So far that hasn t worked Instead the same volume of Brexit bluster has been compressed into an ever tighter space which in accordance with the laws of political thermodynamics raises the temperature and increases the danger of something blowing up 
JAN11	Andy Murray taught us Scots to dream big and show emotion	Small wet overweight countries should not and usually do not produce tennis superstars And although it was a time his many followers in Scotland and beyond had been expecting for a while the pain and frustration etched on Andy Murray s face as he announced his retirement from tennis at a tearful press conference in Australia still came as a shock The fairytale Federer style comeback we all wished for was not to be  The visceral authenticity of the emotion made it difficult to watch But it said everything you need to know about Murray still utterly committed to the game he loves struggling to free himself from the only life he has ever known even though it is now causing him excruciating pain 
JAN11	We don’t think John Finnis should teach at Oxford University. Here’s why	This week along with other students we started a petition to stop Professor John Finnis teaching at Oxford University As anticipated the petition has been criticised on the grounds that its proposals would undermine academic and though Finnis himself says his views are strictly philosophical religious freedom We were called snowflake students who were simply incapable of arguing against opposing views We believe these criticisms miss the point  Here are some of the reasons for the petition in a paper Finnis sets out that the judgment that homosexual conduct is evil can be defended He draws an analogy between the copulation of humans with animals and homosexuality In a article he laments restrictions on the discussion of the reversibility of sexual orientation or the relation if any between sexual orientation and child abuse 
JAN11	Don’t be fooled by Amber Rudd’s phoney attempt at compassion	Imagine launching a leadership bid by promising not to rob quite as many children as you were originally planning to do The work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd is far from alone in circling the carcass of Theresa May s premiership although quite how a remainer is to triumph in a vote of the Ukip ised Tory grassroots is difficult to answer and her speech today appropriately in a jobcentre certainly represents positioning  As well as suggesting the benefits freeze may possibly end next year her heavily trailed announcement is that the retrospective implementation of the two child limit on universal credit won t happen The newly born third child of a supermarket worker nurse or admin assistant from the just about managing families May claimed to champion will still have their support taken away 
JAN11	Labour must back a people’s vote before the clock runs out	Over the next few weeks Britain faces a stark binary choice It is not the blackmail choice that Theresa May misleadingly poses my deal or no deal Nor is it the choice Jeremy Corbyn still implausibly claims her bad Brexit or his much better Brexit The real choice we must make before B day currently March is this blindfold Brexit or democratic timeout  As parliament takes back control we urgently need the Labour front bench to join MPs from all parties in getting us to the timeout By timeout I mean a period of democratic deliberation leading up to a second referendum in which we decide on the basis of everything we now know how we should address the real problems that contributed to the vote for Brexit in what kind of country we really want to be and whether we can do that better outside or inside the EU For this our EU partners will extend article and give us the necessary time 
JAN11	The aliens are coming. And they’ve caught us with our pants down	Earlier this week astronomers announced that they had observed repeated bursts of radio waves coming from deep space with some experts suggesting this could be evidence of alien life Is this it Could extraterrestrials finally be trying to contact us I hope not  Let me provide an analogy and I think you ll see what I mean 
JAN11	Tech firms have a duty to face down antisemitism	Beyond a quick read of a Wikipedia page what can the internet really tell us about antisemitism in the United Kingdom The answer is a great deal It has been shown that people are remarkably honest when they search for information online Their Google searches and queries reveal interests prejudices and hatreds that they might otherwise keep hidden from friends family members neighbours surveys and even themselves These searches have been shown to share their health secrets sexual preferences and hostility towards other groups  As part of my work with the Antisemitism Policy Trust and the Community Security Trust I put this to the test to see what Google searches made by people in the UK could tell us about attitudes towards Jewish people Unsurprisingly perhaps we found that every year people in the UK express antisemitic thoughts through their internet searches 
JAN12	Don’t give in to the age of fatalism. Fight back and secure your future	Anyone reading the outpouring of writing the global crisis has provoked must be prepared for anticlimax There are hundreds of denunciations of Trump s America Brexit Britain and the Putinesque dictatorial democracies appearing everywhere from Hungary to Venezuela Turkey to the Philippines  You turn to the final chapter expecting to hear how to fight back and answer comes there none The endnotes flash by the index rolls and that s that You should not be surprised The global order that developed in the s has failed and to date the only replacement on offer has been authoritarian nationalism that will impoverish and diminish its supporters as much as its opponents 
JAN12	Marie Kondo calls it clutter; to me they are mementoes	I wouldn t say that I m a hoarder exactly but I will admit that there is no shelf in my flat left unadorned with photographs or trinkets or slightly pathetic miniature plants that could do with a good drink  As someone who moves house more often than I buy a new winter coat this is not a practical trait but still I can find ledges where you would not believe That flat part on top of the mirror Perfect for postcards Weird bit along the stairs that doesn t seem to have any structural purpose Exactly the right place for an exhibition of the exhibitions I ve seen over the last couple of years perked up with some holiday snaps and another plant While it s not quite at Channel documentary intervention levels yet I unashamedly love stuff

JAN12	I’m a remainer. So why do I feel more and more sympathy for leave voters?	The outcome of the referendum horrified me Despite my doubts about the European Union as an institution its remoteness lack of democracy and inflexibility in dealing with crises such as the eurozone debt I was and remain convinced that it s better for nations to work together to deal with problems than apart  Since then the chaotic fallout of the vote has made Brexit seem even more scary we have witnessed an unstable government inept negotiations early signs of the economic damage to come and a looming no deal outcome 
JAN12	Theresa May is about to find out that Brexit is bigger than her	Whatever else happens with Brexit no one in British politics will ever again underestimate the power of a timetable The pressure of the article clock ticking down forced Theresa May into the compromises that make her deal unpalatable to MPs She has tried to pass the pain on to MPs hoping that the grim consequences of missing the deadline would force them to settle for her plan Earlier this week in an act of parliamentary jujitsu the former attorney general Dominic Grieve turned the timetable weapon back on May securing an amendment that sets a limit of three days for the prime minister to say what comes next if her deal collapses  Running down the clock should eliminate options and force decisions So far that hasn t worked Instead the same volume of Brexit bluster has been compressed into an ever tighter space which in accordance with the laws of political thermodynamics raises the temperature and increases the danger of something blowing up 
JAN12	The Met’s Gangs Matrix is racist policing in its purest form	In a review into the Metropolitan police service s secretive Gangs Matrix the London mayor s office has been forced to publicly acknowledge that the database disproportionately targets black males The representation of young black males on the matrix is disproportionate to their likelihood of criminality and victimisation the report sneaked out just before Christmas admitted  Of the almost names on the matrix at any given time are black and are other ethnic minorities Yet the review made no attempts to explain why this shocking disproportionality exists nor did it seek to understand or explain the impact of this racist policing process on the individuals targeted their families or the communities that they come from 
JAN12	Bread is on the rise again – but it’s time we Brits demanded a better loaf	Bread is back In a major review hailed by critics of the low carb trend the World Health Organization has decreed that wholegrain breads can help combat a range of diseases such as diabetes cardiovascular problems and cancer  But did bread ever really go away The headline news has looked dire in the last few years white sliced sales down in the five years to according to retail analysts Mintel M S launching those weird high protein sandwiches half the bread but all the filling storied baking powerhouse Warburtons launching gluten free wraps But this low carb trend always felt like a fad awaiting a correction long before the latest news

JAN13	Brexit has revealed MPs’ flaws – and our own	How do you find out someone s character flaws We all go to great lengths to conceal our own producing improbable lines in job interviews about our greatest weakness being our tendency to work too hard Politicians employ advisers who plot news grids to show how busy and effective their leaders are even as those leaders regularly fail to take important decisions  Shakespeare liked to use two devices to get his characters to reveal their true selves he either put them in disguise or got them drunk In politics today the device for unmasking people s weaknesses is rather less fun than a masked ball or session with a tankard it s Brexit 
JAN13	David Cameron and the art of blaming other people	David Cameron really loved organising votes for things didn t he That was his answer to everything I was reminded of this when I read that the elected police and crime commissioners which his government introduced to oversee the constabularies of England and Wales aren t doing a very good job According to the head of the National Crime Agency they re all about stopping speeding and burglary and not so hot on organised crime online child abuse and modern slavery  It s not surprising Making some local elected officials the overseers of the police is effectively putting the Neighbourhood Watch in charge of law enforcement strategy They re going to address the issues most noticeable to the very small percentage of people who might turn out to vote for them If they were in charge of healthcare all the money would go to treating RSI caused by overenergetic net curtain twitching Their best chance of arresting a mafia boss is if he plays the music too loudly at his Christmas party 
JAN13	US TV networks put ratings over principle by airing Trump speech	Donald Trump s speech on the Mexican border crisis delivered live from the Oval Office last week marked a milestone in his brief but historically chaotic presidency it revealed serious errors of judgment that weren t simply down to him Unfortunately for commercial media outlets it was their shortcomings that attracted almost as much attention and criticism as the scaremongering speech itself  It is the hallmark of many non Democratic countries that tinpot dictators appear at the drop of a hat on national broadcast outlets Even in functioning democracies you can measure the importance of a national moment by whether the head of state or government pops up in prime time For this reason appearances by US presidents on all TV networks were traditionally a relatively rare occurrence When they do happen the decision to run them is made on an ad hoc basis by the heads of those networks 
JAN13	Out of the Brexit nightmare must emerge a more robust democracy	There s a terrific scene in The Favourite the film about the last of the Stuart monarchs when Queen Anne is about to propose a European policy to her parliament Just before she opens her mouth the bewigged MPs make plain that they won t have it The queen faints with shock and hits the floor with a thump  I don t expect Queen Theresa to collapse when she loses in parliament this week not least because the rejection of her Brexit deal is not going to be a surprise to anyone herself included If we still lived by the traditional rules of British politics defeat ought to be the final curtain for Mrs May Brexit is the defining task of her premiership and she is about to fail it We d ordinarily expect the abdication of the PM to follow such a humiliating rejection Yet no one neither friend nor foe expects her to respond to defeat by submitting her resignation Brexit has so scrambled our politics that it has normalised dramas that we would once have regarded as extraordinary and made the unthinkable routine We no longer know which of the rules still apply 
JAN13	Fraudulent reporters harm us all. Vigilance is essential	The name Claas Relotius recently joined those of Janet Cooke and Jayson Blair in the list of reporters whose deceptions massively harmed esteemed publications and journalism more generally Similarities in the cases offer lessons  Last December the prestigious German magazine Der Spiegel revealed the extent of the fraud of Relotius one of its star writers Disclosures continue but it is already clear that large parts of his award winning reporting were simply made up 
JAN13	The vandals destroying libraries should have the book thrown at them	It is a further triumph for The Favourite with Bafta nominations to have propelled Ophelia Field s biography of Sarah Churchill the favourite in question to the heights of Amazon s gay and lesbian biography list  Anne Somerset s biography of Queen Anne is also likely to benefit as people attempt to discover more about the extraordinary incidents depicted in Yorgos Lanthimos s film How did th century politicians train their racing ducks Did Queen Anne ever get treatment for her raging bulimia What became of Anne s little rabbits And did Sarah really dress up as a highwayman because it s certainly not in Wikipedia 
JAN13	Leonardo was a man of the Renaissance, not narrow nationhood	He drew portraits for Italian dukes sketched for the papacy and died at the court of a French king If there is any artist who defies nationhood it is surely Leonardo da Vinci Yet last week Leonardo s cosmopolitan legacy was caught up in an extraordinary intergovernmental spat when Rome renewed its threat to block Italian galleries from lending to the forthcoming Louvre exhibition commemorating the th anniversary of Leonardo s death  Leonardo was Italian after all Why don t they loan us the Mona Lisa 
JAN13	A divided Britain is not new. So why do today’s schisms seem intractable?	A few years ago we stayed in a cottage in the Yorkshire Dales One night we went for a drink in the local It was plastered inside and out with union jacks The moment I saw the flags the hairs on my neck stood up Anyone black or Asian who had grown up in s and s Britain would probably have felt the same The union jack in those days was a sign meaning Beware fascists around  Littondale in the s is of course a very different place from east London in the s and the meaning of the union jack very different too The pub was welcoming and friendly and we returned there more than once And yet I know that the next time I see a pub plastered with union jacks the hairs of my neck once more will stand up 
JAN13	Don’t give in to the age of fatalism.

JAN13	Angst, grief, pain: Europe is in turmoil as extremists form new alliances	It could simply be a coincidence Or perhaps the decision to exhibit Edvard Munch s most famous work The Scream at the British Museum in April closely following Britain s scheduled March exit from the EU is an artful piece of deliberate subversion Either way the Norwegian painter s celebrated depiction of extreme pain occasioned by high anxiety mental instability grief loneliness and separation seems especially well suited to the times  Yet while Britain heads for a potentially spectacular nervous breakdown an agitated Europe is not in much better shape Nervousness abounds about the EU s prospects and cohesion with the focus on European parliament elections on May This normally dull uninspiring contest is turning into a battlefield on which a definitive struggle over Europe s direction may be fought and decided The last elections in saw the lowest ever turnout could be very different 
JAN14	This is only the end of the beginning of our Brexit civil war	Let no one think it will soon be over This is only the end of the beginning in a Brexit civil war that will last a generation There is no end in sight no healing in prospect no solution to hand whatever the outcome of myriad votes Just get on with it MPs find constituents complaining They are sick of the sight and sound of Brexit warned the Mail on Sunday leader without moving an inch on its own support for Theresa May s deal Few do budge So listen to no one who claims their particular answer will bring some miraculous national closure None will Better then to ignore snake oil political remedies  Start with no deal the most lethal ending described as national suicide by Dominic Grieve No need to rehearse the irrefutable reasons why crashing out would be a crippling economic blow and turn us into a pariah state But note how devil may care David Davis would wantonly renege on certified EU debts with a blithe We will keep the bn and spend it as we see fit Writing in the Sunday Times he added Now is the time for the UK to call the shots No dealer Dominic Raab tells May in the Telegraph to send a clear message to Brussels that the UK will not be bullied His breezy talk of trading on WTO rules never reveals the killer terms they would entail 
JAN14	On Brexit our MPs have been in hiding. They must show themselves	The Palace of Westminster lends itself well to hide and seek The Gothic labyrinth of interconnecting passageways and stairwells defies navigation It contains a million places of concealment But there are times when the division bell rings and MPs must show themselves The game ends and everyone sees who stands where The vote on Theresa May s Brexit deal should be such a moment of revelation  It is two years since parliament voted to propel the UK out of the European Union giving May authorisation to pull the article trigger Then the great game of hide and seek began A small minority of MPs dared to declare Brexit a bad business from the start They saw how reckless it was to set off on the journey without a map or a notion of the destination But most hid not in niches behind stone pillars but in bogus arguments and behind plastic loyalties 
JAN14	If Labour supports a public vote, we’ll take no lectures from Tories about democracy	In this week in the British electorate went to the polls They did so because Herbert Asquith s Liberal government had been unable to get Lloyd George s famous People s Budget through the House of Lords Liberal posters defined the election as a choice between the peers and the people They finally got their way after a second election that December  The fixed term parliament act was never intended to prop up a zombie government
JAN14	MPs are lying to voters – there is no alternative to May’s Brexit deal	Parliament is about to lie to those who elected it two years ago It is about to pretend that there is a better way of leaving the EU than is outlined in Theresa May s deal It knows there is not If it votes down May s deal it will lie  The deal is not a settlement but a transition It is a way of moving forward of leaving the EU pending negotiation of a long term trading relationship It is not a compromise but in reality a defeat for the having our cake and eating it school of Brexit fantasists But it is the only deal on offer All else is a Westminster miasma of personal ambition party advantage and endemic hysteria MPs are charged with governing the country well Never in my experience have they shown less interest in that cause 
JAN14	In a world of joyless self-denial, what do we really want? Drunken Blind Daters, getting it on	Joanne and Morgan a barista and a children s social worker have quite literally added to the gaiety of the nation with their brilliant blind date As they told the Guardian s Weekend magazine they got drunk fell over crashed a party fancied each other rotten Knickers were lost Mouths were full They didn t care about table manners or the food Or indeed what any of us thought What most of us thought anyway was Excellent behaviour Here were two young people having a wild time For a brief moment all was well with the world  Who cares whether they live happily ever after I have never understood what a date actually is except some sort of weird creepy transaction where whoever pays gets to demand stuff from the other person Often I sit next to people on such dates and eavesdrop and as far as I can ascertain they are worse than job interviews They might as well be asking each other What qualities make you suitable for this role Would you describe yourself as a self starter You state on your application that you are ft would you mind standing up 
JAN14	Forget project fear. Remainers now need a ‘project patriotism’	If as seems likely the prime minister s Brexit deal is rejected in parliament on Tuesday it is arguably only the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who stands in the way of a second referendum If he moves a no confidence vote and it fails Labour has already at its conference mandated that the party seek a second referendum And given that there is no majority in parliament for any currently envisaged version of Brexit including no deal it is entirely plausible that the current Brexit stasis could indeed be eventually settled by another referendum  So what would those who wish Britain to stay in the EU need to do differently to win it Recent tracker polls have shown an increasing swing to remain with the highest scores for Britain was wrong to leave the EU being recorded in the last two months But the long term trends show that few voters are switching remain s ranks are being swelled by new younger voters joining the electorate and their elders leaving it If anything positions may have hardened and polarised further 
JAN14	It’s not too late for Trump and Turkey to reach a compromise over Syria	Since last month s announcement that the US will imminently withdraw its troops from Syria President Trump has backtracked The White House has declared that the withdrawal may yet take a number of months amid a series of other contradictory remarks from senior American officials over whether the US plans to withdraw its troops entirely or to maintain some presence in eastern Syria On Sunday Trump generated further confusion by declaring plans for a safe zone in Syria across the border with Turkey without explaining who would enforce this zone and where it would be located even declaring that the US would devastate Turkey economically if it attacked Syria s Kurds  A precipitous withdrawal would be indeed be bad news it could pave the way for an Islamic State resurgence the jihadist organisation is thought to still have fighters at large in Syria and Iraq as well as expanded Iranian influence 
JAN14	Do you think the Irish citizens' assembly on abortion was a good idea?	In Ireland voted in a referendum to legalise abortion Irish politics had been debating this divisive and emotive issue for decades however the Irish citizens assembly which deliberated on the matter prior to the referendum was cited as a successful process in helping people understand the complex issues  The citizens assembly was established in by parliament and its purpose was to deliberate on a number of issues including the eighth amendment that outlawed abortion The citizen members of the assembly were selected to be electorally representative and included those in favour of the change those against and those undecideds Over the course of five weekends between the end of and early the assembly listened to people on all sides of the abortion debate including experts and those sharing their personal experiences 
JAN14	Why are we so obsessed with young, successful people like Sally Rooney?	When year old novelist Sally Rooney became the youngest ever winner of the Costa Book Prize last week it was to deafening cheers of critical acclaim that have characterised her brief career Rooney has already been heralded as the first great millennial novelist and a Salinger for the Snapchat generation And these Snapchatting millennials have since been overwhelming booksellers in the rush to read their author prompting shops to advertise that they still have copies of her novel Normal People in stock Yet for all her obvious talent the fanfare around Rooney s award made this millennial s heart sink slightly  The slightly frenzied reaction to Rooney seems to be symptomatic of the way we now greet achievements by young people Last year another year old author Daisy Johnson became the youngest person to be shortlisted for the Man Booker prize for her debut novel Everything Under Likewise some of year old Autumn de Forest s expressionist paintings have been valued at m m poet Ocean Vuong was only when he won the TS Eliot prize for his debut collection in and Christopher Paolini published the first of his bestselling Inheritance series when he was in his teens It seems we increasingly celebrate youthfulness as a marker of success in and of itself Teen Vogue s Under list began in This year s cohort includes year old designer Kheris Rogers and seven year old activist Havana Chapman Edwards 
JAN14	A nation ‘bored of Brexit’ risks sleepwalking into disaster	Just before Christmas I spent a day in Cowley a working class suburb of Oxford where a factory now owned by BMW manufactures that great British icon the Mini The plant closes its doors for an annual maintenance period usually timed to coincide with local schools summer holidays But this year amid the company s concerns about Britain s future relationship with Europe the shutdown will not only be longer than usual but is scheduled to begin the day after we formally leave the European Union a decision taken says the company to minimise the risk of any possible short term parts supply disruption in the event of a no deal Brexit  You might imagine the surrounding streets would be full of anxiety and urgency But once BMW had declined my request to visit the factory and I had resigned myself to long hours spent vox popping I was not entirely surprised to find the complete opposite questions about Brexit being met with an exasperated indifference as if it were something in which people were barely interested 
JAN15	After this staggering defeat for May, our country is left lost and adrift	This was a defeat on a scale without precedent in the era of universal suffrage a rebuff more humiliating than any endured even by Ramsay MacDonald in Some Conservatives voted against the signature policy of their own party tonight thereby triggering a motion of no confidence that in any normal era would see the government toppled within hours  But such are these extraordinary times that is not even the most significant story from tonight What matters more than the fate of this government or this prime minister is the fate of the country and its decision to leave the European Union which is now suspended in a state of limbo if not purgatory The law says Britain will leave the EU in odd days Yet tonight it has rejected the only firm exit path that exists It means that unless something changes and MPs can reach an agreement with each other Britain will crash out of the EU on March without a deal an outcome all but the most wild eyed Brexiteers regard as an economic and social catastrophe for these islands 
JAN15	The Guardian view on May’s Brexit deal: it’s over, but what’s next?	The overwhelming and decisive rejection by MPs of Theresa May s withdrawal agreement to leave the European Union is a shattering blow to the authority of the prime minister She has spent two years negotiating a deal which in substance was the opposite of what she said she wanted in public only to see it repudiated by parliament Her minority government has now been defeated on no fewer than occasions Britain is leaving the EU in weeks and Mrs May leads a cabinet that is hopelessly split a party that is riven with disagreements and a country that is deeply divided So emphatic is the Commons historic rebuff that Mrs May s deal is finished Mrs May lost by votes the greatest defeat of a government ever The scale of the opposition means it is not credible Mrs May could bring the motion back to the Commons modified with a few tweaks from Brussels and hope for success a second time round  We do not have to settle for the Hobson s choice of the May deal or no deal The trouble is the Tory party is split between those who want a deal and those who do not Mrs May has intensified the divisions within her party rather than resolve them She chose to start negotiations over Brexit not with the EU but with her own hardliners The red lines Mrs May subsequently set made it impossible for her to get a deal that would bring her fractious party together let alone reach out to her political opponents Her agreement ended up shaped by Mrs May s obsession with immigration and placating Brexit extremists The result is a blindfold Brexit where almost everything about the future relationship with Europe is up in the air for two more years It required a leap of faith to place trust in a prime minister who the Commons wisely decided deserved very little 
JAN15	The fear that lies behind toxic masculinity	What strikes me most is the fragility Gillette makes an advertisement calling on men to challenge abusive behaviour and thousands furiously proclaim they will never use its products again The American Psychological Association APA issues new clinical guidelines advising that a masculinity characterised by dominance aggression and emotional repression can be harmful to men s mental health and the world s conservative media falls into a collective faint So much for the strong and silent types  If real men according to the men s rights movement are tough and commanding why are the exponents of this doctrine so easily discomposed Why does the slightest challenge to the norms they proclaim by a razor ad or an academic body they had probably never encountered before trigger this frenzied testeria 
JAN15	Rod Liddle is wrong about the causes of black teenage deaths	They say don t speak ill of the dead and especially not of dead children But it seems there is an exception to that rule when the subject is black and poor and meets a violent death In fact certain rightwing commentators claim they are are doing us a special favour by suggesting that victims of violent crime such as year old Jaden Moodie are somewhat gangsta Led by figures such as Rod Liddle who among other things questioned why Jaden was out at night pm actually and criticised his fatuous gangsta moves these talking heads believe they are courageously owning the identification of a cultural problem one about which the progressive voices in our society stay silent for fear of being called racist or politically incorrect  Of course most violent crime is conducted by white people and the majority of stabbing victims in Britain are white But as long as any black children are tragically dying on the streets it is hugely important to debate the causes The Liddles of this world posit two diagnoses for the problem of black youth violence absent fathers and the related claim that the black family is uniquely dysfunctional and more nebulously black culture which is perceived as flawed and nefarious Yet in direct contrast to the rightwing commentators who exploit this problem to pursue their poisonous agendas there are people who have been researching and writing about the ecology of violence in our cities for decades making sense of what we are often told is senseless They have found young people living in an alternative cognitive landscape in which you stab first and ask questions later where distrust of the authorities and hostile strangers results in people and especially young men arming themselves and acting in aggressive and threatening ways in order to pre empt attacks 
JAN15	Moaning is a crucial part of parenting. So give Duncan Jones a break	Among the great lies of our time are the Brexit agreement will be one of the easiest in human history Mexico is going to pay for the wall We tried to deliver your parcel but you weren t in and Nobody ever tells you how hard it is to be a parent  The latest person to tell us how hard it is to be a parent is Duncan Jones a filmmaker father of two and the son of David Bowie He sparked debate AKA a social media pile on this week with a series of tweets about life with children aged two and a half and nine months I ll tell you something I never see anyone admit he wrote They are exhausting frustrating and life destabilizing They are rarely fun Sure smiles are great hugs are lovely but it s HARD not obviously a good choice in life 
JAN15	Donald Trump's fast food banquet – feeding the people Whoppers, as ever	It s another day and that means another slice of absurdity served up in Trump s America guys Or in this particular case slices of pizza And some hamburgers and other assortments of fast food  This is the spread the president put on for the visiting Clemson University football team who had won the College Football Playoff National Championship Trump made sure to point out numerous times that he paid for the food out of his own pocket Many federal employees are not being paid at all given the ongoing government shutdown now the longest ever which is why the president had to order food in the first place because catering staff are on furlough which again he blamed on the Democrats 
JAN15	I’ve withdrawn my amendment so parliament can reject May’s failed deal	At pm this evening we as MPs will be asked to take the single most important decision that any of us have faced during our time in parliament The outcome will affect the future of our country our economy and the lives of the people we represent  The Brexit referendum showed us to be divided and those of us who campaigned for remain have to accept that we lost But that does not mean that we have to agree to the deal the prime minister has brought back a deal that satisfies no one 
JAN15	Gillette’s ad is not PC guff, Piers Morgan – look beyond the macho stereotype	What would the advertising industry do without Piers Morgan  Whenever they need a grumpy middle aged man to be triggered there he is reliable as clockwork He did it with Greggs vegan sausage roll helping catapult their January marketing wheeze onto the front pages by complaining that it was a monstrosity And he s done it again with the new Gillette ad targeting toxic masculinity which twists its familiar the best a man can get tagline to suggest that men can do a lot better than Harvey Weinstein and fighting in the street It ends on a heroic note with images of men in general and fathers in particular showing their sons a better way But that didn t stop Morgan dismissing it as absurd virtue signalling PC guff that might drive him to get his razors elsewhere Let boys be damn boys Let men be damn men he harrumphed on Twitter 
JAN15	A London DJ's punishment sheds light on Singapore's caning shame	Any day now year old Ye Ming Yuen could be escorted out of his cell at Singapore s Changi prison and whipped times with a rattan cane This comes on top of the year sentence he s already serving after being convicted of seven drug offences in a country that takes pride in its uncompromising approach when it comes to law breaking  The story of Yuen a former British public schoolboy and London DJ has captured the attention of the British press but he s far from the only one awaiting caning Judicial corporal punishment has been a long time fixture in the south east Asian city state It was first introduced by British colonialists in the th century but has been retained and even expanded by the post independence government Today it s applicable to more than offences from violent crimes like rape and robbery to nonviolent breaches of the law such as vandalism or overstaying one s visa for over days Between January and October the courts handed down caning sentences to people sentences were carried out in that time 
JAN15	Hate the Sopranos finale? You're not a real fan of the series	Let s get one thing straight Tony Soprano didn t die at the end of The Sopranos He sat down with his family put Journey on a jukebox and chomped on some onion rings Then the screen went black What happened after that whether Tony was assassinated by the bloke who walked into the toilet moments before the blackout or if he lived and had to listen to Meadow discuss her terrible parallel parking is an unknown and will always remain so As it should do  At the end of last week a book released to coincide with the show s th anniversary made headlines for an interview with the series creator David Chase by the TV critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz During the interview Chase referred to the final scene as the death scene and the fatal scene That was enough for those who have trawled for an answer to what happened when the screen went black in June to start the ending engine up again The Times dedicated a story to whether or not the issue of Tony Soprano s fate had finally been put to bed Of course it hasn t and isn t In the Vox writer Martha P Nochimson claimed Chase had told her that Tony wasn t dead Finally there was an answer Until Chase released a statement saying the story was untrue and that the final scene of The Sopranos raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer 
JAN16	It’s now or never for May. Time to compromise on Brexit	It is said that the past is a foreign country But after the Brexit referendum it is the present not the past where we do things differently No government in British history has taken such a Commons beating as Theresa May suffered on Tuesday Yet hours later the selfsame MPs who had thrown out her UK EU Brexit deal by votes to now handed her premiership a fresh lifeline The Conservative MPs who voted her policy down on Tuesday backed her on Wednesday as though it were the most natural thing in the world to do  By voting by to that they still had confidence in May s government the House of Commons turned the ordinary meaning of words on their head But this wasn t a vote of confidence in any normal sense It was a suboptimal tribal choice between a government led by May and one led by Jeremy Corbyn It was a knockabout partisan diversion from the main national issue which now resumes The loss leaves Corbyn with fewer defences against Labour s second vote campaigners But the victory also finds May still wedded to her defeated Brexit policy and settled in for another year in Downing Street 
JAN16	Only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo	The pound rose and all was calm on the stock market As far as the financial markets were concerned the message was clear the voting down by MPs of Theresa May s withdrawal agreement means a delayed Brexit a softer Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all Those with serious wealth in Britain have always been worried that Brexit will lead to radical change They now think that there will be a perpetuation of the status quo or something not far removed from it Hence the pound getting stronger  There s no question that opting for the quiet life has its attractions There would be a boost to the economy as companies decided to push ahead with investment plans that had been delayed while the outcome of Brexit was uncertain And of course any economic costs of no deal would be avoided 
JAN16	Labour must pursue a better Brexit deal, not a second referendum	It is perversely a sign of the government s weakness not its strength that it has inevitably seen off a vote of no confidence All that unites a bitterly fractious Conservative party is panic at the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn led Labour government coming to power in a general election a likelihood many are admirably honest about If Theresa May was confident about the Tories prospects she would risk throwing the dice But Labour started the last election campaign percentage points behind the Tories in the polls and ended two points behind six weeks later Today the polling average has Labour slightly ahead Conservatives fear that a Corbyn led administration would not be like a normal Labour government and would upend an economic consensus established by Margaret Thatcher And they would be right  The media will now attempt to shift the narrative claiming that it is Labour under pressure This is absurd The government has just suffered the biggest parliamentary defeat in the history of British democracy A disastrous near decade of Tory rule has left Britain in its worst combined political and social crisis in modern times the consequence of ideologically driven austerity and catastrophic political decisions by both David Cameron and May Labour will be pilloried for not having a magical solution when there is none to a crisis engineered by its opponents 
JAN16	The Guardian view on Brexit and parliament: now dissolve the red lines	A Commons vote affirming confidence in Her Majesty s government does not indicate that parliament trusts Theresa May Her reprieve on Wednesday night by a margin of largely expresses Tory and DUP reluctance to risk a general election Power is still flowing away from the prime minister  In voters deprived the Tories of a majority Last December the government was found in contempt of parliament One third of Tory MPs have said they have no confidence in Mrs May as their party s leader On Tuesday the prime minister s Brexit deal was crushed in a Commons defeat greater than any recorded in the modern era Mrs May s authority has been stripped away her credibility is gone Every precedent guides her towards resignation But not much about Brexit follows precedent 
JAN16	MPs alone won’t solve the Brexit deadlock. We need a citizens’ assembly	The Brexit process has become almost unspeakably awful Like a foul smell that nobody really wants to deal with without action it will only get worse As party unity collapses in parliament how we find consensus on the greatest issue of our time will determine what the outcome is whether that turns out to be a second referendum or the next stage of negotiation We believe the best path to such a consensus involves setting up a citizens assembly  Just like the Labour party we represent contrasting communities that nevertheless have much in common Wigan voted to leave the EU Walthamstow to remain One is a northern town fighting to regain the good jobs and dignity that were once commonplace The other is an inner city area fighting an epidemic of knife crime and the rise of gentrification Separated by miles in both places people are angry deeply affected by poverty and disempowered by a system that does not respond to their needs 
JAN16	Welcome to the Westminster apocalypse. Have you thought about theocracy instead?	The world s most densely betwatted space at the best of times Westminster became even more wantonly apocalyptic in the days and hours leading up to the historic defeat of Theresa May s Brexit deal Behold a bell tolling haute remainer yellow vested journalist infested shitbird MP crawling flashmobbed performance art piece entitled HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THEOCRACY INSTEAD  If not don t rule it out An awful lot of things are apparently back on the table after May s flame out including but not limited to default no deal extending article a Norway style arrangement second referendum and return to absolute monarchy by either the Queen or David Attenborough 
JAN16	Arrogant remainers want a second vote. That would be a bad day for democracy	Remainers often argue as if they had a monopoly on what counts as reasonable and rational decision making Supporting the EU comes from the head whereas wishing to leave the EU comes from the heart as the MP Rachel Reeves once put it And yet the attitude of some towards a second referendum is breathtakingly reckless and cavalier Almost anything as long as it brings us one step closer to the UK staying in the EU is countenanced and justified  I remember one Cambridge lunch on a day when cabinet ministers were resigning over Theresa May s deal in which a colleague told me he would cheer every time a new resignation was announced The more chaotic the better he said because chaos makes shelving Brexit that much more likely 
JAN16	I took part in a citizens' assembly – it could help break the Brexit deadlock	In August there was a knock on my front door A man from a polling company introduced himself he was selecting people to take part in a national forum to discuss social issues in Ireland One of the topics to be debated was our country s strict abortion laws  I said yes not entirely sure what I was signing up for A week later there was a phone call to verify that I was on the register to vote and then my place as one of the members of the Citizens Assembly was confirmed An explainer booklet came in the post along with an invitation to Dublin Castle for the inaugural meeting in October 
JAN16	Theresa May needs to realise she can’t keep every Tory happy	The House of Commons has spoken but what has it actually said A clear and resounding no to a complex deal the UK and the EU have spent nearly two years negotiating And behind the emphatic no lies an unlikely coalition of hard Brexiteers ardent remainers and those in between collaborating to kick the deal and the prime minister  Unfortunately the kick was directionless 
JAN16	Cutting police homicide teams is the sure sign of a failing society	In August year old Yiannoulla Yianni was raped and murdered in her home while preparing food for her family Thirty four years later in my former team at the Metropolitan police led an investigation that convicted her killer After the trial Yiannoulla s brother Rick commented that the family never gave up hoping and were truly grateful to the police for finally bringing him to justice  Every murder cries out for justice That s why the Met never closes an unsolved homicide 
JAN17	Theresa May’s survival is just a Tory confidence trick	Back in when strong and stable was still a campaign slogan and not a laugh line I sat in on a focus group of undecided voters in Harrow home to two marginal seats in north west London Even then they didn t like Theresa May much Assuming she would be an effective negotiator they appreciated her steeliness the word strong came up twice as did Thatcher and clever But overall they found her unreliable and unrelatable They described her among other things as a liar headmistress busybody uncaring and untrustworthy  Comparing her to Jeremy Corbyn one said He d buy a round Theresa wouldn t When asked if they would trust her to look after their home while they were on holiday the consensus was The house yes But not the pets This is Britain If she can t be trusted to get a round in or look after pets I doubt May would have passed one of her own Home Office British values tests 
JAN17	On Saturday the UK turns remain. Parliament must force a second referendum	You could call it swing Saturday or crossover day for this Saturday January marks an important moment This is the day in theory when the country turns remain Even if not a single person has changed their mind since the referendum the demographic shift alone will have done the heavy lifting Enough old leavers will have died and enough young remainers will have come on to the electoral register to turn the dial on what the country thinks about Brexit  The psephologist and founding YouGov president Peter Kellner calculates that the leave vote has been declining by about a day taking into account the differential turnout the young turn out to vote much less often than the old By using exactly the same proportion of every age group turning out to vote exactly as they did in demographics alone will have transformed the UK into a remainer nation 
JAN17	Why did Tulip Siddiq have to vote in person? Cold Conservative calculation	Obscure parliamentary procedures are currently all the rage from John Bercow s controversial deviation from precedence in selecting amendments to business motions and the arcane voting procedure requiring MPs to physically go through division lobbies or be nodded through for which they still have to be on parliament grounds for their vote to be counted  The decision by the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq to delay the caesarean birth of her second child to vote in the crucial Brexit debate on Tuesday night and the confidence vote on Wednesday night has reignited the debate over proxy voting and reminded the country that the Conservatives have a fundamental problem with women Despite parliament agreeing in principle last February to implement proxy voting party whips have yet to facilitate a system for those MPs who most need it mainly pregnant people and parents 
JAN17	Don’t rely on Germany to solve Brexit, it doesn’t need to help Britain	Remember when Boris Johnson was telling you that Germany would force the EU to accept almost any conditions for Brexit basically Britain having its cake and eating it too because they need us more than we need them Didn t happen But in desperate Brexit times the hope for a deus ex machina to solve the whole damn thing persists Recently there have been more suggestions that Angela Merkel will somehow rescue Theresa May by offering Britain a new and better deal That isn t going to happen either Here s why  First back to Johnson He argued that Germany wanted to export cars to Britain so it would make sure that Britain and Europe had free access to each other s markets no matter what True Britons bought German cars in almost every fifth car Germany exported But car exports to Britain were down by whereas exports to China and Japan were up by and respectively May talks about global Britain but Germany thinks globally too and in the scheme of things Asia and the US are more important And by the way while British politicians were bickering about whether the country should belong to a customs union which supposedly stops Britain from striking free trade deals with global partners the EU signed a free trade agreement with Japan which should bring Germany export gains of bn a year 
JAN17	Only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo	The pound rose and all was calm on the stock market As far as the financial markets were concerned the message was clear the voting down by MPs of Theresa May s withdrawal agreement means a delayed Brexit a softer Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all Those with serious wealth in Britain have always been worried that Brexit will lead to radical change They now think that there will be a perpetuation of the status quo or something not far removed from it Hence the pound getting stronger  There s no question that opting for the quiet life has its attractions There would be a boost to the economy as companies decided to push ahead with investment plans that had been delayed while the outcome of Brexit was uncertain And of course any economic costs of no deal would be avoided 
JAN17	It’s not just the Fyre festival – this is the golden age of the social media con	The psychology of the con artist is such say those who study them that the very best fraudsters are able to sail through lie detector tests because they don t believe themselves to be lying This fact came to light in Fyre Fraud one of two documentaries released this week about the Fyre music festival a fiasco that traumatised hundreds of social media influencers and for which organiser Billy McFarland is serving a six year prison sentence What s fascinating about the story as told in both the Netflix and Hulu shows is how deeply McFarland tapped into the self deception of his targets and how the companies that enabled him continue to thrive  The art of the con feels like the great expression of our age and McFarland a grifter who as well as having the brainwave to put on a music festival in the Bahamas ran a credit card company and sold fraudulent tickets to exclusive events is the sort of vapid buffoon whose naked untrustworthiness is so undisguised as to make him seem almost transparent 
JAN17	A semi-Brexit, with just England and Wales leaving the EU, is the solution	When all solutions are bad it s time to reinvent the problem Is it still possible to honour the initial Brexit referendum without crossing the EU s red lines Yes through semi Brexit  The UK is divided into four nations two of which voted remain and two of which voted leave The British government could honour those decisions and allow Scotland and Northern Ireland to remain in the EU as the successor state to the UK while permitting England and Wales if it still wants to to exit 
JAN17	Labour must pursue a better Brexit deal, not a second referendum	It is perversely a sign of the government s weakness not its strength that it has inevitably seen off a vote of no confidence All that unites a bitterly fractious Conservative party is panic at the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn led Labour government coming to power in a general election a likelihood many are admirably honest about If Theresa May was confident about the Tories prospects she would risk throwing the dice But Labour started the last election campaign percentage points behind the Tories in the polls and ended two points behind six weeks later Today the polling average has Labour slightly ahead Conservatives fear that a Corbyn led administration would not be like a normal Labour government and would upend an economic consensus established by Margaret Thatcher And they would be right  The media will now attempt to shift the narrative claiming that it is Labour under pressure This is absurd The government has just suffered the biggest parliamentary defeat in the history of British democracy A disastrous near decade of Tory rule has left Britain in its worst combined political and social crisis in modern times the consequence of ideologically driven austerity and catastrophic political decisions by both David Cameron and May Labour will be pilloried for not having a magical solution when there is none to a crisis engineered by its opponents 
JAN17	Amber Rudd’s denial of the benefits crisis takes political spin to a new level	Watching the government jostle to survive this week I couldn t help but think how spin that frantic Thick of It type politics most associated with the Blair years seems almost mild in today s climate In an era in which politicians can now offer facts that openly contradict reality a spin barely seems to cover it  This was surely on Amber Rudd s mind when taking over at the Department for Work and Pensions DWP in November There are few more toxic domestic briefs in government not least because of universal credit Her predecessor Esther McVey tried the direct route simultaneously misleading parliament while accusing critics of peddling fake news 
JAN18	What we don’t talk about when we only talk about Brexit	One of Brexit s more pernicious aspects even before you get to its actual flaws is its tendency to suck all available oxygen unto itself to drain resources that might otherwise have gone elsewhere Before the referendum civil servants warned that such a task untangling years of legal agreements ripping out a delicate web of connections that had become embedded would consume all their energies Naturally their warnings were dismissed as Project Fear But even the head of Vote Leave Dominic Cummings before he took on the form of Benedict Cumberbatch conceded via Twitter that leaving the European Union would present the British state with the hardest job since beating Nazis  Just think of what else we could have done with all that time and money including the bn we re spending to guard against the entirely avoidable and self inflicted calamity of a no deal crash out from the EU The effort we could have made for jobs or housing or to repair the damage inflicted by austerity the work that could have been done to improve life for those left behind by three decades of change globalisation and automation But Whitehall didn t have the bandwidth Governments might be able to walk and chew gum at the same time but walking while shooting yourself in both feet that it turns out is impossible 
JAN18	How a Cotswolds river became a name that defined history	Sometime in a friendly chain of events not untypical of India took me to a shipping office in Kolkata there to meet the nephew of an Anglo Indian woman I had met quite casually a month or two earlier in Bihar It was dusk The office was in a large gloomy building by the river Unshaded bulbs shed a yellow light on walls decorated with calendars from companies that made ceiling fans and water pumps but there was also a picture of a ship with a black and white funnel and a bow wave creasing a blue sea SS Nuddea said the caption  Nuddea It had been a big name in my childhood My father had sailed on an earlier Nuddea owned by the same shipping line the British India Steam Navigation Company and the family album had pictures of him aboard in his white tropical uniform Not a very smart ship one of the workaday N class Nerbudda Nowshera that tramped slowly to Australia and back my father had wanted a berth on one of the bigger M class Madura Modasa that took passengers as well as cargo Nevertheless I had thought proudly of the Nuddea as Daddy s ship and never imagined that the name could represent anything beyond a cargo steamer built in Glasgow in 
JAN18	Second referendum campaigners’ biggest problem? The ‘elitist’ tag	Short of being photographed skiing at Davos with Bono nothing says global elite like trotting up the steps to your very own private plane  So no wonder Channel pounced delightedly on the revelation that Nigel Farage recently chartered a private jet to reach Strasbourg in an interview with the man himself that swiftly went viral Who s the man of the people now eh 
JAN18	Theresa May will do anything for love, but she won’t do that, or that, or that …	For better or for worse one of post imperial Britain s favoured methods of understanding itself has been through the prism of the royal family We come together at royal weddings and jubilees some like to say while others do so in front of box sets of The Crown Brexit on the other hand has long been a straight up car metaphor Cars are far and away the most popular way of understanding what might be happening to us Remainers warn of a car being driven off a cliff or of Theresa May running out of road Brexiteers talk of taking the wheel and the open road  Sensationally these two streams have crossed DON T CROSS THE STREAMS in the matter of Prince Philip s road accident The crash widely believed to have been orchestrated by Mohamed Al Fayed and MI though you won t read that in the mainstream media comes at a moment of high Brexit drama And looking at HRH s upturned vehicle I wonder what its import can be other than that certain things might be regarded as recklessly beyond the capabilities of our decrepit political system 
JAN18	Why are people cheering for no deal? Because they’re thinking about it the wrong way	There are moments in life when your heart sinks I had one last night right at the start of my terrifying debut on Question Time Isabel Oakeshott had just said we should leave the EU with no deal And the audience cheered Not a subdued start of the evening not quite warmed up cheer But a roar A loud one Shit I thought Do I dare point out the problems with this Because there are problems aplenty  Metaphors matter And Brexit has become a metaphorical cornucopia if you see what I mean Perhaps nowhere is this more true and more damagingly and misleadingly so than when it comes to the question of no deal 
JAN18	It was never about Europe. Brexit is Britain’s reckoning with itself	At least the Sun thrives on chaos The savage parliamentary mauling of Britain s withdrawal agreement with the European Union allowed Rupert Murdoch s pet tabloid to unveil on Wednesday morning a front page of grandly gleeful malevolence Under the headline Brextinct it conjured a creepy chimera of Theresa May s head pasted on to the body of a dodo But the thing about such surreal pictures is that it is not easy to control their interpretation From the outside this one seemed to suggest much more than the immediately intended message that both May and her deal are politically dead When it prompted one to ask did Brextinction really happen Was this strange creature ever really alive or was it not always a grotesquely Photoshopped image of something else a crisis of belonging that has attached itself to the wrong union Do the events of this week point us not towards the EU but to the travails of a radically disunited kingdom  The dodo after all may be proverbially dead but it has a vivid afterlife in that great trawl of the English unconscious Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland It is the Dodo when various characters have fallen into a pool of tears who suggests how they might dry themselves the Caucus race There was no One two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over However when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the Dodo suddenly called out The race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking But who has won 
JAN18	These Steiner ‘failures’ are really a failure of the free school agenda	Ofsted inspectors have found three of the UK s four Steiner state schools inadequate in reports that will be published this week Their core concerns are believed to be safeguarding bullying and a lack of support for children with special educational needs A number of private Steiner schools have also been deemed inadequate  In a brilliant primer written in when free schools were still a jewel in the crown of the coalition government the BBC journalist Chris Cook described the core controversies that might be thrown up by Steiner schools At that point and to this day these are mainly private schools In a way the handful that opened on the state s dollar were the apotheosis of Michael Gove s promise to parents if you want to replicate a private education even at its very wackiest and you have the energy you have our blessing 
JAN18	‘Back in 2019, Britain was much larger’: what the history books will say	It s always odd when politicians make an appeal to the history books it s like an actor making an appeal to reviewers midway through the film But it took on a new surreal meaning on Monday when Theresa May asked us to consider what the history books would say about the vote on her deal  It takes truly great commitment to your own mediocrity to sort through a catalogue of your own mistakes find the largest and most avoidable and then tell the gods of history that yep this national humiliation is the way you want future generations to remember you It s like calling up the Oxford English Dictionary and requesting that to cock something up irrevocably to the point that people feel a pang of despair when they hear your name be for ever known as doing a Theresa 
JAN18	Cate Blanchett’s S&M; play is just the shock that tepid theatre needs	If you love theatre and want to read a measured review of a play that you can go and see stop right here The play that I am talking about Martin Crimp s When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other which I feel could be the title of much of what I have sat through in the theatre is one you are unlikely to see either It is at the National Theatre and is completely sold out Tickets could only be obtained by public ballot It stars Cate Blanchett who is of course bloody wonderful and is full of sex and violence  I am not a theatre buff though I have been a film critic but most of what I have seen in the theatre in the last years has been mediocre beyond belief I love Beckett and recently loved the Pinter revival But what is so brilliant about Pinter is how much fear and menace he conjures just off stage Every line a threat every character is implicit in the horror Its not in your face it just gets in your head 
JAN18	The great thing about my coming out later in life? Nobody judged me	I first came out in my early s following a destructive affair with a colleague Coming out was not nearly as stressful as recovering from the affair or the period surrounding it during which I questioned and eventually began to understand my sexuality I had been married for years to the father of my children and the changes these realisations brought about were complicated and challenging to navigate  I had wondered about my sexuality after my second child was born in my mid s but due to the trauma of my brother s suicide at around that time all my emotional energy was taken up with surviving alongside parenting small children and depression By the time I fell for the woman at work I had lost any remaining affection for my husband and the chaos of an affair was a distraction from my emotional emptiness I remember thinking Fuck it I ve got nothing left to lose and throwing myself headlong into the affair ending my relationship with my husband within about a fortnight 
JAN19	Its compass smashed, the ghost ship Brexit sails into ever darker waters	The curse on the crew of the Flying Dutchman damned them to sail the seas for eternity with no hope of ever reaching port It came to mind during the dark tempests in which parliament first dismasted the government by rejecting its Brexit deal and then voted to leave that same government afloat In the hope of gathering some intelligence about how the captain of the Brexit ghost ship intends to navigate her way out of this hell I turned to a senior and clever Tory who is a close shipmate of the prime minister How will it end Came his sagacious reply I haven t got a fucking clue  This much we do know At pm on March one of three things must happen Britain will crash out of the EU without a withdrawal agreement or a transition period This will mean the overnight termination of decades of legal and trading agreements with both our continent and the rest of the world an outcome that will deal severe reputational damage to this country and unleash disruption for which it is not at all prepared Or Britain s politicians will have to collectively confess that they cannot find a solution and seek to prolong or revoke the withdrawal process damning us to sail on without landfall in sight unless this is accompanied by the promise of another referendum to resolve the deadlock Or parliament will very hard against the deadline finally give its approval to something This may not be a safe harbour but the approval of a withdrawal agreement would be a port of sorts until the beginning of the next stage of the negotiations covering future relations 
JAN19	Cut tuition fees and you shut the door to poor students	Last week universities in England were preparing reports on how they have diversified their student populations These reports will be submitted to the director of fair access at the Office for Students My university King s College London will report happily that our undergraduate intake is now state school more than ethnic minority and has the fastest growing population of low income students in the Russell Group  And what has made all this progress and vital work possible The very thing that many believe to be the enemy of educational opportunity tuition fees 
JAN19	Council houses were once a glory of the public realm. Let’s return to those days	Build more council homes Not so long ago this idea was although not new radical So thoroughly had Margaret Thatcher schooled the nation in the virtues of private property that decades after her departure it still seemed outlandish to mainstream politicians to go back to what had been the main way of addressing housing need Now as it has finally sunk in that the private sector cannot will not and should not be expected to fill all the gaps in the supply of homes even Conservative politicians are calling for local authorities to be given the powers to do so instead  However whenever the case is made it raises the obvious question which is where to find the money Everyone knows that housing is expensive Everyone knows or did before it was found that national wealth can be frittered and forsworn in the great Brexit adventure that the government has been in the grip of austerity for all of this decade It s a reasonable point 
JAN19	The Tories now treat the nation as they have long treated the poor	Brexit did not come from nowhere The jerry built utopianism the indifference to and ignorance of how the British live and what they need to keep them safe the know nothing pride in ignorant generalisations and the cocksure love of sweeping solutions have their roots in the right that emerged a decade ago  Before the Brexiters wrecked the country they wrecked the lives of the poor Universal credit was the Conservatives fantasy when they took power Iain Duncan Smith offered a dream so seductive that even his natural critics could not find it in their hearts to condemn him unequivocally His grand project would remove disincentives to work It would simplify the complicated and create a benefits system that was a doorway to real aspiration and achievement 
JAN19	Here’s me and the Mona Lisa. Who says that art and selfies can’t mix?	So there you are having worked your way through a crowd denser than a Brexit negotiation standing in front of your prize The Mona Lisa in the Louvre What do you do Look more closely at that enigmatic smile Wonder at the subtle gradations of light and shadow in Leonardo s rendering of the face Admire the illusion of depth  No of course not You turn your back on the painting whip out your phone and take a selfie And then you move on to your next prize 
JAN19	Why it sticks in the craw to see billionaire Trump ‘slumming it’	It comes to something when the perfect way to demonstrate wealth and status is by slumming it with junk food  First up President Donald Trump Finding himself without catering staff oh you know the shutdown unpleasantness for a visit from the Clemson University football team Trump piled tables with his beloved takeaway burgers various brands Or as he initially tweeted hamberders stinking and steaming away in polystyrene cartons presumably after so many hours giving off the kind of whiff you d associate with an unregulated abattoir in a heatwave 
JAN19	Jasmin Paris’s amazing feat gives new meaning to endurance	Last week Jasmin Paris won the Montane Spine Race for which the word gruelling seems horribly inadequate Like Diana Nyad swimming from Cuba to Florida at the age of or Serena Williams winning her rd grand slam there are some feats of human endurance that scramble the mind and running miles along the Pennine Way is one of them  But these triumphs go beyond personal victories They should lift our collective spirit because sometimes people are incredible and how wonderful it is to be reminded of that 
JAN19	What we don’t talk about when we only talk about Brexit	One of Brexit s more pernicious aspects even before you get to its actual flaws is its tendency to suck all available oxygen unto itself to drain resources that might otherwise have gone elsewhere Before the referendum civil servants warned that such a task untangling years of legal agreements ripping out a delicate web of connections that had become embedded would consume all their energies Naturally their warnings were dismissed as Project Fear But even the head of Vote Leave Dominic Cummings before he took on the form of Benedict Cumberbatch conceded via Twitter that leaving the European Union would present the British state with the hardest job since beating Nazis  Just think of what else we could have done with all that time and money including the bn we re spending to guard against the entirely avoidable and self inflicted calamity of a no deal crash out from the EU The effort we could have made for jobs or housing or to repair the damage inflicted by austerity the work that could have been done to improve life for those left behind by three decades of change globalisation and automation But Whitehall didn t have the bandwidth Governments might be able to walk and chew gum at the same time but walking while shooting yourself in both feet that it turns out is impossible 
JAN19	May I have a word about… Marcelo Bielsa	What a truly extraordinary week in the febrile world of the B word I refer not to the pustulant Bercow or the vexatious Brexit but the Leeds United head coach Marcelo Bielsa  If you missed this story and I really can t credit that your mind has been elsewhere a brief recap An official from the club was collared for spying on their opponents Derby County prompting a veritable deluge of outrage and opprobrium quite in keeping with an event that shook the noble game to its very foundations feel free to add your own cataclysmic cliche 
JAN19	How a Cotswolds river became a name that defined history	Sometime in a friendly chain of events not untypical of India took me to a shipping office in Kolkata there to meet the nephew of an Anglo Indian woman I had met quite casually a month or two earlier in Bihar It was dusk The office was in a large gloomy building by the river Unshaded bulbs shed a yellow light on walls decorated with calendars from companies that made ceiling fans and water pumps but there was also a picture of a ship with a black and white funnel and a bow wave creasing a blue sea SS Nuddea said the caption  Nuddea It had been a big name in my childhood My father had sailed on an earlier Nuddea owned by the same shipping line the British India Steam Navigation Company and the family album had pictures of him aboard in his white tropical uniform Not a very smart ship one of the workaday N class Nerbudda Nowshera that tramped slowly to Australia and back my father had wanted a berth on one of the bigger M class Madura Modasa that took passengers as well as cargo Nevertheless I had thought proudly of the Nuddea as Daddy s ship and never imagined that the name could represent anything beyond a cargo steamer built in Glasgow in 
JAN20	England’s rebel spirit is rising – and it wants a no-deal Brexit	In my innocence I didn t expect many people to be in a central Portsmouth Wetherspoons at am on a Friday morning But there they all were in their droves passionate supporters of Brexit there to hear the pub chain s founder and chairman Tim Martin make the case for Britain leaving the EU with no deal Martin has been on the road since November with the aim of visiting at least of his boozers The day we crossed paths he was traversing the south coast moving on to Southampton and Weymouth given that it has whetted the appetite of what remains of the country s local press drawn large crowds and shifted huge amounts of food and drink the whole thing looks to have been an unlikely success  Martin s case was unconvincing to the point of tedium a half argument that ignored what a no deal Brexit would mean for British exports and too blithely dismissed all those concerns about supply chains and chaos at UK ports let alone what a no deal scenario would mean for the island of Ireland But on the level of political sociology the spectacle presented was compelling the hardest of the Brexit hardcore many of them on the pints and riled to snapping point before the speech even got going and then taken into incandescence by the posse of local Liberal Democrats interrupting Martin s speech at every turn 
JAN20	We can’t leave a no-deal decision in the hands of wiped-out Theresa May	It is nothing less than despicable that when our opposition and our government can clearly see they need to work together to get us out of this Brexit chaos they are refusing to do so And that means Theresa May could quite conceivably allow Britain to exit the EU without a deal without any serious plans in place and without reference to parliament To prevent a no deal outcome requires MPs to proactively replace this legal default position with something else  If the court case I brought against the government over article was about anything at all it was about parliamentary sovereignty That meant the will of the overwhelming majority of our MPs should prevail on the major issues of the day It is their duty to represent their constituency their party and the interests of the country It is a tenet of representative democracy that MPs are not delegates for their constituents This means that their decisions and actions are ultimately governed by putting the best interests of all their constituency before all else 
JAN20	Where are George Clooney and co now that Sudan needs them?	In a US law firm signed a contract with the Sudanese government to assist in efforts to lift the economic sanctions that had been suffocating the country since Within weeks George Clooney and John Prendergast veteran activists for human rights in Sudan wrote a letter in Time magazine objecting to this They asked rhetorically did the law firm s senior ranks filled with ex senators and congressmen not know that president Omar al Bashir s regime had committed mass atrocities That it was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Darfur That it persecuted Christians The question of their firm working in the service of such a brutal and vile regime can only be answered by the simplest of terms they concluded Probably they just don t know  The sanctions were lifted but it made little difference The world had forgotten Sudan and was in no rush to be reminded All that was associated with the country ticked off neatly in the Clooney Prendergast letter was unsavoury So allow me to remind you For the past four weeks Sudan has been seized by a popular uprising on the part of a people that has been suffering under a brutal dictatorship for years and from the effects of the global human rights machine that cut them off from the world for 
JAN20	Opioids don’t work for chronic pain. So why do we still prescribe them?	One of the key principles you learn in medical school is that doctors should do no harm But what should doctors do when our patients insist that we do things that we know are harmful This is the dilemma that thousands of doctors face on a daily basis when tasked with helping patients with chronic pain  Pain is a universal human experience that alerts us to bodily harm Most pain is transient and requires no specific intervention other than the passage of time For more severe acute pain pain that lasts hours days or weeks and cancer pain at the end of life modern medicine has several very effective treatments pills injections and the like But chronic pain which persists for months or years is a very different entity 
JAN20	It’s the defining issue of Brexit, but who understands Northern Ireland?	Have you ever visited Northern Ireland You should go it s a fascinating place In fact if it were less fascinating that is to say less complicated then the UK s departure from the EU would have been easier You have that to thank us or resent us for  Before you visit you should familiarise yourself with some of the basic geography First of all where is Northern Ireland Obviously it s in Ireland but only in one version of Ireland It is on the island of Ireland but not in the political state legally named Ireland So it s in Britain Not quite it is not on the island of Britain but it is in the United Kingdom the state often referred to as Britain It can therefore be described as being in both Britain and Ireland one politically and the other physically But unpack that sentence further it is not on the island of Britain or in the state of Ireland It is neither and both at the same time 
JAN20	The lure of ancient Egypt is a way to revitalise faded industrial towns	Museums teach us to dream Since the Victorian age it s been Egyptian mummies matched only by dinosaurs that have captivated children Being taken to see the mummies is a rite of passage and one accessible across the country not just to those in London who have the British Museum on their doorstep But local authority culture budgets are being slashed so how can regional arts institutions survive What should they do about the pressure to return looted objects And how do they show their relevance to modern audiences  I have been exploring the history of three northern Egyptian museums which have four remarkable Victorian women at the heart of their story For those looking for entries for one of those currently popular anthologies of plucky rebel ladies from history they all fit the bill 
JAN20	A citizens’ assembly is now the only way to break the Brexit deadlock	Parliament must inflict a second defeat on the government by voting next Tuesday to extend article for a year Not as a delaying tactic but for a purpose to enable a process of nationwide consultation and reflection Key to this would be a series of citizens assemblies whose thinking would then lead to constructive reconsideration by parliament of our relations with Europe including the option of a renegotiation followed by a referendum  The direct engagement of the British people is now essential in order to address the triple challenge of a government defying the sovereignty of parliament an ever more divided country and mounting distrust between parliament and people 
JAN20	How admirable that MPs want to amend Brexit. It won’t work	Constitutional folklore is notoriously unreliable Liberal statesman John Bright for instance did not as is so often claimed declare in that the British legislature was the mother of all parliaments That particular distinction he accorded to England Likewise and more importantly it is not true that parliament is sovereign That authority is vested in the Queen in parliament which is to say ministers of the Crown acting in tandem with the Commons and the Lords The question always is where the balance between government and parliament lies  Since the second world war the general trend has been towards the aggregation of power in the executive In former lord high chancellor Lord Hailsham went as far as saying we live in an elective dictatorship Tony Blair s chief of staff Jonathan Powell spoke of the creation of a Napoleonic state Yet last week s historic defeat of Theresa May s Brexit deal in the Commons was a milestone in a quiet counter revolution Ever since Iraq parliament has assumed that it has a right of veto over any significant declaration of military hostilities select committees though still no match for their US counterparts have flexed their muscles 
JAN20	There’s one thing that really puts me off veganism: Peta	I ve been vegetarian for ages and have been considering going vegan One reason I haven t yet is pizza vegan cheese is a crime against tastebuds Another thing putting me off is Peta The animal rights organisation seems to launch itself into the headlines every few months with an obnoxious advertising campaign that makes vegans look like pea brains with whom no right minded person would want to be associated  Peta s latest act of tofu terrorism is a new ad centred around masculinity Traditional masculinity is DEAD it announces The secret to male sexual stamina is veggies It brought this thesis to life with a puerile video featuring men vigorously waving vegetable genitalia Nothing has ever made me want to eat a carrot less Or an aubergine Congrats Peta you ve put me off fruit and veg I m craving a hamberder as I believe the meat treats are called in the White House 
JAN20	It's heartwarming to hear MPs speaking up for press freedom	In too many countries it is open season on journalists Ruling politicians acting like the monarchs of regimes past openly denigrate the men and women who seek to hold them to account and thereby encourage their citizens to follow suit The most obvious example is US president Donald Trump and his declaration that journalists are enemies of the people purveying fake news  Presidents and prime ministers elsewhere have taken his lead from Turkey s Recep Tayyip Erdo an jailer at the last count of journalists to Hungary s Viktor Orb n who deals with critical media outlets by buying them up and closing them down and on to the Czech president Milo Zeman who thought it amusing to hold up a mock assault rifle labelled for journalists 
JAN21	No-deal Brexit is a Dad’s Army parody and I refuse to stockpile	Plan B No just B for Back to Brussels to Beg a Better Backstop not even Botoxing her old plan A Theresa May does not surprise Wild rumours that she might dash for another election or resign mid crisis fooled no one Why expect better If she pretended to listen to flotillas of visitors imploring her to see sense change course stop the madness then she wore earplugs Of course nothing changed However she has every reason for intransigence strapped to her pilot seat clamped in irons Move an inch on the customs union soften a red line and she would haemorrhage Tory MPs winning few from Labour Kate Hoey may cavort at Jacob Rees Mogg s Bollinger bash at his home to celebrate May s vote defeat but entices no fellow Labour MPs  As the captive prime minister in name only runs the clock down closer to a nuclear no deal how terrified should we be Pay attention when her own business minister Richard Harrington MP warns that it would be such an absolute disaster that he would resign warning of car industry collapse if supply chains were cut Some cabinet ministers would walk too rather than take the blame for needless carnage Every day brings more bad news the International Air Transport Association warns that m sold airline tickets could be cancelled no deal means no extra flights above last year s quota 
JAN21	Prince Philip’s crash should mark a turning point in our royal sycophancy	So much is made of the harm that sections of the British media have done to the royals over the years that it often completely overshadows the terrible harm the royals do to the media For something strange and awful seems to come over the industry when tasked with covering the monarchy it becomes servile oddly pious nerdily preoccupied with such things as the dates of building restorations and the royal protocol on tights People are often mean about the BBC s sycophantic royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell but his is a disease that infects anyone who touches his subject  First and perhaps worst is the fixation on detail which serves to make the country look like deranged stalkers convinced their victims are sending them secret love signals through the curtains Take the reaction to the car crash in which the Duke of Edinburgh wasn t injured there were artist s impressions of Philip in its aftermath fact files about the vehicle he was driving stories about the Queen being as usual driven to church in a different car just days after the accident and what it might have meant that Philip wasn t with her 
JAN21	If Russell Brand wants to change the world, he could try changing a few more nappies	I am way too woke to be part of the backlash against Russell Brand which was sparked by an interview this weekend in which he talked about fatherhood I m so woke I was part of the frontlash But you don t really want to cross a man whose revolutionary consciousness involves legal letters so all I can say is well done Swami Russ for reproducing and reaching a higher state of evolution than I imagined possible  After all it is certainly neither right nor sensible to prefer the womanising drug addled Essex thesaurus to his latest incarnation but then I am not here to be right or sensible His voyage towards sobriety may have helped many He rewrote the step programme in his book Recovery married Katy Perry told everyone not to vote in before changing his mind oh and had sex four or five times a day He was beloved by brocialists as he demanded revolution but then he forgot how to be funny He made the political YouTube series The Trews because the bad old MSM mainstream media was not to be trusted

JAN21	Cancer in your 20s is terrifying – too many of us are left to cope alone	When I was diagnosed with leukaemia in aged I was shocked to find out how little survival rates had improved among young people with cancer in recent decades Research had left us forgotten in the middle between children and older adults as one study put it with improvements in outcomes among teens and twentysomethings lagging behind the dramatic advances seen among the general population  So the encouraging trends revealed by last week s Teenage Cancer Trust TCT report the first detailed analysis of to year olds with cancer in the UK are cause for celebration Mortality rates for all cancers in the age group have fallen by almost a third from per million in to per million in Five year survival rates have risen by four percentage points from in females males in to females males in the period 
JAN21	At last, the Elizabeth v Mary catfight trope of history is being reassessed	The argument that history is written by the winners depends on your definition of winning Who wins in the struggle between Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots may seem obvious in the director Josie Rourke s new film with its opening scene of Mary s execution on Elizabeth s orders in February But in naming the film after Mary Rourke and screenwriter Beau Willimon imply that although Elizabeth won the battle over her Scottish cousin it was Mary who triumphed in the longer historical war of sympathy and affection  For the first time in this story s cinematic history the two female leads are directed by a woman who avoids the catfight trope and instead sees Elizabeth and Mary as potentially kindred spirits whose antagonism is manufactured by their fearful and violent male lovers and counsellors

JAN22	Only empathy can break the cycle of violence in Israel-Palestine	Empathy is all about imagining other minds appreciating that different people have different perspectives and responding to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion After a career studying autism and the nature of empathy I see empathy as one of our most valuable natural resources It has particular promise as an approach to conflict resolution one that has advantages over viewing a problem through a chiefly military economic or legal lens  We can see this if we look at the Israel Palestine conflict where both communities have different views of the same historic period both claim the same piece of land and both have valid emotional reactions to the conflict that must be acknowledged I am not an expert in that dispute nor so naive to believe that there is a single simple solution to it But I do believe empathy can help 
JAN22	Katie Price is right. Disabled people shouldn’t be forced off the internet by abuse	What sort of person repeatedly picks on a disabled child in the most vicious and cruel of terms  The answer of course is the sort of people the model Katie Price had in mind when she started campaigning for online abuse to become a specific criminal offence Price s year old son Harvey who is blind autistic and has Prader Willi syndrome has been hideously mocked and taunted His mother quickly gathered more than supportive signatures for a petition demanding online abuse be treated as a hate crime and now the parliamentary petitions committee has accepted her argument that the law isn t fit for purpose or to be precise a part of that argument Price s petition referred not just to disability but to homophobia racism and even body shaming of women the MPs were careful to single out disability alone arguing in their report that they didn t want to cut across the work of others on the rest

JAN22	A year ago I was raped. Here’s what I have learned	On a grey autumn evening in London just over a year ago I went out for drinks with a friend to celebrate a new job Eight hours later I was raped by somebody I d never met before  My assault happened in late when the MeToo movement was still fresh and gaining momentum every day I felt lucky for this Lucky in the way you might feel if you d escaped a house fire thinking you were alone only to find that the people next door had escaped a house fire too In the state of shock that followed which lasted for several months I became obsessed with this new wave of feminism 
JAN22	Brexit is a mess – what would Yes Minister’s Sir Humphrey do?	 What is the function of the civil service To help the government implement its policies But with Brexit the most important constitutional issue for decades every cabinet minister has his or her own policy Without a written constitution and with only norms traditions and precedents to guide us this unprecedented situation has made everyone in government into a headless chicken   I was merely a humble vessel into which ministers the people s representatives poured their thoughts and hopes My job was to help turn this jumble into workable policies no mean task We were loyal to each government and each prime minister in turn supporting their manifestos their hopes and their dreams where practicable whatever our private opinions 
JAN22	Prince Philip’s crash should mark a turning point in our royal sycophancy	So much is made of the harm that sections of the British media have done to the royals over the years that it often completely overshadows the terrible harm the royals do to the media For something strange and awful seems to come over the industry when tasked with covering the monarchy it becomes servile oddly pious nerdily preoccupied with such things as the dates of building restorations and the royal protocol on tights People are often mean about the BBC s sycophantic royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell but his is a disease that infects anyone who touches his subject  First and perhaps worst is the fixation on detail which serves to make the country look like deranged stalkers convinced their victims are sending them secret love signals through the curtains Take the reaction to the car crash in which the Duke of Edinburgh wasn t injured there were artist s impressions of Philip in its aftermath fact files about the vehicle he was driving stories about the Queen being as usual driven to church in a different car just days after the accident and what it might have meant that Philip wasn t with her 
JAN22	'Transparency and fairness': Irish readers on why the Citizens' Assembly worked	While the Brexit debacle rumbles ever on several outcomes are on the table including the possibility of a second referendum Some including this newspaper have suggested that if a second referendum were to happen a way forward could be for the UK to follow the model adopted by Ireland to try and break the stalemate over an emotive issue that had dogged its politics for decades abortion  In Ireland s Citizens Assembly was established by parliament to deliberate on a number of issues including gay marriage and the eighth amendment that outlawed abortion The citizen members of the assembly were selected to be electorally representative and included people who were in favour of the change some who were against and some who were undecided The findings were published in a report at the end of and debated in parliament in Though the findings weren t initially popular with the public the result of last year s referendum wanted to repeal the th amendment was very close to the assembly s in favour of having no restrictions on termination in early pregnancy 
JAN22	Justin Welby’s speaking in tongues makes sense to his evangelical tribe	Archbishop Justin Welby s statement to the Christian radio station Premier that he talks in tongues every morning is an appeal using one of the clearest markers to his evangelical tribe Talking in tongues is a streaming babble of nonsense syllables delivered with a curious calm authority as if what the speaker were saying made incontrovertible sense even though it contains no recognisable words It sound like what it probably is the spontaneous operation of the speech producing parts of the brain when they are completely decoupled from the bits that handle language and thought  For believers it is a priceless expression of the presence of the holy spirit It is mentioned in the New Testament and has been the defining feature of the charismatic movement which was the major development of Christianity in the last century 
JAN22	If Russell Brand wants to change the world, he could try changing a few more nappies	I am way too woke to be part of the backlash against Russell Brand which was sparked by an interview this weekend in which he talked about fatherhood I m so woke I was part of the frontlash But you don t really want to cross a man whose revolutionary consciousness involves legal letters so all I can say is well done Swami Russ for reproducing and reaching a higher state of evolution than I imagined possible  After all it is certainly neither right nor sensible to prefer the womanising drug addled Essex thesaurus to his latest incarnation but then I am not here to be right or sensible His voyage towards sobriety may have helped many He rewrote the step programme in his book Recovery married Katy Perry told everyone not to vote in before changing his mind oh and had sex four or five times a day He was beloved by brocialists as he demanded revolution but then he forgot how to be funny He made the political YouTube series The Trews because the bad old MSM mainstream media was not to be trusted 
JAN22	Cancer in your 20s is terrifying – too many of us are left to cope alone	When I was diagnosed with leukaemia in aged I was shocked to find out how little survival rates had improved among young people with cancer in recent decades Research had left us forgotten in the middle between children and older adults as one study put it with improvements in outcomes among teens and twentysomethings lagging behind the dramatic advances seen among the general population  So the encouraging trends revealed by last week s Teenage Cancer Trust TCT report the first detailed analysis of to year olds with cancer in the UK are cause for celebration Mortality rates for all cancers in the age group have fallen by almost a third from per million in to per million in Five year survival rates have risen by four percentage points from in females males in to females males in the period 
JAN23	Could this local experiment be the start of a national transformation?	If there is hope it lies here in the most deprived borough in London Barking and Dagenham has shocking levels of unemployment homelessness teenage pregnancy domestic violence and early death Until it was the main stronghold of the British National party Its population turns over at astonishing speed every year about of residents move out But over the past year it has started to become known for something else as a global leader in taking back control  Since the second world war councils and national governments have sought to change people s lives from the top down Their efforts during the first years of this period at least were highly effective creating public services public housing and a social safety net that radically improved people s lives 
JAN23	The only Brexit compromise I can see coming is a bad one	Brexit is a reminder that two connected things need to happen in order for a political compromise to stick First partisan leaders must decide that it is better than any other achievable outcome Second the public must also converge to give it their backing One movement towards the treaty table without the other doesn t cut it  The Northern Ireland peace process was a classic example of this dual process It took many years before mutually antagonistic political leaders decided that a peace deal was better than an unwinnable war But it took even longer for the two communities in Northern Ireland to begin to make the same move The peace process only worked because the political deal was followed by referendums that endorsed it 
JAN23	Think another general election is unlikely? Think again	Could a general election be looming It might seem unlikely Last time Theresa May dissolved parliament she had a point lead and higher personal ratings than Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair in their pomp Labour had suffered one of its worst postwar defeats just two years earlier And yet the Conservatives lost their majority This time round Labour are ahead in several polls Jeremy Corbyn s team though tired after their journey from the political wilderness to the epicentre of the greatest political upheaval since the war will begin an election with far more experience than last time As senior Conservative officials have pointed out to the Sun Tory seats are held by a margin of less than with Labour in second place in of them How would voters view the fourth national vote in five years the fifth for Scottish voters Brenda from Bristol would be considerably more irate this time Would Tory MPs really let May take their party into an election just weeks after of them voted against her leadership Are they not uniquely fearful of a Corbyn government which they rightly judge to be a totally different prospect to a normal Labour administration  And yet May s Brexit deal has suffered the biggest defeat in the history of British democracy If she halved the margin of defeat in another vote it would still find a place in the five worst parliamentary routs How on earth is she supposed to turn a vote deficit into a victory of at least one in a matter of weeks She won t get a meaningful concession on the backstop from the EU how will she get the DUP all the hard Brexiteers of the Tory ERG and Tory remainers on side Jacob Rees Mogg is showing signs of surrender to May but a hardcore would not follow him If she is expecting mass Labour defections to back her deal disappointment beckons May is in an impossible situation of her own making 
JAN23	Wealthy Brexiteers like James Dyson are jumping ship. Why might that be?	Let s give James Dyson the benefit of the doubt Let s take at face value the assurances issued by his multibillion pound company whose products involve the generation of hot air as to why it is relocating its headquarters from Wiltshire to Singapore  Apparently it has nothing to do with Brexit What s more it s barely a move at all since it will see only two people both top executives actually moving to Singapore Dyson will continue to employ people in the UK many of them in research and development and the relocation is really just about wanting to keep a closer eye on the firm s investments in Asia That it chose to do that in Singapore where companies pay a mere in tax rather than say India or South Korea is surely pure coincidence 
JAN23	Let us condemn the heresy of workspaces in churches	Walking through Camden Town in north London recently a place whose countercultural relevance dwindled sometime between the Libertines first and second albums I came across a building labelled WORK LIFE plus the slogan Because life s too short  It seemed to symbolise everything that the late cultural theorist Mark Fisher meant when he coined the phrase boring dystopia WORK LIFE is one of those hubs for freelancers or digital nomads a handy phrase if that green juice cleanse isn t providing the quite the level of purging that your body desires Don t flush yet though there s more Nestled in one of London s most iconic postcodes there s plenty of creative spirit here as well as a punk rock approach to business 
JAN23	To those leaving Labour: if you want to stop Brexit, stay and fight	If some reports are to be believed large numbers of Labour members are leaving the party because of its position on Brexit The suggested figure of people walking away is difficult to corroborate and has been strenuously rebutted by the party But Labour s resistance to backing a fresh referendum despite the overwhelming view of its members has undeniably prompted some to leave  Labour cannot afford to be blase about the size and morale of its membership The maths is simple to win a general election Labour will have to pull off a ground campaign bigger than it did in Around three quarters of its members want a fresh referendum If there is a chasm between the views of members and the strategy of the leadership on such a defining issue Labour s ground troops will be demoralised and it will lose This process will rot away at the Corbyn project pushing thousands of new members into inactivity or into the arms of Labour s old establishment 
JAN23	We’ll never see a cross-party deal on Brexit: tribalism runs too deep	Imagination agility empathy diplomacy all the qualities of an effective negotiator that Theresa May lacks She was unsuited to the task of getting a good deal in Brussels and now looks incapable of steering a bad deal through parliament But the prime minister is not without skill She has an exceptional ability to drain the drama from a crisis to eke dullness out of an emergency It is practically a superpower Only May could make a live broadcast in a drastic breaking news situation feel as missable as a daytime repeat As one former Downing Street aide tells it May has one political technique that she applies to every situation She just grinds you down  It seemed inconceivable that May would try to rehabilitate her Brexit plan after it was rejected in the biggest Commons defeat for a sitting government in modern times MPs on all sides cheered the deal s annihilation believing that the scale of the shock would jolt the prime minister into a change of course It has not May returned to parliament this week looking like an earthquake survivor unable to take in the magnitude of the devastation pottering numbly around a ruined house rehanging pictures on half collapsed walls perching ornaments on the rubble that was once a mantelpiece 
JAN23	Medical advice on the pill was wrong for 60 years. How convenient to blame the pope	Earlier this month updated guidelines from the Faculty of Sexual Reproductive Healthcare FSRH indicated that the seven day break commonly recommended in most contraceptive pill regimens has no health benefits Under the new guidelines people taking the pill are free to reduce or stop this pause allowing them to skip their monthly bleeds  Understandably these changes were widely reported by the media with most reports suggesting an unusual explanation for the original recommendation of the hormone free break Speaking to the Telegraph Professor John Guillebaud of University College London said The gynaecologist John Rock devised the break because he hoped that the pope would accept the pill and make it acceptable for Catholics to use Rock thought if it did imitate the natural cycle then the pope would accept it 
JAN23	For the EU to prosper, Britain must leave	Until recently I was a committed remainer and wedded to the belief that the best way out of this Brexit mess for the EU was simply to try to ensure it didn t happen But the events of the past month illustrate why there is rightly a growing mood in Brussels for a completely different outcome for the EU to prosper Britain must leave  The rationale is simple Brexit is either now or in the not so distant future inevitable That is because Britain continues to demand impossible conditions for its membership of the community based compromise led multinational organisation the modern EU represents Even in trying to exit Britain is still arguing about red lines of its own making This approach would only amplify if it somehow ended up remaining a member Britain already enjoys a privileged position in the EU much to the chagrin of many other member states Opt outs from the euro the Schengen agreement on passport free travel the charter of fundamental rights and on any European legislation related to freedom justice and security have all been negotiated by successive British prime ministers 
JAN23	Panic is on the agenda at Davos – but it’s too little too late	Pity the poor billionaire for today he feels a new and unsettling emotion fear The world order he once clung to is crumbling faster than the value of the pound In its place he frets will come chaos Remember this as the plutocrats gather this week high above us in the ski resort of Davos they are terrified  Whatever dog eared platitudes they may recycle for the TV cameras what grips them is the havoc far below Just look at the new report from the summit organisers that begins by asking plaintively Is the world sleepwalking into a crisis In the accompanying survey of a thousand bosses money men because finance like wealth is still mainly a male thing and other Davos decision makers nine out of say they fear a trade war or other economic confrontation between major powers Most confess to mounting anxieties about populist and nativist agendas and public anger against elites As the cause of this political earthquake they identify two shifting tectonic plates climate change and increasing polarisation of societies 
JAN24	Is there a ‘right’ way to deal with children who commit crimes?	How does an year old boy end up alone in a London police cell Eleven years old for heaven s sake That means either still in primary school or at best in the nervous beginnings of secondary Eleven still says muddy knees flapping around in a blazer several sizes too big and wanting a bedtime story or at least it does for the parents of the lucky children Life is not like that for every year old however and it is the unlucky ones who are perhaps most likely to end up in the bowels of a police station His solicitor didn t say what he was accused of doing when she posted on Twitter earlier this week that no child should be in a cell Period Her point was that a custody suite is no place for a kid that small no matter what they might have done  But the mind makes leaps anyway Children as young as nine have been found carrying knives Gangs organising so called county lines operations running drugs from the inner city deep out into rural towns have been known to recruit from primary schools 
JAN24	If Brexit Britain wants Europe to listen, it must learn to speak European	An old New Yorker cartoon shows a middle aged man at a drinks party saying to another But that s enough about you let s talk about me This is Brexit Britain talking to the rest of Europe To be sure all nations are obsessed with their own affairs A Polish joke has it that the entry for elephant in the encyclopedia reads the elephant and the Polish question But most European countries have at least some accompanying sensitivity to what is going on around them  I wonder how many people in Westminster this week even knew that the leaders of France and Germany were signing a new treaty of cooperation in Aachen that the French president Emmanuel Macron deeply shaken by the level of support for the gilets jaunes protests had launched a national debate much like the one being called for in Britain that Poland had been shaken by the senseless murder of the liberal pro European mayor of Gda sk Pawe Adamowicz in an atmosphere of partisan conflict so bitter that the nation could not even unite in the face of such tragedy Reflecting all this turmoil the whole continent is gearing up for European elections in May which will be a battle royal between two fundamentally different visions of the European future a conservative nationalist one spearheaded by the Hungarian Viktor Orb n and the Italian Matteo Salvini and a more liberal internationalist one represented by the much weakened Aachen duo of Macron and Angela Merkel Orb n and Salvini don t intend to leave the EU they intend to run it So it s not just the future of the UK that will be decided this year it s also the future of Europe 
JAN24	How the right tricked people into supporting rampant inequality	Why don t people rebel The wonder of decades of rising inequality across the west is how placidly people put up with it UK wages are still below levels and a growing sector of jobs are nasty non unionised achingly hard with workers treated worse the boot on the employer s foot despite low unemployment You might call Brexit a kind of protest but that can be overdone The vote was swung largely by comfortable older Tory voters in the shires led or misled by privileged ideologues  Those on the progressive left have been perplexed that rising social injustice hasn t led to much sign of the oppressed rising up either at the ballot box or through more physical acts of protest New research out on Wednesday suggests some explanations though these will be of precious little comfort Looking at surveys across western countries since the s Dr Jonathan Mijs of the London School of Economics International Inequalities Institute monitors how as countries become less equal attitudes of the majority shift in the wrong direction 
JAN24	What does Boris Johnson have to do to stop people giving him money?	In the comedy website Funny Or Die published a patriarchy lampooning video called hours of walking around New York City as a man The white male subject of said video walks around city streets being complimented high fived and offered everything from jobs to Starbucks gift cards By the end he is being carried around on a makeshift throne by adoring passersby dressed in a crown and sceptre while his new subjects chant King King King  Do you think that s what Boris Johnson s life is like I ask because it emerged yesterday that our former foreign secretary was given a donation by JCB before delivering a speech at the company s headquarters a speech that contained four mentions of the company was given in front of a large JCB vehicle and was plastered across the news 
JAN24	Donald Trump’s ship of fools is heading for the rocks in Venezuela	Donald Trump s implicit threat of direct US military intervention in Venezuela is a high risk gamble that could backfire calamitously By publicly and aggressively backing the opposition s bid to supplant him Trump has presented Nicol s Maduro the country s incumbent president with a very personal existential challenge  If Maduro reacts as he has in the past by using violence to suppress his opponents or if he arrests US diplomats who ignore his order to leave the country Trump may face a daunting choice between rapid escalation including possibly sending in US forces and a humiliating climbdown 
JAN24	Clooney and Prendergast: We're not silent on Sudan – we're going after the regime's loot	 Where are George Clooney and co now that Sudan needs them asked an Opinion article in the Guardian this week The oped assumed that a lack of public statements by us and others with a long association with Darfur Sudan more broadly and South Sudan meant that we were doing nothing in response to the Sudanese regime s brutal crackdown of escalating protests throughout the country  This is indeed a critical moment in Sudan s fraught history The people of Sudan are rightly leading demands for change and we believe our role is to support the cause of human rights for Sudanese people by using strategic and tactical advocacy in Europe the US and Africa focused on key points of leverage As the demonstrations have unfolded this past month our entire team has continuously engaged officials in governments around the world to take measures to hold the Bashir regime accountable Much of this advocacy is not done in public 
JAN24	He may dress up as a firefighter. But Matteo Salvini is no saviour	A few weeks ago Matteo Salvini the interior minister and leader of Italy s far right League party conducted a press conference wearing the full uniform of Italy s fire and rescue helicopter crew More recently he wore a jacket belonging to the country s mountain rescue unit another time a firefighter s uniform Images of him in a police jacket are plastered all over his Instagram account he s frequently sighted wearing this outfit at political rallies Clearly Salvini is not a policeman a firefighter or a member of Italy s mountain rescue crew  Saturating his social media feeds with pictures of him in these costumes is part of an elaborate ploy Nicknamed the captain by his supporters this wardrobe projects the vision of powerful leadership his fans crave When he started out it s worth noting Salvini resisted the more traditional outfits of political life wearing sweaters and hoodies rather than suits to such an extent that his opponents dubbed him Felpetta a twist on the Italian term for sweater felpa or even Felpetta Nera a play on the infamous Italian fascist anthem Faccetta Nera

JAN24	The Brexit nightmare is entirely the Tories' fault. Don't blame Labour	There isn t much that s funny about Brexit At least not funny ha ha But there is one aspect of it that is at least curious that this act of national foot shooting has resulted in quite so many people putting the blame for it on the two main political parties even though only one of them has been in power since  Scroll through the comments or tweets on any story about Brexit and the online rage from remainers splits evenly I ll never vote Labour again if they facilitate Brexit in any form is a fairly representative comment as is the idea that supporting Labour means Brexit catastrophe When I tweeted an observation on this I was told Both parties own this mess that there are those of us who will never vote Tory but also never vote Labour because they have enabled the whole thing and that the main parties were uncaring about voters thoughts on the EU 
JAN24	Nancy Pelosi is an alien species to Trump – and he has no idea what to do	Donald Trump might be the worst president in American history but with his incompetence belligerence and intellectual deficits come a perverse advantage it s tough to shame someone who has no shame it s hard to hold a man accountable for a lie when he doesn t care if he s a liar you can t chasten someone for breaking the rules when he never believed the rules applied to him  But while Trump has snaked and slithered his way in and out of scandal corruption and self dealing his entire life there s one force that seems to truly destabilize him a competent woman Which is why in the Trump era there s no better speaker of the House than Nancy Pelosi 
JAN25	Fight for Europe – or the wreckers will destroy it	The idea of Europe is in peril  From all sides there are criticisms insults and desertions from the cause 
JAN25	Anti-vaxxers are thriving – because we live in a fact-phobic wild west	Half of all parents have seen anti vaccination messages on social media according to a report from the Royal Society for Public Health It s not all bad news of parents still have the sense to get their children vaccinated whatever they read just as almost all Mumsnet users mainly stay in secure family units rather than moving to all female communes despite the proliferation of fake news on the site about what husbands are like  Yet of course this is serious measles upon which the anti vaxxer conspiracy so often alights requires of the population in order for the inoculation to hold This is only true of contagious diseases If the anti vaxxers concentrated on spreading nonsense about the tetanus jab they would do no harm to anyone but themselves and their own children But where would be the fun in that They have surprisingly little to say on this soil transmitted disease 
JAN25	Zimbabwe dared to hope. Then the military arrived	Like the fleeting blossom of Jacaranda trees in spring faith in the government of Zimbabwe s president Emmerson Mnangagwa has waned following another round of state violence towards unarmed citizens  A Harare woman wounded in the leg by a close range gunshot from a soldier s gun is ferried in a wheelbarrow to seek medical help Elsewhere in the capital a young footballer is killed for standing outside his home his sole crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time These days on the streets of Harare an unnatural silence and fear have displaced the wild cheers of celebration that accompanied the resignation of Robert Mugabe as president Hope has turned into mourning in cities around the country where a general strike opposing Mnangagwa s fuel price hike turned bloody At least unarmed civilians have been killed and hundreds injured in a brutal crackdown led by the military 
JAN25	Britain is doing socialism for the rich again – this time for oil and gas	The free market is a creed that stirs up near religious devotion among its believers It is in fact a con a myth a great deception Take the latest striking example according to the National Audit Office British taxpayers are expected to cough up bn for tax relief given to oil and gas corporations for the removal of North Sea wells rigs and pipelines Better start saving up because if the companies suddenly go under that bill will only increase Indeed some companies have already defaulted on the costs of decommissioning leaving you and I to pay millions of pounds  Many questions arise here While Britain s Tory government frittered away its North Sea oil wealth Norway invested the proceeds into a sovereign wealth fund which is now worth tn We could have saved up the wealth to invest in the country s future what a tragic waste It is also a damning indictment that we are splashing out on tax breaks for big oil rather than properly investing in tackling the existential crisis of climate change and in doing so creating vast numbers of jobs in renewable energy as Germany has done 
JAN25	Living with a food allergy is difficult enough without restaurants making it worse	Living a life with food allergies can feel like you re walking through a minefield It means having to call up restaurants in advance to see if it s possible to eat there and then feeling like a nuisance every time you have to grill a stumped waiter about how certain foods are prepared It means developing a habit of meticulously reading through every single ingredient list and becoming an expert at studying any allergen guide handed to you And it means checking double checking and then living with the fear that you haven t checked enough and that any oversight can in severe cases cost you your life  It is a burden people like myself have no choice but to carry we simply have to learn how to cope But it s made even harder when people fail to give us relevant information Take Leon for example whose co founder and chief executive John Vincent advised diners with severe allergies to think carefully before choosing to eat at the health conscious joint In a blogpost he wrote The idea that Leon could cause harm to one of our guests is horrifying And we would therefore ask those of you with serious allergies to consider carefully whether you choose to dine with us 
JAN25	Technology need not be the enemy in the fight for better mental health	Effective treatment for children with mental illnesses is a pressing issue so much so in fact that a huge chunk of the recent NHS long term plan was dedicated to it It s long overdue child and adolescent mental health services CAMHS are suffering from both lack of funding and under resourcing with young people subsequently forced to wait months or even years for treatment  The plan has numerous suggestions more money pumped into services for one an overhaul of crisis care early intervention But according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Nice there could be another way to combat the issue apps They re recommending that the NHS administer cognitive behavioural therapy via phones and computers therapy specifically designed to help five to eight year olds 
JAN25	Trump must not be allowed to dictate Venezuela's democratic recovery	Venezuela s Nicol s Maduro and his Russian ally Vladimir Putin are predictably claiming that the swearing in of Juan Guaid as acting president is a coup organised by Donald Trump Those of us who want a democratic and as peaceful as possible end to Maduro s dictatorship must ignore the anti American rhetoric and throw our full support behind the president of the country s national assembly  Guaid must not be allowed to fail No one within the opposition is better suited to steer Venezuela back towards democracy Following years of seeing former president Hugo Ch vez abuse the rules of democracy an increasing number of Venezuelans has lost faith in politics and the power of the vote They are understandably angry and they seem to believe that the only way out is to take the fight to the streets Guaid who cut his teeth in the protests against Ch vez has enough credibility to convince this group that a democratic transition is still possible 
JAN25	Forcing social-media influencers to be clear about #ads? Good luck with that	Izzy just wants to tell the world about her skincare regime The blond teenager has suffered with acne for years at school one bully cruelly nicknamed her Dimple Pimple She has tried so many face washes she even had prescription meds It s no wonder her story told in a series of tweets earlier this month resonated with hundreds of people and was liked on the site more than times  Thankfully there is a happy ending One random Tuesday about six months ago Izzy found a cure for her troublesome skin Coffee Creations coffee scrub

JAN26	Diana Athill’s story was remarkable, and its end serene	Diana Athill had lots of confidence She understood the social class she came from and could stand outside it looking in whenever she chose As she wrote in Stet her memoir of her years in the publishing trade she was a member of a caste one of the London dwelling university educated upper middle class English people who took over publishing towards the end of the th century from the booksellers who used to run it But she was also a white woman who had several black lovers in an age when that kind of relationship could be seen as a political statement and she despised the self consciously beautiful writing of the quintessentially caste writer Virginia Woolf To her caste standards it ought not to need saying have no right to be considered sacrosanct  Her confidence helped her to be a writer of course it stands somewhere between talent and connection in the list of useful attributes but it made her a fine editor too She was clear in her judgments and certain in her encouragement We first met in the early s when a book I was allegedly writing for her publishing firm Andr Deutsch had long passed its delivery date I took the work in no progress to the office where Diana read some of the first chapter aloud with such elegant enunciation that I was almost though not quite persuaded to carry on with the rest At that time I didn t know she d been a writer but then I read her two books of memoir Instead of a Letter and After a Funeral and was struck as many others have been by her frankness and clarity and the wonderful rhythm of her prose 
JAN26	The ‘will of the people’ on Brexit was not fixed for all time in June 2016	They have only one argument left Back in the spring of the Brexiteers were promising sunshine and riches untrammelled sovereignty and m a week all the ice cream of EU membership and none of the spinach We would head out into the world and recover our destiny as a global trading nation with more money in our pockets and independence in our hearts You don t hear much of that kind of talk these days not when Airbus warns it could pull out of the UK taking its direct and indirect jobs with it Sony relocates its European HQ from London to Amsterdam and the carmaker Bentley says baldly It s Brexit that s the killer Instead the pro leave case now boils down to one argument it may be rough We won t be able to get certain foods like bananas or tomatoes in the words of one senior Brexiteer confident our Blitz spirit will get us through the coming storm but we have to do it We have no choice It is the will of the people and that will must be done  Theresa May is the most dogged exponent of this view A remainer in she cannot bring herself to make a positive case for Brexit Instead she repeats over and over that we are compelled to leave because that is what the British people voted for Any deviation would be a betrayal We are a man taking off his socks bracing himself to walk barefoot across hot coals for no better reason than he promised he would 
JAN26	Rees-Mogg plays his queen as Brexit enters a state of emergency	Although he failed to emerge from an Airbus waving it MP Mark Francois had in his hand a piece of paper My father Reginald Francois was a D day veteran he thundered to the news cameras on Friday shortly before ripping up the aforementioned document He never submitted to bullying by any German Neither will his son  Leaving aside the somewhat bathetic description of Rommel s Atlantic Wall defences as bullying can you guess what Mark s piece of paper actually was Certification of a history doctorate He amusingly already holds an MA in war studies A letter from his future self reading simply Don t be a thermonuclear dick Mark it ends badly 
JAN26	Fake-history films like Vice and The Uncivil War are the new threat to truth	Is this the death of journalism or just of history This week sees the screening of Vice a biopic of George W Bush s vice president Dick Cheney who is presented as the evil genius behind the Iraq war torture and other misdemeanours Its maker Adam McKay makes no bones about wishing to nail the misdeeds of a man about to sail over the horizon His star Christian Bale even thanked Satan for giving me inspiration to play the role  Vice follows hard on the heels of the British dramatist James Graham s Brexit The Uncivil War for Channel That set out to reveal the truth about Brexit with Benedict Cumberbatch as Dominic Cummings the eccentric fixer behind the Vote Leave campaign Graham declared a desire to make sense of how the fault lines began to do what journalism cannot do 
JAN26	Ban school league tables. They’re not just misleading, they’re harmful	Yet another piece of academic research has been produced which shows grammar school performance in school league tables is not quite what it seems You have to wonder how many more publicly funded research projects undertaken by leading academics it will require before such findings are taken seriously  This latest research conducted by Bristol University reveals what campaigners against academic selection and grammar schools have long argued when social and economic factors are taken into consideration grammar school performance is no better than any other school It is a point also made by Stephen Gorard and Nadia Siddiqui of Durham University in their exhaustive analysis of pupil data published a few months ago The reason grammar schools do well in league tables is because they select high attaining children who perform well in public exams This fact is so obvious that any year old sitting the plus exam would get it

JAN26	London’s exploited tenants deserve proper rights – not just rent controls	When Anabel and her flatmates were told the rent in their Kentish Town houseshare was due to increase by a month all of them had to find a new place to live In the space of just a few years increases by Ghazal s landlord left her paying of her wages on her Forest Gate accommodation on a monthly rent bill that jumped from to Kenny s Clapton landlord is currently trying to up the rent from to on the three bedroom ex council flat he shares with three others just two years after a previous hike  Renters in London struggle every month to make ends meet spending the bulk of earnings to live in what s often cramped insecure and poor quality housing Our rents rise faster than our wages and we rarely get much choice over where we re able to live In Newham some of the members of our London Renters Union spend of their monthly income on housing with little left for basics like food and clothing Without big changes many of us will be stuck paying rising monthly rents until we retire 
JAN26	Zimbabwe dared to hope. Then the military arrived	Like the fleeting blossom of Jacaranda trees in spring faith in the government of Zimbabwe s president Emmerson Mnangagwa has waned following another round of state violence towards unarmed citizens  A Harare woman wounded in the leg by a close range gunshot from a soldier s gun is ferried in a wheelbarrow to seek medical help Elsewhere in the capital a young footballer is killed for standing outside his home his sole crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time These days on the streets of Harare an unnatural silence and fear have displaced the wild cheers of celebration that accompanied the resignation of Robert Mugabe as president Hope has turned into mourning in cities around the country where a general strike opposing Mnangagwa s fuel price hike turned bloody At least unarmed civilians have been killed and hundreds injured in a brutal crackdown led by the military 
JAN26	Britain is doing socialism for the rich again – this time for oil and gas	The free market is a creed that stirs up near religious devotion among its believers It is in fact a con a myth a great deception Take the latest striking example according to the National Audit Office British taxpayers are expected to cough up bn for tax relief given to oil and gas corporations for the removal of North Sea wells rigs and pipelines Better start saving up because if the companies suddenly go under that bill will only increase Indeed some companies have already defaulted on the costs of decommissioning leaving you and I to pay millions of pounds  Many questions arise here While Britain s Tory government frittered away its North Sea oil wealth Norway invested the proceeds into a sovereign wealth fund which is now worth tn We could have saved up the wealth to invest in the country s future what a tragic waste It is also a damning indictment that we are splashing out on tax breaks for big oil rather than properly investing in tackling the existential crisis of climate change and in doing so creating vast numbers of jobs in renewable energy as Germany has done 
JAN27	I believe in Tory values, but the party is becoming repellent	I have had it up to here with the Conservative party Not perhaps an unusual sentiment to find expressed in the Guardian But as a centre right columnist I do not start from the proposition that all Tories are inherently evil champions of neoliberalism whatever that means intent on maximising suffering and despair I don t express this contempt for the party blithely or to prove a point This is not an exercise in rhetoric I mean it  By way of explanation I used to edit the Spectator I am proud to chair a centre right thinktank Bright Blue I wrote a book about the Conservative led coalition And if you think that s bad I was one of the few people in the world who applauded aspects of Theresa May s manifesto that s a really select club 
JAN27	No longer recognise your country? Look beyond our toxic public life ...	When I was just starting out as a screenwriter I was asked to go to Oslo to interview the great explorer Thor Heyerdahl It was the most glamorous and thrilling thing I d ever been asked to do My daughter worried that if I was going far away on a plane I might not get back in time for her class assembly I told her not to worry Hopping on a plane to do lunch with global icons was what I did now  I might have noticed something was up the moment someone pointed out that I was in their seat I just moved up If I hadn t been feeling so entitled I might have started to worry when the surprisingly extravagant in flight meal was served I just thought I was worth it It wasn t until I finished reading my book that I noticed that the two hour flight was taking a long time And covering a lot of ocean 
JAN27	Britons don’t grasp the EU’s essential motivation – a quest for the quiet life	What does the EU want This simple question has foxed Brits throughout the Brexit talks It is alleged that Brussels is desperate to retain Britain that it yearns to get rid of it that German car makers and friendly states such as the Netherlands will force Angela Merkel to let Britain cherrypick the best of membership that Europeans want to ruin Britain sending it on its way with a punishment beating pour encourager les autres None of this contradictory speculation has turned out to be right and Britain s negotiating efforts have been the poorer for it  European mainlanders can be hard to read The Friday before last prominent Germans including Annegret Kramp Karrenbauer Angela Merkel s heir presumptive wrote a saccharine letter to the Times urging Britain to stay On Monday the Polish foreign minister broke EU ranks to suggest that the Irish backstop be limited to get Theresa May s deal over the line Yet on Wednesday Merkel seemingly contradicted her own colleagues opining fatalistically that Britain an island had always had patchy relations with the EU and suggesting that its exit is inevitable The day after an exasperated Emmanuel Macron told a crowd near Lyon that Brexit has torn British society apart and cannot be delivered his tone so critical that it moved a Spectator writer to ask why the French president hates Britain so much The motivations and instincts of our continental partners sometimes baffle us Brits 
JAN27	Corrupt Maduro has broken his country. Now, democracy must have its day	Venezuela Nicol s Maduro s dwindling band of foreign supporters like to claim is a theatre in a new cold war Donald Trump s administration and his hawkish foreign policy advisers with their occasional threats of military intervention provide the perfect props So does Jair Bolsonaro the new far right president in Brazil But the real contest in Venezuela is between democracy and dictatorship Maduro leads a corrupt authoritarian regime that has stolen and broken a once prosperous country staging a coup against its own constitution  On Saturday January a power cut at the University Hospital in Caracas caused the deaths of six patients according to a union representative It was not an isolated incident in the two months from mid November hospitals in Venezuela monitored by a local doctors group suffered power cuts lasting an average of three hours a day But the deaths at the University Hospital were a particular embarrassment to Maduro Venezuela s ruler since Highlighting his country s descent into criminal public mismanagement they happened just after he was inaugurated for a second six year term as president in a sparsely attended ceremony at the supreme court and not the national assembly as the constitution requires 
JAN27	What’s a chap to do if he can’t be beastly to the Germans?	Mark Francois has made himself into the most famous ex TA lieutenant since Gareth Keenan in The Office by insisting on tearing up a letter he happened to have on him when the BBC was trying to ask him about something else The letter came from the chief executive of a vast and successful company formed in as a government initiative between the UK France and West Germany and which employs more than skilled people in this country Its boss was pointing out that just because factories are based in the UK now that doesn t mean they will stay here if we decide to leave the largest free trade bloc on Earth  Well and good you might think Sound free market common sense with which James Dyson would smile and agree although not with the cameras running But Francois s eagle infantryman s eye had spotted a gap in the Brexit enemy s defences and a chance to become memorable live on TV You see the current CEO of Airbus isn t just a businessman pointing out economic problems He is also a square headed jackbooted scar faced sausage noshing Sieg Heiling swab Cripes Lt Francois sir we ain t gonna let the likes of im shove us around are we 
JAN27	As awards season kicks off, how can we tell who are the real good guys?	Awards season is upon us first the Golden Globes and now Oscar nominations and it has struck me just how odd it is that these Hollywood functions have come to be connected to MeToo and Time s Up Was there ever an industry so comically unsuited to driving an equality movement  Take the struggles of the Academy to catch up with the times one year in The day after it selected Bohemian Rhapsody as a nominee for best picture reviews had been scathing but it did after all feature Aids and a bisexual storyline multiple allegations of sexual assault emerged against its director Bryan Singer Singer denied the accusations but they had not come out of the blue rumours of sexual misconduct had followed him for some years 
JAN27	Brexiters never had a real exit plan. No wonder they avoided the issue	The secret history of modern Britain is made in obscure corners between men and women taken seriously by no one but themselves A good time to begin it would be in the winter of when the Institute of Economic Affairs a rightist outfit that won t reveal where its money comes from offered a prize to whoever could devise a means of leaving the European Union  The reason why politicians are now stumbling towards disaster like prisoners marching to the scaffold ought to have been clear from that moment Obviously Britain can leave the EU but only if it is willing to pay an extortionate price Yet first the institute s judges led by Nigel Lawson and Gisela Stuart then the Leave campaigns of Boris Johnson Nigel Farage and Dominic Cummings and finally Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn who even now cannot speak plainly have refused to acknowledge the harsh truth 
JAN27	The academy revolution has swept England. It has left casualties in its wake	Walk into a school and some things will strike you right away Is the atmosphere respectful and warm How do children interact with their teachers What sort of project work takes pride of place on the corridor walls  One thing that you can t immediately tell from wandering from classroom to classroom is whether the school is an academy run by a not for profit organisation independent of the local council or a maintained school under local council oversight When things are going well parents may barely notice the difference But when things are going badly it matters and that s why the extraordinary growth of academy schools has become one of the most hotly contested developments in education policy 
JAN27	Demography is not destiny. Politics should be about winning minds	Peter Kellner s crossover day has caused some commotion Last Saturday according to the veteran pollster Britain became a majority Remain nation through demographic changes alone Kellner s calculations suggested that in the period since the referendum sufficient old folk who largely voted Leave had died and enough teenagers overwhelmingly Remain had reached voting age to have wiped out the majority for Brexit  Remainers seized on Kellner s projections as ammunition for a second referendum Critics not all Leave supporters condemned them as being in the words of the Labour MP Caroline Flint unhelpful ageist and divisive Whichever view one takes the ruckus over crossover day reveals the way that political demography the study of the relationship between population changes and political attitudes has become increasingly central to public debate 
JAN27	This is no time to make political capital out of Alex Salmond’s arrest	It s impossible to overstate the sense of shock that swept across Scotland when it was revealed what charges Alex Salmond is facing after his appearance on petition at Edinburgh sheriff court last Thursday Scotland s former first minister has been charged with two counts of attempted rape and multiple counts of sexual assault He immediately said that he was innocent of any criminality whatsoever and would defend himself in court to the utmost In Holyrood a little while later Nicola Sturgeon cut a weary figure as she talked about how shocked many people would be at this news  Scotland is weeks away from being dragged out of the European Union against its overwhelmingly settled will while even the most fervently rightwing publications have stopped pretending that all will be well across the nation following a possible no deal Brexit And yet this most profoundly damaging event will be submerged in terms of importance by the long list of very serious charges that Salmond must face It s highly unlikely that this case will be heard in court before another months have elapsed 
JAN28	What I learned about Viktor Orbán on a road trip with my dad	Like many families mine has been divided by politics in recent years I am British my dad has returned to his native Hungary I work for the Guardian he has become a supporter of Hungary s nationalist prime minister Viktor Orb n It had become a festering sore He loves talking politics and resented the fact that he couldn t discuss politics with me I couldn t talk about it because I resented his politics  So we decided to go on a road trip together We d spend seven days in a car travelling across Hungary and its political spectrum to have it all out What could possibly go wrong 
JAN28	A second Brexit referendum would not benefit the EU	When the prime minister s Brexit deal received its crushing defeat in parliament European council president Donald Tusk tweeted If a deal is impossible and no one wants no deal then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is This wasn t the first time that Tusk has suggested the UK could remain in the EU After the general election Tusk discussed reversing Brexit He said The European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible and then quoted John Lennon s Imagine adding You may say I m a dreamer but I am not the only one But is the EU serious about this Have Brussels and member states really thought things through  If a new remain campaign focused on the benefits of EU membership a new vote to leave would be a definitive rejection
JAN28	Stop ‘fighting’ cancer, and start treating it like any other illness	Do you have a cancer Or are you a brave hero fighting against the demon foe Have you something in your body that needs removing or are you a heroic victim in a war you may win or lose A poll by Macmillan Cancer Support has found that many people with cancer are fed up with the language of war They want to be treated like anyone else who is ill They want to discuss their treatment with a doctor It is as simple as that  Anyone with experience of a cancer knows well the lugubrious looks you get You poor thing We are so sorry How long have they given you Be brave Be positive Fight back Don t give in and lose It suggests you lacked courage and were beaten 
JAN28	The way we eat is killing us – and the planet	The distinguished medical journal The Lancet has issued not one but two apocalyptic warnings about our food in under a month One of its special commissions reported earlier this month that civilisation itself was at risk from the effects of the current food system on both human health and the Earth s ecosystems This week comes the next instalment from another special Lancet commission which finds that pandemics of obesity and malnutrition are interacting with climate change in a feedback loop and represent an existential threat to humans and the planet The modern western diet has become a highly damaging thing that needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe It concluded that we need to halve global meat consumption and more than double the volume of whole grains pulses nuts fruit and vegetables we eat  Cue howls of indignation from big food and its cheerleaders the libertarian right Those nanny statists have gone nuts eating their own double dose of nuts Cue cries of distress from champions of local low impact agriculture who include grass fed animals and their meat and manure in their sustainable mix These self appointed experts don t understand farming Cue grim food wheels with only a quarter of a rasher of bacon or a fifth of an egg a day Those miserabilist medics want us all to go vegan 
JAN28	Women still have to use their frozen eggs in 10 years – or lose them. Why?	Fertility experts are urging the government to dump legislation that demands women who have frozen their eggs must use them within years After this time fertility clinics are obliged to destroy the eggs irrespective of what the woman they belong to wants unless she has been through the egg freezing process because her fertility is compromised which can happen for a number of reasons  The law at present dictates that any woman who has had her eggs frozen for social reasons that is not medically indicated for instance she may not have met someone she wants to have children with yet has a maximum of years in which to use them Before we even begin to unpack the implications of such restrictions though the term social in itself warrants our attention Pejorative is putting it lightly 
JAN28	Looking on the bright side of climate change, think of all the money corporations can make	You know what I love about capitalism Its optimism Even in the direst of circumstances it is always able to find a silver lining  Take climate change for example After weird weather and ominous warnings of more to come many of us are freaking out about an environmental apocalypse Indeed a new poll shows record numbers of Americans are worried about climate change and after last year s heatwave concerns about the issue have soared in Britain 
JAN28	What has happened in Venezuela is a coup. Trump’s denial is dangerous	The picture shows him in the act of swearing himself in as interim president of Venezuela His right hand raised to the heavens as is proper of one who having no popular mandate proclaims himself in the name of God like the kings of old Only this is no kingdom but a revolutionary republic born of a people s war It has since protected its right to self determination by means of people power and persistent anti colonial struggle  In the th century the struggle was led by Sim n Bol var the liberator Rebelling against the laws of the time Bolivar stood up to the might of the Spanish empire in alliance with then free Haiti Bolivar made instant enemies of slaveholders in the newly formed US and the rest of the Americas upon embracing a universal right and call to happiness without hypocrisy That promise was realised only in part 
JAN28	England can be better than the Brexit caricature. We have to make the case for it	There are two kinds of questions to be asked about Brexit One of them defines the day to day grind at Westminster and is about an urgent set of issues that encompasses everything from the most basic framework for trade to the future of Northern Ireland and which still seem all but insoluble But as all the parliamentary drama on goes on it is the other big Brexit conundrum that shows even fewer signs of resolution To use a phrase habitually deployed by the prime minister herself what kind of country do we want to be Put another way who are we  To some extent we know the answer and it is not pretty Whatever the varied motivations of many of the people who voted for it our exit from the European Union looks to outsiders like an expression of nostalgia introversion and a very unbecoming belligerence Some of the most powerful branches of government seem to be operating on much the same impulses As evidenced by the Windrush scandal and a steady stream of heartbreaking deportation stories the Home Office now seems to be institutionally sociopathic So does the Department for Work and Pensions 
JAN28	Forget the 'big society'. Austerity is to blame for this army of volunteers	At first it sounded quite lovely didn t it The notion of a big society back in those heady days when David Cameron and Nick Clegg stood side by side in the Downing Street garden In May we were still ignorant of the devastating austerity these two men would go on to inflict And so they offered us the big society from the Cabinet Office a document was proudly produced Our Conservative Liberal Democrat government has come together with a driving ambition to put more power and opportunity into people s hands reads the opening We want to give citizens communities and local government the power and information they need to come together solve the problems they face and build the Britain they want  Cut to and it s unclear how much of what was promised ever materialised Broad brush pledges such as we will train a new generation of community organisers and the radical devolution of power and greater financial autonomy to local government meant little or nothing in practice one can only assume their full review of local government finance concluded with the line just take all their money away 
JAN28	Our flawed parliamentary system has let the Tories stifle the Brexit debate	Another fine mess that s what it is Parliament is logjammed The main parties are riven Two Tory MPs Jacob Rees Mogg and Desmond Swayne have called for the prime minister to suspend parliament indefinitely because they fear the House of Commons will talk about subjects and maybe even legislate for things they don t like It s not the first time that has happened Elizabeth I tried to stop MPs talking about her marital status and Charles I governed for years without parliament but Elizabeth failed and Charles ended up on the block  Our winner takes all parliamentary system isn t fit for purpose It is failing the nation at a moment of true crisis It builds in division and prevents compromise It leads ministers to believe in their divine right to govern unimpeded because only the government gets precedence for its business only a minister can raise a tax or spend money and only a minister can determine when there will be a vote or even if there will be a vote 
JAN29	Why I won't miss Tesco's fake 'posh' deli, fish and meat counters	The news that Tesco is to shut the fresh food counters at of its UK stores was surprising in one detail it has chosen to retain the butcher s cheese and deli counters at more Why The remaining counters will surely be streamlined but in is anyone really taken in by the supermarket fresh food counter that sentimental harking back to a world of town squares and traditional retailers Does anyone browse what Morrisons calls its Market Street and feel like they are in a market or a street No  In a Financial Times article which identified fresh food as the next major supermarket battleground tell that to up to people now facing redundancy at Tesco one expert revealingly described fresh food as the biggest single determinant of the quality image of a superstore operator Key words there quality image As opposed to actual objective quality Retail magazine The Grocer this week described fresh food counters as key to customer perception but an expensive luxury which say analysts have been haemorrhaging money for years Unlike in continental hypermarkets yes even here we are diverging from Europe fresh food counters contribute microscopic amounts to turnover 
JAN29	Here in Liverpool, we know what northern austerity looks like up close	This week started with me reporting a couple of things that many in Liverpool already know that their city has been ravaged by the austerity agenda of the past nine years and that the Conservatives don t care too much about them and their lives  Most people in this city know it and most people are angry about it but this week s report into local council funding cuts by the Centre for Cities thinktank brought into sharp focus just how unfair this all is 
JAN29	The Alex Iwobi ‘gorilla’ insult shines a light on south Asian anti-black racism	 Did you know Gandhi was racist A white friend sits opposite me grinning so widely I wonder if there s going to be a punchline We know I reply we all know Her smile fades quickly and she moves on I stop listening the noise in the cafe dies down and the soundtrack to a sad Bollywood film fills the moment She thought I didn t know Why don t I talk about it more I hide the trauma of black people because Gandhi was one of the few saviours we had in our toxic community Anti blackness was a punchline I wasn t expecting  One thing I remember from studying A level sociology is the idea of how you develop through your primary and then your secondary education something that contributes greatly to social dynamics Primary education is what you learn from your family home secondary education is what is passed on to us from institutions 
JAN29	The new 100% mortgage won’t help low-income Generation Rent	If there s anything more British than talking about the weather it s obsessing about house prices This is a country where it s taboo to ask someone their salary but perfectly acceptable to ask how much their house is worth and look it up on Rightmove if they won t tell you  In recent years it s been harder to avoid talking about house prices than ever because in many places around the country they re so out of control According to the Office for National Statistics the median price paid for a home leapt by between and while earnings only rose by 
JAN29	That brand new Tory plan for Brexit? Here’s why it’s dead in the water	There is considerable excitement in the Conservative party on Tuesday morning It looks like a deal has been reached on Brexit There s just one problem that from what we can gather of the so called Malthouse compromise it stands no chance of being acceptable to the EU  There seem to be three fundamentals to the plan the extension of the implementation period to technological solutions to ensure no border infrastructure requirements on the island of Ireland and an interim free trade agreement to be tabled immediately This has been termed a triple lock 
JAN29	Nick Clegg squirms as Facebook apologist-in-chief. Sound familiar?	Once upon a time there was a Tumblr account called Nick Clegg Looking Sad which consisted almost entirely of pictures of the then deputy prime minister looking miserable  It doesn t seem to have been updated since the general election presumably because that represented peak misery but I was reminded of it on Tuesday when Clegg made his first outing as spin doctor for Facebook He had been given some happy news to impart including the creation of a centre for electoral integrity to try to fight political disinformation campaigns aimed at skewing elections But the pained expression crept in when confronted on TV with examples of the kind of graphic Instagram posts that year old Molly Russell s bereaved parents believe had a bearing on their daughter s suicide and asked whether he would want his own children to see them There is something horribly familiar about the sight of Clegg publicly squirming over the consequences of things he doesn t quite have the power to stop as if the coalition years were happening all over again in slow motion 
JAN29	Don't know your James Charles from Zoella? Get with YouTube celebrity culture	There is a particular breed of middle aged man that prides itself on not knowing who Kim Kardashian is What s that they cry in comment sections throughout the land What s a Kim Kardashian This performative I m too busy with books to even turn on the TV intelligence usually backfires immediately you re telling me you ve read books but can t discern that Kimberly is a woman s name  Pretending not to know who celebrities are to seem clever is likely an age old phenomenon Spartacus Never heard of him but thankfully you no longer have to pretend After makeup artist and YouTuber James Charles brought Birmingham to a standstill on Sunday with traffic gridlocked as thousands of teenage fans flocked to see the year old at a shopping centre many people are realising that they actually genuinely haven t the foggiest who s celebrities are 
JAN29	Bill Gates says poverty is decreasing. He couldn’t be more wrong	Last week as world leaders and business elites arrived in Davos for the World Economic Forum Bill Gates tweeted an infographic to his million followers showing that the world has been getting better and better This is one of my favourite infographics he wrote A lot of people underestimate just how much life has improved over the past two centuries  Of the six graphs developed by Max Roser of Our World in Data the first has attracted the most attention by far It shows that the proportion of people living in poverty has declined from in to only today The claim is simple and compelling And it s not just Gates who s grabbed on to it These figures have been trotted out in the past year by everyone from Steven Pinker to Nick Kristof and much of the rest of the Davos set to argue that the global extension of free market capitalism has been great for everyone Pinker and Gates have gone even further saying we shouldn t complain about rising inequality when the very forces that deliver such immense wealth to the richest are also eradicating poverty before our very eyes 
JAN29	Labour councils and activists are at war. But it won’t stop austerity	Just because we stopped talking about austerity doesn t mean it went away The Centre for Cities published research this week on nearly a decade of Conservative fiscal tightening councils have now lost p in every pound of funding they got from central government under Labour Barnsley has suffered the greatest percentage cut in day to day spending on services at Liverpool has had the deepest annual cuts per head at Three of the top five cities affected are in Yorkshire there is a clear skew towards the north  A new funding formula explicitly redirects funds away from inner cities and towards the shires This is far from new news Simon Duffy from the Centre for Welfare Reform published an astonishing report in that detailed the cumulative effects of cuts to local authorities and to benefits To be reliant on both local authority services and welfare over this period has meant suffering hardships that simply would not have been approved by any voter had the consequences been spelled out in a manifesto So the effect on local democracy sounds abstract set against more concrete catastrophes such as that in adult social care Yet there are lessons here some harsh ones if we re ever going to get to the business of political renewal 
JAN29	Britannia rules the waves? After Brexit, it’ll be floundering	Never underestimate the Brexit romance the tug for an island nation set in a silver sea unconquered for centuries proud of its insularity The idea of the sea wrenches at British heartstrings you can hear it when you listen to the language of the Brexit groundswell Normandy landings D day pluck empire sailors leave voters use this imagery however far from the shore  Brexit leaders rub in that seafaring imagery but here s the paradox these buccaneers promoting free markets on the high seas are the same deregulators who have helped destroy British shipping 
JAN30	If Corbyn gets his hands dirty he can avert a hard Brexit	In spite of the upbeat signals that came from Jeremy Corbyn s meeting with Theresa May on Wednesday experience suggests that it will not prove a turning point on Brexit Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator These gifts are not part of their skill sets Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign Corbyn s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo s Inspector Javert look like a libertine May s default mode towards Corbyn on show again at question time this week is to give him her full Lady Disdain  What is more even if the two leaders wanted to patch something together their respective Brexit positions do not allow for much common ground anyway May s red lines on leaving the single market and the customs union ending free movement and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court are mostly mirror images of Corbyn s He wants a close relationship with the EU market and on customs and supports his own version of free movement The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen preferably under a Conservative government 
JAN30	Labour can’t be held responsible for the Brexit fiasco	This week s parliamentary votes on Brexit should mark the death of a delusion This may seem an odd argument parliament has just voted for an amendment demanding an alternative to the backstop which has been repeatedly ruled out by the EU Tory MPs voted for what they know is impossible David Lidington the prime minister s number two who three weeks ago denounced fantasies about magical alternative deals voted for what he knows is impossible Theresa May who has repeatedly declared that no alternative to her deal exists and then ludicrously whipped her MPs to vote against that deal voted for what she knows is impossible The DUP which at least has the excuse of being stranded in the th century voted for what it knows is impossible The Tory party is subjecting the country to a pantomime acting out a script it knows bears no relation to reality and is prolonging Britain s turmoil and our international humiliation all for the sake of its own partisan interests  No the delusion that died last night was the idea that Labour has any meaningful say over the substance of Brexit at all Labour put forward an amendment to strike out no deal and to provide the option of a second referendum It backed Yvette Cooper s amendment to extend article by a mere three months and Dominic Grieve s amendment to allow consultative votes on alternatives to May s Brexit plan All three of the amendments were voted down in parliament The reason for this is that the Tories have a parliamentary majority courtesy of the DUP and Tory MPs wherever they stand on the Brexit divide prioritise stopping a party split over the nation s interests Along with their ideological obsession with austerity this is the proximate cause of Britain s crisis This should be a statement of the obvious but sometimes to state the obvious is a revolutionary act 
JAN30	Outsourcing education to Clarks shoes: only a Tory could think of that	Parents we ve all been there a high street shoe shop in early September Everyone with a school aged child has simultaneously realised that if they don t get around to buying shoes today the kids are going to have to start the year wearing flip flops or wellies The queue is out of the door heaps of small black lace ups litter the aisles Babies are wailing Somebody s toddler has got a foot stuck in the measuring machine It s too hot in the store and there s a heady scent of sweat and wee Your own children are desperate to leave because you rashly bribed them to come here with the promise of a trip to the Lego shop and a doughnut  How you might wonder could this annual ritual get any more hellish As ever the government is one step ahead
JAN30	Labour’s immigration U-turn is a wake-up call for Corbyn supporters	We re here then The point at which a Labour leadership that won support for being different ends up being the same The stage that jaded observers warned was an inevitability of politics no matter who was in charge The day that a political project with impeccably pro migration credentials triangulated into abstention on a miserable destructive Conservative immigration bill  OK so it didn t fully triangulate in the end Let s start at the beginning On Monday the government s immigration bill their flagship legislation for what the country s immigration policy would be after Brexit was due a second reading The Labour party announced in the afternoon that it would be abstaining in other words not voting it down Within hours after an excoriating backlash from Labour MPs and Jeremy Corbyn s supporters alike the party shifted from abstention to a one line whip and the government bill passed with Labour MPs absent This bill among other things ends freedom of movement and strips million EU citizens of their rights in the UK while threatening them with the hostile environment that others are already cruelly subjected to It also cavalierly hands immigration powers to ministers and puts a salary threshold on skilled worker visas for EU citizens making it unattainable for skilled workers in key areas such as the NHS social care and beyond In this context Labour s approach to this bad bill really is staggering 
JAN30	As schools are forced to be academies, the will of the people means nothing	Saturday morning and Stevenage appears to be bracing itself for a riot Police cars block off road after road Sirens scythe the air Officers hurry about in hi vis And at the eye of this storm is not some motley crew of furious insurgents but hundreds of children and mums and dads marching last weekend to save the school they love   We are a small town and we aren t used to staging demonstrations says councillor Josh Bennett Lovell which explains both the law and order overkill and the bright eyed kids enjoying all the excitement of a big day out Only when the marchers hit the town square does the carnival spirit give way to speeches highlighting the seriousness of their situation 
JAN30	It’s not just Meghan and Kate – all women need social media protection	Being a royal secures unfathomable perks Whether it s getting a m home refurbishment gifted by the taxpayer ownership of all the swans or a lifetime of inherited privilege for you and your descendants royal status shields the bestowed from life s mundane troubles But even a five metre Givenchy wedding veil couldn t save Meghan Duchess of Sussex from misogynoir and a barrage of trolling  This week Kensington Palace had to reach out for help from Twitter and Instagram as staff members were spending hours each week reporting sexist and racist comments and threats aimed at Meghan and Kate Duchess of Cambridge The diatribe is so dire that Hello magazine has started a campaign HelloToKindness 
JAN30	Rat-infested prison cells are one difference between punishment and cruelty	The news that a year old pensioner serving a short sentence in Wormwood Scrubs prison developed symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder when he was locked in a rat infested cell for hours a day will not have come as a surprise to prisons chief inspector Peter Clarke Only last week Clarke s report on HMP Bedford revealed that a prisoner was catching and killing rats in his cell even as that prison was being inspected  The Scrubs pensioner is now suing the prison service for the vivid and terrifying nightmares anxiety attacks and depression he has suffered since the experience The saddest part of his story is that he says when he complained to prison officers about the rats he was told This isn t a hotel you know You re here to be punished Is that really the answer he deserved 
JAN30	Worse than plastic waste: the burning tyres choking India	What we see is not the economy What we see is the tiny fragment of economic life we are supposed to see the products and services we buy The rest the mines plantations factories and dumps required to deliver and remove them are kept as far from our minds as possible Given the scale of global extraction and waste disposal it is a remarkable feat of perception management  The recent enthusiasm for plastic porn footage of the disgusting waste pouring into the sea is a rare reminder that we are still living in a material world But it has had no meaningful effect on government policy When China banned imports of plastic waste a year ago you might have hoped that the UK government would invest heavily in waste reduction and domestic recycling Instead it has sought new outlets for our filth Among the lucky recipients are Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam none of which have adequate disposal systems as I write our plastic is doubtless flooding into their seas There s a term for this practice waste colonialism 
JAN30	Britain criminalising young BME people could spark a new crisis on the streets	The latest figures to emerge showing racial inequality are sadly as unsurprising as they are shocking Reading that more than half of the people locked in young offender institutions in England and Wales belong to an ethnic minority should be a cause for national alarm Somehow things are actually worse than in when the Lammy review put the figure at But we have become so desensitised to institutional racism that the nation is numb to the reality We are sleepwalking into the next crisis on the streets for a generation of black and brown young people  The criminal injustice system is offered as a solution to a problem that it is one of the principal forces in creating
JAN30	It shouldn’t take Pink Floyd to rescue Isis fighters’ abandoned children	 Pink Floyd rescues Trinidadian boys born to Isis dad it reads like a headline from US satirical outlet the Onion But the information is real and the issue it highlights is no laughing matter  On January Roger Waters co founder of the British rock band Pink Floyd helped rescue two young brothers from a camp in Syria that was holding wives and children of foreign Islamic State members Mahmud Ferreira and his brother Ayyub have been reunited with their mother and are poised to return to their native Trinidad The boys were taken to Syria by their father reportedly now dead in A few years later they were found abandoned on a roadside and put in the camp run by the Kurdish Arab forces controlling northeast Syria 
JAN31	‘Stress interviews’: another way to make millennials’ lives hell	It sounds like the job interview from hell Olivia Bland ended up crying at the bus stop after what the year old describes as being deliberately torn to shreds over everything from her writing skills to her posture apparently even my arms were wrong and the way I sat was wrong Tech company boss Craig Dean the man on the other side of the desk ended up posting what he called a sleep deprived and anxiety driven apology on Twitter after her account of it all went viral  Tell me your gender age and political leanings and I can probably guess with reasonable certainty whether your sympathies lie with her or with him But if nothing else the rejection email she sent explaining where Web Applications UK could stick the job it eventually offered her certainly demonstrates the timely concise and effective communications skills stipulated in the job description 
JAN31	An Android-only app for EU citizens' residency – finally, my time to shine!	Years of struggle have come to an end finally after a decade of taunting my people s time has come It has not been easy being mocked for the apps we inexplicably cannot get and the Instagram pictures we post that look like they were taken by a drunk child but now Android users have the upper hand  Maybe I should take the comical incompetency of the Home Office more seriously It is after all somewhat bonkers that EU citizens in the UK of which I am one are only able to apply for residency on one type of smartphone but if Brexit Britain has taught me anything it is to look for the silver linings 
JAN31	Lazy homophobia signals the end of the road for Clarkson and co	It s been a while since Jeremy Clarkson caused an upset The days of him punching a producer prompting his ejection from the BBC or straining diplomatic relations in Argentina seem so long ago it s enough to make one nostalgic But order has been restored with a fresh storm about homophobic remarks aired during the new series of The Grand Tour highlighted on Twitter by the singer Will Young   Enough is enough said Young I m pissed and fed up I want Amazon Prime and the producers of Grand Tour to meet young LGBT people who want to kill themselves because of shaming and laughter and normalising of shaming homophobic narratives 
JAN31	The backstop isn’t just about trade. Is that so hard to understand, Britain?	One of my earliest childhood memories is of a circling red light motioning cars to stop near the border silencing all who encountered its fiery glare That red light filled my young heart with fear I didn t know if the gloved hand holding the torch was that of the RUC the British army the IRA or the UVF  I grew up during the Troubles in the shadow of Cloghogue one of the largest British army bases in Northern Ireland Having to make detours to avoid customs and security checks along bomb alley an atrocity laden eight mile stretch of road between Newry and Dundalk was as frightening as it was familiar 
JAN31	The World Bank and IMF are in crisis. It's time to push a radical new vision	The president of the World Bank Jim Yong Kim will step down on February three and a half years before the end of his term in search of greener pastures His readiness to resign from the leadership of one the two most powerful international financial institutions is a worrying omen But it is also an important wake up call  The World Bank and the IMF are the last remaining columns of the Bretton Woods edifice under which capitalism experienced its golden age in the s and s While that system and the fixed exchange rate regime it relied upon bit the dust in the two institutions continued to support global finance along purely Atlanticist lines with Europe s establishment choosing the IMF s managing director and the United States selecting the head of the World Bank 
JAN31	If the police step up stop-and-search tactics, trouble will follow	Last month it emerged that there had been a rise in police use of stop and search powers And according to a recent Guardian report there is evidence that black people are being disproportionately targeted This is profoundly depressing There are real grounds for concern that once again use of this policing strategy is storing up trouble  Our new report Beyond Contagion published today supports the view that stop and search can have unintended but significant social and psychological consequences We examined patterns of data in the riots in particular how these events arose and spread The significance of the riots is indisputable this was the largest wave of disorder in the UK since the s and involved an estimated people with more than arrests It is important to understand the underlying causes 
JAN31	Supermarkets say Brexit could empty shelves. That's a risk they chose to run	 The shops will be empty and the lights will go out are the staple warnings of commercial interests that have an axe to grind or are looking for public support But the letter this week from store bosses sounding an alert about the impact of a no deal Brexithas added irony when delivered by some of Britain s biggest supermarket retailers whose centralised business model has done much to hollow out the economy making it so vulnerable in the first place  The companies focus on the threat of disruption to food supplies We ve been here before and recently While shambolic Brexit negotiations continue and place more stress on the system a whole range of other dynamics in recent years has left our food system more frail and at risk 
JAN31	If Corbyn gets his hands dirty he can avert a hard Brexit	In spite of the upbeat signals that came from Jeremy Corbyn s meeting with Theresa May on Wednesday experience suggests that it will not prove a turning point on Brexit Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator These gifts are not part of their skill sets Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign Corbyn s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo s Inspector Javert look like a libertine May s default mode towards Corbyn on show again at question time this week is to give him her full Lady Disdain  What is more even if the two leaders wanted to patch something together their respective Brexit positions do not allow for much common ground anyway May s red lines on leaving the single market and the customs union ending free movement and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court are mostly mirror images of Corbyn s He wants a close relationship with the EU market and on customs and supports his own version of free movement The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen preferably under a Conservative government 
JAN31	The UK isn’t ready to Brexit. Instead it’s heading towards a no-deal tsunami	Shellshocked MPs of the sensible tendency are now seriously alarmed You find them in a daze around Westminster and its news studio green rooms stunned by Tuesday night s failure of the modest Cooper amendment to prevent a no deal crash out  Each day the news gets worse not forecasts but actuality Today it s the UK motor manufacturers reporting a drop in investment last year and Barclays whisking bn of assets off to Dublin joining a torrential outflow including Jacob Rees Mogg s own investment company 
JAN31	Like Anne Hathaway, I ditched alcohol so I could be a better parent	As a child I used to lie to my mother about when parents evening at school was Not because I had been underachieving but because I was scared she would turn up drunk staggering around and slurring again  My childhood was mostly spent caring for myself and my mother as she took to her bed wailing with bottles of vodka She went in and out of hospital eventually ending up in a care home in her early s after years of absolute darkness and chaos having wrecked her mind and body 
FEB1	May’s bribe won’t stop Brexit inflicting more pain on Labour's heartlands	It took years but now perhaps comes the final act of the miners strike that tore Britain apart for one long bitter year in the mid s Decades later the second woman prime minister is promising balm to heal the wounds inflicted by the first as Theresa May offers bundles of cash to areas of the country punched hard by Margaret Thatcher s war on the pits  Of course that s not how it s being presented It s true too that not every Labour leave voting area now being pledged transformative investment was once marked by pitheads Even so a map of the Labour heartlands that voted to leave the European Union in does match up remarkably closely with the old coalfields It would be easy to cast May s proposed multibillion fund as an act of atonement for the damage the Tories did by crushing the miners closing the pits and leaving many of those towns and villages to rot 
FEB1	How uplifting to hear David Bowie’s ‘girl with the mousy hair’ tell her story	How lovely to hear from Hermione Farthingale the girl with the mousy hair and muse of David Bowie for his song Life on Mars Finally we ll be able to get closure on those questions that have baffled us for the best part of half a century Why was her mother yelling no Why did her father tell her to go And why didn t she consider some sort of colouring product to brighten up her hair  In fact none of these questions is satisfactorily answered in the interview Farthingale gives for the forthcoming BBC film David Bowie Finding Fame We learn though that after they fell in love in He looked ridiculously young he looked about eight they formed a band called Feathers The following year the dancer and actor ditched him to make a film called Song of Norway 
FEB1	There’s something new on offer at these Nigerian elections – hope	Who would want to be president of Nigeria Well once upon a time me When I was I set out my manifesto on the BBC Africa website Some of my campaign promises included quality education constant electricity and running water for all I planned to use my honest smile as my most efficient tool to win votes and secure the presidency  By I d set my sights a little lower After some research I discovered that local government was the most effective place to implement real change So I decided that by I was going to be a local government chair in Lagos my home state I would be in charge of primary education waste management and primary healthcare for over a million people Two years from my deadline I am still ensconced in the suburbs of London with not a campaign flyer in sight 
FEB1	So, poorer Brexiters voted to be worse off? There’s nothing wrong in that	In Uncle Tom s Cabin there is a moment when Augustine St Clare who owns Tom suggests that he is better off as a slave than he would be as a free man No insists Tom Why Tom asks St Clare You couldn t possibly have earned by your work such clothes and such living as I have given you Know s all that Mas r says Tom But I d rather have poor clothes poor house poor everything and have em mine than have the best and have em any man else s  It has long been a challenge particularly for those who are comfortable to understand why anybody who is struggling would choose to be worse off Liberals can take it particularly personally when those who would most benefit materially from a change in policy or circumstance opt to reject it The assumption is that they must be misinformed ill informed uninformed stupid naive or cruelly misled 
FEB1	These Tories won’t fix the rough sleeping crisis, no matter what they say	The latest official figures for homelessness show that in England outside cities the number of people sleeping rough on any one night is down But this is where the good news ends Rough sleeping has increased by since with rises of as much as in major cities compared with last year The homeless charity Crisis s own research estimates that more than people sleep rough on any given night Meanwhile deaths of homeless people have more than doubled in the past five years  Most people agree that rough sleeping shouldn t exist in a healthy society especially not in the sixth richest economy in the world But it doesn t appear out of nowhere it s the product of political decisions So why is it being allowed to continue 
FEB1	Work isn’t working – but a four-day week would help fix it	Our current political moment is defined by a state of paralysis By refusing to face the reality of a broken economic model reactionary forces are driving us towards a future based on exclusion continued deregulation and the scrapping of workers rights Instead of conceding to this inevitable race to the bottom progressive forces of all kinds need to meet the crises of the st century head on by putting forward proposals that tangibly improve people s lives  As Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has demonstrated in the US with the green new deal fresh proposals can change political and economic narratives so as to embrace collective opportunity potentially avert catastrophe and move us towards sustainable futures What will make up our new deal here in the UK A new report by Autonomy a thinktank of which I am co director argues that a shorter working week should be a central pillar of our economic future 
FEB1	Theresa May is trying to bribe the people of Redcar. She can forget it	For nearly a decade my constituents have been told to put up with austerity in the name of the national interest We were told the nation was broke so grandmothers had to be forced out of their family homes by the bedroom tax council workers had to lose their jobs crimes had to go unsolved disabled people had to lose financial support NHS walk in centres had to close wages had to flatline with workers reliant on Redcar s new food banks and our steelworks had to close with no government bailout These measures alone are enough to make us angry and resentful particularly while other areas seemed to prosper and government investment continued to flow elsewhere  Yet we learned yesterday that there is after all money magically available for a programme of national renewal for areas like mine on the condition I vote for Theresa May s Brexit deal It s amazing how much money which should have been distributed on the basis of need and fairness can suddenly be found to bribe MPs to vote for a deal that was dismissed by the largest parliamentary margin in history 
FEB1	The polar vortex has turned New Yorkers into Brits for one week only	Once the basics are covered and one s face is set against the storm there is nothing like a good weather event to excite bipartisan unity For a British person in the US the advent of the polar vortex this week has been an embarrassment of riches the like of which we haven t seen since first encountering the term thundersnow It was C with wind chill in New York this week and in a household in which my children persistently refuse to put on their coats the weather finally won on the school run we all went the full Shackleton  I m aware you have to squint slightly to make this experience a fully detribalised issue The crashing temperatures including a contender for the lowest ever on record in Chicago are linked to Arctic air being pushed south by disruptions to the jet stream that experts say is caused by global warming And enjoying both the frisson of cold air and repeated opportunity to use the word vortex relies on the luxury of minimal exposure 
FEB2	Forget philanthropy. The super-rich should be paying proper taxes	A half lie dominates modern culture that is worse than a straight lie because it contains enough truth to persuade readers who otherwise wouldn t be fooled The people from somewhere have risen up against the people from nowhere it runs The globalised elites once as comfortable in Manhattan as Davos have been humbled by the left behind working class  The half of the lie that s true is that Brexit Trump and the rise of the European radical right are shocks to the system Yet they are shocks that leave the holders of wealth and power remarkably unruffled 
FEB2	‘Bullshit’, not lies, is the corrosive influence blighting our public life	 Bullshit the philosopher Harry Frankfurt observed in a seminal essay on the subject is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about He wrote that in but he might have been watching recent episodes of This Week BBC s late night politics show presided over by Andrew Neil Over the past two weeks it s thrown up two car crash interviews that serve as textbook illustrations of Frankfurt s thesis  First we had the rightwing writer James Delingpole waxing lyrical about a no deal Brexit If ever there were a case of someone talking without knowing what he is talking about this was it The simplest of questions reduced Delingpole who clearly is as familiar with economics as Theresa May is with dancing to incoherently mumbling I don t know the answer Michel Barnier could probably have made a better fist of arguing for Brexit 
FEB2	Using the big freeze to deny climate change... stupidity or cynicism?	The winters of the early s were very cold and snowy in the northeastern United States where I grew up as elsewhere around the US and Europe I remember snowfalls that came up to my chin though of course I was only a few feet tall back then We now call those old fashioned winters precisely because they have grown so rare as a consequence of yes global warming  If you re younger than I am I became a demi centenarian three years ago those winters are likely to be outside the range of your experience And so it may seem plausible to you that cold snaps that in reality simply reflect the sort of weather that was commonplace just decades ago might constitute record or unprecedented cold 
FEB2	Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: their secret for a happy marriage? Separate TVs	At a party last week I was told that my viewing habits are not in keeping with those of my peer group I was talking about watching programmes when they are on according to the TV guide using an actual television which sits in the corner of my living room and my friends seemed confused by this  I started to wonder if I was doing it wrong I had a sudden realisation that perhaps with this cold snap and self imposed January puritanism and all the rest of it I might have been watching more than normal a fact confirmed when I started to reel off the afternoon s quiz shows in scheduled order Tipping Point first 
FEB2	North to south, the seeds of division in Brexit Britain were sown long ago	The Australian writer and academic Donald Horne is best remembered in Britain for his vivid summation of one of its largest divisions that between the north and the south Writing in Horne decided that the Britain of what he called the northern metaphor was pragmatic empirical calculating Puritan bourgeois enterprising adventurous scientific serious and believes in struggle while in the southern metaphor the same country was romantic illogical muddled divinely lucky Anglican aristocratic traditional frivolous and believes in order and tradition The north s great sin was a ruthless avarice rationalised in the belief that humanity s prime impulse was a calculating economic self interest the south matched it with a ruthless pride that believed men are born to serve  Horne included Scotland with northern England as the north and if he d thought about it he might well have included Wales too because what he considered to be northern qualities had matured in the places most affected by the industrial revolution But it was not as though Horne believed these attitudes were strictly defined by geography as though the traveller left the village ponds of Sussex in fuzzy Technicolor and arrived at Manchester s mills in stark black and white 
FEB2	Brexit Britain is now the only argument on Earth for rising sea levels	So many people have been branded traitors in the past year of Brexit that many of us now have traitor fatigue But everyone should salute Ukip leader Gerard Batten for totally revitalising the genre this week by calling the Queen a traitor Gerard a sort of radicalised Just For Men box wrote to Her Majesty to ask her to prorogue parliament to save Brexit He also took the opportunity to inform Queen Elizabeth II that she had committed treason when she signed the Maastricht treaty   To presume to convey rights on or to impose duties on Your Majesty was and remains unlawful and treasonous under the bill of rights and the coronation oath wrote the Ukip leader whose treatment for low budget legal drama Better Call Gerard is thought not to have tempted the networks Your Majesty s ministers were gravely in error and wrongly advised you

FEB3	An orderly Brexit depends on a united Tory party. So start stockpiling now	Let us take a stroll down the shabby corridors of Conservative history it is June and the party leadership vacated by John Major after New Labour s landslide is being contested in the second round of the race by William Hague John Redwood and Kenneth Clarke  In a desperate bid to see off Hague the arch Europhile Clarke and the arch Eurosceptic Redwood form a pact founded on the principle that Europe will be an open issue in the party and that Tory MPs will not be bound by a strict party policy There is much talk of a historic breakthrough an end to the long Conservative civil war over Britain s relationship with the EU and a new era of internal party unity But even those responsible for this brief alliance know it is nonsense on stilts In his memoirs Clarke jovially describes it as a last desperate idea quickly condemned by MPs on both sides of the divide as a Nazi Soviet agreement 
FEB3	Roma is a cinematic triumph. Can it teach Trump’s America the value of compassion?	Staying in Santiago Chile at the moment I see echoes and reflections of Cleo the servant at the heart of Alfonso Cuar n s wondrous film Roma everywhere Cuar n s consummate recreation of his Mexico City childhood in the early s has garnered Oscar nominations and is a favourite for the top prizes later this month including best picture best actress for Yalitza Aparicio who plays Cleo and best director for Cuar n  I see Cleo in the maids who trudge to work at seven in the morning after two hours of gruelling travel from the outskirts of the city They hurry along so they can make a hot breakfast for their employers I see Cleo in the caretaker who spends night after night sitting with an octogenarian friend who is dying of cancer I see Cleo in the women who sweep the floors of a nearby hospital and those who serve the food at a cafeteria in the civil registry office I see her in the female workers who water the municipal gardens in the morning and pick up the trash in the afternoons 
FEB3	I did Veganuary, and now I’m staying vegan. Here’s what I’ve learned so far	We know the world is eating too much meat and we know that we as individuals have to do something about it So I was one of the record people who signed up to Veganuary this year  I haven t actually eaten meat for years although I occasionally ate fish and felt bad about it Two years ago I visited a modern British dairy farm where the cows were kept in very clean conditions indoors all year round I hated it So I switched to oat milk and last year gave up eating cheese But there s still plenty of animal products in cakes and biscuits And so until January I wasn t vegan 
FEB3	Leave Brigitte Macron alone. We French need to lay off our first ladies	It s almost a ritual In France it takes only a few months after the election of a new president for essays pamphlets picture albums novels even about the great man s political ideas but also his true or hidden personal story to start flooding bookshops More surprisingly and perhaps more revealingly France s first ladies get a similar treatment  Although Emmanuel Macron has been in power for only months his wife Brigitte has already been the subject of five books In January Brigitte Macron L affranchie came out followed four months later by Brigitte Macron La confidente We were also treated to Les Macron and Lettre Ouverte Brigitte Macron a plea for assisted dying by an author hoping she would pass the message on to her other half so he d make it legal 
FEB3	One day, a second people’s vote will bring us back into the EU. But when?	I marched for a people s vote I co wrote a book making the case for one a case that included a massive programme of reform I have argued for it in many public meetings Britain can and must be a member of this club of like minded European states at the global standard setting centre of the world s largest free trading network It transcends the World Trade Organization in importance and reach confirmed on Friday by the Japan EU trade deal  For the EU is the enabler of prosperity and guarantor of peace in Europe It is the friend of every principal economic interest group from farmers to magic circle law firms from university lecturers to trade unionists The British are culturally and philosophically Europeans even though too many still believe in the myth of our Dunkirk spirit exceptionalism 
FEB3	The Tories should heed Oliver Letwin. They won’t be forgiven a no-deal Brexit	One of the better because more honest speeches delivered during parliament s most recent Brexit debate came from Oliver Letwin While other Tories carried on fantasising and wrangling about what they would or would not permit Sir Oliver confessed that he was past caring what deal we have and would support whatever Mrs May comes up with next He would do so the former cabinet minister explained because if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal and the consequences are bad my party will not be forgiven for many years  Were I a Tory I d pay attention to that warning Sir Oliver speaks with experience of what follows when politicians wilfully inflict abominations on their voters He was one of the architects of the poll tax in the s Some readers may need reminding that this reckless experiment in changing local taxation without thinking through the consequences led to rioting in Trafalgar Square and the defenestration of Margaret Thatcher at the hands of her own party 
FEB3	We’re fixated by giving things up. After Dry January, I’m saying yes to indulgence	The dryness of January ended with overnight snowfall and according to the app on my phone the saving of units of alcohol and calories The calendar shows I managed drink free days One night is accounted for by a birthday party at which I drank three glasses of champagne and the hostess s daughter surprisingly burst out of a cake The night before having an early evening meal in an Italian restaurant I became so exasperated by the boredom the sheer even keel of my days their monotonous sameness of my mood that I ordered an Aperol spritz and felt that familiar surge of temporary joy and satisfaction that I associate with the varied world of cocktails  I ve never given anything up for Lent I ve never even managed hours of Yom Kippur fasting I m new to this world I didn t think there was a problem with my drinking I assumed I was a moderate drinker one or two units three or four times a week less if I m not going out more if I m on holiday when a glass of chilly white wine is the boundary between swimming pool and dinner table I don t go to pubs I almost never drink at lunchtime I don t go on benders It s many years since I had a hangover and it would never have occurred to me to give up alcohol were it not for the relentless nagging of the Dry January campaign promising me undreamed of benefits better sleep more money more energy weight loss and this was a new whammy lowering one s risk of cancer

FEB4	North-east England will pay the price for decades of dishonesty about Nissan	The sprawling site near Sunderland of the giant Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is a fine tuned product of Britain s participation in the European Union The company s decision to pull the making of its proposed new X Trail model out of that plant is a disastrous consequence of the failure to explain this to the British people  The virtual absence of public explanation about the benefits of EU membership was exploited in the referendum by the leave campaign and enabled its proponents to dismiss well informed warnings then and now as scaremongering Even on Sunday when Nissan itself explained that Brexit uncertainty was a factor in its decision to build the new SUV in Japan airtime was still given to Brexit campaigners denying this Prominent among them predictably was Jacob Rees Mogg a backbench Conservative MP with no discernible car industry expertise or experience whose Somerset constituency could hardly be further away from the north east 
FEB4	Nick Clegg betrayed the public – and now he’s failing upwards at Facebook	No amount of Auto Tuned apologies will make me forgive Nick Clegg Ever since he shone in televised electoral debates by remembering audience members names this trick is used by every snake oil salesman on the planet I do not want earnest young men in Currys or on my doorstep calling me Susan And this is but one of his legacies Nick I could a been a contender Clegg actually was a contender This is mind warping He was as my youngest said like prime minister or something He was in fact deputy prime minister and we are meant to be grateful to him for curbing the worst excesses of the Tories  No one is though In spite of fine speeches about liberal values no one cares about Nick s views now do they He betrayed the public and his core vote in student towns on tuition fees The Liberal Democrat compromise on proportional representation meant that a crucial argument on electoral reform was never made Under his leadership the Lib Dems went from a party of MPs to eight Clegg had been told that to act as a power in a coalition government he would need to deliver specifically in certain ministries Instead he insisted on a Lib Dem presence across the board It failed 
FEB4	Stop the new deportation flights to Jamaica. They shouldn’t be happening	Given the justified outrage there was when the Windrush scandal was exposed many Britons may be surprised to know that the government is planning a secret flight to forcibly remove more than people to Jamaica on Wednesday The last flight took place in Then more than people were each shackled and cuffed to two security guards throughout the entire journey Although for years I and other campaigners have been campaigning against such deportations and other aspects of the government s hostile environment it was the reporting on cases that became known as the Windrush scandal that finally drew attention to the gross injustices faced by many of that generation  In light of the scandal a planned charter flight to Jamaica last spring was cancelled Charter flights to Jamaica but not other countries were suspended Until now 
FEB4	Trump set a low bar for other deluded billionaires flirting with a 2020 run	Donald Trump has set a low bar for other billionaires who are contemplating a run for the White House  Why not me they ponder Trump had no experience in government before he won the Republican nomination He was just a popular TV reality star who branded his name on every piece of real estate he built He wasn t even that successful in business going bankrupt more than once He s a lazy bones too rarely hitting the Oval Office until am according to Axios which obtained his daily schedules His approval ratings may never again cross If President Trump runs again he certainly looks beatable 
FEB4	Faith should be no barrier to schools teaching respect for LGBT rights	Recently we ve seen several clashes between local communities and education leaders over the application of the Equality Act in Britain s schools Shraga Stern the Orthodox Jewish activist warned earlier this year that Haredi Jews would leave the UK if faiths schools were forced to teach children about same sex relationships and gender reassignment And last month the headteacher of a school in Birmingham was petitioned by mainly Muslim parents to do away with a pilot programme called No Outsiders which is centred around inclusion and diversity as part of sex and relationship education Although the programme addresses issues as broad as gender race ageism faith and disability the spotlight has inevitably fallen on the teaching of LGBT identities  Children will naturally have questions but it is dangerous to assume they will all be able to ask their parents
FEB4	Rebuild the faded towns of Britain to end our national malaise	For the past nine years or so I have been observing a regular journalistic ritual In pursuit of enlightenment over where the country may be going how people are going to vote and their opinions about such massive issues as Brexit and Scottish independence I have pitched up in scores of places and begun my inquiries with some version of a simple question how is this place doing  In most cases I can still depend on the same answer quickly cropping up in at least of conversations a loud complaint about the number of closed down shops and the dire state of the town centre To some extent such stories have now hardened into a grim cliche summed up by those shots of boarded up premises that are a staple of the TV news and weekly reports about the fate of our high streets But that does not make what people say any less true or detract from how passionately they feel about something that has now been happening for over a decade 
FEB4	I once stole a 99p book. Twenty years later it’s still stopping me getting a job	Twenty years ago I made two mistakes  First I was caught stealing a book worth p then I compounded this by missing an appointment before a magistrate I received two convictions 
FEB4	My son’s life depends on this cystic fibrosis drug. And ministers stand in the way	Luis was three weeks old when we found out he had cystic fibrosis Neither my husband nor I had heard of the condition before but we knew very quickly our lives were about to change for ever from that moment Of all of the stats thrown at you when you hear the diagnosis one sticks out more than any other Luis s life expectancy was my age at the time We would most likely outlive our baby boy  Luis is eight years old now and though parts of our routine will be recognisable to every parent he has a life of many challenges It starts in the morning with a medical regime that takes up to two and half hours Every day he takes tablets three nebulisers two inhalers nasal sprays and lots of supplements The condition means he struggles to put on any weight so we need to keep a constant eye on his eating to ensure he gets much more than the recommended calorie intake for children of his age He ll have physio sessions too and be surrounded constantly by adults worrying if he s OK Then before bed he ll have another hour and a half of his medical regime Those are the good days 
FEB4	Roma is a cinematic triumph. Can it teach Trump’s America the value of compassion?	Staying in Santiago Chile at the moment I see echoes and reflections of Cleo the servant at the heart of Alfonso Cuar n s wondrous film Roma everywhere Cuar n s consummate recreation of his Mexico City childhood in the early s has garnered Oscar nominations and is a favourite for the top prizes later this month including best picture best actress for Yalitza Aparicio who plays Cleo and best director for Cuar n  I see Cleo in the maids who trudge to work at seven in the morning after two hours of gruelling travel from the outskirts of the city They hurry along so they can make a hot breakfast for their employers I see Cleo in the caretaker who spends night after night sitting with an octogenarian friend who is dying of cancer I see Cleo in the women who sweep the floors of a nearby hospital and those who serve the food at a cafeteria in the civil registry office I see her in the female workers who water the municipal gardens in the morning and pick up the trash in the afternoons 
FEB4	I did Veganuary, and now I’m staying vegan. Here’s what I’ve learned so far	We know the world is eating too much meat and we know that we as individuals have to do something about it So I was one of the record people who signed up to Veganuary this year  I haven t actually eaten meat for years although I occasionally ate fish and felt bad about it Two years ago I visited a modern British dairy farm where the cows were kept in very clean conditions indoors all year round I hated it So I switched to oat milk and last year gave up eating cheese But there s still plenty of animal products in cakes and biscuits And so until January I wasn t vegan 
FEB5	Liam Neeson’s interview shows that for some, black people are still not fully human	 When I was coming up in Mississippi I never knew it was against the law to kill a black man the late Buford Posey told me when he was I learned that when I went in the army I was years old When they told me I thought they were joking I was grateful for his candour Back in the day they used to call it nigger hunting A posse of good ol boys would head out in search of a black man to pay the price for his melanin and their inadequacies It was a relief to have a white person offer an honest reflection on the racial mores of the time  So following Liam Neeson s recent interview we should at the very least admire him for his candour For all the talk of a post racial society and Enlightenment values here s a white man who admits he literally went out for a week or more looking for a black man to murder It seems the bad old days of Buford Posey s youth aren t as distant a memory as some would like to think When it comes to race and racism we are not simply far from the place many thought we were we are not even where even more still pretend to be The next time someone asks me why I have a chip on my shoulder I need no longer brush the question away with disdain I can say with all sincerity Because there may well be an Oscar nominated actor out there who wants to kill me so I have to be alert at all times 
FEB5	So Revolut, I’m a single woman. How does that make me a sad, lonely loser?	Face it You re a loser You re a sad lonely loser There you are slumped on your sofa gulping down a bowl of grease alone And you thought you could keep it secret Well we know exactly what you re doing and we think it s tragic but also quite funny So we thought we d get everyone else to titter at the mess you ve made of your life  This appeared to be the message one company was keen to send out to single women this week Next to a giant bank card on one of the billboard ads for financial technology company Revolut were the words To the people who ordered a single takeaway on Valentine s Day Followed by the punchline You OK hun 
FEB5	The UK right loves this youth group. But it has a worrying US history	As political launches go it fish tailed rather than flew Amid a raft of endorsements from conservative and reactionary figures Turning Point UK a local offshoot of an American conservative youth movement hit social media with all the grace of a pigeon slamming into a plate glass window Instead of a brave bunch of plucky young Britons ready to crowbar free the stranglehold the left supposedly has on UK youth our heroes were subjected to a sustained shower of ridicule the likes of which hasn t been seen on Twitter for well at least a fortnight  Turning Point UK says it aims to challenge the idea that young people are inherently left leaning and seeks to fight against socialism racism and identity politics But recommendations from such reactionary bad boys as Infowars Paul Joseph Watson Breitbart s James Delingpole and Westminster s Michael Heaver weren t enough to drown out the ridicule Nor were the endorsements from Tory right MPs such as Jacob Rees Mogg Ben Bradley Priti Patel Chris Green and Steve Baker among others The wisecracks particularly about star recruit Darren Grimes who is still looking at a fine from the Electoral Commission simply wrote themselves 
FEB5	The EU’s deal with Libya is sentencing refugees to death	Haftom a year old Eritrean dentist used to tell a joke that went like this God was watching the globe and saw Eritrea was green How did this country become so green he wondered and went to investigate But when he got there he saw the green was overcrowded militias  Of course this was black humour Like tens of thousands of others Haftom fled Eritrea one of the most isolated dictatorships in the world He wanted to get away from brutal leaders who controlled every aspect of his life from his profession and his salary to where he could live and what he could speak about Friends described him as a quiet smart man who had eventually despaired of any chance that things would get better 
FEB5	MPs, step away from the social media. Twitter is not your friend	In the early s politicians sometimes made the mistake of agreeing to be interviewed by Ali G the spoof character played by Sacha Baron Cohen It never went well for them In in the process of navigating Ali G s confusion over BLTs bacon lettuce and tomato sandwiches and WMDs weapons of mass destruction the American pundit Pat Buchanan ended up stating that Saddam Hussein was at one time using BLTs on the Kurds Is it ever worth fighting a war over sandwiches his interviewer replied The Green party presidential candidate Ralph Nader was lured by his host s questions into discussing the difficulties of getting cows to break wind into boxes so as to conserve energy Any good these people had imagined might be done them by the exposure was always entirely undone by the nature of that exposure They always ended up looking like idiots  A similar mistake is made when British politicians decide to join Twitter Almost all MPs have an account now and some tweet more than times a day But Twitter is not there to help them It is there to trip them up First it lulls them into a false sense of security rewarding chit chat about their pets or their constituency welcoming them into an environment where other people not MPs are free to tweet unguarded thoughts and opinions and then at some unspecified but certain point it brutally shames them in front of the whole world Twitter has nothing to lose and they do 
FEB5	Another Brexit referendum would be the EU’s worst nightmare	Is it not time for the Dis united Kingdom to adopt a new national anthem A song more suited perhaps to the extraordinary spectacle that it has been putting on for the world since June  I d vote for Hotel California by the Eagles We are all just prisoners here Of our own device You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave Britain reminds me of the drug addict of the song who wants to get clean but keeps failing 
FEB5	A statue of Margaret Thatcher? No plinth will be too high for the vandals	Place an obstacle in the path and many people will seek to overcome it Urban planners build footpaths pedestrians forge their own desire lines Hanging a Do not climb plaque is often a psychological incentive for people to clamber on to the forbidden edifice This aspect of human nature should have occurred to the people behind the proposed installation of an enormous Margaret Thatcher statue in her home town Grantham in Lincolnshire In order to prevent the statue being besieged by vandals it will have to stand atop a three metre ft plinth  Creative critics of Thatcher s legacy have already proposed workarounds paintball target practice hammer throwing competitions and the simple but trusty ladder The depth of antipathy to the former prime minister means no matter what is built in her honour it will draw vandals and dissenters Knowing in advance that a statue commemorating her is likely to be defaced immediately it is mystifying to insist on erecting it at all Thatcher s legacy remains with us today and is still comfortably within living memory that history therefore is still contested and fought over Her fans and critics are embroiled in a battle to have their perspective recognised and recorded in history s narrative 
FEB5	Who’s going to care about the women being forced out of work?	What would drive thousands of people a year out of jobs they love or need with no certainty about whether they will ever be able to come back  If you have parents of a certain age you might already have guessed the answer About people a day are giving up their jobs to look after elderly or sick relatives the charity Carers UK estimates a hidden exodus from working life that we don t discuss nearly enough Young women are bombarded practically from the cradle with conflicting advice about how to have it all as working mothers yet hear almost nothing about coping as working daughters in an age of unravelling safety nets And yes about of carers are male which means many thousands of men are also toiling unpaid round the clock but women are statistically more likely to care for parents and men for spouses meaning men are more likely to care in retirement and women when they are still young enough to be working 
FEB5	Parliament voted to get a Brexit deal done now. So let’s make it happen	Parliamentary turmoil over Brexit has lasted almost days and still the arguments rage Last week saw a glimmer of a solution  Strip away the theatrics and the parliamentary proceduralism and it became pretty clear what parliament voted for 
FEB5	Fantasies of Dunkirk spirit couldn’t survive a no-deal Brexit	There s a frisson of excitement in the air among Brexiters The coming crisis brings an eve of battle thrill to those who invented all this pointlessness They relish a cataclysm to blame on the enemy across the Channel There is hope says Jacob Rees Mogg Tick tock goes the clock and as it ticks down we get closer to leaving And when we leave we have taken back control we are in charge Geronimo  No deal Brexit will feel about as in control as a blindfold skiing novice pushed off piste from a black run But it certainly won t be dull We have lived years of boring peace on our shores so the Brexiters savour a faux war to test our mettle If you enjoy those olden days TV shows Back in Time for School Dinner no deal will let us play it at home Can we still survive hard times How s your kitchen cupboard How s your nerve How s your business and your job Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood it s time to test our national fibre 
FEB6	Climate change is the deadliest legacy we will leave the young	One of the strange things that happens when you start work on a novel is that you realise what s been preoccupying you sometimes without you knowing it I was about a third of the way into my new novel The Wall when I discovered that I was completely obsessed by intergenerational inequality In particular by the question of intergenerational inequality linked to climate change Who knew Certainly not me  Now there s nothing wrong with intergenerational inequality At least there s nothing wrong with the version of it that existed in the developed world for much of the th century That kind of inequality was based on the idea that life should be gradually better from one generation to another more secure more prosperous healthier longer That means that children got a better deal than their parents but that was fine indeed in this version of the social contract that was the whole point 
FEB6	A special place in hell? Donald Tusk didn’t go far enough	Donald Tusk should be criticised not for his malice but his moderation The European council president triggered a tsunami of confected outrage from leavers today when he observed with some justice that there should be a special place in hell for those who promoted Brexit without a plan But he should have said far more He should have added that within that special place there should be an executive suite of sleepless torment for those politicians who promoted Brexit without ever giving a stuff about Ireland  Once again Brexit is all coming down to Ireland This was always going to happen and rightly so Time after time in our history Ireland emerges as an awkward reality check that shames the fantasies of those who think the British are better and that Ireland can be ignored So there is something both fateful and tragic about the fact Theresa May should have prepared for the final showdown by having to make a rare visit to Ireland 
FEB6	We in the Stansted 15 have been treated like terrorists	Along with other peaceful protesters I was found guilty of a controversial terror related offence in December after stopping a mass deportation flight from taking off On Wednesday we avoided prison  The judge awarded most of us community service and three of us suspended sentences We could have been given life in jail and I m so relieved that hasn t happened But I m also angry We might not be going to prison but we ve still been found guilty of a crime we clearly did not commit We are a group of peaceful protesters but the state has convicted us of a terror related offence This was done without any transparency by the Crown Prosecution Service CPS and neither the CPS nor the attorney general have explained this decision It was an abuse of power that never should have happened 
FEB6	Dear Theresa May, your Brexit plan is doomed. Here’s a deal that will work	Dear Mrs May  I write to you at a time of grave national crisis beholden to no party a representative of no special interest and in nobody s pocket I am however a concerned citizen a mother and an employer and I am hopeful that in view of the deadlock in our politics just weeks before we are due to leave the European Union on March you will have the intellectual and moral honesty to consider a commonsense and pragmatic proposal 
FEB6	The talented Dan Mallory affair: is this high noon for the privileged white male?	There s a new work that has the publishing world gripped with editors in London and New York confessing themselves hooked It races along like a thriller with several dizzying twists and turns and a compelling central character What s more this sensational story is not fiction but a detailed well sourced work of journalism  I m referring to the New Yorker s word profile of Dan Mallory whose debut novel The Woman in the Window published under the pseudonym AJ Finn has been a monster hit The report makes an unsettling read charting what the magazine calls the trail of deceptions left by Mallory including claims that he has endured and survived cancer in various forms with tumours in both his brain and spine that his parents were dead and that his brother took his own life 
FEB6	The children skipping school aren't ruining the planet – you are	If there is one political subject that remains neglected and underestimated because of how we have for centuries run our societies economies and families then it is children Although the experience and process of growing up has in many ways profoundly changed through history our understanding of children has failed to keep pace  Nothing makes this clearer than the children s climate strikes These protests involving school age children refusing to attend class to focus the attention of political leaders on the global climate crisis have spread from Australia to Germany from Sweden to Belgium the first strikes in the UK take place this Friday and in the US later this month But instead of taking themseriously many adults usually though not exclusively old men in leadership positions are still dismissing them with the utterly paternalistic argument that all these protests are nice and cute but skipping school Why can t the children protest in their free time instead of endangering their own education and their future which we the adults supposedly have provided for them 
FEB6	Sajid Javid’s deportation flight shows the hostile environment in action	A private Titan Airways jet left Birmingham on Wednesday morning carrying about people forcibly expelling them from the UK on a flight bound for Jamaica It is the first such flight since the revelations surrounding the Windrush scandal and it left hours before the activists known as the Stansted were sentenced for peacefully grounding a charter flight in March For many in the Caribbean community and migrant rights campaigners this charter flight is a slap in the face a reminder that lessons from the Windrush scandal have not been learned and that the government s hostile environment immigration policy endures  However the charter flight is being seemingly justified on the grounds that the people on the flight have criminal records The home secretary Sajid Javid said on Tuesday Every single person that will be on that flight that is being deported is a foreign national offender they are all convicted of serious crimes very serious crimes It s not clear what the home secretary defines as very serious here as it seems that some people on the flight have been convicted of minor offences Take Akeem who is registered blind and suffers from epilepsy following a brain tumour as a child and who served a four month sentence for an assault conviction Javid used the same term when explaining that he would not assist wrongly deported Windrush migrants with criminal records But whether they committed crimes serious or not Javid reminds us that those fighting for migrant rights need to develop arguments that can include those with criminal records 
FEB6	A ‘duty of care’ for sexists – no wonder Warwick students are furious	The University of Warwick is renowned for academic excellence but for many who have studied there it has a reputation for very different reasons Today the student union is supporting a protest on campus against sexism racism and rape culture at the university  It was reported last week that two male undergraduates who were among a group who had used reprehensible racist antisemitic and ableist language while joking about raping their female peers were being allowed to return after a year s suspension despite the university s original decision to ban them from campus for a decade 
FEB6	Liam Neeson laid bare the logic of lynching, in all its horror	In an interview with the UK s Independent newspaper the action star Liam Neeson who was on a press junket to promote his new action movie Cold Pursuit admitted to wanting racist revenge Decades ago he said a friend of his had confided that she had been raped Neeson asked if she knew the man who had raped her and when she said no he asked the man s race She told him that the attacker had been black Neeson said that after this he was intent on murdering a black man He said he walked the streets carrying a cosh British slang for a bludgeon going into black neighborhoods and hoping to find himself in a fight so that he would have an excuse to beat a black man to death All of this came from a feeling of defensiveness toward his friend he said Thus he would murder a black man on her behalf  The comment sparked controversy and anger black people rightly pointed out that this attitude seeks to impose collective punishment putting their communities in grave and pointless danger Many were angry at Neeson for not condemning his own past racism instead saying that the episode had taught him a lesson about the danger and futility of revenge In response Neeson went on Good Morning America I am not a racist he said and added unhelpfully that he had overcome his urges by power walking While he was there he also promoted his new movie 
FEB6	Who smashed up Karl Marx’s grave? Here are the prime suspects	On Tuesday nearly years after his death somebody decided to stop the rise of communism by trashing Karl Marx s gravestone before it s too late  It s a weird time to do it Who could be mad enough at him that they want vengeance given that he is at most fairly politically inactive as a corpse The perpetrator is believed to have used a hammer not even paying him the respect of also using a sickle so they must really hate the guy 
FEB7	Why disaster capitalists are praying for a no-deal Brexit	Part of me wants to smash it all up I want to see the British bubble burst the imperial nostalgia the groundless belief in the inherent greatness of this nation the casual dishonesty of those who govern us the xenophobia the intolerance the denial the complacency I want those who have caused the coming disaster to own it so that nobody ever believes them again No deal Brexit Bring it on  Such dark thoughts do not last long It will be the poor who get hurt first and worst The rich leavers demanding the hardest of possible Brexits with their offshore accounts homes abroad and lavish pensions will be all right I remember the eerie silence of the City of London While the bosses of companies producing goods and tangible services write anxious letters to the papers the financial sector has stayed largely shtum Shorting sterling is just the first of its possible gains 
FEB7	Yes, I do give a sh*t about these sweary book covers	Among the boom in self help books on the shelves this year there is a title by life coach Andrea Owen called How to Stop Feeling Like Sh t It has a quote on the cover from Jen Sincero author of You Are a Badass and comes hard on the heels of Unf ck Yourself F ck Feelings F k Anxiety Calm the F k Down Unf ck Your Brain How to Make Sh t Happen and the mother of all sweary self help titles Mark Manson s juggernaut The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F ck  Most of these books present perfectly sensible ideas about how to stop jeopardising your own efforts and escape negative thought loops They compile lists of bad habits and address self defeating behaviours and a few years ago when the trend started taking off they sounded naughty and arresting in a light handed way 
FEB7	Labour will be punished by voters if it gives any backing at all to Brexit	Jeremy Corbyn s letter to Theresa May last night offering to slightly soften his Brexit stance risks stirring a backlash from Labour supporters A new poll makes it devastatingly clear that if Labour is perceived as having enabled Brexit it will lose seats including five of its seven precious Scottish seats  Labour s true heartlands are remain four fifths of Labour voters think May s deal will hurt the British economy and of them don t trust the government to deliver a good Brexit Remainers will desert and punish the party in droves unless it opposes Brexit This outlook comes from a large poll of more than people it was commissioned by TSSA the transport union which has always backed Corbyn It was meant to be private advice to him but it leaked There can be no disguising the sense of disappointment and disillusionment with Labour if it fails to oppose Brexit and there is every indication that it will be far more damaging to the party s electoral fortunes than the Iraq war the polling document reports 
FEB7	Teaching all pupils to act more like Etonians won’t help solve inequality	It really does take a special kind of inattention to observe public life today and conclude that what we need is more public school swagger Our politics is currently dominated by men who are so convinced of their own swag it s dangerous We know where politics as a debating society with no real world consequences leads Jacob Rees Mogg and Boris Johnson are exemplary only in their callous recklessness Still here we have the education secretary Damian Hinds I know no one knows who he is or what he does as Brexit has vacuumed all policy into its void suggesting that state school pupils should practise debating and public speaking to compete against Old Etonians in the workplace   Public school confidence is something he wants to call time on so that all kinds of everyone can hold their own Wow This is hardly an unfamiliar idea is it That one can achieve privilege through class mimicry instead of er having actual privilege In order to be taken seriously one must adhere to the mores of those who have effortlessly risen to the top because of their special education 
FEB7	How could a cheerleader for Ukip ever become CEO of Women’s Aid?	In early January I was due to speak at the opening of an exhibition about the domestic violence refuges of the s and s Out of curiosity I Googled the woman who was to speak alongside me Katie Ghose at the time the CEO of Women s Aid What I discovered astounded me  In two years before she joined Women s Aid she had as CEO of the Electoral Reform Society ERS spoken at the Ukip annual conference and enthused about the party s passion for a new way of doing politics referring to Douglas Carswell as an outstanding MP and praising Nigel Farage At a fringe event organised by ERS at the Ukip conference she had hosted Katie Hopkins who had ranted about gassing members of the House of Lords 
FEB7	Labour MPs must not be fooled by Theresa May’s Brexit promises	Just when we think we have reached peak Brexit complexity we always seem to go one better As Jeremy Corbyn s letter to Theresa May laying out Labour s terms for supporting her deal made the headlines I simultaneously got an email from a local party member decrying Labour facilitating Brexit and a text from a local resident saying Yay this is clear and offers a soft Brexit Putting aside issues of where such a move leaves Labour with members and the electorate where does this letter leave us in terms of the potential renegade Labour MPs willing to vote for May s deal as long as there are sweeteners  In the absence of May being able to ensure a permanent customs union it seems to make it more likely that Brexit bribes will be on offer and potentially more likely that they ll be taken up It s not just the political dangers of such a move that are a problem here it s that a politically motivated half baked short term regional investment programme will do nothing to address deep rooted inequalities in the UK 
FEB7	Climate change is the deadliest legacy we will leave the young	One of the strange things that happens when you start work on a novel is that you realise what s been preoccupying you sometimes without you knowing it I was about a third of the way into my new novel The Wall when I discovered that I was completely obsessed by intergenerational inequality In particular by the question of intergenerational inequality linked to climate change Who knew Certainly not me  Now there s nothing wrong with intergenerational inequality At least there s nothing wrong with the version of it that existed in the developed world for much of the th century That kind of inequality was based on the idea that life should be gradually better from one generation to another more secure more prosperous healthier longer That means that children got a better deal than their parents but that was fine indeed in this version of the social contract that was the whole point 
FEB7	Forget new trade deals – Britain’s struggling to keep the ones it has	 Global Britain advocates often fail to acknowledge the long list of countries the UK already has free trade agreements FTAs with by virtue of its EU membership The EU s trade partners include Turkey Israel Morocco South Korea South Africa Chile Mexico and more recently Canada and Japan  And these agreements matter to British business up to of UK exports are to countries the EU already has a trade agreement with It is of little surprise that the Brexit priority for most British businesses after securing a deep relationship with the UK s most important trading partner the EU is not future free trade agreements with the US New Zealand and others but replacing those that already exist 
FEB7	Only a small, sad nation robs its people of arts and culture	As it emerged Grantham Museum will soon look out on to a bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher I found myself thinking about the last time I stepped foot in there  Growing up in the town in the s the local museum was a cheap trip out for my primary school class a sea of sticky fingers smudging the glass I still remember the smell a sort of musty air mixed with a whiff of adventure 
FEB7	Why are so many women writing about rough sex?	Recently I have found myself wondering about the prevalence of rough sex in new fiction written by women It s viscerally present in You Know You Want This the new short story collection by Kristen Roupenian who shot to fame last year with Cat Person published in the New Yorker I found some of the scenes so unpalatable that I had to keep putting it down They spoiler alert include a woman strangled to death as part of a sex game a man who imagines his penis is a knife when he has sex and a woman who says to the guy she is sleeping with I want you to punch me in the face as hard as you can After you ve punched me when I ve fallen down I want you to kick me in the stomach And then we can have sex  Now my personal discomfort with the sexual content is no comment on its quality fiction that never challenges us isn t good fiction at all Each reader can make up their own mind about how good the work is But what is interesting about this rough sex is what it tells us about the current cultural moment It is supposed to be edgy and transgressive in You Know You Want This it feels deliberately put there to shock and yet it s everywhere More often than not it is women writing it and female characters desiring it and frequently those characters are using sadomasochistic sex as a way of processing their own trauma The MeToo and Time s Up movements have shone a light on abuse and harassment so it s no wonder a new generation of women are exploring how that manifests itself in sexual relationships 
FEB8	In the age of Trump and Bezos, public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase	Is there a Russian piss tape of Donald Trump Did a government agency intercept Amazon boss Jeff Bezos s dick pics How did Trump s cheerleaders at the National Enquirer get them Is this part of Trump s willy waving at Bezos as owner of the Washington Post Does the Enquirer s apparent blackmail threat to Bezos breach its plea deal with Robert Mueller s Trump Russia investigation which gave its owners American Media Inc immunity in exchange for evidence about Michael Cohen s role in its policy of buying and killing Trump sex expos s Is Riyadh somehow involved given AMI s business ties with senior Saudi figures and given that Bezos owns the Washington Post whose columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by the regime last October  Guys I don t know the answer to any of these questions but I am enjoying this reminder of why literally every American president has had a penis and why more than of Fortune CEOs do too Face it the plotlines are just better Public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase 
FEB8	We can’t wait for a people’s vote: make the case against Brexit right now	Sounding the klaxon and warning of imminent disaster is it turns out an even older British tradition than you might think A tour of the spellbinding Anglo Saxon Kingdoms exhibition at the British Library confirms that back in the year a scribbling sermoniser by the name of Gildas surely the Guardian columnist of his day was writing on the ruin of Britain Even before the country properly existed there were Cassandras to prophesy its demise  Still that same exhibition leaves the visitor in no doubt that what will befall these islands in less than days is of epic significance breaking a thread that has run through our long history Even in the age of Mercia the kingdom strained hard to connect with its neighbours in Francia Rome and Ireland The th century court of thelstan was a cosmopolitan magnet to scholars from all over the continent And need we mention that the Anglo Saxons were themselves migrants from northern Europe The Faragiste tendency which imagines a British past pure and unsullied by the taint of Europe imagines a past that did not exist 
FEB8	Liam Neeson started a vital debate. To condemn him is to end it	Everyone seems to have had their say on the Liam Neeson s racist interview including me I seem to be one of very few people defending him and I d like to explain why  I have been accused of being an apologist for a racist but let me start off by saying that I m sure that Neeson is as unconsciously racially biased as the next person Myself included This is perfectly understandable when you consider the value and worth ascribed to different groups by our society This is deeply ingrained in our history literature news reporting and beyond whether it s Muslim grooming gangs Nigerian conmen or Jamaican drug dealers 
FEB8	Whatever Luciana Berger’s politics, Labour members must stand with her against antisemitism	Some things in politics are far from being clear cut Here s something that is Luciana Berger Labour s MP for Liverpool Wavertree is the victim of antisemitic abuse and harassment She has suffered this for years In October a neo Nazi was jailed for sending her an antisemitic tweet Another online troll was jailed for spewing racist bile at her two years later Yet another was jailed in after calling Berger Jewish scum and suggesting she would get it like Jo Cox Berger has used Twitter to highlight some of the vile antisemitic abuse she received some of which looks like grotesque propaganda from s Nazi Germany  Berger has been courageous in confronting the hatred directed against her because she is Jewish and not only deserves solidarity but requires it The horror of antisemitism cannot be minimised Last year there were antisemitic incidents in the UK a increase on the year before including verbal abuse on the streets If you fail to extend solidarity to a victim of antisemitism because you do not agree with their politics then you do not truly oppose antisemitism at all Neither Labour s leadership nor the vast majority of Labour members are antisemitic but antisemitism does exist on fringes of the left and there has to be far more seriousness in rooting it out Those who deny it exists at all who think it s entirely a smear campaign and nothing else are part of the problem 
FEB8	Why disaster capitalists are praying for a no-deal Brexit	Part of me wants to smash it all up I want to see the British bubble burst the imperial nostalgia the groundless belief in the inherent greatness of this nation the casual dishonesty of those who govern us the xenophobia the intolerance the denial the complacency I want those who have caused the coming disaster to own it so that nobody ever believes them again No deal Brexit Bring it on  Such dark thoughts do not last long It will be the poor who get hurt first and worst The rich leavers demanding the hardest of possible Brexits with their offshore accounts homes abroad and lavish pensions will be all right I remember the eerie silence of the City of London While the bosses of companies producing goods and tangible services write anxious letters to the papers the financial sector has stayed largely shtum Shorting sterling is just the first of its possible gains 
FEB8	Goop has a Netflix deal – this is a dangerous win for pseudoscience	Are you wary of experts Do you enjoy a fact free lifestyle Are you itching to splurge on non toxic skin creams and carat gold sex toys Well I ve got brilliant news Goop Gwyneth Paltrow s controversial lifestyle brand has signed a deal with Netflix Soon we will all be able to stream Paltrow s glamorous strain of woo on demand  Keeping with the general theme of Goop facts about the new Netflix project are hard to come by All we know so far is that the docuseries minute episodes will be hosted by Paltrow and Elise Loehnen Goop s chief content officer Loehnen has also said the series seeks to dial up the aesthetics and quality of storytelling surrounding issues like mental physical and sexual health Which again keeping with the general theme of Goop sounds lovely but means little

Then the police came to talk to me	I could not fail to be moved when I read the Whaley family s story this week Geoff Whaley who had terminal motor neurone disease died on Thursday morning in the arms of his wife Ann at the Dignitas assisted dying facility in Switzerland He was able to fulfil his final wish to have control over his end and die peacefully rather than endure the final months of agony that his illness had in store for him  Their carefully laid plans had been jeopardised at the last moment when an anonymous call was made to social services alerted the police of their intentions Ann acting purely out of love and compassion was made to feel like a criminal for supporting her husband Anyone would feel for the family but this affected me more than most 
FEB8	The France-Italy row is theatrical – but such shows are dangerous for Europe	To describe this as the worst crisis between France and Italy since the second world war seems a bit of an overstatement It s not exactly as if troops are about to march across the Alps as Mussolini s did in Still when France recalled its ambassador from Rome this week after Italy s deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio had met a group of gilets jaunes protesters in central France it felt as if European politics had taken a dangerous turn Di Maio a leader of the anti establishment Five Star Movement had tweeted a photo of the meeting with the words the winds of change have crossed the Alps  No two European countries are culturally and historically closer than France and Italy They are founding members of the European project The two countries obsess about food and fashion alike they are Mediterranean and of a Latin culture 
FEB8	Think the backstop issue is insoluble? My Brexit plan will please everyone	What would prompt an academic from Germany to come up with a plan to try to end the current stalemate on the backstop the mechanism designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit The answer has three parts experience in negotiations gained during my time with a multinational company an academic interest in Brexit since including a study in which I compared it for complexity with the first moon landing and the third is that I m a father of two who can vividly imagine the consequences for families on both sides of the UK EU divide if these negotiations fail  My experience of business negotiations in China and Russia convinced me of how crucial trust is Without it any negotiation is doomed to failure You have to put yourself in the shoes of the other side and tough as that may be accept that you are not always right When we look at the deadlock between London and Brussels over the Northern Ireland backstop what we can observe after nearly two years of negotiations is the total breakdown of trust Once you hear from both sides the words this is a matter of principle you know you are very close to a showdown 
FEB8	Lung cancer needn’t be a killer. NHS mobile chest scans will save lives	A decade ago I decided to devote my career to tackling what many saw as one of medicine s biggest challenges lung cancer a smokers disease shrouded in unfair stigma prevalent among the most disadvantaged Patients would frequently arrive at clinic with the disease well advanced with few options beyond harsh radiotherapy and chemotherapy to buy a few extra months Curative surgery was effective only for a small fortunate proportion of patients who were diagnosed early  Ten years on much of this is still true The disease still claims lives prematurely every year many from the more deprived sectors of society Late diagnosis is still a huge issue with two thirds diagnosed at an advanced incurable stage In survival terms we re still doing worse than many comparable countries 
FEB9	A hidden government is preparing for Brexit… by keeping us in the dark	Brexit is killing many myths but its chief victim is the belief that Britain is not an absurd country The British establishment believed in our innate common sense as did admiring foreigners  Weirdly the supposedly cynical British public still does Voters damn politicians but assume they will somehow find a way through I doubt their confidence will last and they will soon see our new United Kingdom of Absurdistan for what it is a land where civil servants send military advisers into government departments as if the mandarins were planning a coup or draw up emergency measures to lift the Queen fall of Saigon style from Buckingham Palace or stockpile medicines as if we were at war We are at war in a sense only Brexit is a war the British have declared on themselves and still do not realise they are fighting 
FEB9	What does Liam Neeson’s ‘primal urge’ really tell us about racism?	It s been one hell of a week in the wide wide world of racism On Monday the Egyptian international Mohamed Salah was subjected to alleged racist abuse during Liverpool s match with West Ham On Wednesday memories of the Windrush scandal were awoken when people were forcibly expelled from the UK on a charter flight to Jamaica Then on Thursday Gucci released a polo neck jumper that covers the mouth and the chin of the wearer making them resemble a blackface minstrel You know like you do  Anyone hoping to cut through the background hum of structural inequality and racial insensitivity was really going to have to pull something special out of the bag Cue Liam Neeson who revealed that years ago he had entertained a racist lynching fantasy and actually gone out looking for a black man to murder The response of Neeson s co star Tom Bateman who was sitting beside him set the tone for what was to follow Holy shit 
FEB9	Since when was it a police job to impose sanctions on drill musicians?	The authorities ban musicians from playing without official approval The police prevent them from performing a song deemed unacceptable The courts threaten to imprison them when they do play it All this not in Russia or Iran but in Britain  Last month two drill musicians Skengdo and AM from the Brixton group were given nine month suspended sentences Their crime Performing their song Attempted at a gig in December In so doing they breached a court injunction issued in August It was producer and writer Ian McQuaid observed a watershed moment for the censorship of culture 
FEB9	In the age of Trump and Bezos, public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase	Is there a Russian piss tape of Donald Trump Did a government agency intercept Amazon boss Jeff Bezos s dick pics How did Trump s cheerleaders at the National Enquirer get them Is this part of Trump s willy waving at Bezos as owner of the Washington Post Does the Enquirer s apparent blackmail threat to Bezos breach its plea deal with Robert Mueller s Trump Russia investigation which gave its owners American Media Inc immunity in exchange for evidence about Michael Cohen s role in its policy of buying and killing Trump sex expos s Is Riyadh somehow involved given AMI s business ties with senior Saudi figures and given that Bezos owns the Washington Post whose columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by the regime last October  Guys I don t know the answer to any of these questions but I am enjoying this reminder of why literally every American president has had a penis and why more than of Fortune CEOs do too Face it the plotlines are just better Public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase 
FEB9	There will be no fake news in Martin Clunes’ Islands of America	The unwritten rules of documentary making can be a more controversial topic than one might expect remember Mary Beard s courageous admission that she isn t all that keen on re enactments but you know it s time to listen when Martin Clunes the king of gentle travel ish shows with a side serving of animals has something to say In the run up to his new series Islands of America last week Hawaii Alaska bear cubs Clunes told the Radio Times that he was not a fan of documentary cliches such as pretending to meet people for the first time when you ve already met them the night before If the crew want to shoot me doing a meet and greet it has to be genuine  Coincidentally I read this as I was watching the final season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt One of the episodes is a self referential documentary for the streaming service Houseflix in which a celebrity DJ attempts to uncover the truth about Jon Hamm s incarcerated kidnapper and rapist Richard Wayne Gary Wayne It s a collection of modern investigative documentary cliches from the grainy home footage compilation in the opening credits to the scruffy but tenacious lawyer working from his home office 
FEB9	We can’t wait for a people’s vote: make the case against Brexit right now	Sounding the klaxon and warning of imminent disaster is it turns out an even older British tradition than you might think A tour of the spellbinding Anglo Saxon Kingdoms exhibition at the British Library confirms that back in the year a scribbling sermoniser by the name of Gildas surely the Guardian columnist of his day was writing on the ruin of Britain Even before the country properly existed there were Cassandras to prophesy its demise  Still that same exhibition leaves the visitor in no doubt that what will befall these islands in less than days is of epic significance breaking a thread that has run through our long history Even in the age of Mercia the kingdom strained hard to connect with its neighbours in Francia Rome and Ireland The th century court of thelstan was a cosmopolitan magnet to scholars from all over the continent And need we mention that the Anglo Saxons were themselves migrants from northern Europe The Faragiste tendency which imagines a British past pure and unsullied by the taint of Europe imagines a past that did not exist 
FEB9	Liam Neeson started a vital debate. To condemn him is to end it	Everyone seems to have had their say on the Liam Neeson s racist interview including me I seem to be one of very few people defending him and I d like to explain why  I have been accused of being an apologist for a racist but let me start off by saying that I m sure that Neeson is as unconsciously racially biased as the next person Myself included This is perfectly understandable when you consider the value and worth ascribed to different groups by our society This is deeply ingrained in our history literature news reporting and beyond whether it s Muslim grooming gangs Nigerian conmen or Jamaican drug dealers 
FEB9	Whatever Luciana Berger’s politics, Labour members must stand with her against antisemitism	Some things in politics are far from being clear cut Here s something that is Luciana Berger Labour s MP for Liverpool Wavertree is the victim of antisemitic abuse and harassment She has suffered this for years In October a neo Nazi was jailed for sending her an antisemitic tweet Another online troll was jailed for spewing racist bile at her two years later Yet another was jailed in after calling Berger Jewish scum and suggesting she would get it like Jo Cox Berger has used Twitter to highlight some of the vile antisemitic abuse she received some of which looks like grotesque propaganda from s Nazi Germany  Berger has been courageous in confronting the hatred directed against her because she is Jewish and not only deserves solidarity but requires it The horror of antisemitism cannot be minimised Last year there were antisemitic incidents in the UK a increase on the year before including verbal abuse on the streets If you fail to extend solidarity to a victim of antisemitism because you do not agree with their politics then you do not truly oppose antisemitism at all Neither Labour s leadership nor the vast majority of Labour members are antisemitic but antisemitism does exist on fringes of the left and there has to be far more seriousness in rooting it out Those who deny it exists at all who think it s entirely a smear campaign and nothing else are part of the problem 
FEB9	Why disaster capitalists are praying for a no-deal Brexit	Part of me wants to smash it all up I want to see the British bubble burst the imperial nostalgia the groundless belief in the inherent greatness of this nation the casual dishonesty of those who govern us the xenophobia the intolerance the denial the complacency I want those who have caused the coming disaster to own it so that nobody ever believes them again No deal Brexit Bring it on  Such dark thoughts do not last long It will be the poor who get hurt first and worst The rich leavers demanding the hardest of possible Brexits with their offshore accounts homes abroad and lavish pensions will be all right I remember the eerie silence of the City of London While the bosses of companies producing goods and tangible services write anxious letters to the papers the financial sector has stayed largely shtum Shorting sterling is just the first of its possible gains

FEB10	Have MPs, finally, come up with a decent Brexit proposal?	It all has the feel of the world s most boring thriller Though there are only just under seven weeks left until Britain s official date of departure from the European Union public life seems drowsy with a lethal brew of fatalism insouciance and burrowing cowardice  On the BBC s Andrew Marr Show this morning James Brokenshire the communities secretary looked less like the minister charged with preparing local government for the social chaos of a no deal outcome than a beaming salesman politely urging a client to renew his contents insurance policy 
FEB10	Why study English? We’re poorer in every sense without it	The lack of science maths and language teachers has been talked about for years But a shortage of English teachers has gone under the radar Although last year s target for new trainees was met in the two previous years it was missed English used to be among the most popular subjects both to teach and to learn Lessons had a reputation for being creative thought provoking and even fun Philip Pullman David Almond and Joanne Harris were all teachers before they became authors But dramatic reductions in the number of A level entries and applications to study English at university suggest that some of the enthusiasm long associated with English has drained away  The figures are most startling at A level where the number of students in England taking English language or literature has fallen since a pattern mirrored in Wales and Northern Ireland but not Scotland While a demographic dip fewer year olds partly explains this the fall in English entries is far bigger than the overall drop in entries English has lost more students than other subjects Undergraduate enrolments on English degrees have also fallen from an all time high of around in to last year although the proportion of English A level students who go on to study it at university has hovered around for a decade 
FEB10	Why didn’t Liam Neeson just stick to the script?	Is it because of Liam Neeson I wonder that John Humphrys has announced he s going to retire from the Today programme Was Neeson s astonishing interview in the Independent what finally made the great Radio inquisitor realise quite how much you can get out of an interviewee if you give them a bit of space to speak  Interviews and interviewing have been in the news a lot Not only was there the extraordinary confession Neeson volunteered in the middle of what was supposed to be a perfectly vacuous press junket and Humphrys s equally unexpected proclamation but also Maureen Lipman writing in the Radio Times had a pop at the modern style of chatshow The sofa is crammed like a chapel pew with English actors telling their juiciest genitalia stories while the host sniggers in a three piece suit was how she described the genre 
FEB10	In revering Trump, the religious right has laid bare its hypocrisy	The annual anachronism known as the National Prayer Breakfast attracted its usual array of clergy military and political leaders in Washington on February Most prominent of all of course was Donald Trump who used the de facto pulpit to call for outlawing abortion among other positions dear to the Religious Right  Yet the presidential comment that most typified all that has gone morally haywire with the supposedly moral majority came when Trump praised the abolition of civil rights You can consider that statement an innocent if embarrassing misreading of the Teleprompter Or you can hear it as a Freudian slip 
FEB10	Ignorance of the Holocaust is different to wilful disbelief	And what has the world learned of all this is the handwritten question by Holocaust survivor Henri Obstfeld which appears beside his image in a book Survivor Introducing his portraits of survivors the photographer Harry Borden writes I grew up on a farm in Devon England My dad Charlie was a resolutely atheist Jew who derived nothing from his background except a fear of antisemitism When I was a boy he once told me that the Nazis would have killed us I was shocked I attended a Church of England primary school sang in the choir and had always considered myself a Christian like my mum  Disquieting also was the size of some responses to the assertion that the scale of the Holocaust is exaggerated

FEB10	Ivanka Trump’s a feminist? Yep – just like her father and her brothers	In a singular achievement for US conceptual art an installation by Jennifer Rubell has prompted three to date of Donald Trump s children to disclose their horror of sexism  The piece in question Ivanka Vacuuming recently opened in Washington DC A video shows a woman in the Trump preferred genre young high heeled blond impassively pushing a vacuum cleaner around a pink carpet on to which visitors are invited to throw crumbs from a generous pile on a pedestal Inspired by a figure whose public persona incorporates an almost comically wide range of feminine identities daughter wife mother sister model working woman blond Ivanka Vacuuming is say the organisers CulturalDC simultaneously a visual celebration of a contemporary icon a portrait of our own relationship to that figure and a questioning of our complicity in her role playing 
FEB10	Long untouchable, web giants now know what it feels like to be hunted	The key question to ask when a shocking tragedy comes to light is this does it signify a scandal or a crisis Scandals happen all the time in societies They generate a lot of heat outrage and public angst But eventually the media caravan moves on and nothing much changes  When in for example the Guardian printed shocking revelations of tabloid phone hacking and particularly the news that reporters had hacked the mobile phone of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler many observers concluded that this indicated a crisis for the British newspaper industry Initially the signs were promising solemn statement by the prime minister ubiquitous shock horror outrage closure of a big newspaper a judicial inquiry all the trappings of a democracy embarking on radical reform But in the end nothing much changed British tabloids are as intrusive and crass as ever And the industry remains self regulated It was just another scandal after all

FEB11	Trump offers socialism for the rich, capitalism for everyone else	 America will never be a socialist country Donald Trump declared in his State of the Union address Someone should alert Trump that America is now a hotbed of socialism But it is socialism for the rich Everyone else is treated to harsh capitalism  In the conservative mind socialism means getting something for doing nothing That pretty much describes the bn saved by the nation s largest banks last year thanks to Trump s tax cuts some of which went into massive bonuses for bank executives On the other hand more than lower level bank employees got a big dose of harsh capitalism They lost their jobs 
FEB11	There’s only one way to head off May’s threat of no-deal chaos	In a strange new twist Theresa May has replied to Labour s suggestions on Brexit in terms so opaque that this newspaper has interpreted them as a rejection of Jeremy Corbyn s terms while the Times believes her to be ready to compromise Like the death throes of a chess game the moves available to her are small and few and it s hard to figure out what decision she has taken  In shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer s lawyerly fashion Labour s terms were laid out fivefold a permanent customs union close alignment with the single market dynamic alignment on workers rights that is for the UK to keep pace with the evolution of rights and protections in Europe continued membership of EU wide agencies and funding programmes and an agreement on security arrangements such that we retain access to shared databases and the European arrest warrant 
FEB11	And the Bafta for most witlessly outdated awards ceremony goes to …	Deja vu is a common complaint during awards season The same faces shuffle down a carpet There are whopping frocks and usually some interpretative dance There are heroes and baddies causes c l bres and sacred cows hot bandwagons and atrocious jokes though rarely quite as dire as those told by Joanna Lumley last night  It s often hard to keep track Is this the year everyone refers to Harvey Weinstein as God or as the devil Has Glenn Close really never won anything or is she always winning everything Is that actor s photo being beamed big because they re triumphed or because they ve died 
FEB11	British ‘lethality’? Gavin Williamson’s brain has gone absent without leave	The defence secretary s brain has gone absent without leave Gavin Williamson said in a speech today that he intends to send his new aircraft carrier the HMS Queen Elizabeth round the world to frighten China He will equip it with a squadron of F fighter jets purchased from America In addition he wants to build two British military bases one in Asia and the other in the Caribbean They are to strengthen our global presence enhance our lethality and increase our mass  Brexit says the defence secretary has brought us to a great moment in our history when we must be ready to deploy hard power against those who flout international law What on earth is Williamson talking about apart from a desire to be Tory leader His budget was last week said to be bn adrift of reality The Queen Elizabeth cannot sail until It has no business whatsoever in the South China Sea where such a vast and unwieldy ship would be a sitting target The Chinese could sink it in an hour As for new military bases in the Caribbean and east of Suez they would cost billions and be an invitation to terrorists The Chinese must be laughing themselves sick 
FEB11	Surely British business can do better than Mike Ashley and Philip Green?	Here s a question Do you really think that two white billionaires with a penchant for excess questionable morals and a slew of scandals to their name are the ideal face of business in a country scrambling to keep the surviving scraps of its international reputation intact I didn t think so And yet here we are  Mike Ashley and Philip Green shared the business headlines over the weekend with stories very different in nature but nonetheless all serving as a reminder for why British businessmen are in desperate need of a dramatic image overhaul Sports Direct headed up by Ashley the mouthy retail entrepreneur who also owns House of Fraser and Newcastle United was last week hailed as a possible buyer of Patisserie Valerie after the cafe chain spectacularly crashed into administration in January putting hundreds of jobs at risk 
FEB11	Britain deports people who grew up here. This racialised system must end	Last week mass deportations resumed in Britain It s less than a year since the Windrush scandal broke and the review into the events leading up to it hasn t even reported back yet This was a stark reminder that the government s compliant environment policies have changed in name only otherwise they remain as hostile as ever and continue to destroy the lives of black and ethnic minority people BME people many of whom have lived in the UK since they were children  Before the deportation flight the home secretary Sajid Javid declared that many of the foreign national offenders on the flight had committed very serious crimes but soon after this the Home Office admitted that most of the deportees had committed minor crimes such as single drug or driving offences More worryingly people on the Jamaican charter flight had come to the UK as children nine of them were under the age of had indefinite leave to remain ILR and one person even had a British passport Not only were most of the people on this flight more British than foreign they were also being punished twice three times if you include immigration detention for crimes they had already served sentences for 
FEB11	The country I walked through deserves better than Brexit	In May a few weeks before the EU referendum I walked miles from Liverpool to London to see what was happening to my country I was travelling in the footsteps of a march against unemployment that my late father had helped to organise In that year Tory policies had devastated industry and sent unemployment skyrocketing In Tory austerity was putting the final nail in the coffin of those broken communities  Even so on my walk I was shocked by the level of poverty by the sheer number of homeless people in doorways and parks and by the high streets of boarded up shops and pubs full of payday loan outlets and bookies People in those former industrial towns spoke of their anger and betrayal of having being forgotten by Westminster politicians of their communities having been destroyed as the manufacturing that had sustained them either folded or moved to low wage economies 
FEB11	The Green New Deal offers radical environmental and economic change	The revival of the Green New Deal framework first developed in a report published in and popularized by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Justice Democrats in the US is a huge advance for green campaigners and hopefully for our threatened species That is because it has a single radical ask an ecological and economic transformation of the current system to end our addiction to fossil fuels and endless consumption of the earth s finite assets  The Green New Deal demands major structural governmental and inter governmental changes not just behavioural change in our approach to the ecosystem In addition and as in the s such change to be driven by radical structural transformation of the finance sector and the economy It was developed on the understanding that finance the economy and the ecosystem are all tightly bound together Protecting and restoring the ecosystem to balance cannot be tackled effectively without transformation of the other sectors Financing the transformation of the economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels cannot be achieved without a transformation of the finance sector 
FEB11	If Sisi’s brutality in Egypt continues, the results could be dire for Europe	The outpouring of joy that followed Hosni Mubarak s resignation was palpable It was February eight years ago to this day Egyptians of all faiths and ages and backgrounds united by a desire for freedom gathered in Tahrir Square to bring years of tyranny to an end We believed that as the people of the region s most historic power inspired by the success of the Tunisian revolution we were setting in motion a chain of events that would guarantee Egypt s freedom  But after months the dream became a nightmare Letting the military manage the transitional period was probably the biggest mistake of all revolutions never give power to pillars of the old regime Perhaps later on we were complacent our first free presidential election and the subsequent referendum on a new constitution gave us confidence that the changes taking place could not be stopped or undone But the solidarity that defined the protests in Tahrir Square was disintegrating and neither the government of Mohamed Morsi nor any of the other political powers could resolve the differences or abate the fears of the old regime the political parties the army and the people in the street that had started to infuse public life

FEB12	Deal or no deal, both Labour and the Tories will split over Brexit	A casual observer seeing Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn exchange rhetorical blows over Brexit in the Commons today might imagine that they stand on opposite sides of this totemic issue But veterans of the debate know they are equal in determination that Britain should leave the EU They are separated from consensus by small technical matters that can for theatrical effect be inflated into irreconcilable differences That process is testimony to the hold that the two party system exerts over English politics and to much of what is wrong with it  Brexit keeps promising to break party lines and then failing to do so That is partly because pro Europeanism and the British left stand on overlapping cultural ground The remain proposition goes well beyond attachment to EU membership it is driven by revulsion at the nativist spirit of Brexit s marauding generals Nigel Farage Boris Johnson Jacob Rees Mogg and shock that they have hijacked Britain s political identity But that dismay is not exclusive to Labour It is felt by liberal Tories and swing voters who just pine for competent rational government 
FEB12	Polar bears in the playground, Insectageddon … and it’s all our fault	Children s books are filled with fantastic friendships between humans and beasts From a young age we learn that if a tiger comes for tea we should expect it to eat all our sandwiches and if a Peruvian bear drops in for lunch we had better have some marmalade in the cupboard  In this fantasy world we can coexist peacefully with large mammals Meanwhile in real life young people are having fewer wild interactions than ever before In part this is a result of increased screen time and decreased access to wild spaces Perhaps it doesn t help that many countries drove out their most exciting inhabitants lynx bears and wolves centuries ago 
FEB12	The EU looks like the Soviet Union in 1991 – on the verge of collapse	Europe is sleepwalking into oblivion and its people need to wake up before it is too late If they don t the European Union will go the way of the Soviet Union in Neither our leaders nor ordinary citizens seem to understand that we are experiencing a revolutionary moment that the range of possibilities is very broad and that the eventual outcome is thus highly uncertain  Most of us assume the future will more or less resemble the present but this is not necessarily so In a long and eventful life I have witnessed many periods of what I call radical disequilibrium We are living in such a period today 
FEB12	Why it matters to call external female genitalia ‘vulva’ not ‘vagina’	When you find yourself mansplaining the term mansplaining to a worked up faction of Twitter on a Sunday evening you can assume you re not getting the best out of your leisure time And that s not even the most foolish thing a man called Paul Bullen did over the weekend  On Saturday the Guardian published an extract from an upcoming book Womanhood The Bare Reality by the photographer and writer Laura Dodsworth Alongside photographs of external genitalia was first person testimony from the subjects pictured Titled Me and my vulva women reveal all it was an arresting story Bullen spotted the article on Sunday and responded with a tweet that he probably well hopefully now regrets The correct word is vagina 
FEB12	Humanity faces an existential crisis – Labour must join the fightback	Here s the bad news We are quite in a lot of trouble A new study by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that a series of crises from global warming to soil infertility are set to hit us at the same time The consequences could include massive destabilisation not just in individual countries but on a global level From the damage inflicted on human health to a possible economic meltdown caused by mass insurance claims if the US is ravaged by floods and forest fires we are not remotely prepared  Consider just one scenario According to Laurie Laybourn Langton the lead author of the report climate crisis could lead to times more refugees from the Middle East than the million who fled during the past few years of upheaval and turmoil The far right skilfully manipulated and inflamed backlash over this last refugee crisis that s partly why Donald Trump is now president of the US why the far right are in coalition governments in Italy and Austria and why Viktor Orb n s Hungarian regime has been able to consolidate its authoritarian rule What will happen when refugees come in far greater numbers A twisted irony beckons that extremists in the Trump administration aptly labelled climate change arsonists by writer Naomi Klein will make mass forced migration more likely because of their environment wrecking policies and then reap perverse political benefits by whipping up hatred against the resulting tide of human misery 
FEB12	The #ligueduLOL cyberbullying case is the French media’s day of reckoning	The French media world has been in the grip of a deep crisis for the past few days The people at the heart of the scandal say it started as a joke and stemmed from a desire to share some black humour If that is the case the ligueduLOL controversy has turned out to be something much darker and has exposed the everyday abuse that women and minorities face on social media  The Ligue du LOL is the name of a closed Facebook group in which about young and successful journalists media professionals and early day Twitter influencers allegedly coordinated cyberbullying trolling and Twitter campaigns against other social media users mostly women as well as feminist and LGBT activists between and Some of them continued their activities for years after the group was closed 
FEB12	Free money wouldn’t make people lazy – but it could revolutionise work	The danger of so called free money not only underpins critiques of universal basic income UBI but also the incredibly strong narratives that underlie the attitudes to work in the UK and elsewhere and our unemployment benefit system Paid employment is held up as one of the ultimate markers of being a valuable member of society with those not in paid work always described in these narratives as a voluntary position rather than as the result of issues outside their control seen as a drain on society Those out of work are positioned in direct contrast to those in paid employment the shirkers versus the strivers the welfare dependent versus the hardworking families  For those in paid work working hard and being constantly busy are worn as a badge of pride and there are whole industries promising to make us more productive and efficient For some hard work is enforced through workplace monitoring impossibly short breaks or expectations of staff being always on for example responding to emails outside work hours Work is idealised as providing meaning in our lives while at the same time removing us from other sources of meaning such as family friends and our communities through long hours and unpaid overtime The negative psychological social and physical effects of these narratives and assumptions are now being investigated and the centrality of work in our lives and society questioned 
FEB12	Northern Ireland’s young people know their history. If only the rest of Britain did too	Touts are a three piece rock band from Derry The name is a reference to the Northern Irish colloquialism for a police informer which is scrawled and sprayed around their home city the music they make is full of a sense of Derry s violent past and its uneasy present It harks back to the distant days of punk rock but its sheer velocity also speaks of an urge to get on with the future whatever that might be The band are part of a lineage of music interwoven with Northern Ireland s difficult politics and history as the Belfast based music writer Stuart Bailie s brilliant book Trouble Songs puts it raw art that has challenged given stories and provided succour and a sense of collective worth  All three Touts members were born at a time when the Troubles were receding into history two of them were too young to vote in the EU referendum Last week I watched them rehearse in a freezing room on an edge of town industrial estate They talked about Northern Ireland s political predicament with the kind of incisive eloquence that most English musicians seem to have lost Politics is just inescapable coming from here said year old bassist and co vocalist Luke McLaughlin If you have a platform you may as well say something 
FEB12	Spain’s trial of Catalan separatists is an alarming act of state repression	The most important political trial in Catalonia s recent history is about to begin in Madrid The trial is against members of the former government of Catalonia the speaker of the Catalan parliament at that time and the leaders of Catalonia s two largest pro independence civil society groups  These individuals will be prosecuted for having organised Catalonia s referendum on self determination on October The charges brought by the public prosecutor s office and by the far right Vox party representing the private accusation are among the most serious of those envisaged by the Spanish criminal code rebellion misappropriation of public funds and civil disobedience 
FEB12	The NHS lives by co-operation. The privatisers are still trying to wreck it	Some bad ideas are very hard to kill The NHS in England is finally trying to strangle the notion that competition between hospitals is like competition between supermarkets an anti cartel spur to quality and low prices But zombie like the competition mania keeps being resurrected by those who think nothing works without red in tooth and claw markets This ideological fight has battered the NHS for decades  The latest NHS England year plan is all about urging everyone into closer collaboration between community GPs and hospitals and at a stretch social care too without pointless duplication or destructive competition for staff and resources With lengthening waiting lists where s the spare capacity to compete for patients If that sounds like blindingly obvious common sense it isn t to privatisers and marketisers 
FEB13	Carney is right. Brexit could lead to a better, fairer kind of globalisation	It all seemed so simple back in the s Barriers were coming down the free market was advancing to all corners of the world and in return for production being shifted to low cost countries consumers in the west were getting cheaper clothes and gizmos Globalisation was said to be unstoppable The end of history was nigh  The financial crisis and its aftermath have changed the political weather with a decade of low growth unevenly distributed pain and business as usual prompting a backlash Voters in the west have started to focus on globalisation s dark side the multinational companies that avoid paying tax the towns hollowed out by de industrialisation the loss of democratic control over market forces the uneasy sense that the entire edifice is poised precariously on a mountain of debt 
FEB13	Let’s give citizens free cash to save not-for-profit journalism	A flourishing diverse media is essential to a functioning democracy We have neither An already broken model faces an existential crisis Back in the media mogul Lord Beaverbrook told a royal commission on the press that he ran the Daily Express purely for the purpose of making propaganda and with no other object I look at it as a purely propagandist project Today most of the British press remains the plaything of media moguls who profit from a broken status quo  Ideas such as public ownership are popular with the public a poll by one rightwing thinktank found that back nationalisation of the water industry as do more than three quarters with regard to electricity gas and the railways The vast majority of people back higher taxes on the rich Yet these are fringe ideas within most of the mainstream media which marginalises those who support them 
FEB13	For Theresa, bad jam is better than no jam – that's just common sense	Yesterday in Brexit news stockpiling bodybags Today scraping the mould off jam Because this is where we are now Never mind the special place in hell Donald Tusk hopes is reserved for key Brexiters we are already there Truly daily the flames are licking  There was a time when waking up in the morning and seeing the headline Theresa May I scrape the mould off the top of jam and eat what s underneath would be surprising it s the kind of thing someone randomly and without context would come out with in group therapy to an awkward silence But no longer There was a time when an MP moaning that there was a lack of positivity around Brexit news which was prompted by the aforementioned news of stockpiled bodybags would have struck me as odd But no longer The MP was Kate Hoey by the way to absolutely no one s surprise 
FEB13	Football is addicted to gambling – and it’s harming children	It s a fair bet that the new rules announced today aimed at preventing the gambling industry from targeting children will be welcomed by almost everyone Who could be against a ban on betting ads popping up on sites computer games or apps popular with kids such as the promos that were once embedded in the I m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here or Mario Kart apps Given the extraordinary stats that show no fewer than children aged to gamble each week with of those classed as problem gamblers surely any move to keep young eyes away from temptation is to be applauded  But you only have to set out the planned steps to see why they don t go far enough The new rules from the Committee of Advertising Practice insist for example that gambling companies stop featuring celebrities or others who look under in their ads Sounds good until you reflect that the betting companies could simply find a footballer who s or older to do the job instead John Stones say could be subbed off to be replaced by I don t know the new a week man Aaron Ramsey 
FEB13	Dark money is pushing for a no-deal Brexit. Who is behind it?	Modern governments respond to only two varieties of emergency those whose solution is bombs and bullets and those whose solution is bailouts for the banks But what if they decided to take other threats as seriously  This week s revelations of a catastrophic collapse in insect populations jeopardising all terrestrial life would prompt the equivalent of an emergency meeting of the UN security council The escalating disasters of climate breakdown and soil loss would trigger spending at least as great as the quantitative easing after the financial crisis Instead politicians carry on as if nothing is amiss 
FEB13	The self-driving car is a marvel doomed by unpredictable humans	A few years ago I wrote a Guardian article about jetpacks  A mode of transport that seemingly everyone wants and has been expecting and angrily demanding of us scientists for a good while but which is still essentially nowhere in sight I did my best to write about why jetpacks are not likely to be a household item any time soon 
FEB13	Forty years for a mosque killer, when murderers of white victims get 75?	Two years ago Alexandre Bissonnette walked into a Quebec City mosque and opened fire on men at prayer killing six injuring and ensuring that children would grow up without their fathers Known to Quebec feminist and refugee support groups as an internet troll Bissonnette s search history suggested he had been influenced by racist misogynistic shooters such as Dylann Roof Elliot Rodger and Marc L pine After the attack Bissonnette told a social worker he regretted not having killed more people  In court he pleaded guilty and expressed remorse Last Friday in an unusual judgment Bissonnette was sentenced to life in prison with years before he is eligible for parole 
FEB13	Take that, Salvini! How musical justice was served in Sanremo	Italy s Sanremo Music Festival the model for everything from Eurovision to The X Factor is one of the oldest and most prestigious of its kind On Saturday evening year old Alessandro Mahmoud who goes by the stage name Mahmood won the th edition of the festival with his song Soldi Money But this was no ordinary win This win was about much more than music it was political and important  Mahmood was born in Milan to an Italian mother and an Egyptian father His winning song contains Arabic and references Ramadan He has criticised discrimination against gay men in Italy and Egypt The singer embodies much of what Matteo Salvini and other far right figures in Italy would love to erase from their notion of traditional Italian identity the white Christian heterosexual northern model from which Salvini s party the League first took its name 
FEB13	Nationalist strongmen are bent on controlling women’s bodies	When Brazil where I am writing from this week became worried that almost two thirds of its population was black or mixed race radical steps were taken Never mind that the blackness of its population was thanks to its own dependence on African slavery in the first part of the th century Brazil actively recruited European migrants with the explicit aim of whitening itself or keeping in the words of a presidential decree of the most convenient features of its European ancestry  The resulting class and race inequalities in the South American country are part of a complex mix that has resulted in Brazil s own variation on the populist theme Now under the Trump of the tropics as Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro is sometimes described reproductive fascism is back and focused so far on controlling women s bodies 
FEB13	Voter ID trials are dangerous. That’s why I’m taking the government to court	On Wednesday I received a date to attend the high court to fight against the government s dangerous voter ID plans  This case is particularly significant for everyone who lives in my community because next May for the first time ever we will be asked to show identification in order to cast our vote at the local government election Braintree district council my local authority in Essex is one of boroughs across England taking part in the government s pilot scheme before it plans to roll out voter ID at the next general election 
FEB14	History will not forgive May’s reckless push to the no-deal precipice	Just another Brexit day of dither delay and dawdling Just another humiliating defeat for Theresa May at the hands of the party within her party that she dare not confront Clever Anna Soubry won a significant victory the Conservative MP forced the government to agree to publish its no deal advice we shall now know what the cabinet knows We shall see the full horror of the damage a no deal Brexit would do to business and trade Those who brought us to this pitch should remember that a day of judgment will come Someday a judicial inquiry will expose the reckless Brexit chaos into which the Conservative party cast this country Inquiries go on for years but in the end a mighty Domesday tome will record what was done by whom and why If anyone in Labour aided and abetted Brexit they too will be recorded in the annals  The civil service knows observers note the scrupulous care with which officials insist ministers personally sign every decision delay or absurdity they are ordered to carry out They know someday the recording angels will write down the names of everyone to blame 
FEB14	Shamima Begum is just a teenager. Britain should be strong enough to take her back	Shamima Begum who achieved notoriety in as one of three young schoolgirls from Bethnal Green who left the country to join Islamic State has re emerged in a refugee camp controlled by the Syrian Defence Forces in north eastern Syria Understandably given her situation she is about to give birth and has already lost two children she would like to get home But where is home and what does home mean  By her account as reported in The Times she enjoyed living under Isis control even as it beheaded its enemies and left their remains for all to see She was married to a Dutch member of the group who was presumably fighting for the cause and she was ready to bear children who could follow in his footsteps to the frontline She appeared therefore not only to have abandoned her family but also to have firmly rejected the broader society in which she grew up 
FEB14	The Churchill row is part of the glib approach to history that gave us Brexit	Churchill hero or villain Prince Charles goodie or baddie Jesus Christ yes or no John McDonnell modern Herodotus or fool Tick the boxes and pass the GCSE Welcome to the new history McDonnell the shadow chancellor is entitled to dislike Winston Churchill but why for Tonypandy Churchill happened to be Liberal home secretary in and was asked to authorise a small company of soldiers to help local police during the Rhondda disturbances He did so with reluctance and later professed sympathy for the miners The one man who later died was hit on the head by a Glamorganshire policeman The soldiers were not involved  What is this really about The answer is yah boo history binary storytelling charged with fake emotion sucked dry of fact or balance It is history as partisan docudrama Why did McDonnell not mention Churchill s role in the death of hundreds of thousands of innocent Germans Does he not care about dead Germans Is he for bombing civilians 
FEB14	From Tahrir to Trump: nationalism has hijacked the hope of the people	Thousands of people in Tahrir Square chanted the slogan Bread Dignity Freedom It was and the height of the Arab spring Standing on my own in the crowd I recalled a middle aged worker I d met in Buenos Aires a decade earlier telling me why he and his colleagues had taken over a factory during Argentina s economic collapse He rattled off reasons such as hunger poverty and inequality But then his voice changed And the boss he said Well he never said good morning to us and you know that destroys your dignity  Defending one s dignity sometimes tastes sweeter than the bread yes even when you re hungry
FEB14	Who’s the biggest failure in the Brexit cabinet: Chris Grayling – or Liam Fox?	How badly do you have to mess up these days before you re not allowed in Theresa May s cabinet Just how far does tolerance stretch You might imagine Chris Grayling to be the ultimate prototype in this real world experiment with his granting then cancelling of a m ferry contract to a ferry company with no ferries but let us also observe the progress of Liam Fox  Fox is one of the most vocal and optimistic Brexiteers in politics In he declared that a trade deal with the EU would be one of the easiest in human history In he promised to replicate the EU free trade agreements that exist before we leave the European Union so we ve got no disruption of trade and they would be ready one second after midnight in March 
FEB14	Shamima Begum was groomed. She deserves the chance of rehabilitation	It s impossible not to feel a jolt of shock when confronted with the photo of Shamima Begum on the front page of this morning s Times Four years ago when we last saw her it was accepted that Begum had been brainwashed There was consensus that she was an innocent child who d been groomed online Begum was allowed to be the victim in the nation s narrative one that over decades had grasped the power and dangers of grooming because that demanded nothing from us She was the little girl who d been caught up in a dangerous death cult the pixelated image of a kid caught on CCTV about to fly and that was sad  It was also made easier by her absence We only needed to empathise with Begum s situation in the abstract Of course we wanted her to be rescued and returned to Britain immediately But that was just a fantasy I can t have been alone in assuming these girls would simply meet a horrible fate in the fighting abroad Having been found alive and nine months pregnant in a Syrian refugee camp Begum is no longer an abstract concept Instinctively it feels a little harder to say we should bring her back to her home in the United Kingdom especially given her apparent lack of remorse And yet is she not still a victim of grooming Still a British citizen we should be looking to help 
FEB14	The secret to happiness? Health, housing and job security	For some time sensible people have been arguing that governments need to focus less on economic growth and more on the wellbeing of citizens Be careful what you wish for  In response to this demand from David Cameron instructed the Office for National Statistics to gather data on people s self reported happiness and life satisfaction Little practical good has come from this so far but a new report by George Bangham for the Resolution Foundation is one of the best attempts to make useful sense of the data He concludes The best prospects for policymakers targeting future increases in national wellbeing lie in raising job quality raising incomes particularly at the lower end and policies to improve security in the housing market 
FEB14	Chimpanzees ‘talk’ just like humans. It’s time to realise how similar we are	It s a bit garbled but you can definitely hear it in the mobile phone footage As the chimpanzees arrange their branches into a makeshift ladder and one of them makes its daring escape from its Belfast zoo enclosure some words ring out loud and clear Don t escape you bad little gorilla a child onlooker shouts from the crowd And POP with that a tiny explosion goes off inside my head Something knocks me back about this sentence It s a kids say the funniest things kind of sentence and in any other situation I d offer a warm smile and a chuckle of approval But not this time This statement has brought out the pedant in me  At this point you may wonder if I m capable of fleshing out a word article chastising a toddler for mistakenly referring to a chimpanzee as a gorilla The good news is that though I am more than capable of such a callous feat I don t intend to write about this child s naive zoological error In fact this piece isn t really about the gorgeous I m sure child It s about us You and me and the words we use 
FEB14	Ignore the free-trade evangelists. Brexit can create a fairer economy	It all seemed so simple back in the s Barriers were coming down the free market was advancing to all corners of the world and in return for production being shifted to low cost countries consumers in the west were getting cheaper clothes and gizmos Globalisation was said to be unstoppable The end of history was nigh  The financial crisis and its aftermath have changed the political weather with a decade of low growth unevenly distributed pain and business as usual prompting a backlash Voters in the west have started to focus on globalisation s dark side the multinational companies that avoid paying tax the towns hollowed out by de industrialisation the loss of democratic control over market forces the uneasy sense that the entire edifice is poised precariously on a mountain of debt 
FEB14	Confused? Here’s my guide to Valentine’s Day in the #MeToo era	I ve always liked Valentine s Day and believe men who dismiss it as commercialised nonsense are joyless tightwads My enthusiasm dates back to primary school My teacher made us cut scraps of shiny red paper into heart shapes glue them to flimsy cards and write messages inside to our mums although I remember wanting to give my card to a girl named Demelza  Ernest Hemingway said he had to be in love to be able to write When I was a teenager in the s I had to be in love to go to school My love was usually unrequited so Valentine s Day offered an annual shot at redemption In year I loved Tammy so I wrote a haiku inside a Valentine s card and placed it on her desk along with a Terry s Chocolate Orange Thanks said Tammy I said I loved her You don t know what love is she said and went to maths 
FEB15	The school climate change strikes are inspiring – but they should shame us	Such is the upside down topsy turvy state of our world that the children are now the adults and the adults are the children In Westminster our supposed leaders men and women of mature vintage keep stamping their feet and demanding what no one can give them  They insist they should be allowed to gobble up all the birthday cake and still have cake left to eat threatening to storm out of the European Union and slam the door behind them As Dominic Grieve the former attorney general rightly puts it Threatening to leave is the behaviour of a three year old who says that they are going to hold their breath if they do not get the toy that they want 
FEB15	Our destiny is in the hands of Rees-Mogg’s unfinished robot sidekick	Where are you on Steve Baker on a scale of one to so completely over him The deputy chair of the European Research Group took to the airwaves today to warn mildly that parliament passing Theresa May s withdrawal agreement would collapse the government Furthermore Baker complained I really do rather object to being called hardline  Oh dear Given the need to find alternative arrangements for describing Steve Baker let s look at technological solutions It s as if someone had half an idea to build a fun geeky robot sidekick for Jacob Rees Mogg then became so bored or repulsed by the task that they gave up before they d fitted him with a cool metallic exoskeleton Somehow the unfinished unit picked itself off the workshop floor and found its way to parliament By rights Steve Baker is just the innards of something that had it been completed you might find in the background of a Mos Espa docking bay scene in The Phantom Menace Instead he s one of the fanatics holding our national destiny in his partially assembled hands The more versatile politicians of this golden age have two expressions Steve Baker has one Steve Baker s sole expression is cocking his head slightly to the side as if to say I m listening politely and reasonably when what he is actually saying is Let s just fucking burn it all down and see what happens 
FEB15	My generation trashed the planet. So I salute the children striking back	The Youth Strike Climate gives me more hope than I have felt in years of campaigning Before this week I believed it was all over I thought given the indifference and hostility of those who govern us and the passivity of most of my generation that climate breakdown and ecological collapse were inevitable Now for the first time in years I think we can turn them around  My generation and the generations that went before have failed you We failed to grasp the basic premise of intergenerational justice that you cannot apply discount rates to human life In other words the life of someone who has not been born will be of no less value than the life of someone who already exists We have lived as if your lives had no importance as if any resource we encountered was ours and ours alone to use as we wished regardless of the impact on future generations In doing so we created a cannibal economy we ate your future to satisfy our greed 
FEB15	AI can write just like me. Brace for the robot apocalypse	Elon Musk recently busying himself with calling people pedo on Twitter and potentially violating US securities law with what was perhaps just a joke about weed both perfectly normal activities is now involved in a move to terrify us all The non profit he backs OpenAI has developed an AI system so good it had me quaking in my trainers when it was fed an article of mine and wrote an extension of it that was a perfect act of journalistic ventriloquism  As my colleague Alex Hern wrote yesterday The system GPT is pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible both in terms of the quality of the output and the wide variety of potential uses GPT is so efficient that the full research is not being released publicly yet because of the risk of misuse 
FEB15	I swallowed the Brexit lies. Now I regret telling curry house workers to vote leave	One of the many myths and mysteries of the referendum campaign is that people from the south east Asian community backed a leave campaign that was so often linked to bigotry  The truth is they didn t A majority of voters of south east Asian heritage supported remain but more of us voted for Brexit than anyone expected Not only was I one of them I also bear some responsibility as the head of an organisation that urged our members and restaurants to vote leave 
FEB15	Call the Midwife takes women’s side over abortion. But the BBC is failing us	Call the Midwife is a wonderfully successful programme a slice of dramatised social history that centres on women s experience It tackles many difficult issues recently we saw a young woman find out that she was intersex and the introduction of the cervical smear It manages to be warm and moving while reflecting the quiet bravery of so many women A triumph It is if you like always on our side  I never thought of it this way before even though I know the BBC as an institution is not always great for women It does not promote women into its senior management roles it does not pay women equally and it is happy to crank out routine misogyny on many of its flagship shows such as Today in the guise of banter 
FEB15	Measles is on the rise. But telling anti-vaxxers they’re stupid won’t fix it	After reading the news that cases of measles have soared by in the last year I recalled the first time I heard an anti vaccination conspiracy theory It wasn t from a member of Donald Trump s administration or part of a frenetic grammatically challenged Facebook post it was from a classmate when I was at school Her family wasn t waging a crusade against medical science they simply gave credence to disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield s study that wrongly asserted a link between the MMR vaccine and autism Back then the study had not yet been discredited  One only has to stray into anti vaxxer internet forums for a few minutes to see that they re stuffed with conspiracy theorists opportunists reactionaries and worst of all hubristic idiots This is the vanguard of the anti vaxxer movement But behind that vanguard are a lot of concerned parents who are being convinced of wild and dangerous ideas because we and by we I mean those of us who recognise the incontrovertible fact that vaccines are essential aren t talking to them properly A number of the anti vaxxer vanguard may have started life as concerned parents but have gradually sunk into increasingly extreme positions because the only communication they re getting from the other side is that they re foolish and irresponsible Almost every week the internet produces another diatribe against anti vaxxers or a listicle of their horrifyingly stupid social media posts 
FEB15	Attacks on the media show Duterte’s Philippines is heading for despotism	 I will do the right thing Maria Ressa CEO of the Philippines news site Rappler told reporters as she was led away by police officers having been served a warrant for her arrest in her own newsroom Agents from the Philippines National Bureau of Investigations arrested Ressa concerning a continuing and much inflated digital libel case this Wednesday in Manila She was freed a day later having paid a bond of Philippine pesos This is now the sixth time the veteran journalist has been obliged to post bail  In what has been a damaging but depressingly predictable blow to press freedom in the Philippines it s yet another warning sign that President Rodrigo Duterte is accelerating towards an all out authoritarian state 
FEB15	The arts were supposed to champion diversity. What went wrong?	In February the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence made recommendations for eradicating institutional racism within the police Although the arts culture and media sectors were not a target of the report we can similarly trace the uptake of what would later become known as cultural diversity within these institutions particularly at a time when the political context was invested at least rhetorically in eradicating racial prejudice  This week years on from the report Arts Council England published its annual report on diversity within the arts sector showing that in some areas arts organisations are treading water 
FEB16	Brexit extremism is going nowhere. Now the moderate millions must act	For three years the worst of Britain has been in charge The Britain that says it is elitist to tell the electorate it can t have the impossible The Britain that has patted itself on the back for threatening the rule of law and the independence of MPs The Britain where it is normal for supporters of Jeremy Corbyn to call the BBC s political editor a bitch and a whore and demand her dismissal for crimes against the party line and for supporters of Nigel Farage to send death threats to MPs The Britain with no middle only extremes  Millions have been airbrushed from the national story Conservatives who voted to remain Europeans who have made Britain their home for so long they are British in everything except their paperwork British citizens living in the EU and everyone in the UK who wants to live in the EU but whose rights are being taken away in a vast state power grab 
FEB16	Andrea Levy gave a voice to all my silenced forebears	Andrea Levy wrote to understand where she came from I read her to understand where we come from I was when Small Island was published in and had just started working at the London Review Bookshop The voice of the protagonist Hortense a Jamaican woman who worked hard and expected more from everyone reminded me of my maternal grandma and her nursing friends all of whom I respectfully called aunty It was the first time I had read a depiction of people like my relations in the pages of a novel I had already encountered another Jamaican Hortense in literary fiction in Zadie Smith s triumphant debut White Teeth However it is Levy s Hortense who is devoted to Britain the Mother Country who truly brought me a deeper understanding of home  How often it seems the Windrush generation is often more British than the British their upbringing was strict under traditional British colonialism They honoured and adored the Queen as their head of state their language is formal and accented RP and their manners correct they are so serious that you cannot help but smile 
FEB16	Tormenting Meghan Markle has become a national sport that shames us	In the period when the acquisition of the former Meghan Markle was depicted as little short of a national triumph much was written in the British press about her various accomplishments These are after all roughly as common in royal spouses as successful independent careers Meghan the actress and blogger and charity worker is also it emerged a skilled calligrapher   I ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well she once told an Esquire journalist who d described her writing as incredible What it evolved into was my pseudo waitressing job when I was auditioning 
FEB16	Nan Goldin on art, opioids and the need for positive action	Netflix recently sent up the art world in its feature film Velvet Buzzsaw It s a strange hybrid of spoof and horror but an early section in which ludicrous money is thrown around and gross consumption and cut throat competition are par for the course is the most successful A later gag in which a gallerist mistakes a pile of bin bags for a new work is surely the dad joke of satire It descends into a mess of blood and gore when the paintings of a freshly discovered outsider artist become sentient and take their revenge on the people who profited from them  The artist Nan Goldin famous for her intimate photographs of a certain kind of New York life is continuing her admirable fight to highlight the more gruesome aspects of the real art world After a call to arms on Instagram Goldin and her activist collective Pain Prescription Addiction Intervention Now staged a die in at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan scattering fake prescriptions chanting and unfurling signs The statistics laid bare by the red and black banners were stark dead dead each day Shame on Sackler read one Take down their name read another

FEB16	Tate Modern’s neighbours missed the point: cities make voyeurs of us all	When you live in the city the world is full of nosy parkers I should know because I am one I remember my early forays up to London from the West Country on the National Express coach coming in via the Westway as the sun was setting  As the sky turned indigo lights would flicker on in the flats that overlooked the dual carriageway giving me a direct view into the lives of strangers I would glimpse them standing at stoves slumped on sofas or sitting on the phone clutching a fag and a bottle of beer These domestic scenes were for the teenage me fleeting urban postcards idyllic snapshots of what my own life could be 
FEB16	The trip from London to Lincolnshire showed me the Brexit divide’s depth	What was it the Queen said As we look for new answers in the modern age I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view coming together to seek out the common ground and never losing sight of the bigger picture She spoke those words last month at the centenary of the Sandringham Women s Institute humble occasions are no enemies of wisdom and they are understood to refer to the social and political division caused by the Brexit vote I remembered the gist of them last weekend as our train trundled towards Boston in Lincolnshire a town on the other side of the Wash from the monarch s Norfolk estate  The division between migrants and natives long predated Brexit and the vote was a consequence rather than a cause of it
FEB16	My generation trashed the planet.

FEB18	I backed the SDP. But this Labour schism makes no sense at all	The great Brexit crisis slices through both parties dividing families friends neighbours and colleagues It may yet break apart the moribund political system But that seismic rupture didn t happen today when seven MPs walked out of the Labour party  Seven is a pitifully small number The timing is monstrously badly judged and the reasons the MPs give are oddly scattergun lacking political punch and focus To be sure they are not alone in thinking Jeremy Corbyn a weak leader with many failings his poll ratings show most of the country agrees as did the Labour MPs who voted no confidence in him two and half years ago as his kinder gentler politics turned poisonous 
FEB18	Britain could deradicalise Shamima Begum – with compassion	The CCTV images of the three teenage girls Shamima Begum Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase passing through Gatwick airport four years ago en route to join the Islamic State caliphate were shocking for much of the British public That Isis was radicalising people online was no surprise but the fact these three girls were as young as and from the same academy school in Bethnal Green east London cast the risks of radicalisation closer to home  The discredited counter radicalisation strategy Prevent was meant to stem the recruitment of homegrown terrorists including those recruited into the far right but has disproportionately focused on Islamist extremism without yielding any significant concrete results Last year for example an essay by the late Marxist political theorist Norman Geras on the political uses of violence was deemed so dangerous under the Prevent programme that Reading University students were warned not to leave it lying around where it could be seen by those who are not prepared to view it The university flagged the text as an extremist piece of work that should only be read in a secure setting 
FEB18	History will judge the selfish breakaway Independent Group	The reasons offered by the Independent Group for their departure from Labour at their launch press conference simply do not stand up to scrutiny  First Brexit Labour has opposed the Tories at every stage fighting Theresa May s broken exit plan voting against no deal and putting Labour s policy including the possibility of a further referendum to a vote by MPs 
FEB18	If Corbyn doesn’t want the Labour split to worsen, he has to listen	The ball is now in Jeremy Corbyn s court Whether the new Independent Group of MPs that split from the Labour party on Monday takes off largely depends upon what the leader does now to address the three crisis issues dividing him from the mainstream in his party Europe antisemitism and the attempted mass deselection of Labour MPs  The group if it coalesces into a party of some kind will struggle in the unforgiving world of our first past the post electoral system The SDP of which I was an enthusiastic founder member shortly after my th birthday because of my admiration for Roy Jenkins and Shirley Williams is not an encouraging precedent The SDP got to of the vote in alliance with the Liberals in the election but the two parties combined won only seats and most of the Labour MPs who defected to it lost their seats Significantly for the Independent Group far more Labour MPs lost their seats from joining the SDP than from deselection at the hands of far left activists 
FEB18	You get the heroes you deserve. And Brexit Britain has Gavin Williamson	What a time to be alive for Conservative former chief whip turned defence secretary Gavin Williamson  Keen to turn back the clock to the days when Britain s men in uniform could brutally quash a native uprising in the morning appropriate half of India s wealth in the afternoon and enjoy a G T or seven in the evening the man who once kept a pet tarantula in his office to cultivate an air of ruthless cunning has appropriated an image befitting his new role action man 
FEB18	Facebook is out of control and politicians have no idea what to do	Death threats bullying mental torture privacy invasion election rigging fake news monopoly abuse as was said of a medieval pope this is merely to suppress more serious charges It is hard to recall the social media of years ago and its offer of universal love democracy and global peace Britain s parliament has finally caught up and today s Commons report is at least unequivocal A menace stalks the land and must be curbed  Some of the report s accusations are astonishing Facebook purposefully obstructed the committee Its boss Mark Zuckerberg who continues to choose profit over data security held parliament in contempt His rambling empire is portrayed as lying thieving digital gangsterism Yet British electoral law is puny It is unfit for purpose leaving elections vulnerable to foreign influence disinformation and voter manipulation Not a week passes without evidence that cybersecurity is inadequate and public services have been left vulnerable to hacking 
FEB18	Stop the online conspiracy theorists before they break democracy	Organised conspiracy theorist networks have launched an all out information war across Europe At the heart of this is the QAnon movement It expanded from the US to Europe and the UK at rapid speed hijacking political debates on social media as well as mass protests in the streets in recent months Our new analysis at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue shows that European conspiracy theorists run increasingly sophisticated campaigns around critical junctions in national regional and global politics They even carried out social media operations to influence voters in German state elections including the election in Bavaria  The QAnon community which began on the message board site chan strongly overlaps with the support networks of far right movements such as the EDL and Pegida Most recently it co opted yellow vest demonstrations and boosted hardline Brexit campaigns and Tommy Robinson protests By injecting conspiratorial narratives into these movements its members can leverage existing networks and alter their political direction A commonly used tactic is to combine conspiricist hashtags with those of viral campaigns and trending topics The scale this generates is disproportional enough to distort public perception In ISD identified close to m uses of the word QAnon across Twitter YouTube and forums such as Reddit and chan 
FEB18	Brexit-led nationalism is destroying Britain’s overseas aid effort	Wearing a colourful dashiki shirt given to him by the president of Rwanda Andrew Mitchell leaned forward in his armchair eyes gleaming and explained why the Conservative party s pledge to spend of GDP on international development was solid Any attempt to change party policy on aid would fail Mitchell told me because there are too many of us who won t put up with it  That might have been the case when we met months ago it s not now The political consensus on aid which has lasted two decades and led to Britain becoming a world leader in aid and development has fallen apart 
FEB18	England lacks white working-class graduates. Quick fixes won’t change that	At half of England s universities fewer than of students are classified as being from disadvantaged white backgrounds according to a new report from the National Education Opportunities Network Neon This fact is bluntly stated as being a problem in the introduction of the report rather than the conclusion but it is worth looking beyond these headline figures What do reports like this really tell us  Who attends university and which university they attend is a question that captures commentators and policymakers for reasons that are related to but not fundamentally about education Universities are both pathways and gateways They can help train you to get somewhere new but they also work to make sure that only the right sort of people get into positions of power These functions overlap but aren t the same 
FEB19	The choice is clear for Labour MPs. Stay with Corbyn or leave the party	There is a phrase that has a lot of currency among Labour MPs who hate the direction their party has taken under Jeremy Corbyn They say they will stay and fight The vow is sometimes taken in private sometimes declared on social media alongside a plea for others to do the same It has become so familiar that its meaning is rarely interrogated  But what is this fight Who is it against What does victory look like The answers are not comfortable for the stayers The enemy is the elected leader of their party and he enjoys the overwhelming support of its members Corbyn s position is so unassailable that his would be assailants hardly dare to criticise him They grumble about Labour s position on Brexit and agitate for the endorsement of a second referendum They express horror at the way antisemitism has eaten into the party like gangrene and demand surgical intervention But in public the dissenters avoid pointing blame squarely at the leader or even at individuals in his entourage 
FEB19	The return of King Rat Derek Hatton marks a new low for Labour	In a single day the Labour party has lost Luciana Berger and gained Derek Hatton As swaps go this isn t dissimilar to giving someone an orgasm and them giving you gonorrhoea the loss of a hard working campaigning constituency MP Berger was among seven MPs to resign from Labour and the official welcoming back by a three person panel of a man so odious that he infamously delivered redundancy notices by taxi to his own council staff  To sum up Hatton in a brief vignette at the Labour party conference in Liverpool I was in a coffee shop searching for wifi and hit on a hotspot someone had called Derek Twatton 
FEB19	Carmakers quitting Britain won't blame Brexit – it's not in their interest	In a wave of anti Japanese nationalism gripped China Angry crowds burned down Japanese owned factories smashed Japanese made cars and pelted Tokyo s embassy in Beijing with eggs It was an experience that jolted Japanese business leaders and they decided to make sure they never again relied on one country for essential widgets and especially the finished article  In the months before the Brexit vote Japan s government warned that a victory for the leave campaign could have a negative impact on investments in Britain The Japan Business Federation noting that more than Japanese firms have a presence in Britain joined the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in pleading with Britain to remain in the EU 
FEB19	At last, a Brexit dividend – shame it’s for the pedlars of fake medicine	Some crimes are just worse than others When I tell people I research the market for fake and substandard medicines their most common reaction is Fake cancer medicines That s horrible Why would anyone do that  The World Health Organization reported earlier this month that fake leukaemia medicine packaged for the UK market to look like the genuine drug Iclusig was circulating in Europe and the Americas The short answer as to why anyone would do something as morally awful as this is of course to make money The fake leukaemia drug containing mostly paracetamol is being sold for a pack a pill in the US or a pack in the UK There is now a far larger market for legal medicines than there is for illegal drugs such as heroin or cocaine and there s a much smaller chance of getting caught The genuine pills are for seriously sick people so if a patient doesn t blossom back to health after taking fake treatments doctors generally blame the tumour not the pill 
FEB19	A poll shows support for Labour’s defectors – it could tempt Tory MPs to follow	For a party that doesn t actually exist yet the movement born from the wreckage of what was once the Labour mainstream seems surprisingly popular  The first poll to test the water since seven MPs abandoned Jeremy Corbyn shows a new centrist party against Brexit in third place behind Labour and the Tories and already beating the old centrist party against Brexit otherwise known as the Liberal Democrats Or to put it another way in hours it s achieved the kind of market share that Ukip took decades to get near 
FEB19	Can Bernie Sanders repeat his surprising success this time around?	Bernie is back  It s easy to forget the condescension and amusement that greeted himwhen he announced his first campaign for president in May 
FEB19	The British far right is leaderless – and all the more dangerous for it	Over the past year there have been a number of far right demonstrations in London some of which have attracted as many as people Whether it was the Free Tommy Robinson event in July or the Brexit betrayal demonstration in December the far right descended on the capital in numbers not seen in decades perhaps not since the interwar period of the s  The primary focus of this string of demonstrations has ranged from the imprisonment of anti Muslim activist Robinson real name Stephen Yaxley Lennon to the supposed suppression of free speech especially in regards to speaking about Muslims and the perceived betrayal of the Brexit vote by politicians and elites Similarly has kicked off with a number of small yellow vest demonstrations also focusing on Brexit 
FEB19	How would I deradicalise Shamima Begum? With Islamic scholarship	How do we deradicalise young indoctrinated people like Shamima Begum As part of their ideology takfiri terrorist groups such as Islamic State and al Qaida justify their aggression towards the west by creating a divide between Muslims and non Muslims They argue that the modern nation state model of governance is incompatible with Islamic principles and that the Muslim world must be governed by a caliphate based on medieval Sunni Islamic jurisprudence From her recent interviews it is clear that Begum is confused and conflicted about these issues she has clear loyalty to Isis but did also criticise them and called Britain home  The medieval Muslim model of the world has been adapting and evolving for at least years and modern Islamic jurisprudence accepts that the nation state system is entirely compatible with Islam 
FEB19	Bees brought Bavarians together. And they have a lesson for us all	Last week Bavarians forced their state legislature to change farming policies with the most successful petition in the state s history And while the law proposed by the petition covers a range of measures it s no surprise that campaigners rallying cry quickly became save the bees Bees stand for diligence dedication and orderliness But they are also a symbol of our relationship with nature and everything that has been wrong with it for decades Bees are emblematic of how the fight to save our planet and stop runaway climate change cannot wait They are our canary in the coalmine  Bees are essential for our food supply apples courgettes almonds one in every three bites we eat depends on bees and other pollinators But soil sealing and industrial monocultural agriculture using bee harming pesticides have caused a massive decline in bee populations worldwide to the extent that apple farmers in China have to pollinate their trees by hand 
FEB19	Podemos was the dazzling new force in Spanish politics. What went wrong?	It was only five years ago that Spain s break out party Podemos became a dazzling new lodestar for Europe s lost and troubled left But with a snap election just weeks away it now risks a crash as spectacular as its rise Has the leftwing populist model of ponytailed rebel Pablo Iglesias and his gang of talented young thinkers so admired by many Jeremy Corbyn backers and others around Europe proved a failure  Polling suggests the party is in deep trouble Podemos once led the polls and very nearly snatched leadership of Spain s left from prime minister Pedro S nchez s Socialist party at the elections but it is now only the voters fourth favourite party The meltdown means it is slated to lose half its deputies while S nchez gallops ahead taking well over twice as many votes as Podemos on April 
FEB20	The splitting of the Tories and Labour could redefine British politics	Heidi Allen Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston are not the first MPs to break away from the Conservative party The list of Tory resigners goes back to Winston Churchill in and beyond And they are unlikely to be the last Back in October I had a coffee at the Tory conference with a cabinet minister who confessed Part of me is longing for Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees Mogg to become leader so the rest of us can just leave and join a new party  Wednesday s departure of the three amigos as Allen called them at their press conference does not make that much larger Tory fissure a certainty much will depend on the Brexit endgame But it makes it more likely It also marks a potential watershed for the st century Conservative party When the three former Tory female MPs and their gender is definitely part of the story crossed the floor of the House of Commons this morning they threw down the gauntlet to an entire generation of st century Tory modernisers to either stand up or stand down 
FEB20	Whatever Meghan does, she’s damned. Let’s not repeat history	Last month I nominated Meghan Duchess of Sussex as a hate figure for the nation in the person we all need to get us through a difficult time like your cousin s girlfriend who waxes her eyebrows and yammers on about yoga at the start of a fraught Christmas As I then explained about a million times on Twitter I was joking I do not hate Meghan or even consider her vaguely hateful I could no more despise the woman than I could flick through the pages of a magazine and take against a salt and pepper male model with a watch on She wasn t the point the point was that society quests ceaselessly for an enemy and if you re going to have one at least let it be one who probably won t care  This was right in an ambient premonitory way but I was wrong to think it was funny The poor woman is being vilified round the clock this week for having the audacity to have a baby shower with her friends in New York It has gone beyond the point of mattering what her personality is like were anyone in any position to know she would have to be so thoroughly bad to warrant this level of scrutiny so devoid of human feeling so malicious in every intention that the media s daily censure wouldn t be enough We d have to paint her yellow and black like a bee 
FEB20	The Independent Group will at last give us real opposition to Brexit	Democracy abhors a vacuum The realignment that is happening now in our politics is the inevitable consequence of of the electorate feeling politically homeless A majority of our people who feel that neither of our main parties share their values principles and integrity  The decision of Heidi Allen Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston to join the existing Labour members of the Independent Group begins what I hope will be a process that will finally give a voice to a so far silent majority of voters I admire them for beingwilling to put their heads above the parapet to defy the onslaught of abuse I know too well and to be brave enough to look beyond a vote taken nearly three years ago and to acknowledge the clear and present danger Brexit now poses to the livelihoods jobs and quality of life of both leavers and remainers 
FEB20	UK museums should be honest about being stuffed with stolen goods	Museums are in crisis In the past their social role has been taken for granted they re spaces for preserving objects and educating the deferential public that comes to admire them It s a tidy completist dream wouldn t it be nice to see the whole of human history free and open to all  Except that history is nasty and ugly It s full of violence every moment every event takes place within a power dynamic there s always a hierarchy in play The whole concept of The Museum is a colonialist imperialist fantasy born from the fallacy that somehow the whole world can be neatly catalogued contained in a single building mapped out for easy digestion There s no such thing as a free object and every piece in a museum has been moved from its original context It s uncomfortable and rude to look too closely at what that move involved 
FEB20	New York is right to ban hair discrimination. Now how about the UK?	New York City s new legal guidance on discrimination based on hairstyle is a thing of beauty It points out that there is a widespread and fundamentally racist belief that black hairstyles are not suited for formal settings and may be unhygienic messy disruptive or unkempt and deems natural hair textures that are tightly coiled or tightly curled and black hairstyles such as locs cornrows braids fades and afros a protected racial characteristic This means that is now illegal to target black people based on their hair or hairstyle at work school or in any public place and if you do you may get fined  In a country where our elected representatives think it s OK to describe ethnic minorities as having a funny tinge on live television it appears that British conversations around the nature of hair texture and hairstyle discrimination and how they intersect with race are rudimentary at best But now is the perfect time to consider the experiences of those of us living in Britain with kinky coily hair and whether Britain should introduce similar laws 
FEB20	The clitoris is a gift, so why is there an ingrained fear of talking about it?	The first UK conviction for female genital mutilation FGM this month was a milestone in the fight for the basic human rights of women and girls But one of the things that stands out from the news reports of that case is how oddly furtive they were about communicating the key facts in particular their avoidance of the C word clitoris  In reporting such a prominent case are readers unable to be shown the correct medical terminology Why do the media carefully avoid mentioning what occurred using highly generalised anatomical terms before quickly moving on If this lack of detail was to spare the victim the indignity of having such a personal matter discussed so publicly I would have sympathy however I do not think that this is the case here What I think is at play is a deep rooted fear of the clitoris 
FEB20	Javid’s decision on Shamima Begum demeans his office	Politics has always to some extent been the art of combining doing what s right with doing what s in one s own political interests It would be naive to pretend otherwise But in recent months with a weak prime minister desperately trying to cling on to power and senior Tories hungrily eyeing the top job it feels like naked political ambition is shaping real world outcomes more than ever before  Nowhere is that more evident than in Sajid Javid s decision to revoke Shamima Begum s British citizenship In trying to position himself as Theresa May s successor the home secretary is signalling to the tabloid press just how tough he is on national security and immigration Perhaps as a son of immigrants he feels he has more to prove 
FEB20	My grandfather was a Nazi. I’ve seen why we need the EU	Until his death in the early s my grandad was a committed Nazi Most of his elder brothers died in one night at the battle of the Hartmannsweilerkopf in the first world war In a bitterly traumatised interwar Germany defined by hatred against foreigners Jews and democracy as well as delusions of national grandeur he was unemployed for most of the s He joined the Nazi party early and volunteered to fight in He became a staff sergeant in the Wehrmacht and led a so called anti partisan unit on the eastern front and participated in the capture of Kiev  We believe he took part in the September Babi Yar massacre in which more than Jewish inhabitants of Kiev were shot Until his death he would rant about Jews the French and the perfidious Albion He never left the country again and he d be in a near panic when coming close to a border 
FEB20	How to cure the shopping addiction that’s destroying our planet	I ve always thought of myself as someone who cares about the environment I ve recycled for as long as I can remember I m on my way to having a plastic free kitchen and I always try to take public transport instead of driving But until last year I was guilty of unknowingly contributing to m tonnes of waste a year more carbon emissions than the shipping and aviation industries combined and microplastics ending up in the ocean just by buying new clothes  A cross party report has found that people today buy and discard clothes faster than ever and it means we get rid of more than m tonnes of clothes a year with m worth going to landfill every year The implications of this are so bad that there have been recent claims that the fashion industry can be listed alongside the oil industry as one of the five most polluting industries in the world 
FEB20	Young climate strikers can win their fight. We must all help	This one has to succeed It is not just that the youth climate strike now building worldwide with tremendous speed is our best and possibly our last hope of avoiding catastrophe It is also that the impacts on the young people themselves if their mobilisation and hopes collapse so early in their lives could be devastating  To help this movement win we should ask why others lost We should ask for instance why Occupy despite the energy and sacrifices of so many came to an end while the institutions it confronted remain intact We should wonder why the global justice movement of the late s and early s despite the numbers involved their courage and determination has not changed the world We should consider why Podemos the Spanish party that rose so high on the optimism of the indignados movement now seems to be spiralling into recriminatory collapse 
FEB21	Shamima Begum has a right to British citizenship, whether you like it or not	When I was I stopped off in Holland during a camping holiday with a friend We bought as much marijuana as we could and smoked it all in an afternoon Sat behind a housing estate in the border town of Nijmegen we giggled rambled and lay around until the local police came They took us back to the campsite we found the fact that they spoke Dutch hilarious where we were asked for our passports and train tickets They already had our number a couple of idiots out of their minds and out of their depth They told us to get on the next train in the direction of the port We d stopped laughing by then We went home  Adolescents do stupid things Often they know they are stupid at the time
FEB21	These Tory defectors are the Thelma and Louise of British politics	At the end of Thelma Louise as the net closes in on the outlaws Geena Davis s character turns to her friend and says she doesn t ever remember feeling this awake The freedom they craved may be violent and volatile compared to the steady suburban unhappiness of the lives they left behind but at least now it feels as if there s something to live for  There was a hint of something similar about a gleeful Heidi Allen declaring as she left the Conservative party this week that she was tired of feeling numb about politics that she hadn t felt this excited in years The self styled three amigos driving away from the Tories into an uncertain future as independents will no doubt have suffered their share of sleepless nights over this particular road trip But compared with the rather grief stricken press conference given by their colleagues leaving the Labour party the excitement was palpable and for a certain kind of female voter it s undoubtedly infectious 
FEB21	The EU must resist impatience with Britain – for its own sake	 I will celebrate said an emphatic German voice behind me while some dignitary on stage mouthed the conventional polite platitudes of regret about Britain s departure from the EU I will celebrate when it s over at last A week spent talking to politicians officials and opinion makers on the continent tells me that this captures the prevailing mood among Britain s frustrated and increasingly contemptuous European partners just get the negotiated withdrawal agreement across the line and Britain out of the door then we can go back to fighting the real battles for Europe starting with the European elections  While I understand all the feelings and calculations behind this view it is profoundly shortsighted It abandons those of us still fighting for Europe in Britain and underestimates the EU s role in deciding Britain s future A divided country in the midst of a collective nervous breakdown is painfully dependent on the reaction of its now much stronger EU negotiating partner This explains why every tweet from Donald Tusk every hint from Jean Claude Juncker every nuance from Michel Barnier is pored over in the British media with almost Sovietological attention The EU is a major actor in the British debate not merely a reactor to it The conclusion is clear it s not just Britain that faces a big choice over Brexit it s also Europe 
FEB21	The City may thrive despite Brexit, but the rest of us won’t	An iron law of modern British government says that whatever London wants London gets On Monday with no fuss or publicity the Bank of England and a group of City interests reached an apparently boring deal in Paris with the European Security and Markets Authority It follows a similar deal with the European commission last December Both state in effect that as far as the City is concerned if there is a no deal Brexit Brexit did not happen It was just play acting by idiots down the road in Westminster  Up to tn in financial guarantees insurances hedges and other derivatives all within the EU s regulatory regime is said to be at risk in the City s clearing houses For everyone involved this is a grownup business not to be left to the mercies of the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees Mogg The regulators have duly issued licences to the clearing houses allowing Europe s banks to disregard EU rules and continue trading on London s derivatives platforms Financially speaking London is to become a free port Sighs of relief all round 
FEB21	Barbie, a kitsch throwback? At least she wears it on her sleeve	There is a lot of excitement over the release later this year of the sequel to Frozen but in my house greater anticipation is reserved for the Barbie live action movie due out in with Margot Robbie in the title role For the last few years Mattel Barbie s makers have been fighting competition from more modern Disney heroines and the movie in which Barbie is reportedly expelled from Barbie world for not being perfect enough is part of the brand s attempt at a feminist rejigging  I was never big into Barbie as a child She and Ken seemed underpowered compared with my gang of hulking great Sindy dolls and their single beau Action Man with his weird felt hair and khaki jeep and switch at the back of his head that actually made his eyes swivel Sindy has no presence in America however and among my daughters fourth birthday presents were palaeontologist Barbie and scientist Barbie They are also committed to a seven season Barbie animation on Netflix called Life in the Dreamhouse 
FEB21	Once Brexit is over, what’s left? A two-party system that kills optimism	Brexit breaks everything it touches scything through the country risking the union itself Now it bites chunks out of both main parties both richly deserving these desertions More defections may follow up to from Labour are said to have considered it while Heidi Allen claims a third of Tories would jump if no deal is in prospect Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve have confirmed they are among them  This is as it should be because Brexit is the most momentous political crisis of our lifetimes overriding all other political issues crossing party lines Right now in these crucial weeks every good MP should put the fate of the country first and do all they can to stop Britain teetering over the Brexit precipice They should threaten their rigid leaders with whatever damage they can inflict to make them change direction 
FEB21	Gay conversion therapy proves there’s still bigotry towards LGBT people	The results of a new survey on the evidence and impact of gay conversion therapy in which same sex attracted individuals are treated in order to become straight are shocking But I for one am not surprised that there still exists bigotry and prejudice towards us As an out lesbian I witness it on a regular basis  The survey by the Ozanne Foundation led by Church of England lesbian activist Jayne Ozanne attracted more than responses Of those people said they had tried to become straight had attempted suicide and had been forced to have sex with someone of the opposite sex 
FEB21	We cannot allow Liam Fox’s post-Brexit trade plans to go unscrutinised	The government cancelled parliament s recess at short notice so as not to give the impression MPs were on holiday a matter of weeks before we face crashing out of the EU  The international trade secretary Liam Fox is using the opportunity to avoid proper scrutiny of plans that threaten our rights our environment and our democracy He tabled a general debate on post Brexit trade agreements with the US Australia New Zealand and the Trans Pacific Partnership for Thursday And he is expected to launch negotiations soon after the debate with no chance for parliament to stop him 
FEB21	What next for the Independent Group? Here’s a winning manifesto	This week s eruption of the new Independent Group in parliament has been caused in part by the toxic culture that has taken hold within each of the established parties Bullying intimidation and racism covert and overt have already persuaded MPs to jump ship probably to be followed by more in due course But if they are to gain a permanent foothold in British politics they will need to morph into a more normal party and establish policies that distinguish them from Labour and the Conservatives What policies might appeal to both social democrats and liberal conservatives alike  Start with this the stale brand of politics practised on both frontbenches is inherently conservative It looks back to a mythic past that never was and never could have been Tories increasingly look askance at the liberal open and cosmopolitan Britain that is emerging many of them want to shut off the world raise our borders reduce immigration insist on social modes and mores that went out of fashion decades ago Labour now seems like something of a s tribute band champing at the bit to nationalise the public utilities re establish a ministry of labour bring back sectoral wage bargaining and repeal most of the Trade Union Acts Each of these pasts is a deeply nostalgic vision of a Britain that is not coming back however much governments huff and puff 
FEB21	I served in the Met. The lack of progress on diversity is disgusting	The question that needs to be asked is not are the Metropolitan police institutionally racist or why does black and minority ethnic recruitment for the police still lag so far behind the diversity of London as a whole It should simply be Why do young black and minority ethnic people reject the Metropolitan police as a career choice  This week marking years since the landmark Macpherson report on institutional racism in the police the Met said it would take years for the force to mirror the wider diversity of London and will remain disproportionately white Why 
FEB22	Charles Dickens was a ruthless Victorian husband. Like my great-grandfather	Domestic tyranny was a fact of Victorian life men who were saintly in public could behave very cruelly behind their front doors In close to the end of her life Catherine Dickens began to confide to her neighbours in Camden north London a few details of how her late husband had treated her Charles was by now eight years dead and the couple had last lived together in around the time the novelist began his long affair with the young actress Ellen Ternan But the public knew nothing of this relationship  Dickens worldwide reputation as a compassionate moralist the enemy of humbug and suffering continued to flourish untainted by the facts of his private life Naturally the neighbours Edward Dutton Cook and his wife were shocked when Catherine told them how Charles had once tried to have her locked up as a madwoman 
FEB22	Just when the country needs Tom Hanks, we get Derek Hatton	Derek Hatton George Galloway Chris Williamson Ken Livingstone these guys may not physically sit together in public life but I definitely think of them as a grouping In fact it is perfectly possible that over time they could be joined by like minded individuals from the right Galloway got on like a house on fire with Nigel Farage during the referendum Unfortunately both of them seem to have been pulled from the inferno unscathed  Yup you can totally picture their independent minds dovetailing with disaffected MeToo defendants or even defectors from the daytime schedules such as Noel Edmonds If things were different they d hang out more with their brother from another mother Julian Assange Like I said it s a mood it s a feeling They don t have to share every view Most of them will have an objection to paying the licence fee say while only some of them will get slightly aroused when they think about Marine A Quite a lot of them actually And not just the obvious ones 
FEB22	The odds are against them, but these MPs could yet change our politics	Westminster has a new parlour game Since Monday a conversation with anyone in or around politics will open with a round of So what are the chances for this new Independent Group Players are encouraged to produce ever smarter reasons why the cluster of MPs who broke from their former parties eight from Labour three from the Tories is doomed to fail Bonus points are awarded for historical references or imaginative use of polling data By way of a warm up there are the obvious early arguments New or third parties do notoriously badly under our first past the post electoral system just look at the SDP There are no heavyweight figures to match the Gang of Four who broke from Labour in The Independents have no leader and no clear policy stance  What s more within three hours of launching they were playing defence after one of their number Angela Smith seemingly referred to black and minority ethnic people as having a funny tinge a racism so crude it was bewildering Notice too how they struggle to surmount the contradiction of demanding a people s vote on Brexit while refusing a people s vote on themselves by refusing to trigger byelections in their own seats 
FEB22	The ugly truth about Karl Lagerfeld’s reign	Karl Lagerfeld is dead and the fashion industry he presided over from the house of Chanel rends its garments and calls itself heartbroken His muse a white cat called Choupette which exists largely on Twitter a metaphor for his misanthropy so pure I thank him was photographed in a mourning veil thanking us for our words of condolence That his best beloved was literally inhuman and very small is no surprise It is rumoured that if she exists she will inherit his fortune though that is illegal in France  I do not think Lagerfeld really liked women It is impossible to watch his work and think he did It is impossible to watch his face immobile from surgery or not I can t say and think he liked himself It is obvious and often noted that fashion doesn t have to be misogynistic and exclusionary fashion is merely expression and expression is morally neutral But it certainly became those things in the era when Lagerfeld was dominant In a world that is pure hierarchy he had the power of a medieval pope and he could have used it to make fashion less exclusionary and more joyful Consider the changes that Edward Enninful is making at British Vogue He employs Paris Lees a trans woman as a columnist and his first cover featured Adwoa Aboah a mixed race woman Lagerfeld was rarely so benevolent or brave profit was his calling and misogyny his method At home meanwhile he preferred to idolise a cat 
FEB22	Calling everyone who criticises Corbyn ‘Blairite’ is crazy	Splitters Traitors The People s Front of Judea I am quite enjoying the current shenanigans of those people who say they just can t take it any more Some are sick of Brexit Some want a people s vote Some are disgusted at the acceptance of antisemitism Some are probably terrible careerists out only for themselves though this seems a rather unlikely way to do it Some may be people you want to go to the pub with Some you would cross over the street to avoid I couldn t possibly comment  Never mind Some probably just look at their own their leaders and wonder what they have to lose Jeremy Corbyn nonchalant about George Galloway being readmitted Galloway Oh why not Degsy Hatton lasted all of two days in the in out shake it all about Labour party where you can say nasty things about Jews to some of the people just some of the time As usual none of this matters if you utter the magic word neoliberalism every other sentence 
FEB22	If news is dying, who will safeguard democracy?	Journalism has joined the list of endangered professions teaching it appears to be more lucrative than doing it A great deal of brilliant and high quality journalism is still being pursued around the world every day but the news industry is steadily shrinking Why is that  Let s make a distinction here between journalism and news News is only one of the many kinds of journalistic output News as a standardised non fiction literary form was invented more than years ago in response to very specific social and cultural conditions and was ignited by a new technology called the telegraph The invention of the electric telegraph in the s allowed the fast and international transmission of bursts of information in short staccato messages which were ironically not unlike tweets 
FEB22	France has an antisemitism problem – and not just from the gilets jaunes	The issue of antisemitism has taken centre stage in France in the last few days following a spate of violent attacks President Emmanuel Macron even said that it was at its worst level since the second world war The gilets jaunes yellow vests movement has also been infiltrated by this bigotry Last weekend gilets jaunes protesters hurled antisemitic slurs at Alain Finkielkraut a prominent philosopher and ardent supporter of the movement as he was walking by a rally While the movement as a whole is not antisemitic extremist groups both far right and far left have effectively co opted it turning it into a platform for a range of hateful narratives As support continues to decline the movement is becoming increasingly dominated by a radical and sometimes extremist minority  Yet reading the attack against Finkielkraut as an isolated episode or as a symptom of a movement spinning out of control misses an important truth that early on the very nature of the movement has allowed hateful voices to weave their way into its ranks 
FEB22	Burberry’s noose hoodie is part of a shameful fashion tradition	A year ago Gucci put an offensive jumper on their Milan catwalk although it took that long to actually cause offence  The wool balaclava jumper was black with a cut out mouth and red lips which when pulled up over the wearer s face bore a disturbing resemblance to blackface At the time no one seemed to notice I missed it too and I missed it again when it went on sale last autumn both of which now seem inexcusable looking at it it couldn t be anything else Yet it wasn t until February this year that flags were raised on Twitter as is often the case these days and even then only within the context of Black History Month Gucci apologised and took the jumpers off the shelves even though they had already sat there for a good six months 
FEB22	The EU must resist impatience with Britain – for its own sake	 I will celebrate said an emphatic German voice behind me while some dignitary on stage mouthed the conventional polite platitudes of regret about Britain s departure from the EU I will celebrate when it s over at last A week spent talking to politicians officials and opinion makers on the continent tells me that this captures the prevailing mood among Britain s frustrated and increasingly contemptuous European partners just get the negotiated withdrawal agreement across the line and Britain out of the door then we can go back to fighting the real battles for Europe starting with the European elections  While I understand all the feelings and calculations behind this view it is profoundly shortsighted It abandons those of us still fighting for Europe in Britain and underestimates the EU s role in deciding Britain s future A divided country in the midst of a collective nervous breakdown is painfully dependent on the reaction of its now much stronger EU negotiating partner This explains why every tweet from Donald Tusk every hint from Jean Claude Juncker every nuance from Michel Barnier is pored over in the British media with almost Sovietological attention The EU is a major actor in the British debate not merely a reactor to it The conclusion is clear it s not just Britain that faces a big choice over Brexit it s also Europe 
FEB22	Tory defectors are just getting involved in a Labour party tussle	I find it difficult to fathom why three Conservative MPs would wish to join the Independent Group formed by Labour MPs They argue that the Conservative party has shifted away from them under Theresa May over the last year and a half There is no evidence to support this  The party is rightly moving away from the austerity of the David Cameron George Osborne years It is highlighting the need to govern for the whole nation and to take care of those places and people that need more support It has championed the higher living wage building on Labour s introduction of the minimum wage It has taken care to progress policies of toleration and support for minorities to give more weight and money to mental health issues and has now announced major new funding for the NHS These are all things I as a supporter of the European Research Group also support 
FEB23	Put yourself in Shamima Begum’s shoes before you damn her out of hand	Less than two weeks after Shamima Begum was discovered in a Syrian refugee camp she s public enemy number one Eight in people believe she should be stripped of her British citizenship say so even if that leaves her stateless  The home secretary Sajid Javid might regard this as vindication of his disgraceful decision to deprive Begum of her citizenship last week But others have expressed dismay at the level of public vitriol 
FEB23	May I have a word about… actors, hackers and shape-shifting balls	Did you know that there was a league table of state sponsored hackers  No me neither but apparently Russia is the quickest out of the blocks for launching aggressive global cyber attacks with an average breakout time the time it takes to move from a compromised computer to others in an organisation of minutes and seconds while Iran is a positive sluggard with an average breakout time of hours and minutes This research comes from an organisation called CrowdStrike which as you might expect goes big in its mission statement 
FEB23	Asbestos has haunted Scotland for decades and our children still at risk	In the dismal argot of government few working class families in west central Scotland have not been adversely affected by bad health choices and outcomes  Heart disease and cancer in particular seem to have developed a peculiar attachment to those who lived and worked near yards and factories and inhaled the fumes of mass production Politicians academics and health professionals almost all of them sincere and intent on doing the right thing like to reduce their analysis of these patterns of bad health into easily digestible bites that seem to make sense to the rest of us If only we would all drink less eat better and reduce our salt and sugar intake why Scotland could become the gym bunny of Europe 
FEB23	Buoyed by freedom, the rebels are now able to follow their consciences	Of all the party s factions Labour First was the most practical It wasn t filled with rosy cheeked Blairite missionaries from the upper middle class or with Corbynites who had never recovered from their first reading of Lenin as the joints were passed around in the s  Working class and hard headed the Labour First rally at last year s conference echoed to calls of stay and fight Corbyn Show offs would walk away hawking their conscience around from body to body asking to be told what to do with it as Ernie Bevin hero of old Labour s right put it Real Labourites would do the hard work to recapture the party from the far left 
FEB23	In exploring this united kingdom, I discovered a still proud separateness	I am English by birth and British by nationality Brexit reminded me that I am Celtic by origin Not for emotional reasons but because my paternal grandfather was born in Newry County Down And that entitles me to Irish citizenship which I was granted last year and an Irish passport which is being processed at the moment Thanks to Dublin I have salvaged my European identity which I hold as dear as I do my Englishness and Britishness  Growing up in London I had no sense of an Irish or Scottish identity But inspired by my newfound Irish citizenship I found myself last month staring at an imposing stone oblong slab at St Patrick s church in Newry a couple of miles from the border with the Republic of Ireland The words The Glennys of Newry were engraved in large letters and behind it lay the graves of my great my great great and my great great great grandfathers 
FEB23	‘Barking mad’... how Dickens led to our modern gaslighting men	If not exactly a local saint like Churchill or Florence Nightingale Charles Dickens comes close enough for his reputation to have largely survived to date the documented mistreatment of his wife Catherine mother of his children She was publicly dumped by him denigrated and separated from all but one of their children having become fat and to Dickens dull  Indeed as the playwright Martin McDonagh demonstrated in a recent play A Very Very Very Dark Matter the reputational damage has been so scant that his hilarious reimagining of the creator of Tiny Tim as a foulmouthed lecherous fraud came across as not so much counterfactual as wildly blasphemous 
FEB23	The Observer view on the robust action needed to curb 'online gangsters'	It would have been fascinating to be a fly on the wall or a bug in the software at last week s meeting in San Francisco between Jeremy Wright the culture secretary and Mark Zuckerberg the elusive boss of Facebook Mr Wright did not willingly share a lot of data afterwards though who knows what might end up online He described the talks as useful while Facebook reported a positive and productive conversation  The fact that a cabinet minister was obliged to travel to California after Mr Zuckerberg declined repeated invitations to appear before parliament gives an insight into the relative balance of power as pressure grows to impose a semblance of order integrity and legality on a chaotic online digital world By deigning to meet Mr Zuckerberg gave the impression that he was doing Wright a big favour 
FEB23	The Observer view on the future of the Independent Group	More than half of the UK electorate think the political system is broken That s according to a poll published by the charity Hope not Hate last week Just under seven in of those polled also said that they think none of the main political parties speaks for them It s not hard to imagine what s motivating these sentiments Parliament remains gridlocked on the most important question facing the country for decades Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are plainly putting their party interest before the national interest on Brexit Other issues that matter to people school funding how we care for older people have been all but squeezed out of the debate  Could a new political party go some way towards fixing these problems That s the question facing newly independent MPs who left the Labour and Conservative parties last week of whom have formed a loose grouping the Independent Group There was something refreshing about watching these MPs call time on their parties floundering leaderships And there was much to agree with in their critiques For Labour by far the most serious charge is the leadership s failure to respond adequately to the antisemitic abuse being committed by some of its members It is damning and shocking to witness a Jewish Labour MP leaving a party with a proud anti racist history because the disgusting abuse shows no signs of abating in Of course Mr Corbyn s failure to adopt a coherent position on Brexit was also a big factor for most of the departing MPs 
FEB23	Breakdancing at the Olympics? Bring it on...	Good for Paco Boxy the face of British breakdancing who came out with a punchy one might say nominatively characteristic comment on hearing that the sport was to be included pending ratification in the Olympic Games in Paris   A lot of people will look at breakdancing as just spinning on your head or doing the worm he said but the people that I know train like athletes They go to the gym swimming train every day For this to go in the Olympics is massive 
FEB23	The Japanese aren’t daft – that’s why they’re getting out of Brexit Britain	One of the few remaining elegant wooden buildings in central Tokyo that survived allied bombing in the second world war is the Mitsubishi lodge The Kaitokaku set back from the main thoroughfares its gardens overshadowed by skyscrapers is a web of beautifully carved wood rooms where executives bankers and clients who are part of the Mitsubishi keiretsu or conglomerate network socialise with top officials from the phenomenally influential ministry of international trade and industry MITI and discuss business privately drinking sake until three or four in the morning Deals are done new technologies discussed and consensus reached on what is happening geopolitically to Japan s markets and how it should react  The closeness of the relationship between business finance and state is a universe apart from anything we know in Britain Critics argue that the keiretsu represents a destructive corporatism and an obstacle to the operation of free and open markets admirers that it allows member companies to share risks find synergies lower financing costs and encourage long termism so informing Japan s agile industrial policy and directly leading to Japan having dozens of world beating companies and brands By contrast Britain is not at the races 
FEB24	If Labour aids a Tory Brexit it will be destroyed by what follows	Even now after all that s happened over the past few days and with everything to come Labour politicians and their aides cling to one of two excuses for their position on Brexit The first will come most often from an MP for some kicked about northern seat I voted remain of course they generally begin but my constituents wanted Brexit And so despite all misgivings Brexit they shall have Soft Brexit naturally as soft and as yielding as a goosedown pillow because our clear eyed good hearted representative looks at the tragedy at Honda and knows they want no more of that but enough Brexit they hope to satisfy the voters appetite  The second excuse usually comes from those closer to Jeremy Corbyn by employment or inclination For them Brexit is something to be endured for the greater good of enabling Labour to kick out the Tories So nail those six tests to the door even if they are to use a technical term bollocks offer to help Theresa May with her deal strike a tone both constructive and ambiguous 
FEB24	Jussie Smollett’s story shows how intolerant of ‘victims’ we really are	One of the many moral panics of our time is that of victimhood culture Apparently we are too indulgent of those who can claim victim status a state especially rife among students The story goes that this has turned us all into eternal babies coddling us protecting us from micro aggressions and signalling an erosion of individual grit and autonomy in favour of mimsy whining  In an effort to invert unfair power structures some claim victimhood culture has only succeeded in replacing them with different unfair power structures where those who used to be at the bottom now hold the whip hand over those who used to be at the top Women terrify men who are forever fearful an offhand remark will become a harassment lawsuit and racial minorities secure jobs at the expense of white people the moment their unusual names are spotted on a CV The writer Lionel Shriver called it privileging the disadvantaged Shriver also told BBC Radio that white men in the UK are on the bottom rung of society because they are considered to be the most powerful demographic reader I can reveal they are Victimhood culture advocates engage in a lot of doublethink 
FEB24	I salute the new independent MPs – here is my advice to them	Let us start with the wisdom of Edmund Burke the founding father of not so thoughtless conservatism The unfortunate independent member has nothing to offer but harsh refusal or pitiful excuse or despondent representation of a hopeless interest In the House he votes for ever in a dispirited minority Can we conceive of a more discouraging post of duty than this  I did it for four years from to and believe that Burke was wrong Looking back on it I reflected that being an MP like being a soldier was something that I did not much enjoy doing but I enjoyed having done And I found a friendly space in the House of Commons MPs on all sides treated me as an historical oddity rather than a threat to their party system My parliamentary friends were of the awkward squad 
FEB24	There is now a force to disrupt Brexit. MPs, it’s time to act	One of the great lessons of the th century is that history has no direction as Isaiah Berlin and Karl Popper argued and as the transformative upheavals of showed to thrilling effect there is no secular version of providence no ideological script to follow So it has been alarming in the past few years to watch the two main parties surrendering to different versions of the teleological delusion  The Conservative party has embraced Brexit as a mythic nativist destiny towards which we must all march loyally Labour meanwhile is in thrall to the old left determinism in which all the core debates have long since been settled devotion to the leadership must be absolute and all that remains is for those who are foolish enough to think otherwise to be stripped of their false consciousness For those of us who believe in pluralist politics it has been a depressing spectacle a battle between desperate certainties that slide pointlessly over the gritty unpredictable reality of st century life Which is the principal reason why the foundation of the strong Independent Group of formerly Labour and Tory MPs has been so refreshing 
FEB24	Real pain lies behind the fiction of true-crime dramas	Though I m better known as an arts journalist for most of my career I ve been a crime reporter I ve covered headline making cases from the serial killer Levi Bellfield the subject of ITV s recent drama Manhunt to that of Shannon Matthews whose abduction was the subject of the BBC drama The Moorside I m proud of the careful responsible reporting of those cases by journalists and am always inspired by the diligent work of police lawyers and jurors in public courtrooms all over the country  That s why I m wary of fictionalised true crime Writers of dramas take the trauma of real lives but then without the same obligations of accuracy and fairness that journalists or documentarians have can play fast and loose to make fiction about relatively recent crimes Some is breathtakingly casual Who did not wince at John Malkovich s recent musings on the Today programme about David Mamet s new black farce about a very badly behaved movie mogul It s a terrific piece of writing he told us 
FEB24	Sajid Javid is pandering to rightwing press over Shamima Begum	A media rule of thumb beware those moments when competing editors leader writers and commentators agree with each other and politicians leap on the bandwagon It always heralds a moral panic  This has been perfectly illustrated by the case of Shamima Begum the year old Islamic State recruit who gave birth to her third child the previous two having died in a Syrian refugee camp She would have been an easy target at any time Now with Britain s parliament in disarray and the country hopelessly split over Brexit here was a rallying point for collective outrage Nobody surely could disagree 
FEB24	Why binary politics leaves Britain all at sea	Eton College s most admirable attribute I ve long thought is its motto A Latin phrase but not one that would have been familiar to the Romans Floreat Etona translates as May Eton flourish Contractually speaking that s watertight No bombast and no virtue signalling Good luck anyone saying that particular institution has hypocritically betrayed its aims or principles This place is about this place It s like someone proclaiming I m all about me it steals the thunder of any accusations of selfishness  On consulting the college s website however I discovered that Floreat Etona is not strictly speaking its motto Eton s motto is often thought to be Floreat Etona it says but Esto perpetua May it last for ever came into usage if anything a little earlier I m not sure what the if anything is doing for that sentence I think if anything it s superfluous That s to say I think it s a superfluous if anything If anything The website carries on In fact neither phrase is officially a motto they are unofficial creations that over time have stuck 
FEB24	Shock value has its role for animal rights campaigners	Judging by its wiry dun coloured fur its ears and snout the dog was perhaps an airedale lying side on and close up to the camera But identification was difficult because most of its body had been skinned and it seemed in the process of being barbecued whole The arresting image was the title screen still from a video about the protest methods of animal rights activists  Readers reacted quickly Please get this off our screens without delay It is horrible that the Guardian would stoop so low and call it journalism One person complained that the title and content of the article gives no clue that a close up image of the face and body of a butchered animal will appear and it is not directly related to the content either In the context of serious video journalism exploring a strand of contemporary political activism there was clear editorial justification for reporting signposted the mock barbecue staged by protesters in a shopping precinct in Sydney Their sign on the barbecue read If you wouldn t eat a dog why eat a lamb Go vegan 
FEB24	Independents offer hope to those who despair of our broken politics	Winston Churchill who left the Tories to become a Liberal and then went back to the Conservatives wryly congratulated himself Anyone can rat but it takes a certain ingenuity to re rat  He is the exception to the rule that switchers don t succeed in British politics It is an enormous decision when an MP chooses to break with a party to which the politician will very often have committed decades of his or her life It means the ruination of friendships and the wrecking of family relationships And it is much more often than not a choice that leads to doom This is why so many Labour and Conservative MPs stay within their parties even when they are in the most profound despair with where they are going or how they are being led They resign themselves to bitter self imprisonment in the belief that splitters never prosper 
FEB24	A new politics? That lies with the people, not the Independent Group	The launch of the new Independent Group was a golden opportunity to do politics differently The most high profile of its eight former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna even described it as the beginning of a new politics Really It all felt frustratingly dispiritingly same old same old Politicians behind podiums at a press conference a stone s throw from parliament telling us it s about them what they know what they will do and why they should be in charge This categorically is not a new politics because that wouldn t be about them it would be about us  This is what those MPs should have done to demonstrate a new politics They would have gone anywhere but Westminster to a vibrant community hub for example They would have brought together lots of different people from varied backgrounds especially the young They would have sat with them not in front of them The people would have talked first and the politicians would have responded It would have been live streamed with people asking questions and making points from wherever they were Climate change would have been a key issue 
FEB25	At last, Jeremy. Now Labour’s mission must be to prevent any Brexit	Sliding closer day by day you can hear the swelling excitement of the catastrophists at the thrilling prospect of a no deal smash out Into the unknown Hurl all the old certainties into the air and see what new patterns the broken fragments make on the floor Break all rules start again bring on the Brexit revolution  They take no heed when the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte cautioned them on Monday We are sleep walking into no deal scenario It s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you Wake up This is real European council president Donald Tusk and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar added warnings of a chaotic Brexit the grown ups trying to restrain the out of control teenagers punching each other up inside what purports to be the British government Since there can t be a reopening of the withdrawal agreement or a breaking of the backstop in the Irish border settlement Tusk says It s absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal So Theresa May tiptoes closer to the edge at serious risk of an accidental last minute plunge 
FEB25	Green Book’s Oscar shows Hollywood still doesn’t get race	It s now four years since the OscarsSoWhite hashtag put Hollywood movie making in the dock over its failure to acknowledge black achievement A lot has happened since Moonlight memorably won the best picture Oscar two years ago Mahershala Ali and Viola Davis have won supporting actor prizes and Jordan Peele has a best original screenplay gong Alongside them several other black artists have been nominated  But the OscarsSoWhite campaign was not meant merely as a tick box exercise in counting the number of nominations It was meant to make Hollywood rethink how it tells black people s stories and to reward black artists in the best possible way by giving them the chance to have their voices heard 
FEB25	What lunch with the PM taught me: her dullness disguises a dangerous power mania	Have I told you about the very long lunch I once had with Theresa May I was reminded of it as I watched a clip of her playing pool with the Italian prime minister at an EU summit at the weekend The lunch went on for several hours or so it seemed All space and time came to a halt as I sat there staring at my cutlery in a state of existential despair failing somehow to communicate with her I gave up the will to live between the starter and the main course and just kept glancing over at her security detail on another table wishing I could be with them Ordinary people talking  This was when I worked at a rightwing newspaper and would often be taken along as a token woman to meet Tory grandees Some of them were quite a laugh Some sort of fun and gossip could be had Some were incredibly dull and thick Some sent me into a trance they were so boring And some were just obnoxious Ann Widdecombe for instance was I felt nasty to the waitress To me that breaks the th commandment I remember asking her what star sign she was just to annoy her 
FEB25	If Labour aids a Tory Brexit it will be destroyed by what follows	Even now after all that s happened over the past few days and with everything to come Labour politicians and their aides cling to one of two excuses for their position on Brexit The first will come most often from an MP for some kicked about northern seat I voted remain of course they generally begin but my constituents wanted Brexit And so despite all misgivings Brexit they shall have Soft Brexit naturally as soft and as yielding as a goosedown pillow because our clear eyed good hearted representative looks at the tragedy at Honda and knows they want no more of that but enough Brexit they hope to satisfy the voters appetite  The second excuse usually comes from those closer to Jeremy Corbyn by employment or inclination For them Brexit is something to be endured for the greater good of enabling Labour to kick out the Tories So nail those six tests to the door even if they are to use a technical term bollocks offer to help Theresa May with her deal strike a tone both constructive and ambiguous 
FEB25	Brexit is too important to be rushed. Let’s calm down and press ‘pause’	Delay delay delay Today s parliament well mirrors the nation It is implacably split It cannot make up its mind on how to leave the EU next month So it should just stop calm down and think  There is a sensible way forward into the two year transition period and it is called Theresa May s deal with the EU But since some Tory fundamentalists will not have it and hold her in an arm lock to move forward requires Labour cooperation EU negotiators are at a loss as to why such cooperation has not been forthcoming The answer is that Labour s Jeremy Corbyn is as much an anarchist as the Tory fundamentalists So there is stalemate Hence the wisdom of delay A decision has been made to leave the EU Every bit of evidence from business and trade to opinion polls and lobbyists shows a desire to maintain frictionless trade at least in goods and services with a future Europe It is equally plain that MPs have shown that finding such a compromise is beyond them The House of Commons will stand with the Rump Parliament as among the worst in history 
FEB25	How big tobacco keeps cancer rates high in countries like mine	Caring for people with cancer in Bangladesh as I do every day should be getting easier After all we ve had a decade long economic boom with extreme poverty rates halved This in turn has led to dramatic health benefits with large reductions in maternal and child mortality  So why aren t we seeing similar improvements in cancer 
FEB25	A huge land grab is threatening India’s tribal people. They need global help	About million indigenous people in India are in danger of being evicted from forests that their ancestors have lived in for millennia This grave injustice follows a shocking supreme court ruling that rides roughshod over the rights of India s indigenous people known as Adivasi or tribals  According to the census these tribal people number million almost of the country s then billion population It is the largest indigenous population in any country in the world occupying of India s geographical terrain 
FEB25	Don't trust the adults in the room on climate change	There s an inspiring new slogan gaining traction among venerated pundits and politicians of a certain age that claim steadfast commitment to the cause of stopping catastrophic climate change Get off my lawn  Most recently California senator Dianne Feinstein scolded a group of middle schoolers with the group Youth v Apocalypse who had joined the Sunrise Movement to call on Feinstein to back a resolution in the Senate supporting a Green New Deal In a now infamous exchange Feinstein barked that I know what I m doing and that she has been doing this for years so they better just bugger off and let the adults work To be fair the video was edited to comply with Twitter s content guidelines In the full clip she also offers them an internship 
FEB25	Homeless people need a home first, support second	As news breaks of the scarily high numbers of homeless people arriving in British hospitals with diseases we thought we d left in the past such as tuberculosis there s yet more soul searching about what can be done to help So what do homeless people really need It sounds naive and obvious but the answer is housing They need homes more than anything else Rough sleepers especially urgently need a permanent roof over their head as of right  Recently I have been sofa surfing It was more difficult than I can really explain I endured daily insecurity often not knowing where I would stay that night I applied successfully to be housed and have now been offered a home Because that is what I needed it doesn t take a genius to work out that homeless people need some sort of a home 
FEB25	Deportation for being single? This shows the real bigotry gay people face	Last week it was revealed that a year old man faces deportation to Malaysia because Home Office officials and a tribunal judge refuse to believe he is gay Yew Fook Sam known as Sam came out two years ago and spent months in Harmondsworth immigration removal centre He arrived in the UK in after his wife found out he had been having sex with ladyboys in Thailand and left him  The Home Office has suggested the fact that Sam does not have a boyfriend raises suspicions about the legitimacy of his asylum claim leading to a rejection of his claim His lack of sexual partners lent weight to their suspicions 
FEB26	Another referendum has edged closer. With Labour behind it, remain can win	No unnamed Labour source can mask what s happened and no professional Corbyn sceptics can derail it There is now a real prospect of another referendum Labour has committed to several parliamentary manoeuvres including one final stab at its own Brexit which will certainly fail another to support Yvette Cooper s attempt to push no deal further into the realm of destructive fantasy where it belongs and a vote on an amendment demanding that any Brexit deal approved by the Commons must be ratified in a public referendum In that public vote Labour will campaign to remain in the EU   Sources within Labour continue to deny this new reality even as its senior frontbenchers have announced it It s a disgrace one told me that unelected unsourced voices are briefing against Labour s frontbench If they want to speak for the Labour party a staffer said they should stand for the Labour party The position as it stands now is not the seismic shift some suggest It is a continuation of the policy adopted at Labour s party conference last September And credit for it belongs with the grassroots of the Labour party 
FEB26	What do Labour MPs think of the party’s shift on a second Brexit vote?	As the dust settles on Labour s announcement this week major problems emerge The first is the belief that you can game the system from a desk in Westminster to get the outcome you want When significant numbers of voters want to leave without a deal at all a choice between May s deal or remain is not democratic MPs rightly want to avoid no deal but to pretend we can settle the will of the people when a major popular option is simply left off the ballot paper treats people as if they are stupid They aren t Why aren t we learning  https web archive org web https www theguardian com info ng interactive jan sign up for the guardian opinion email
FEB26	For the Independent Group, even Nando's is a photo opportunity	It is day eight of the existence of the Independent Group which is currently polling at according to YouGov The group has said it will hold off calling byelections for now and is not at this stage registered as a political party but in its early days it is of course keen to raise its profile This has led to a number of beautiful photo opportunities press conferences and broadcast appearances Let s take a look shall we  A photo of the group s first outing was tweeted last night by Chuka Umunna As so often with politicians trying to appeal to the people it was a food based photo opportunity 
FEB26	At last, Jeremy. Now Labour’s mission must be to prevent any Brexit	Sliding closer day by day you can hear the swelling excitement of the catastrophists at the thrilling prospect of a no deal smash out Into the unknown Hurl all the old certainties into the air and see what new patterns the broken fragments make on the floor Break all rules start again bring on the Brexit revolution  They take no heed when the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte cautioned them on Monday We are sleep walking into no deal scenario It s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you Wake up This is real European council president Donald Tusk and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar added warnings of a chaotic Brexit the grown ups trying to restrain the out of control teenagers punching each other up inside what purports to be the British government Since there can t be a reopening of the withdrawal agreement or a breaking of the backstop in the Irish border settlement Tusk says It s absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal So Theresa May tiptoes closer to the edge at serious risk of an accidental last minute plunge 
FEB26	If we’re heading for a hard Brexit, then we’re heading for a united Ireland	The year is and the prime minister David Lammy has just phoned the Sinn F in leader Mary Lou McDonald to congratulate her on victory in Ireland s unification referendum The deputy prime minister Nicola Sturgeon tweets that she hopes Scotland will follow suit in the referendum she secured at the last election for taking the Scottish National party into coalition with Labour Gerry Adams gives the dedication as a statue of Jacob Rees Mogg is unveiled in Crossmaglen The Tory leader Amber Rudd refuses to publicly blame her predecessor Boris Johnson for the breakup of the union but like the rest of what s left of the country she knows the truth  As anyone involved in the Good Friday agreement will tell you principles guarantee no deal It s why the current Brexit negotiations between the UK and itself are going so well Theresa May has red lines the European Research Group ERG has absolute red lines the Democratic Unionist party DUP has blood red lines and Jeremy Corbyn has blurred lines featuring Pharrell If they all hold firm we re heading for a hard Brexit And a united Ireland 
FEB26	This change in the law on organ donation will save hundreds of lives	Lives will be saved Hundreds of them every year That s the first and most important thing to say about the organ donation deemed consent bill which is expected to clear parliament today and become English law in  You may already know it as Max and Keira s Law after the young boy and girl whose story inspired politicians of all parties to get behind a change that will take us from having to opt in as an organ donor to having to opt out The government expects that as many as lives a year may be saved as Max Johnson s was 
FEB26	Gunboat diplomacy can only harm Britain’s relationship with China	A certain British politician s hyping up of the China threat in a recent speech struck a discordant note with the mainstream view in the UK that the country has a strong and constructive relationship with China It has led me to think about how much could be learned from the world class concerts by London s leading symphony orchestra that I have attended the beauty of which comes from the harmony of various sounds and the coordination between the players If the China UK relationship were compared to a symphony its success would depend on close coordination between the two countries and a firm resistance to interruptions and noises  In this symphony China and the UK rely on mutual respect and trust to keep us in tune and keep out the noise of enmity and confrontation 
FEB26	Am I the only one who’s terrified about the warm weather?	They were everywhere in London on the weekend The people in short sleeves or sandals The ones with sunglasses ostentatiously hanging from the front of their shirts or balanced on top of their heads The beer gardens and riverside pubs of the capital were heaving corner shops ran out of ice cream Outside it was C F  Monday was another warm day without a cloud in the sky and in the late afternoon the light took on a magical honey coloured hue It brought to mind one of those summer evenings you remember from childhood when you d be in the park all day and your parents let you stay out until bedtime and you felt like you were doing something deliciously naughty just by being there

FEB26	Why was Alesha MacPhail killed? Perhaps we should stop asking	One aims not to weep on the job so I just about made it to the ladies after sitting through the pathologist s report The extent of the brutalisation endured by six year old Alesha MacPhail who was found dead on the Isle of Bute last July has not been reported by the media and I hope never will be But it goes some way to explaining why experienced police officers and scientific experts struggled to maintain their composure while giving evidence during the nine day trial of her killer  A year old boy was found guilty of Alesha s abduction rape and murder at the high court in Glasgow last Thursday The following day the trial judge agreed to lift the legal protection usually afforded to young people who are an accused victim or witness in criminal trials in Scotland and allowed Aaron Campbell to be named 
FEB27	Time is on the side of remainers amid Brexit’s smoke and mirrors	Ever since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June two things have been clear No serious attempt to reverse or even moderate the leave decision would ever be uncontroversial And any such attempt would require a degree of present legitimacy that could be acquired only in the light of new events and with the passing of time The question today is whether we have now reached such a moment  Very clearly there was no such moment in the immediate aftermath of the referendum It would have been too soon It would have been merely a spasm of outrage The voters had only just expressed their will No government could defy that decision even if it had wanted to Theresa May rightly grasped that she had become prime minister with a mandate to deliver on the vote 
FEB27	For Kashmir, there is only one strategy left to try: peace	In the summer of I was standing outside our ancestral home in Srinagar the capital of Indian administered Kashmir when I saw fighter jets roar past in the skies above me The Indian air force was carrying out sorties towards the mountainous district of Kargil to dislodge Pakistani militants and as we found out later Pakistani soldiers The troops had quietly occupied the snow capped peaks as part of a stealth operation masterminded by the then Pakistani general and future president Pervez Musharraf  The sight and sound of sophisticated military hardware provided a brief thrill but it soon turned into panic What if these bombers dropped their lethal cache on our home At night as I lay in bed I imagined our neighbourhood as rubble from which acrid smoke rose I imagined dear ones lying dead in homes and on streets like in war films I saw friends and myself as bodies in pools of blood It was terrifying 
FEB27	Labour doesn’t have zero tolerance of antisemitism if Chris Williamson is an MP	Credit to Chris Williamson for originality Not many have suggested that Labour s chief problem with antisemitism within its ranks is that it has been too apologetic to the Jewish community that it has shown an excess of concern and contrition Yet that is the argument the Derby North MP made to activists in Sheffield last week in footage obtained by the Yorkshire Post   I ve got to say I think our party s response has been partly responsible he said Because in my opinion we ve backed off far too much we ve given too much ground we ve been too apologetic 
FEB27	How not to infuriate your spouse: a short guide to the marriage lessons all couples need	When I heard that a hotel was offering groom courses for fiances with classes on making breakfast in bed and doing the laundry I immediately assumed it was in Japan where themed accommodation is commonplace But the training is actually being offered at Rosslea Hall in Argyll and Bute   We are calling all lovely brides to be before they say I do so they can whip their men into shape and cut the mothers apron strings said a spokeswoman for the establishment although it read like a Russian troll bot programmed to inflame men s rights activists And boy did they bite Are these women looking for a husband or a servant asked one Twitter user amid more generalised griping about how this was and how do people think men manage before they get married 
FEB27	Did Iran’s foreign minister ‘resign’ just to boost his influence at home?	Almost hours after the apparent resignation of Iran s foreign minister there are finally some answers to the many questions it raised For instance his superior president Hassan Rouhani has not accepted his resignation which is required under Iranian law Neither has the top decision maker in the country Ayatollah Ali Khamenei if one is to believe cryptic rumours of a high ranking official having told the diplomat that his exit is not expedient Mohammad Javad Zarif is back at work joining Rouhani in greeting a visiting Armenian delegation early on Wednesday  But there is still the question of why Zarif suddenly decided to go on Instagram at midnight on Monday expressing gratitude to the dear and honourable Iranian people for the last months and apologising for his incapacity to continue serving in his post Being under fire from all sides is certainly not a novelty for the ever smiling Iranian chief diplomat For years he has been adored and despised for essentially the same thing his ability to convincingly make Iran s case to the world in fluent English with a strong grasp of how western media works 
FEB27	Chagos Islanders remind us that Britain is a shameful coloniser, not a colony	At a time when Britain needs goodwill and great branding the world was reminded this week of our nation s shame courtesy of the families of people dispossessed from their Indian Ocean home in the s and s It s a shame that looms large in the history of the Chagos Islands an archipelago whose tiny size is in perfect contrast to the scale of the wrongs its people have witnessed They are wrongs stretching back centuries since the British formally acquired the islands from France as part of the bigger colony of Mauritius and forced slaves from Mozambique and Madagascar to work on British owned coconut plantations  Britain the colonial power is not quite the image its leaders are trying to project just now
FEB27	Student halls for all? That's not an answer to Britain’s housing crisis, it's a living nightmare	Due to a lack of affordable housing a new report suggests childless millennials should be offered living spaces that comprise a small bedroom with shower plus shared kitchens and living areas The report points to co living communities already springing up in London New York and Beijing which make it easier for people to interact with each other Let s call a spade a tool for digging our graves What they are talking about is living in student halls For the rest of your days  When you re young dorm life can be thrilling Listening to the pound of house music through plasterboard walls battling for space on the kitchen hob like it s Iwo Jima A part of growing up But that is the crucial aspect No one should be sentenced to live like this once they no longer have their photo on their travel card If normal sized homes will in future be offered only to couples with babies it is hard to not consider it a punishment for the childless The idea could be a sticking plaster for the housing crisis but a pint of vodka and Red Bull for the overpopulation crisis 
FEB27	This change in the law on organ donation will save hundreds of lives	Lives will be saved Hundreds of them every year That s the first and most important thing to say about the organ donation deemed consent bill which is expected to clear parliament today and become English law in  You may already know it as Max and Keira s Law after the young boy and girl whose story inspired politicians of all parties to get behind a change that will take us from having to opt in as an organ donor to having to opt out The government expects that as many as lives a year may be saved as Max Johnson s was 
FEB27	Gunboat diplomacy can only harm Britain’s relationship with China	A certain British politician s hyping up of the China threat in a recent speech struck a discordant note with the mainstream view in the UK that the country has a strong and constructive relationship with China It has led me to think about how much could be learned from the world class concerts by London s leading symphony orchestra that I have attended the beauty of which comes from the harmony of various sounds and the coordination between the players If the China UK relationship were compared to a symphony its success would depend on close coordination between the two countries and a firm resistance to interruptions and noises  In this symphony China and the UK rely on mutual respect and trust to keep us in tune and keep out the noise of enmity and confrontation 
FEB27	Am I the only one who’s terrified about the warm weather?	They were everywhere in London on the weekend The people in short sleeves or sandals The ones with sunglasses ostentatiously hanging from the front of their shirts or balanced on top of their heads The beer gardens and riverside pubs of the capital were heaving corner shops ran out of ice cream Outside it was C F  Monday was another warm day without a cloud in the sky and in the late afternoon the light took on a magical honey coloured hue It brought to mind one of those summer evenings you remember from childhood when you d be in the park all day and your parents let you stay out until bedtime and you felt like you were doing something deliciously naughty just by being there 
FEB28	Trump’s a racist conman – and that’s the brand America bought	Shortly before November s midterm elections I interviewed a Donald Trump supporter coming out of a debate between three local candidates in a congressional race asking how she felt about the president s attitude to women I need to see the facts and the actual documentation she said I can t just do all this hearsay   What about when he says he personally grabs women and kisses them I prodded That was him saying that 
FEB28	‘White saviours’ belong in the 1980s. Let’s keep them there	Bare faced and clad in jeans clutching a rather uncertain looking black toddler on her hip Stacey Dooley stands beaming in the dust of a parched African landscape At first glance you could mistake it for a gap year snapshot destined to be pinned up somewhere in a student bedroom Dooley is of course one of the breakout stars of this year s Strictly Come Dancing and the picture was taken in Uganda where she is making a film for the upcoming Comic Relief Yet as with so many gap year experiences it isn t entirely easy to tell who is having the more emotionally rewarding time here the volunteer who feels privileged to have seen what they ve seen or the children they re actually supposed to be helping  Which is perhaps why the Labour MP David Lammy touched such a nerve when he responded to the image by tweeting that the world doesn t need any more white saviours or western do gooders flying in believing they are solving the developing world s problems while blissfully ignorant of the colonial baggage they carry 
FEB28	Parents: don't panic about Momo – worry about YouTube Kids instead	I first heard about Momo in my local parents WhatsApp group Someone had screenshotted a Facebook post about a creepy puppet that supposedly appeared in unsuspecting children s phone messages and spliced into YouTube videos dispensing advice on self harm and violent acts I reacted with suspicion this would hardly be the first time that something on Facebook turned out not to be true and the Momo challenge seemed a bit too on the nose too obviously sinister to be real  It turned out that Momo was indeed a hoax a viral shock story driven by a frightening image and well intentioned worry about children s safety online 
FEB28	Trump was out of his depth in Hanoi. This failure is his greatest flop yet	Donald Trump s self reverential style of personalised fly by the seat of your pants diplomacy just crashed and burned in Hanoi It is fitting perhaps that Vietnam scene of past American humiliations was the setting for the blunderer in chief s greatest flop Trump tried to wing it in nuclear talks with North Korea s more canny leader Kim Jong un and got what he deserved precisely nothing The summit like last year s effort in Singapore was a Trump vanity project and proved a labour in vain  In principle just about everybody including close neighbours South Korea China and Russia would like to see North Korea s nuclear arsenal brought under international supervision and preferably eliminated altogether To make such a mess of things given this exceptional consensus is a true measure of Trump s incomparable incompetence Yet this is barely a surprise It is entirely of a piece with his amateurish approach to key foreign policy challenges the world over 
FEB28	Excellence is overrated. Let’s embrace being good enough instead	We live in a society obsessed with being exceptional Whether it is as workers parents students lovers or cooks we are expected to be outstanding We must strive to be the best employee craft an outstanding body have an amazing relationship all while being exceptionally happy Even the most ordinary institutions also are expected to be nothing less than excellent Companies want to be world class schools have become academies of excellence and humble local GP surgeries strive to be outstanding Being good enough is seen as simply not good enough  Our quest to be excellent has many positive consequences but it also can be damaging Lionising excellence can create huge inequalities When high performers are showered with rewards the great mass of us who are average miss out This can spark resentment in those who feel that they don t measure up But the obsession with being exceptional does just harm the great mass of average people It can also do damage to people at the top as well 
FEB28	The environment was once a safe space for activism in Iran. No longer	In early nine environmental experts and activists from the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation PWHF were arrested in Iran Disregarding their international reputation for tireless efforts to protect Iran s endangered Asiatic cheetahs the country s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC accused them of being agents of the CIA Mossad and MI The IRGC which acts as an alternative hardline centre of power in Iran claimed that PWHF was using environmental activism as a cover for a mission to disrupt national security It accused them of collecting sensitive environmental information and using camera traps to monitor Iran s ballistic missile programme  A few weeks later one of them Kavous Seyed Emami died suspiciously in an alleged suicide at Tehran s notorious Evin prison His grieving wife Maryam Mombeini is still banned from leaving the country to join her two sons in Canada The rest of the group are still in temporary detention Four of them have been charged with spreading corruption on the earth a crime that can carry the death penalty The rest face serious security charges for cooperation with hostile governments and acts against national security Their page indictment was finally disclosed to them in a trial behind closed doors that began a few weeks ago 
FEB28	The fight for EU citizens’ rights could become another Windrush	As theatre Brexit loses out to drying paint It is mostly excruciating Time and again we are promised a high noon shoot out with cabinet walkouts and armies of pitchfork wielding Tory rebels but then anti climax the real drama happens behind the scenes as our flawed heroine surrenders leaving a damp squib finale in the Commons It s like the Richard II scene when the king calls off mortal combat between two nobles that doesn t end well Today s virtually Brexit free front pages tell the story no fighting is boring boring boring  Yet what happened this week in Brexit has been momentous even if we were denied catharsis Battle honours go to Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin demanding the Commons right to vote down a no deal and extend article They have saved the nation from the utter catastrophe revealed in the no deal documents Anna Soubry prised from the cabinet Backing for the Cooper Letwin amendment from an unprecedented ministers threatening resignation forced Queen Theresa to concede she is ordering her troops to vote for a contradiction to her every Brexit word so far 
FEB28	Nadine Dorries’ TV junk-food binge: now that’s a hard act to swallow	MPs should not go on reality TV The results are conclusive George Galloway shouldn t have gone on Celebrity Big Brother years later the image of Galloway pretending to lick milk from a bowl held by Rula Lenska another contestant still overshadows in most minds anything else he has ever done  Penny Mordaunt shouldn t have gone on the diving show Splash like it or not her political legacy will now include one spectacular belly flop lovingly captured and replayed in slow motion from four angles during the show And Nadine Dorries shouldn t have gone on I m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here for which she was suspended from the Tory party just a few days before she was humiliatingly booted out of the jungle itself 
FEB28	Ivanka Trump occupies a different reality from most working women	Responding to a question about Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez s proposed Green New Deal and its call for a federal job guarantee Ivanka Trump this week offered sage wisdom I ve spent a lot of time traveling around this country over the last four years she said People want to work for what they get So I think that this idea of a guaranteed minimum is not something most people want  The statement sparked outrage including from Ocasio Cortez She tweeted in response As a person who actually worked for tips hourly wages in my life instead of having to learn about it nd hand I can tell you that most people want to be paid enough to live 
FEB28	The Romans took their graffiti seriously – especially the phalluses	Leave an image of a penis up long enough and it will become part of our national heritage The rush to record inscriptions made in a Cumbrian quarry in AD has cast a spotlight on the rich legacy of graffiti in Britain by the Romans Masons sourcing stone blocks for the nearby fortifications of Hadrian s Wall carved a date a phallus and the caricature of an officer They were not alone in leaving their mark Hunting for images of phalluses is one of the great pleasures of walking the wall Look attentively enough and they can be found repeatedly along its line  Graffiti was always a mark of Roman life In Rome the right to draw it was widely regarded as a civic prerogative In a society rigidly stratified by wealth and rank it provided an essential safety valve Slogans scrawled across the city served up to everyone who could read such a relentless dishing of dirt that people fretted that its sheer weight might bring walls crashing down Even the illiterate would defecate on the monuments of those who had offended them Soldiers by virtue of the oath of duty they swore when signing up to the army had abdicated the rights that were the essence of citizenship but many were the legionaries who sought to ease their boredom by scratching doodles on quarry walls Tiles stamped with a unit s name would often bear graffiti Ferocious though military discipline invariably was it did not serve to iron out all the habits of civilian life

MAR1	We now know the great prize of Brexit: becoming Trump’s prey	Shall we take a gentle amble down memory lane a nostalgic trip back to the heady days of the referendum campaign of So many sweet promises were murmured into our ear it can be hard to remember them all No talk then of shelling out m to settle a legal case with Eurotunnel or ferry contracts for companies with no ferries or spending billions to prepare for the cataclysm of a no deal departure No back then it was all cash bonanzas of m a week and assurances that Brexit would be smooth and seamless the Europeans needed us more than we needed them after all so that by the time June came around voting leave seemed like a painless risk free option Not only was there nothing to lose there was so much to gain And top of the list was a big shiny trade deal with the United States of America   Within two years vowed the soon to be Brexit secretary David Davis a few short weeks after the vote we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU A deal with the US along with China would give us a trade area almost twice the size of the EU he gushed apparently unaware that under European law it was illegal for a Britain that had not formally exited the EU to so much as enter talks with those nations let alone sign an agreement with them

MAR1	Long before Shamima Begum, Muslim women were targets	What progress if any have we made in the last decade when it comes to our understanding of Muslim women I found myself asking this question when the BBC s Bodyguard won best new drama last month at the National Television awards having amassed million viewers including of the audience share for its finale  Spoiler alert the Muslim woman at the heart of the story starts out as the groomed victim of a brutal jihadi husband but by the end of the season her character is unmasked as the violent terrorist 
MAR1	Right to Rent’s demise should spell the end for the hostile environment	Seven years after the then home secretary Theresa May announced her intention to create a really hostile environment for undocumented residents in the UK the high court has declared one of her flagship schemes to be unlawful  The Right to Rent scheme which threatens landlords with unlimited fines and up to five years in jail if their tenants can t produce all the right immigration paperwork has been found to encourage racial discrimination against anybody with a foreign sounding name or a foreign passport The court has found that the government ignored evidence of these risks and in turn that it failed to provide any evidence the scheme delivers anything but misery and state sanctioned hostility targeted predominantly at minorities people of colour and people who just happen to have been born somewhere else 
MAR1	Justin Trudeau’s disgrace is like watching a unicorn get run over	For Canadian liberals or indeed any of us who cling to outdated ideas such as good governance and liberal democratic values it was like watching a unicorn get flattened by a lorry Earlier this week Canada s undeniably gorgeous halo bound Liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau proud feminist defender of minority rights advocate for transparency inclusivity and decency and prince of the one armed push up was morally eviscerated over four hours of astonishing testimony by his own former attorney general and justice minister Jody Wilson Raybould a woman of great integrity and a rare Indigenous Canadian cabinet minister  To recap Wilson Raybould was demoted to the position of veterans affairs minister in a cabinet shuffle earlier this year Shortly thereafter reports emerged that she and her staff had been subjected to a sustained campaign by the prime minister s office over the handling of corruption charges against SNC Lavalin a Montreal based engineering giant accused of bribing Libyan officials It happens to be a large employer in Quebec Trudeau s home state the prime minister s office made sure to remind her of that the job losses such charges might cause and the fact that it was an election year There was a string of increasingly irate calls texts and emails Still Wilson Raybould held her ground The prime minister lost the battle Then she was demoted 
MAR1	There is no magic ‘stop Brexit’ button for Labour. There never has been	The problem with recommending good options for Labour on Brexit with regards to their electoral prospects is that none exist Here is a party whose members and existing voters supported remain but which cannot win a general election without leave voters The only six seats lost by Labour in heavily opted for Brexit in the referendum such as the ex mining community of Mansfield and post industrial Stoke on Trent South And of the top Tory held target seats without which Labour cannot form a majority voted leave As long as Brexit dominates and defines political debate Labour will suffer Its popular domestic policies are sidelined  Corbynism is an insurgent project with a clear sense of the people versus the elite at its heart but in order to keep its electoral coalition together it has been forced to triangulate on the most important political issue of our time sapping it of the radical energy it thrives on Brexit has unleashed a culture war too which divides and polarises Labour s electoral coalition 
MAR1	Art rarely touches on disabled siblings – that’s why a new play made me cry	I don t often cry when I go to the theatre I certainly don t often have to dig my fingernails into my palm in order to keep my feelings under control but that is what happened during a performance of Christina Murdock s one woman play Dangerous Giant Animals next on at The Vaults in London between and March Described as a darkly comedic show about finding your voice amid your sister s screams it tells the story of Christina s San Francisco childhood with her younger sister who has atypical Rett syndrome speech apraxia and severe epilepsy She loves the spotlight and movies like Jurassic Park and Jaws hence the title of the show Murdock tells me  The play resonated with me because as many Guardian readers will know from my writing my own brother has severe autism I encountered Murdock s work for the first time last year at a meeting for the charity Sibs for brothers and sisters of disabled siblings and adults where I was making a speech The day was an intensely moving experience because it was the first time that I had ever sat in a room with people whose experiences were very much like mine who understood profoundly the emotions that I was describing as the sibling of a vulnerable person lurching between protectiveness and fury sadness and hilarity heartbreak and love 
MAR1	I backed Sadiq Khan – but now his racist minicab policy has betrayed me	They say you can get used to anything in time but I am not sure that is true Some things in life such as the loss of a loved one we must find the courage to accept Others like discrimination and exploitation we must find the courage to fight Two weeks ago I lost my dear son Hadi to leukaemia at and somehow my family and I must find a way to grieve and carry on though I doubt we will ever get over it  I have worked as a minicab driver for Uber since Hadi first became ill The job provided much needed flexibility while my wife and I juggled lengthy stays at Great Ormond Street hospital and tried to keep things as normal as possible for Hadi s two sisters at home I borrowed money to buy a vehicle applied for a Transport for London TfL minicab licence and went to work trusting that I would be paid fairly Shortly after Uber dropped fare prices to grab market share and TfL flooded the streets doubling the number of minicab licences in a few short years Now there are just too many drivers chasing too little work leading to too much congestion and too little pay The upshot is that drivers like me work as much as hours each week to earn just per hour 
MAR1	Democracy has failed in Nigeria when voters no longer care who wins	You know a democracy is in trouble when two out of three voters don t bother to turn up for a presidential election In Nigeria s just concluded presidential poll incumbent Muhammadu Buhari was re elected with the backing of million voters compared to the million votes his main rival Atiku Abubakar was able to amass  Although this gave Buhari of the total votes cast in a country with a population of close to million including more than million registered voters million votes hardly qualifies as a huge mandate The voter turnout was down from in the presidential election and way down from the turnout in In fact turnout for Nigerian presidential elections has been dropping at an alarmingly consistent rate since So why are increasingly fewer Nigerians feeling the need to vote in elections that decide the most powerful political office 
MAR2	The Satanic Verses is still creating monsters, even new book-burners	Sometimes you just have to shake your head to clear it and look again Did he really write that So it was when I read a review in the Independent by Sean O Grady of The Satanic Verses Years On a BBC documentary on the Rushdie affair and its legacy  But yes in the last paragraph he really wrote Rushdie s silly childish book should be banned under today s anti hate legislation It s no better than racist graffiti on a bus stop I wouldn t have it in my house out of respect to Muslim people and contempt for Rushdie and because it sounds quite boring I d be quite inclined to burn it in fact 
MAR2	Thought for the day: is it time to silence BBC preachers who keep women down?	And welcome to the amoral maze where our dilemma of the week is just how insufferable does a spiritual leader have to be before he or she becomes unqualified to preach at the general public Or to put it another way why should the church have a monopoly on excommunication  The question is not emphatically restricted to the case of the ubiquitous prelate blogger and speaker Giles Fraser although with his recent blog chastising women who fail to stay near home for the future convenience of incontinent fathers he has done more than most to focus attention on the sort of qualities that should ideally distinguish a Thought for the Day contributor from say Jacob Rees Mogg 
MAR2	André Previn, the classical maestro who knew the value of pop culture	In Andr Previn was so famous that he had his own chatshow on BBC In one episode wearing an expensive looking brown suede safari jacket with big collar and clutching his oversize glasses in his hands he introduces the studio audience to Jonathan Miller They discuss Miller s new production of The Merchant of Venice the director going on to predict the slow disintegration of English theatre  It s a real spirit of the age moment There is no apology for the elevated tone of their conversation the format is simple two cultural polymaths ruminating on the arts on primetime television 
MAR2	Ariana Grande is the right person to lead Manchester’s Pride party	Ariana Grande headlining this year s Manchester Pride seems on the surface as if it should be a perfect fit After the horrendous tragedy of the Arena bombing in the singer has a unique and close connection to the city She is one of the biggest pop stars in the world if not the biggest there are so many numbers on her Spotify or YouTube that they look like the answer to a final grade University Challenge maths question She has a back catalogue bursting with irresistible pop hits  Yet this is and the idea of any kind of announcement occurring without any kind of backlash immediately following it is as old fashioned as me wondering why Grande can t use capital letters on her album tracklistings In this case the controversy came in two parts Manchester Pride almost doubled the cost of tickets this year organisers claim that it s a new event and can t be compared with last year s pricing When this was first revealed at the end of January many objected to one more indication that another Pride was being further commodified and made more exclusive Pride was a protest so the history teaches us It wasn t about booze brands issuing limited edition rainbow bottles and VIP wristbands it was about fighting for one s right to exist You can see why charging people to celebrate that history might stick in the teeth 
MAR2	Remember the days when we weren’t freaked out by freak weather?	There was a time on these temperate islands when freak weather thrilled us with its bouts of exceptional heat wind rain or snow Unless you were at sea in a gale fear was a rare emotion Even in when the so called Great Storm hurtled through southern England and northern France on a night in mid October it was possible to be more awed than afraid Crashing branches and tumbling slates woke people but when they turned to each other in bed it was to exclaim about the wind s strength Would you just listen to that rather than to see it as a portent of something larger or more terrible Thirty odd years later most of the people who lived through the Great Storm remember it mainly because a BBC weatherman got the forecast wrong  In England the wind gusted at mph that night and at least people were killed on both sides of the Channel But unless you were among the bereaved or had a tall oak fall through the roof nobody felt anxiety or despair There was no prevailing gloom 
MAR2	The Tories’ response to raging Islamophobia? Turn a blind eye	On Thursday s BBC Politics Live show the Conservative MP Henry Smith dismissed claims of Islamophobia in the Conservative party citing the fact he personally had not seen any anti Muslim discrimination  Yet we have a fair idea as to just how Islamophobia has taken hold among the party s support base and how its leadership is responding to such attitudes

MAR3	The Trump/Cohen revelations are awful. So why am I yawning?	There is an old Arabic joke about corruption A thieving government minister is fired by the head of state and replaced but the people who have long suffered under the minister don t rejoice When they re asked why they re not celebrating one explains to the confused president Yes he was a thief but he stole until he d taken his fill The new guy will be hungry  Growing up under authoritarian regimes in the Arab world was great for the jokes It was always dark humour but that made it easier to accept the inevitabilities of living under a dictatorship than trying to fight them There were so many violations of rights on a daily basis that survival required adaptation It was exhausting and futile to be permanently scandalised And so we spared our energy and joked instead 
MAR3	Could Gina Miller’s next move compel the EU to delay Brexit?	In a crisis imagination is as important as commitment and Gina Miller has both As March hoves ominously into view the investment manager who successfully challenged the government s authority to invoke article without parliamentary approval is making another significant intervention in the Brexit process more subtle this time but no less worthy of political and legal attention  Having used the courts in to give parliament a say in the triggering of article Miller is now I gather seeking to reframe the way in which Westminster and Brussels contemplate the possibility of its extension Armed with a legal opinion written by Kieron Beal QC and three other senior lawyers the co founder of the pro remain campaign Lead Not Leave will argue that the EU council of ministers could itself unilaterally extend the article deadline 
MAR3	Corporate-branded ‘communities’ prove you can’t buy taste	I find reading about rich people very depressing Not because I am jealous they have so much money but because I am frustrated they have so little imagination Take a look at the recent New York Times piece that says a growing number of wealthy home buyers are choosing to live in corporate branded communities Not just any branded communities mind you but luxury ones from the likes of Porsche Armani and Bulgari  These expensive branded buildings have proliferated in the past few years a trend that seems to be driven by the having more money than they know what to do with Slapping a fancy brand name on a residential development can add a price premium of to according to the upmarket estate agency Savills A report on the sector by another agency Knight Frank notes that there is a direct correlation between wealth creation and demand for branded residences

Last week supposedly unprecedented spring wildfires raged across dry bushy and exposed areas On Monday having dealt with serious incidents at Saddleworth Moor and Hundred Acre Wood teams of specialised firefighters also attended the small piece of Shredded Wheat that lives on top of Andrew Neil s head  Dozens of grateful weevils were saved from certain death in the breakfast bisc inferno by the firefighters and rehoused in temporary accommodation in the nearby clumps of Andrew Neil s ear hair while his nostrils became emergency treatment centres for scorched pests 
MAR3	Labour’s balance of terror has shifted. Now Corbynites have cause to be fearful	Until recently Tom Watson was a shrunken figure in every sense Labour s deputy leader had become more famous for his weight shedding diet than for the influence he wielded in his party He had earned the undying enmity of the Corbynites for attempting to persuade their hero to quit as leader and they schemed to replace him as deputy with someone more pliable Labour moderates had given up on him for failing to deliver on reassurances that he could fix the party Whenever he made public criticism of antisemitism or entryism by the far left a gang of Corbynites in the shadow cabinet would be organised to verbally batter him at the body s next meeting  At last autumn s conference in Liverpool the deputy leader was such a diminished figure that he was denied a speaking slot from the platform and all he could do was pretend to be happy about it 
MAR3	Kashmir is in a perilous state because of India’s pivot to nationalism	On Friday the four day long military flare up between Pakistan and India began winding down with Islamabad handing back an Indian air force pilot taken captive by the Pakistan army two days earlier He had been shot down in the first aerial fighter combat between the two South Asian enemies since a full scale war in  Yet forgotten in the Indian euphoria is the fact that Kashmir where the deaths of security men in a suicide bomb attack last month triggered this latest crisis continues to simmer Even as the pilot walked free four policemen died in an encounter with Kashmiri militants 
MAR3	Is the world ready for lab-grown meat?	Do people want to eat lab grown meat A new study for which I was a peer reviewer is the first to rigorously assess consumer interest in plant based and clean meat also known as lab grown or cultured meat in the US India and China The study found high levels of acceptance in all three countries and significantly higher acceptance in India and China where and respectively reported being at least somewhat likely to purchase clean meat  Chris Bryant the lead author on the study in the journal Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems told me Across the world s three most populous countries consumers want plant based and clean meat The opportunities for innovators to change the meat industry in these countries are there 
MAR3	Europe can only give us more time if we have a clear Brexit plan	President Macron is right Any extension of the article process should be for a reason It should be to eliminate the blind Brexit Theresa May proposes But first her deal must be defeated  The Brexiters will fall into line with her deal because they believe they can win the subsequent battle and impose a hard Brexit The soft Brexit supporters and those who want a fresh referendum should unite to insist Britain knows the direction of its future relationship with Europe before we leave We have learned a lot during this Brexit debacle It has been a masterclass in political risk We are now in a state of confusion in which even those whose day job is to study the details find it hard to explain 
MAR3	At last we are turning away from our mania for hiving off public services	The Tredegar Workmen s Medical Aid Society was a mini self help medical co operative established in the late th century on the principle that anyone in Tredegar should get free health as they needed It is always credited as giving Nye Bevan who worked there and sat on its board the inspiration for the NHS But it also inspired the author AJ Cronin who also worked there to write his bestseller The Citadel  It was this book more than any other that persuaded the English middle class that far from socialist a national health system based on the same co operative principles of mutuality was what everyone needed Health was a lottery and those unfortunate to suffer illness should receive free help from in effect a vastly upscaled version of what worked in Tredegar 
MAR3	As immigration from outside Europe rises, hucksters foment racial hatred	If you want to understand the future look at an experiment conducted at Manchester University on whether wealth should be redistributed from rich to poor A majority thought it should and showed robust support for the proposition that money should be spent on educational opportunities for working class children  This is real politics is it not Tax and spend and redistribution powered the debates of the th century The culture wars that fill the airwaves today seem an ephemeral American import in comparison America was the aberration of th century western politics Unlike European societies it never found the social solidarity to develop a mass social democratic party As a nation of immigrants poisoned by the original sin of slavery the US was concerned with race politics while we were concerned with class 
MAR4	Dear Europe, Brexit is a lesson for all of us: it’s time for renewal	Citizens of Europe if I am taking the liberty of addressing you directly it is not only in the name of the history and values that unite us but because time is of the essence A few weeks from now the European elections will be decisive for the future of our continent  Never since the second world war has Europe been so essential Yet never has Europe been in such danger Brexit stands as the symbol of that It symbolises the crisis of a Europe that has failed to respond to its peoples need for protection from the major shocks of the modern world It also symbolises the European trap The trap lies not in being part of the European Union the trap is in the lie and the irresponsibility that can destroy it Who told the British people the truth about their post Brexit future Who spoke to them about losing access to the EU market Who mentioned the risks to peace in Ireland of restoring the border Retreating into nationalism offers nothing it is rejection without an alternative And this is the trap that threatens the whole of Europe the anger mongers backed by fake news promise anything and everything 
MAR4	The anti-EU lies are back to exploit Britain’s weak spot again	 Just got through reading the Lisbon treaty OMG and Why is no one talking about the Lisbon treaty that comes into force in Suddenly it s viral If you see this everywhere online you may puzzle how the treaty s dense pages have become such hot reading across Facebook Twitter and Reddit Look for example at what one now deleted tweet claims of what staying in the EU means Just been reading some of the Lisbon treaty very worrying By we lose our veto control over fishing agriculture and more Also by all countries must adopt the euro How can Theresa May and our MPs want to keep us in such an appalling club  This new wave of fakery about the Lisbon treaty is a useful warning about what the remain cause faces
MAR4	Liz ‘the Truss’: truly a politician for our times	The rumour is that Liz Truss likes to call herself the Truss while speaking to colleagues a horrifying echo of when Sajid Javid started calling himself the Saj Since there is no surer way to discredit a politician indeed human being than to alert the public to their self aggrandisement it sounds almost too bad to be true It might have been invented by a hostile colleague trying to stain the Treasury secretary and also associate her with surgical dressings and muscle strain  But is that reading too much into it Could she simply be that bad Javid incidentally denies the third personning which considering all the other rhetorical behaviour he ll exhibit right out in the open illustrates just how damaging a slur it is Only one thing is certain the constant stream of malevolent tittle tattle designed to discredit everyone named and unnamed is the only element of government business still functioning 
MAR4	Enough is enough: Michael Jackson's music is dead to me now	Nothing should interfere with my personal listening pleasure Nothing at all Great art is often made by terrible people These truths I have held to be self evident Certainly as a woman you have to get over yourself a lot of the time because the canon of literature of cinema of art is the canon of lauded misogyny and in order to function critically you have to inhabit it  Hannah Gadsby s wonderful comedy show Nanette includes a takedown of Picasso but it doesn t work for me I like Picasso too much I can t not look at his paintings Just as I can t not wonder at the words of William Burroughs who killed his wife accidentally we are meant to believe 
MAR4	May’s Brexit bung to the north is pathetic. It changes nothing	Theresa May s bung is like Donald Trump s wall You give me my Northern Ireland border deal she says to Labour and I will give your people oodles of cash Except that May has blown it She has promised Labour MPs in the Midlands and north bn but they have not promised her the deal She is apparently relying on the kindness of their hearts How stupid is that She is even offering them a similar deal on workers rights again with no reciprocity She showered a billion on the DUP and now look how it treats her Will she not learn  The northern bung should be judged on two levels May desperately needs her deal and anything might be thought worth it that gets us through the current political chaos But it is also proof of the cancer that hard Brexit has brought to modern government The handout offers bn to deprived regions on a needs basis This appears to be a mild adjustment of the last austerity based formula of grants to councils May says it is because prosperity has been unfairly spread between north and south How was it fair when the formula was calculated last autumn yet not now As for the additional m it is not unconditional It will go to lucky towns that can bid for local partnership or city challenge projects 
MAR4	The world is in a bad way. Students need the skills to fix it	At a time when every week s weird weather seems to bring fresh news of how manmade climate change could destroy everything we know and love it seems almost trite to point out that the challenges we face as a society are vast and complex Clearly the next generation will need to be equipped to tackle them but assuming that tackling them means preventing them as opposed to say riding out the catastrophe with a mixture of improvised weaponry and martial arts skills it is unclear where if anywhere they might acquire the relevant skills  In the UK at least higher education is overly focused on narrow degree courses where institutional prestige often trumps the value of what students are taught This reflects an academic research community in which various perverse incentives have created a climate where the arts and humanities have become overspecialised often to the point of irrelevance and where the whole integrity of the social and life sciences is threatened by the replication crisis 
MAR4	The unanswered question: why do antisemites think Labour is the party for them?	I had a conversation last week with a Jewish woman from a family of Holocaust survivors and people murdered by the Nazis She has been a Labour party member for nearly years It feels like being in an abusive relationship she said A year ago she made an official complaint to the party about what she has experienced but aside from an acknowledgment she has heard nothing During debates in her constituency general committee about issues of antisemitism she has been jeered by as many as people for trying to point out the gravity of the issue At one party event about hate speech she was prevented from speaking Some of her supposed comrades have said that claims of antisemitism have been invented to undermine Jeremy Corbyn she knows of at least one suggestion that such accusations are the work of Israel  She told me that the people responsible seem to fall into two broad groups a belligerent and relentless hard core including a few people who seem to be attracted to conspiracy theories and an element who seem much less zealous but are swept up by a kind of tribalism A lot of my Jewish friends have left Labour she told me I feel that I have to stay and fight But I m on the brink 
MAR4	Lucía, 11, was raped. Then Argentina’s church conspired to deny her an abortion	Luc a is not called Luc a Her name is the only fiction in this spine chilling true story But we must call her Luc a to protect her identity  Luc a is years old Four years ago a court in Argentina placed Luc a in her grandmother s care after her mother s boyfriend reportedly abused her two older sisters However Luc a was not safe at her grandmother s home either she was raped by her grandmother s boyfriend and became pregnant 
MAR4	Instagram is stripping its devotees of their basic humanity	Walking around my city recently I ve been experiencing an odd and dislocated feeling of vertigo as though the world is veering on a precipice and without wanting to sound too dramatic we are approaching what pavement preachers refer to as the end times My husband says it s just a symptom of getting older but I m convinced my environment has something to do with it  Day by day aspects of the city have started to blend into one another the same chains popping up to replace local businesses the flimsy looking so called affordable housing the upscale student accommodation blocks with their own cinemas all becoming uncannily homogenous These act as a backdrop to the tents and mattresses of so many desperate homeless people Things just feel wrong 
MAR4	Mentally ill people pay higher bills – and banks are partly to blame	Money management is not easy at the best of times Choosing the right deal setting up standing orders checking you re not over or underpaying switching providers the whole thing can be overwhelming This is doubly true for those with mental health problems and a new report from Citizens Advice has exposed just how difficult it can be It found that when poor mental health reduces someone s ability to carry out daily activities it can end up costing them to a year  The reasons for this are manifold Choosing services can be problematic difficulty acting under pressure poor working memory and poor response inhibition can prevent people from getting the right deal Paying for services can be impacted by difficulties doing paperwork and dealing with problems can be hindered by avoidance or a reluctance to communicate This may not be the case for everyone mental illness can manifest in any variety of ways But inaccessible services and inadequate support are problems across the board no matter the exact nature of someone s illness 
MAR5	We’re divorcing the EU. So why do hard Brexiteers still feel jilted?	There is a jilted quality to the way some Tories talk about Brexit which is odd given that Britain is dumping the European Union The resentment would make more sense if it were the other way round if member states had expelled Britain from their club But after decades of treating everything European as a punishment inflicted on a nation against its will the habit is hard to break Even the act of leaving is configured by the Eurosceptic imagination as something done by them to us There is an illustration in the resignation letter sent by George Eustice an agriculture minister to Theresa May last week Eustice was appalled by the prospect of an article extension which would he fretted be the final humiliation of our country He said the European commission had not behaved honourably and had deliberately made progress slow and difficult Yes George it would all have been quick and easy without those meddling Brussels bureaucrats  It doesn t require a romantic attachment to the EU to find such Brexiter tantrums tedious All it takes is an ability to imagine what the process looks like from the other side of the negotiating table 
MAR5	Children are dying on our streets – May’s response is not good enough	Their faces are hauntingly impossible to ignore staring out from the front pages Some are in school uniform little more than children others all teenage bravado hovering on the difficult cusp of adulthood  But all teenagers were far too young to die like this stabbed to death on the streets of Britain in the past months This is the kind of national moment that demands a swift reassuring and comprehensive response from politicians And yet what it gets is Theresa May stiffly insisting that there is no direct correlation between the rising tide of knife crime and police numbers Nothing has changed or if it has then it definitely wasn t her fault It is a characteristically tone deaf response to a public mood characterised by alarm and sorrow why can t she see that dead children requires something more emotionally literate than this But the bigger problem is that what she s saying flies in the face of common sense 
MAR5	Macron’s overblown vision for Europe shows how much it needs Britain	Emmanuel Macron s open letter to Europe s citizens published in all EU member states is an ambitious attempt to stop the rot inside the EU and create a framework for progressive democratic renewal But in taking his best shot at saving Europe France s president has badly misfired or to use a duelling term adapted from the French deloped  Europe s future cohesion and coherence are of primary importance to Britain in or out Macron is right to warn that this is a pivotal moment The corrosive continent wide onslaught of rightwing populist nationalist and xenophobic forces is real and urgent It found its most recent expression in Estonia at the weekend where electoral support for the far right surged 
MAR5	Pupils shouldn’t be denied LGBT lessons – whatever their parents say	Parkfield community school in Birmingham has found itself in the headlines once again after protests against its No Outsiders lessons The protests by the school s largely Muslim parent body garnered a lot of coverage and raised a fundamental question how can inclusive education reach every child when many households of faith remain deeply opposed  No Outsiders is a teaching package designed for primary school children The lessons cover gender sexual orientation and the idea that discrimination is wrong Andrew Moffat the author of the package and assistant headteacher of Parkfield had been trialling the resource at the school when the controversy erupted 
MAR5	As foreign secretary I argued against an EU referendum. Now I back one	The Brexit debate is coming to a head at a moment when Britain s political parties seem to be coming apart Maybe that is not surprising The referendum usurped the role of parliament and MPs And both Labour and Conservative parties are being pulled by the far right and far left The mess of Brexit is the result Millions of voters are left feeling not only frustrated but homeless with unprecedented strain on the stability and legitimacy of the two party system  The defections from the main parties last month were not just about Brexit Labour s antisemitism crisis also reflects dangerous wider trends It is horrifying to see the Jewish roots of MPs turned into a weapon against their political views to see sectarianism so deep that reason is lost to see the anonymity of social media toxify political debate 
MAR5	Bohemian Rhapsody’s release in China is a victory, despite the cuts	 Gay and Chinese Two words that have more cultural friction than a pair of bearded drag queens going in for a hairy hello kiss China s LGBT history has been difficult and fraught Homosexuality only became legal in and same sex scenes are still banned from their television In fact it was only last year that the social media giant Weibo decided to stop censoring gay themed content after a huge online campaign which gave birth to catchy hashtags like iamgaynotapervert  So it s no surprise to discover that when the Oscar winning biopic Bohemian Rhapsody gets its release in China this month censors will cut as much as two minutes of the homosexual scenes and drug use It may not seem like a lot but in a film which spends the latter third recreating Freddie Mercury s enthralling Live Aid performance it s a decent chunk For some two minutes of gay intimacy constitutes an entire relationship with extra time for a post coital cigarette Censorship here is being used as a way to demonise drugs and gay kisses both equally bad in the eyes of the state 
MAR5	Rudd’s disability benefits move is nothing more than political gaslighting	Watching the government spin over anything from Brexit offers to money for deprived towns there is an analogy that keeps coming to mind a doctor amputates someone s leg for no discernible reason and then when she notices the wound is bleeding expects applause for offering a plaster This image came to mind again today with work and pensions boss Amber Rudd s announcement of reforms to the disability benefits system including freeing disabled pensioners from unnecessary benefit checks  Under the policy older people will not have personal independence payments Pip regularly reviewed and may be able to fill in a form rather than seeing an assessor in person In a speech on Tuesday to the disability charity Scope Rudd is also set to announce a small scale trial to test the feasibility of bringing together the Pip tests and work capability assessments into one the disaster strewn test that determines whether a disabled person is fit for work 
MAR5	I will survive: how Failing Grayling made himself unsackable	What does it take to get sacked by Theresa May these days That s a question being asked on the other side of the Atlantic after the bumbling transport secretary Chris Grayling went global and became the subject of an editorial in the New York Times Under the headline How does he survive The curious case of Failing Grayling the paper describes him as a byword for haplessness in a golden age of political blundering in Britain  While the NYT has developed a reputation of late for gloomy coverage of UK politics Grayling s political survival is also the subject of increasing astonishment in the UK The Labour party claims that as a government minister Grayling has cost the taxpayer a total of bn by way of political gaffes Meanwhile there are plenty of Conservative MPs who have grown impatient with their colleague over continuing train problems that have got their constituents seeing red Most recently Grayling made the news for a ferry fiasco when he awarded a no deal ferry contract to a company with no ferries and then had to pay out m to Eurotunnel over the decision 
MAR5	Virgin Atlantic’s sexism goes deeper than telling women what to wear	Obviously I didn t think they were all virgins just because they worked for a company with the V word in the title That would be ridiculous wouldn t it But then I never imagined it was compulsory for female cabin crew at Virgin Atlantic to wear makeup and tight skirts when they were serving meals dealing with sick children or in the worst possible scenario guiding terrified passengers through emergency exits on to inflatable slides  On Monday in a sudden lurch into the st century the company relaxed its strict dress rules announcing that female cabin crew would no longer be obliged to work wearing full slap It also decreed that trousers would be available as a standard item in the Virgin Atlantic uniform instead of female flight attendants having to make a special request I mean how modern is that

MAR6	Teenagers are being killed. But more policing is too simple an answer	While researching my book about all the young people and teens who were killed by guns on a random day in the United States I would call the journalist who wrote the original story of the shooting and ask if they had any leads With a handful of exceptions they didn t The victims were overwhelmingly working class black and Latino killed in poor black and Latino neighbourhoods The stories were often little more than rewrites of police reports People are desensitised to it said one journalist They figure that s where bad things happen Unfortunately homicides are not uncommon in that area said another Unless something unexpected happened it just wouldn t be the kind of story we d follow up on said a third  After a while it was difficult to escape the notion that there were places where the shooting of a child did not challenge the general understanding of how a city or a society works but confirmed it The death was not news in the conventional sense How could it be when it was expected And then there were places where children were not supposed to get shot schools suburbs malls cinemas and universities A fatal shooting of a child in one of those places would contradict how people thought a city or society should work This was news How could it not be when it had shocked so many people 
MAR6	Britain has cut itself adrift from Europe. I fear we may sink	In his novel The Stone Raft the Portuguese writer Jos Saramago imagines that the Iberian peninsula breaks away physically from the rest of the European continent at the Pyrenees The peninsula and its peoples detach from Europe and drift across the oceans seemingly in search of a new home and contentment which spoiler alert they never quite find  Saramago s book is a brilliantly playful examination of several aspects of the Portuguese national mentality not least the complex relationship with Spain But the essence of his fantastical idea is easily transferable to Britain As Brexit looms it is not difficult to see the British as another disparate group of rub along peoples caught aboard our own stone raft beginning to drift into the dark ocean of the future 
MAR6	The Tories are tough on Islamophobia? What a joke	Conservatives are doubtless congratulating themselves for acting swiftly and decisively following the suspension of party members for allegedly making Islamophobic comments online including calls to get rid of all mosques and to turf all Muslims out of public office Tories will similarly point to yesterday s resignation from the party of a local council candidate in Harlow as evidence that they are getting a grip Peter Lamb who in tweeted Islam is like alcoholism The first step to recovery is admit you have a problem was suspended over that and yet as picked once again to contest the local elections in May Now he is gone  The Conservative top brass will hope that voters will see these moves as proof that the Tories have zero tolerance for racism in their ranks drawing an implied contrast with Labour and its ongoing travails over antisemitism And yet the departure of these low level activists serves only to draw attention to the Islamophobia exhibited by much more senior Tory figures anti Muslim prejudice that has gone entirely unpunished 
MAR6	The fabulous, feral Derry Girls are the new emblems of Northern Ireland	I m a Derry girl We never grow out of it Waiting for the new series was like being pregnant with your second child What if you didn t love it as much as the first one We needn t have worried The girls and their cousin the wee English fella are more fabulous and feral than ever The head nun Sister Michael only has to roll her eyes and curl her lip to have us falling about the place  Nearly everyone from the north of Ireland who grew up at any stage of the Troubles was sent out on forced encounters across the religious divide just like the reconciliation weekend that provides the plot for the first episode of the new season Bridge building as it is known There was always a frisky interest in the talent on the other side It didn t always go well for us either but few can have been as disappointed as Clare played by Nicola Coughlan Determined to befriend a fully blown Protestant to outdo smarmy Jenny who already knows a half Protestant she ends up dangling over a cliff squealing that the boy holding the rope is a fenian hating madman 
MAR6	Set the children free – show them the joy of reading for reading’s sake	For many young people today books are only for school and exams the notion of reading for simple pleasure is greatly diminishing  This week a survey of children and young people carried out by the National Literacy Trust ahead of Thursday s World Book Day found only of eight to year olds read for pleasure And just a quarter of those will read daily dropping from figures It is a fact made worse by findings of Nielsen Book Research s annual survey on British children s reading habits which found that as few as of children under are read to daily by an adult for no other reason than the pure fun of it this is down from in with most parents stopping reading to their child by the age of eight 
MAR6	Stop talking about testosterone – there’s no such thing as a ‘true sex’	Debates are raging again over who should be allowed to compete in women s sport Take two recent examples that inflamed the internet First the Sunday Times reported that the International Association of Athletics Federations IAAF intended to classify women with higher natural testosterone as biological males just as m runner Caster Semenya was headed to court to challenge IAAF regulations that would exclude her and others from competing owing to higher than typical testosterone levels Then tennis great Martina Navratilova asserted that trans women biologically are still men and shouldn t be allowed to compete in women s events  The IAAF and Navratilova quickly backed away from these claims but the damage was done Many journalists intent on covering a mind bogglingly complicated subject with authority have asked me the same question recently Are women with high T testosterone biological males The answer is that there is no simple definition of what a biological male is 
MAR6	Renaming the Cook Islands would be a vital step towards true independence	Fifty four years after independence the Cook Islands is considering a name change Named after Captain Cook the Pacific islands located between New Zealand and Hawaii comprise Polynesian islands each with their own pre colonial names and histories and complicated dynamics in the present They are not the colonial fantasies of remote island adventures or tropical sexualities and more than tourist destinations  If you thought decolonisation in the Pacific was a mid th century moment that ended with political independence you would be wrong Decolonisation is a continuing undoing of the legacies of colonialism It involves re examining names and categories but it is not always about going back to the past to claim some authentic identity Hence Danny Mataroa chair of the Cook Islands name change committee has suggested a name that encompasses Christian faith which arrived after colonialism and M ori heritage which predates colonialism 
MAR6	Police spied on trade unionists for an illegal blacklist. We demand justice	Ten years ago today the Guardian broke the story of an illegal blacklist orchestrated by the country s largest building contractor The Consulting Association spied on construction workers who had the temerity to stand up for their rights or raise concerns about safety It directly carried on the work of the notorious Economic League an organisation that kept a list of alleged leftwing trouble makers who were often denied jobs When it was closed down in the Association s database held personal information on more than workers who were repeatedly denied work and endured long periods of unemployment and family hardship as a consequence  On this anniversary a new released police report proves that it was not just the building firms spying on us The UK s secret political police were also supplying information to the blacklist Operation Reuben was the internal police investigation into blacklisting launched after disclosures in the media and parliament The report by ex chief constable Mick Creedon on Operation Reuben s findings unequivocally states Police including Special Branches and the security services supplied information to the blacklist funded by the country s major construction firms The Consulting Association 
MAR6	In an era of brutal cuts, one ordinary place has the imagination to fight back	The story of local government today can be summed up in one word cuts Brutal life changing future cancelling cuts As many as children s centres have been closed by English councils since David Cameron took office in Almost libraries closed across Britain last year alone That s people with disabilities trapped in their homes grandparents denied adequate care and lifeline bus services scrapped  This is news that rarely makes the news It is announced through notices tied around lamp posts rather than in the national newspapers When Cameron and George Osborne designed their historic spending cuts to fall most heavily on local government this was the outcome they wanted private tragedies delivered through tens of thousands of brown envelopes plopping on to doormats across the land rather than one glaring public outrage Yet stack them all together and you can make two big bets about this country s future 
MAR6	We’re divorcing the EU. So why do hard Brexiteers still feel jilted?

MAR7	Cars are killing us. Within 10 years, we must phase them out	It s the last straw Parked outside the hospital doors is a minibus with its engine running The driver is playing on his mobile phone The fumes are blowing into the atrium I step up to his window and ask him to turn the engine off He does so grumpily Then I notice he s wearing a health service uniform I walk through the atrium down a corridor and into the cancer department not for cancer this time but to talk about reconstructive surgery I look around the huge waiting room and wonder how many of the people sitting here might be ill as a result of air pollution I think of people in other departments children with asthma attacks patients being treated for road injuries or suffering from a lifetime of inactivity as wheels replaced their feet And I m struck by the amazing variety of ways in which cars have ruined our lives  Let s abandon this disastrous experiment recognise that this th century technology is now doing more harm than good and plan our way out of it Let s set a target to cut the use of cars by over the next decade 
MAR7	Believe the victims of child sexual abuse? If only we did	Here are some things I don t really want to think about but have had to over the years Jimmy Savile s penchant for tracksuits as the bottoms can be pulled up and down so easily vulnerable year old girls in Rochdale ignored by local police seven year old boys sleeping in the bed of a pop star and being introduced to masturbation or the day long ago when I was teaching film studies and a film I showed Terence Davies Distant Voices Still Lives produced extreme distress for one of my mature students  Something in that film a shot of a sofa I think had caused a rush of terrible memories In those days there were groups for survivors of sexual abuse and I was able to find some kind of help for them Never for one moment did I disbelieve the distress I saw in front of me Nor did I find it strange that sometimes people did not clearly remember what happened to them as children and that they could not talk about it till many years later 
MAR7	Macron reached out to all Europeans, and what does he get? Scorn	Emmanuel Macron s letter to the citizens of Europe calling for a European renaissance was conveniently mocked or scorned by some who picked at its lofty language we need to politically and culturally reinvent the shape of our civilisation or its seemingly unrealistic to do list Yet the crux of his message was found not in the roadmap he attempted to lay out but in the audience he tried to address the million citizens of the EU s member states  This was the first time a European head of state or government had reached out not to fellow nationals or other governments nor to EU institutions but to the entirety of the bloc s citizens The only other leader who has ever attempted such a thing was Barack Obama in his speech in Hanover Address to the people of Europe That day Obama gave a pep talk to Europeans as the heirs to a struggle for freedom 
MAR7	Sick children being denied drugs are a grim foretaste of a post-Brexit NHS	Today in front of the health select committee in the Commons one of the bravest and best elements of the NHS has been giving evidence against Vertex a pantomime villain US drug company Caught in between are unfortunate patients also giving evidence today about their need for Vertex s cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi which Nice is so far refusing to approve  This is an everyday painful dilemma in the life of Nice the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence one of the Blair government s best creations With transparent criteria panels of expert and lay assessors examine the evidence to decide which new drugs offer enough new benefit at an acceptable price The Nice rule of thumb there are exceptions is a price of some for every good year of life gained by a patient a QALY a quality adjusted life year 
MAR7	Until they feel safe, young people will risk their lives by carrying knives	The senseless murders of two year olds Jodie Chesney and Yousef Makki have caused a national outrage Even though the killings were miles apart were not linked and do not appear to be gang related they have forced Sajid Javid the home secretary to finally call the growing number of knife attacks a national crisis  He d had countless opportunities to do so since taking up his post nine months ago there had been a number of black victims including year old Jaden Moodie who was viciously murdered in January yet he had refused This had led many people especially within the black community to suggest that his declaration of a crisis and the subsequent meeting with police chiefs happened only because the latest victims were white and from the suburbs 
MAR7	Another broken promise on Grenfell puts the lives of survivors on hold	In the weeks after the fire at Grenfell Tower that killed people the prime minister promised a swift inquiry urgent recommendations and a process that put the traumatised community at the heart of the process A promise was made justice would be done  Last night bereaved families and survivors heard that the police investigation into the fire would be delayed until the inquiry had presented its final report This means it could be at least the latter part of before detectives assess whether they have enough evidence to pass a file to the Crown Prosecution Service Then the CPS will need to decide whether to prosecute That will also take time We are looking at before key decisions are thought about let alone made That s five years after the fire before a prosecution is even considered 
MAR7	Labour‘s antisemitism problem is institutional. It needs investigation	When the Labour party set up the Equality and Human Rights Commission just over a decade ago it probably never dreamed it could itself be the subject of a statutory investigation  The crisis over antisemitism in the party has again reached an acute point with the resignations of MPs including heroic Luciana Berger the suspension of Chris Williamson for saying the party had been too apologetic over antisemitism and the ongoing revelations about the leadership interfering with disciplinary processes 
MAR7	A 'privacy-focused' Facebook would kill Zuckerberg's business model	Plenty of people look back on their early s and regret the things they said and did Few do it as publicly as Mark Zuckerberg  In a note posted to his social network on Wednesday the year old Facebook chief executive of spent words patiently explaining why the year old Facebook chief executive of was wrong to build a company predicated on the assumption that we would all want to live every second of our lives in the public sphere 
MAR7	It’s not the ‘white working class’. The real home of bigotry is elsewhere	New research this week has undermined the widely held view that to be prejudiced you must be poor It turns out that rather than the working class or the poorest it is middle income earners those in households with combined salaries of k k who are more likely to feel threatened by immigrants Muslims Gypsies and Travellers Tell me something I don t know  For years we have had a deeply divisive and incorrect conversation about the working class We constantly hear the working class is white rather than multi ethnic that it is the white working class who disproportionately voted for Brexit even though that is factually incorrect and that it is among the white working class that we find the majority of British racism 
MAR7	The Tories’ Islamophobia will not be stopped from within	The news that Conservative members were suspended this week alongside the reinstatement of Peter Lamb a Conservative council candidate in Harlow who then resigned on Tuesday demonstrates that the party has a significant amount of work to do to counter anti Muslim hate Lamb had previously tweeted Islam is like alcoholism The first step to recovery is to admit that you have a problem Yet he was reintroduced into the party to be a council candidate  Sadly as the founder and former director of the hate crime reporting project Tell Mama I know that views such as these have been picked up and circulated among groups that vehemently dislike Muslims There has been a steady drip of cases of anti Muslim bigotry in statements made by party members and councillors Serving Conservative councillors such as Hashim Bhatti have talked about a deeper problem within the party and the chair of the Conservative Muslim Forum Mohammed Amin said that the party has failed to take action against anti Muslim bigotry 
MAR8	Worried about Brexit? What, with these geniuses in charge?	In the depths of Building at Microsoft s Washington state headquarters there s a laboratory rated the quietest place on the planet This anechoic chamber is so silent that someone standing in it can hear not just their heart beating but the blood flowing in their veins People can t handle the experience for more than minutes Nasa has sent astronauts to a similar lab in Minnesota to prepare them for the terrifying silence of space Both of these facilities however are currently less silent than Michael Gove Remember him By way of a refresher course Michael was one of the architects of Brexit Or perhaps that s the wrong word given the mess Describing someone as an architect of Brexit is like describing the Luftwaffe as an architect of London Let s say Michael was one of the frontmen of the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union and is currently secretary of state for the environment  But you may recall him for his decision in the immediate wake of the referendum to knife leadership hopeful Boris Johnson This treachery backfired spectacularly with Michael s behaviour widely regarded as too distasteful even for the Conservative party Mindful that his personal brand was marginally more toxic than the Exxon Valdez then Michael has spent the past two and a half years cleaning up the fallout via apologetic interviews launching about six big idea consultations a week and being photographed going into cabinet carrying a refillable coffee cup The latter ruse was probably my favourite I only wish Brutus had waved something similar round the Capitol in late March BC It would have saved a lot of unpleasantness 
MAR8	An insane place where politics is done one day at a time – that’s Brexit Britain	So here we are The government seems to be headed towards a free vote on whether the country should leave Europe with no deal This is in case you are wondering an insane situation No deal would plunge the country into a state of emergency cause medicine and food shortages and the government is refusing to take a position on whether or not that should happen  Here s the timetable On the March MPs will vote whether or not to back Theresa May s deal If it is voted down on the March there will be a vote on whether or not to leave the EU with no deal a vote which it is reported the Tories will not whip which means Conservative MPs do not need to vote along the party s line If the outcome is not to leave the EU on the March MPs will decide whether to extend article a vote which will either end in no deal March s default outcome or in a lengthening of the current state of affairs which could still end in no deal Let s be clear no deal is a situation the head of the Confederation of British Industry called a threat to global stability on Friday and which medics have warned will cause thousands of British people to die 
MAR8	Michael Jackson’s trick was to groom an entire culture	It was hard this week watching R Kelly jump up and down on CBS while claiming his greatest problem was being big hearted and sitting through four hours of Michael Jackson revelations to hang on to the idea that the truth has implacable meaning In both cases the sense of outrage from the accused parties in Jackson s case his estate was palpable and brought to mind another example of male pattern entitlement that of Brett Kavanaugh during his supreme court confirmation hearing   They are trying to bring us down Jackson was reported as saying to one of his victims while asking him to lie in court The double think was part of the abuse The narrative was only ever these men s to control and one suspects that control was in large part what they got off on Guilt or innocence seemed secondary to the fury generated by the presumption of those who dared to doubt them 
MAR8	R Kelly and the art of the male meltdown	I m sure you ve seen the photo by now Gayle King sitting serenely and staring calmly ahead while R Kelly looms over her gesticulating violently The shot taken during King s interview with Kelly this week quickly went viral  It wasn t just the striking juxtaposition of King s professional calm and Kelly s frenzied rage that made the photo an instant classic It was the fact the juxtaposition was so familiar As many people noted the image was a flashback to Brett Kavanaugh s hearing before the Senate judiciary committee last year Dr Christine Blasey Ford was composed and measured while she gave her testimony She didn t raise her voice she didn t let her emotions get the better of her Kavanaugh in contrast ranted and raged He didn t care about being emotional because he knew he would never get called hysterical or irrational or shrill or crazy He knew that we treat angry men very differently than we do angry women 
MAR8	The terrifying case of a six-week embryo suing an abortion clinic	In Alabama a man is suing for what he believes is his right to allow any man to force a female partner to give birth against her will In a bizarre twist a judge has allowed a no longer in existence embryo to sue as well It s a case that highlights the fundamental divide between the pro choice movement and the anti abortion and often anti contraception one is the debate just about life Or is it about allowing men and the government to control women our lives our futures and the very skin organs and bones we live in  This case brings the stakes into sharp clarity 
MAR8	Neither oppressed nor trailblazing, Muslim women need to be heard	The politics of the Muslim woman remains wrapped up in debate The oppressed terrorist bride complex is rampant within our societal infrastructures and it s still deeply ingrained in the consciousness of the supposedly reasonable man on the Clapham omnibus Are we now though seeing any visible difference in the representation of Muslim women within mainstream media and politics I m inclined to think not  Her identity is still up for discussion by others if she is perceived to be oppressed then the secular white British media must highlight the oppressive nature of her religion and save her from it if she is on the terrorist bride Shamima Begum side of the scale she must be reminded that she is not an actual citizen of this country and resides here at the mercy of public and political opinion 
MAR8	To fix its problems now, Labour must face the racism in its past	It would come to be known as one of the UK s most racist pieces of legislation But when the then Labour home secretary James Callaghan rushed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act through parliament in the space of three days he was adamant it had nothing to do with race A series of cabinet papers released years later proved what everyone already knew at the time Callaghan wasn t telling the truth  Asian people were facing expulsion from Kenya and under the existing laws they would have been able to come safely and securely to the UK But the act rewrote the UK government s previous guarantees stripping them of their right to come here almost overnight The reason for these frantic changes was race The intentional aim was to stop coloured immigrants from entering this country 
MAR8	Anti-English sentiment in Ireland had healed. But Brexit has brought it all flooding back	Brexit has created many nightmares but a particularly unpleasant one is the rise of anti English sentiment in Ireland British Irish relations have not just cooled on a diplomatic and political level but among the Irish population The anti Englishness born of past oppression had we thought been confined to the past but has resurfaced And whose fault is that The emotional trauma of Ireland s treatment by Britain and England in particular is usually delicately contained but now it is spilling over  I grew up in Dublin far removed from the conflict north of the border but I went to an Irish speaking secondary school where boys wore balaclavas to school Gaelic football matches for a laugh and IRA was carved into desks with maths compasses As the painful peace process concluded and the Good Friday agreement came into force God Save the Queen was sung in Croke Park the hallowed ground of Gaelic sports and the Queen spoke in Irish at a state dinner in Dublin Castle It seemed as if anti British sentiment was at least covered over with a healing gauze if not completely healed But Brexit and the behaviour and rhetoric of British politicians the tone of the trightwing British press and the constant stream of ignorance about our island from across the Irish Sea has ripped that bandage off Everything is exposed now and it s a wound that has been and can be again mortal 
MAR8	Feminism without socialism will never cure our unequal society	The chair of the Institute of Directors Charlotte Valeur has used International Women s Day to criticise FTSE companies for not making enough effort to recruit and promote women and minority ethnic directors Scrolling through the list of FTSE companies one will find brands such as HSBC which was fined bn for helping drug cartels launder money in Mexico Sports Direct where workers have been exploited to the extent that one woman gave birth in the toilets and G S a company so mired in scandal that it has an entire Wikipedia page dedicated solely to the amount of controversies it has amassed If a company behaves terribly but its director is a woman is that still feminism  The reality of women s work across the world is not that we re duking it out to see who can make partner first it s exploitation low pay and precariousness Sexism is bad everywhere including in boardrooms but feminism must exist to improve the lives of the majority of women or it is worth nothing Valeur may get her wish for more female directors in the FTSE but it makes little difference to the world unless those women use their new power to fundamentally alter the relations between women and capital 
MAR8	No matter what happens with Brexit, this toxic environment must end	Tuesday should have been the annual MPs v press pancake race for charity Alas this year due to the daily hostilities traded on the green outside parliament where it s held it was cancelled The toxic Brexit induced climate around the Palace of Westminster made it too risky The speaker John Bercow expressed regret in the House While most right minded people abhor the extreme behaviour by some on the fringes putting MPs and journos back in their boxes is supported by the public Polling shows increasing faith in the military and royals but dwindling public trust in politics MPs and the traditional media And politics is polarised on a scale unseen before Brexit has meant that families political parties even the cabinet are split Three quarters of Britons surveyed say the UK is divided rising to among to year olds  Social media has had democratising effects Once if you wanted to contact an MP or sound off to the press you d have to go to the trouble of penning a letter finding a stamp and envelope then getting off your arse to post it Today a bit of typing on your mobile and the hazards of being ignored by your recipient or the filter of editorial control are removed Now everyone no matter how extreme has a platform 
MAR9	Only in Tory fantasy land does knife crime have nothing to do with austerity	A conservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality declared the American neo conservative Irving Kristol in as he predicted that experience would batter the idealistic into accepting the value of order and holding the guilty responsible for their crimes  In the st century it is conservatism s turn to become unreal and not only because Brexit has destroyed its claim to be the philosophy of the hard headed Brexit is a symptom of a wider Tory breakdown in which fantasies replace evidence and temporary convenience trumps the public interest Reality is mugging knifing and killing the British and all a Conservative prime minister safe behind her bodyguards can say is there is no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers 
MAR9	Playing politics with a child’s life shames us all, Mr Javid	Theresa May famously peddled a story about an illegal immigrant who had won his case because he had a cat and had used article of the Human Rights Act the right to a family life to stay in the country  It wasn t true but hey she didn t care she had a point to make about the Human Rights Act and she needed a headline grabbing story In the same speech the then home secretary said We must end the Human Rights Act As we now know she very unfortunately made it to the office of prime minister 
MAR9	Golf tycoons want to raid Scotland. It is our duty to defend its beauty	If there were an international beauty pageant for countries Scotland would win it most years In January it was voted the most beautiful country on the planet by the travel website Rough Guides  This follows similar awards by global travel specialists in three of the previous five years as well as ancillary awards for best island Lewis and Harris and quality of living Orkney Edinburgh Other countries have spectacular mountains and gorgeous lakes but nature seems to have chosen Scotland as the location for her best work 
MAR9	Carolee Schneemann, the artist you definitely didn’t hear about at school	The artist Carolee Schneemann has died at the age of Last summer she was one of the most intriguing interviewees in Rebel Women The Great Art Fightback a wonderful BBC documentary about the emergence of feminist performance art in the s and s That documentary is exactly my idea of a great night in and it was the first time I had seen many incredible revolutionary artists speaking from Suzanne Lacy to Judy Chicago  Although their work was all strikingly different the stories they told were pitifully similar They were derided and rubbished and it took decades for most of these pioneers to find even a modicum of recognition in the mainstream art world Talking about her Interior Scroll from which saw her pulling a long stream of paper out of her vagina and reading from it Schneemann said dryly that it probably cost her a lot of nice teaching jobs 
MAR9	For 2,000 years we’ve linked Jews to money. It’s why antisemitism is so ingrained	I m reluctant to add to the workload of the Equality and Human Rights Commission which this week announced the first step towards a statutory inquiry into Labour and antisemitism If it goes ahead it will be only the second time the commission has seen fit to investigate a British political party for racism the first related to the BNP and given the number of complaints that have been reported it ll have its work cut out Nevertheless I have a research trip to suggest  First though a word of context An oft heard defence of Labour is that a party of its now vastly increased size is bound to reflect the wider population since that population includes some antisemites then sadly but inevitably so will Labour But that swerves around a gloomier possibility that anti Jewish racism might exert a particular appeal to some on the left even paradoxically enough those who might otherwise proudly regard themselves as anti racists 
MAR9	This is not the week to push a people’s vote. May’s deal has to fail first	Here we go again Another big weekend of political speculation ahead of another big vote in parliament Cue the TV talking heads endlessly telling us this really is crunch time again  Amid the noise and the millions of words said and written about Brexit and the many interviews with ministers constantly telling us the prime minister has been very clear about this in truth very little is clear at all But this much is as clear as can be Theresa May lost the first meaningful vote on her withdrawal agreement and the accompanying political declaration by an enormous margin of defeat and the changes she said she would fight for in further negotiations in Brussels have not been forthcoming This time for once she would be right in saying nothing has changed 
MAR9	Would you like your Brexit vanilla or Marmite? It’s time to choose	This is it Next week sees the end of the beginning of Brexit and the beginning of the end Theresa May is determined to offer herself for ritual lynching by her mob of free trade anarchists having spent two years failing to face them down Parliament will then liberate itself from her torture and seek a new way forward The plan is for May s defeat on Tuesday to be followed by a vote against no deal and then by its only sane consequence a vote to delay article To make that delay acceptable to the EU there must be a plausible reason for it That means a plausible alternative Brexit agreed by the British parliament What is that alternative  The answer began to emerge last Wednesday from talks between the Nick Boles Oliver Letwin group of Tories and Labour s leader Jeremy Corbyn It is for the UK to leave the EU but remain a member of the European customs union It avoids the Northern Ireland border issue honours May s commitment to frictionless trade and meets a hundred other reasonable concerns of those involved in Britain s dealings with Europe There is no question that there would be a Commons majority for such a proposal as there is already in the House of Lords Only the glaring inadequacy of the two party leaders has prevented a multiparty agreement on remaining in the customs union being already reached 
MAR9	Worried about Brexit? What, with these geniuses in charge?	In the depths of Building at Microsoft s Washington state headquarters there s a laboratory rated the quietest place on the planet This anechoic chamber is so silent that someone standing in it can hear not just their heart beating but the blood flowing in their veins People can t handle the experience for more than minutes Nasa has sent astronauts to a similar lab in Minnesota to prepare them for the terrifying silence of space Both of these facilities however are currently less silent than Michael Gove Remember him By way of a refresher course Michael was one of the architects of Brexit Or perhaps that s the wrong word given the mess Describing someone as an architect of Brexit is like describing the Luftwaffe as an architect of London Let s say Michael was one of the frontmen of the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union and is currently secretary of state for the environment  But you may recall him for his decision in the immediate wake of the referendum to knife leadership hopeful Boris Johnson This treachery backfired spectacularly with Michael s behaviour widely regarded as too distasteful even for the Conservative party Mindful that his personal brand was marginally more toxic than the Exxon Valdez then Michael has spent the past two and a half years cleaning up the fallout via apologetic interviews launching about six big idea consultations a week and being photographed going into cabinet carrying a refillable coffee cup The latter ruse was probably my favourite I only wish Brutus had waved something similar round the Capitol in late March BC It would have saved a lot of unpleasantness 
MAR9	The great betrayal: how Britain’s industrial towns died of neglect	Perhaps there have been trade union banners on anti Brexit marches but I have never seen any Faced with the greatest threat to jobs and prosperity the UK has faced since the Great Depression organised labour refuses to be excited The Trades Union Congress TUC has a position in order to maintain workers rights and preserve tariff free frictionless trade with the rest of Europe it wants the UK to stay in the single market and customs union But union members themselves are noticeably shy about endorsing that line even in industries such as car making that are otherwise heading for extinction  Some go against it completely Reports suggest that most shop floor workers at the Nissan plant in Sunderland want to leave the EU regardless of the consequences A worker at the Jaguar plant at Solihull told the Guardian that he hadn t bothered to vote but he would have voted leave Even at the risk to his job Yes because it s not about jobs It s about immigration 
MAR9	The EU’s plan to rein in Facebook and Google will do exactly the opposite	The growth of the internet and user generated content in the past years has been underpinned by speed and ease of use The foundations for this are commonly referred to as safe harbour provisions in copyright law This means that organisations that allow users to upload content to their websites Wikipedia YouTube Facebook et al are not liable for copyright infringement of their users but are required to speedily remove content after the fact if a copyright makes a complaint Now through article of its new copyright directive the EU is curtailing these safe harbour provisions and thereby challenging the very basis of a free and open internet  Imagine that you upload content to a video sharing website and then have to wait for days for it to appear after it is vetted That could be the future of the internet in the EU 
MAR10	Why are our MPs putting blatant self-interest ahead of the Brexit vote?	In the parliamentary drama of the coming week the term Namierite is one you are unlikely to hear often if at all But it matches perfectly this moment in the Brexit saga wretchedly so in fact Sir Lewis Namier one of the great historians of the th century argued on the basis of detailed forensic analysis that most political behaviour is not motivated by high idealism but the complex interaction of faction and connections the search for personal advantage and the force of self interest  In his masterpiece The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III he wrote Men no more dreamt of a seat in the House in order to benefit humanity than a child dreams of a birthday cake that others may eat it the seat in the House was not their ultimate goal but a means to ulterior aims 
MAR10	Sajid Javid makes me question the value of Muslim politicians	Growing up I rarely saw people who looked like me occupying important political positions Minorities were far more likely to be represented in sport or entertainment than in real positions of power But in there are more high profile politicians from such backgrounds than ever Sajid Javid Chuka Umunna Priti Patel Sadiq Khan to name just four So why to me doesn t this actually feel like progress  When Khan won the London mayoral election as the Labour candidate in Sajid Javid tweeted From one son of a Pakistani bus driver to another congratulations This seemed at the time like a touching message across party lines Yet today it feels different 
MAR10	This is like Iraq all over again – we must extend article 50	It s become clear that the prime minister s strategy has been to run down the clock on parliament and the EU to push through her Brexit deal And not for the first time in our recent history parliamentarians have been backed into a corner by government ministers with the immense power and control they have in our political system and forced to choose between two unpalatable foreign policy options with dire consequences for the country  The framing of the choice is similar to the one MPs were presented with in the run up to the Iraq war military action against Saddam Hussein or the risk of an attack on this country The prime minister s version is a similarly artificial choice her deal or a chaotic and disorderly exit from the EU that we know will have severe consequences for our communities MPs are effectively being asked to choose between the frying pan and the fire in the hope they will choose the former and that can somehow be declared a victory 
MAR10	Europe must abandon these foolish Brussels treaties	An alternative to what Europe could and should be exists to the one Emmanuel Macron described last week If there is a need for a rebirth then let it be of the sovereignty of the people of enlightenment against the obscurantism of money and religion  In Europe the time has come to speak the only truly international language capable of motivating peoples widely diverse in history languages and culture It is the language of common good of its defence and its extension of living together of rebuilding after years of ransacked rights and public services and free and undistorted competition It is a language for peace in the face of frenzied belligerent anti Russian warlike Nato provocations 
MAR10	Brexit is heading towards extra time. The question then is: to what purpose?	Election slogans are rarely amusing when they are served hot from the political kitchen It is the cooling breeze of time that flavours the braggery of yesterday with a certain black comedy  Recall how David Cameron framed the choice at the election as one between strong and stable government led by himself or a coalition of chaos under Ed Miliband We have no way of knowing how chaotic life might have been under a Miliband government but it is reasonable to guess that even at his most hapless he would have struggled to match the unblemished record of unleashing havoc achieved by the Tories in the four years since 
MAR10	Bezos v the Enquirer reminds us of the potential for abuse of media power	In exposing what he called an extortionate proposal from the US publication National Enquirer Jeff Bezos founder of Amazon concentrated minds in newsrooms last month when he wrote in a blogpost Be assured no real journalists ever propose anything like what is happening here  The Enquirer s proposal in emails Bezos disclosed was that if Bezos would state publicly that there was no basis for suggesting the Enquirer s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces the Enquirer would stop publishing intensely private communications between Bezos and a woman with whom he was in a relationship 
MAR10	When schools close early, we are surely back in an age of decline	To millennials s nostalgia consists largely of themed nights at nightclubs a disturbing revival of synth pop and the return of shoulder pads With house prices pushing home ownership beyond the reach of those without private wealth and students leaving university with average debts of more than no one in their right mind would call young people fortunate but they are blessed in having no other associations with the s Small comfort I know  For the generations who were around to experience it the s is a decade that comes with baggage In as car manufacturers announce layoffs or transfer investment overseas as waiting times go up and satisfaction in the NHS heads down and with the formation of a new centrist party the gang of the past few weeks have increasingly felt like a trip around a s theme park The brief but ghastly reappearance last month of Derek Hatton the ghost of recessions past felt as apt as it did sick making

MAR10	How repressive does a country have to be before it becomes a guilt trip for tourists?	Go on visit Turkey For fun joy happiness and neverending journey Women are allowed to judge by the country s tourism website to laugh there now Will it be safe One hears these stories Be reassured says the useful tips section this is one of the safest countries in the world You ll find the police helpful and friendly Well the ones who are left since the president Recep Tayyip Erdo an dismissed a further officers in last year s purge  There s no section as yet dealing with the latest from the land of fun joy and happiness last week s warning by the minister of interior Suleyman Soylu to the effect that certain tourists could find themselves staying indefinitely Let them come and go to prison directly from the airport 
MAR10	Playing politics with the life of Shamima Begum's baby shames us all, Mr Javid	Theresa May famously peddled a story about an illegal immigrant who had won his case because he had a cat and had used article of the Human Rights Act the right to a family life to stay in the country  It wasn t true but hey she didn t care she had a point to make about the Human Rights Act and she needed a headline grabbing story In the same speech the then home secretary said We must end the Human Rights Act As we now know she very unfortunately made it to the office of prime minister 
MAR11	Even if Theresa May’s rotten deal scrapes through, Brexit will fester for a generation	Bring on the mayhem roll on the waves of chaos let Brexit and its conflicted Brexiters writhe over the impossible contradictions of their revolutionary cause The worse it gets the better for the country as the less likely we are to leave The prime minister s evening dash to Strasbourg may still deliver deadlock and a good thing too If we end the week with no deal a bar on no deal exit and a delay with length and purpose unknown the country inches closer to no Brexit If her rotten deal does scrape through this will not be the end it will fester on fought over for a generation unless the people have agreed it with a vote  Hardliners fight tooth and claw against delaying withdrawal as they see Brexit slip away Three long years since the referendum campaign makes that close result look more obsolete with each passing week so much has happened we know so much more The more furiously Brexiters assert that one vote is the only valid will of the people the more bogus their claim looks 
MAR11	Think the Commonwealth can save Brexit Britain? That’s utter delusion	I m struck as the British parliament moves towards the endgame on Brexit with the number of times Australia Canada New Zealand and India have been advanced by the Brexiteers in the public debate as magical alternatives to Britain s current trade and investment relationship with the European Union This is the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments that have emerged from the Land of Hope and Glory set now masquerading as the authentic standard bearers of British patriotism It s utter bollocks  If Britain proceeds with giving effect to what future historians will legitimately describe as the longest suicide note in history by leaving the union the cold hard reality is that the mathematics simply don t stack up in terms of credible economic alternatives to Europe Much as any Australian Canadian and New Zealand governments of whichever persuasion would do whatever they could to frame new free trade agreements with the UK the bottom line is that million of us do not come within a bull s roar of Britain s adjacent market of million Europeans 
MAR11	The guff spoken about Jess Phillips shows how uneasy people still are about class	I am not so much angry with the working class as deeply disappointed We are an embarrassment to our revolutionary leaders to the middle classes but mostly to ourselves We do a lot of stupid stuff We don t even identify as a class half the time And before you tell me I am not working class because I write in a newspaper and I like nice things can I just say you are right in one way wrong in others  The guff spoken about class after Jess Phillips gave an interview while wearing expensive clothes for a photoshoot showed just how uneasy and disingenuous about class some of the left remain She was deemed not working class enough I like Phillips She wants to sort out stuff and will get her hands dirty but she is not sufficiently loyal to the leader This is beyond tedious as well as vastly hypocritical The top of the Labour party is as close to the working class as I am to Prince Philip These are public schoolboys who appear never to have heard of equal ops Nepotism and privilege is rife so their anxiety about class is understandable 
MAR11	Low-paid work is no longer a route to better pay – it is a trap	One of the few domestic political issues that occasionally manages to make itself heard over the Brexit cacophony is the rollout of universal credit It is a huge and disruptive shake up of the welfare system which will end up taking more than a decade from legislation to implementation And it is no niche concern One in three working age households will be entitled to it once in place Spending will top bn a year roughly equivalent to what we spend on all primary and secondary education And from April most benefits will have been frozen for the fourth year in a row  We d normally expect the chancellor to be focusing on this issue at this time of year But the traditional spring budget has been moved to the autumn and the spring statement which Philip Hammond will give on Wednesday is not intended to be a major fiscal event so policy and spending announcements are unlikely 
MAR11	Social media polarises and radicalises – and MPs aren’t immune to its effects	Barely a week goes by without government ministers or MPs warning Facebook Twitter Google YouTube a subsidiary of Google Instagram or WhatsApp both owned by Facebook that they must do more to prevent radical or dangerous ideas being spread A crackdown is always just around the corner to protect users from harmful content  Oddly MPs never wonder whether they might be victims of the same effects of these tools that they too use all the time Why not though We keep hearing that it s a big problem for people to be repeatedly exposed to radical ideas and outspoken extremists It s just that for MPs those tend to be within their own parties rather than on obscure YouTube channels 
MAR11	We exclude the Labour left from British politics at our peril	Jeremy Corbyn s leadership is on borrowed time That assumption has hung over it throughout his three and a half years in charge It s there during every Labour crisis It s there before every perilous election such as the local polls this May And after every bad or even so so Labour result the end of Corbyn s leadership is there in the minds of his many enemies of many commentators of many anxious Corbynistas  When the party is doing better under him such as during and immediately after the election this sense that he is on perpetual probation recedes but never completely and never for long In June two days after Labour had won its largest general election vote since Tony Blair s landslide the then Labour MP Chris Leslie told BBC Radio s Today programme We shouldn t pretend that this is a famous victory It is good but it s not going to be good enough Twenty months later without waiting to see if his scepticism about Corbynism s electoral potential was justified he left the party to co found the Independent Group

MAR11	Northern Ireland policing is in crisis. It could threaten peace	Ten years ago the late Martin McGuinness then deputy first minister at the Northern Ireland assembly stood beside his unionist counterpart Peter Robinson the Democratic Unionist party first minister and called the dissident republicans who had murdered a police officer traitors to the island of Ireland Two weeks ago a senior Sinn F in figure on the Northern Ireland Policing Board said that among the Catholic community nationalist and republican confidence in the Police Service of Northern Ireland PSNI had hit rock bottom Now Karen Bradley the secretary of state has trampled into the middle of this crisis and made matters a great deal worse  Bradley who said last week that killings during the Troubles by members of the police and the British army were not crimes has the authority to select the person tasked with investigating police wrongdoing the police ombudsman when the current incumbent leaves in the summer This is absurd and untenable Bradley offered a belated apology claiming bizarrely that she did not mean what she said and that it was not her view However at a Northern Ireland affairs committee hearing several months ago she supported a call to change the law so that army veterans and former police officers do not face harassment in the courts 
MAR11	The European Spring holds the answer to the fragmenting EU’s plight	The European Union is fragmenting at a time when Europeans need it the most Emmanuel Macron is right to point this out But he is wrong to push another top down agenda that lacks credibility fails to speak to Europeans concerns and entrenches the democratic deficit at the heart of the EU By entrusting Europe s renewal to its unaccountable bureaucrats Macron s programme will only deepen the discontent that has given rise to the ultra right he claims to oppose  Over the past months we have worked with political parties activists and practitioners to develop a different kind of renewal programme one that offers immediate solutions to Europe s overlapping crises that gives control back to citizens in their communities and that sets out a long term vision for our democratic union It is called a New Deal for Europe and it will be put to voters across the continent in May s European parliament elections by our European Spring the transnational coalition of progressive forces brought together by Democracy in Europe Movement DiEM 
MAR11	There is a way to address the vile indignities heaped on homeless people	In Britain today homelessness is effectively a criminal offence A Guardian investigation shows at least councils up from last year have obtained the power to use public spaces protection orders PSPOs These orders criminalise people who put up tents seek charity or engage in other behaviour associated with rough sleeping They also give the council the power to hand out fines to rough sleepers which if left unpaid can result in conviction and a fine  More than people are homeless in Britain today Rough sleeping is up by since the Tories took power At least people died on our streets in 
MAR12	Theresa May’s Brexit lost to the ultimate adversary: reality	There might still be ways that Brexit can go badly unexplored dead ends and byways of failure But the road to success is now closed Parliament s second verdict on Theresa May s deal is slightly less crushing than the first one in January But a defeat by votes just weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU indicates not only the last evacuation of any authority from the prime minister but a profound crisis in the project that is the only purpose of her government She had one job and she cannot do it Vital questions about the future will now be settled in a state between despondency and panic There is no strategy no guiding intelligence A plan must be salvaged from the wreckage of a bad idea badly executed  There was a moment early today when May thought she saw a way through A path was briefly visible to the promised land of orderly Brexit The prime minister had brought legal clarifications from Strasbourg to embellish her deal But then the road was barred by Geoffrey Cox The attorney general judged that the UK might still find itself in the notorious backstop an EU customs union with no unilateral means of dissolving the arrangement Indefinite backstop is a deal breaker for hardliners 
MAR12	Punchbag May is humiliated again. But for MPs the real crisis starts now	Well that seemed interminable It was gone pm by the time the tellers appeared And the prime minister was hammered again would in normal times represent a total humiliation But we don t live in normal times Nowadays the second biggest defeat in the House of Commons since represents progress  The problem now confronting the prime minister is a relatively simple one The endless breathless speculation and rolling coverage of days such as today often feels more like football transfer deadline day than politics as usual But as any football fan knows deadline day depends on the existence of a fixed deadline that everyone accepts 
MAR12	Britain is trapped in the purposeless austerity that gave us Brexit	Slap bang in the middle of this week falls one parliamentary event likely to be greeted with near silence When Philip Hammond stands up tomorrow afternoon to deliver his spring statement on the health of Britain s finances he ll know in his bones that it will provoke no feverish excitement among lobby journalists nor command the front pages Given a major economic policy announcement newsreaders would previously devote their bulletins to his figures and forecasts this time they will probably give it a mere moment s notice And who can blame them  A prime minister potentially faces her last days in office her cabinet is in all out mutiny and the country teeters on the brink of its biggest foreign policy decision in almost half a century Herein lies a glorious chance to treat politics as Netflix to gossip about court intrigues among Boris and Amber and Jacob to refer in am dram tones to Cox s codpiece and the Malthouse compromise Presented with all that which puritan would plump instead for Spreadsheet Phil and his dry bread sums 
MAR12	My complaints of Tory Islamophobia were ignored, so I had to resign	In January I took the heart wrenching decision to resign as chair of South Shields Conservative Association It was a difficult moment My parents came to Britain from India in the s My father worked as a coalminer for years I was born here and we were a typical working class family My father has been a Labour supporter all his life like so many first generation immigrants so it was a surprise to both my parents when I joined the Conservative party  But they were so proud when I was elected chairman of my local association I have always been so grateful for the opportunities made available to me here and I often reflect on how my life might have turned out had my father not embarked his arduous journey to these shores 
MAR12	I’m not the mother who left her baby at the airport. But I could have been	I have left my baby on walls in public toilets up trees on trains rolled under beds and on one very memorable occasion in an envelope at the bottom of my handbag I had to fumble under keys books a spare jumper and some tissues to pull it out Not in real life you understand but in a thousand sweaty sleepless eye juddering neck clasping nightmares For one woman this week that nightmare became true  Like John Candy in his polka van seeking to bring solace to Kevin s mother in Home Alone I am not here to criticise the woman who left her baby in a Saudi airport as she boarded the plane to Kuala Lumpur I have no right or any authority to question any other parent s ability to cope under stress or navigate the unfamiliar I certainly have no interest in puffing up my own sense of smug accomplishment by revelling in comparison and mother bashing here s looking at you YouTube commenters I have left enough bags coats phones tickets and keys on enough benches buses and other people s bonnets while juggling and jiggling a helpless baby to know that sometimes you simply do not have the capacity to carry all the disparate parts of your life along without occasionally faltering About two months into motherhood I spent two hours in my own garden sitting on a plastic bag entertaining the baby with clothes pegs and singing the songs from Aladdin because I had forgotten not just my keys and wallet but also any snacks toys or phone 
MAR12	To my ERG colleagues, I urge you to hold your nose and support May’s deal	Theresa May s deal has many issues within it issues that are intended to be short term We don t want to take EU rules over which we have no say we don t want to answer to European courts and certainly not permanently We asked May to go and make sure these issues should only be temporary and she has achieved something It s not everything it s not perfect but it s something that shifts the balance of risk  As the attorney general Geoffrey Cox has said this is a political decision which is informed by the legal advice He is clear that the risk of our being tied in against our will is significantly reduced and we ve been clear about our intentions going forward The unilateral declaration sets out our understanding of the agreement and our intention to leave if obligations are not fulfilled It s not perfect it s a legal argument we would have to make at that time but it does have legal weight and has been accepted by the EU In conjunction with the joint statement making a commitment to acting immediately on finding alternative border arrangements and securing a better future relationship one that does not have to be based on the existing backstop plans the risks of foul play or entrapment by the EU are significantly reduced 
MAR12	Cox’s verdict on the backstop is the final nail in the coffin for May’s deal	 The legal risk remains that the United Kingdom would have at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same no internationally lawful means of exiting the backstop And with that verdict from attorney general Geoffrey Cox on the modified withdrawal agreement the chances of Theresa May s deal getting through the Commons this evening have receded to almost nothing  The chances were always slim But if Cox had declared that the concessions May had obtained in the form of an addendum to the original withdrawal agreement were transformative in terms of the backstop the prime minister had hoped to be able to rally enough MPs behind her deal to at least minimise the scale of her defeat to less than votes This would have left the door open to her to bring back her deal for a third meaningful vote next week 
MAR12	Is ‘Future Britain’ the lifeline disenchanted Labourites need?	What on earth is Tom Watson up to now  People have been asking that question almost as long as Labour s deputy leader has been in the Labour party in fairness All that has changed since the arch fixer s days of plotting to oust Tony Blair for Gordon Brown is the nature of who s asking But it s always a question worth taking seriously which is why this week s inaugural meeting of Future Britain a new grouping to uphold Labour s social democratic and democratic socialist tradition which Watson promised to create in the traumatic aftermath of nine MPs leaving the party was packed to the rafters 
MAR12	I've been drafted into 'operation no deal'. And things here feel desperate	The real countdown has truly started In Whitehall today the clocks are striking the number of days left before we are due to leave the European Union Tempers are running high So too is the nation s imagination in the few weeks since my first article the Brexit commentariat has created such a torrent of snarky metaphor including many references to how terrified yet also strangely bored of Brexit we all are that it feels like we re being hit by a tsunami of tepid tapioca  Yet we can t seem to get enough Politico and other websites have even started collecting the best Brexaphors There s Mad Max Hotel California cake the Titanic a chocolate orange a Mexican standoff a blue furry monster actually the Dutch came up with that one but it s too cute to leave out And it s not too late to get your Brexit advent calendar 
MAR12	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is right – it's time for radical change, not more ‘meh’ politics	Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is an equal opportunity irritant The newly elected congresswoman doesn t just drive Republicans to distraction she routinely riles establishment Democrats with her refusal to meekly toe the party line Ocasio Cortez to the chagrin of many of her colleagues has no interest in diluting her views and occupying a safe middle ground If that wasn t obvious enough already AOC made her derision for political moderates extremely clear in a speech at South by Southwest on Saturday   Moderate is not a stance It s just an attitude towards life of like meh Ocasio Cortez told a packed room at the tech centric festival in Austin Texas We ve become so cynical that we view cynicism as an intellectually superior attitude and we view ambition as youthful naivety when the greatest things we have ever accomplished as a society have been ambitious acts of vision The meh is worshipped now For what 
MAR13	MPs have voted against no deal. Now here’s how to make that decision stick	MPs have just voted against a no deal Brexit But this vote doesn t achieve much by itself because it s just an indicative vote No deal can t be taken off the table it is the table You ll hear this clever soundbite in the Twitter feeds of MPs and commentators on both sides of the Brexit divide but it suffers from the serious defect of being wrong  When we talk about no deal being the table what we really mean is that it is the present default position It is absolutely true that unless we agree a deal we will leave the EU without one be that on the th of this month if no extension is granted or if an extension is granted when that extension expires No deal is as things stand the ultimate default position 
MAR13	Theresa May is truly on the ropes. But there may yet be life in her deal	And so the Brexit options facing Theresa May tighten again remorselessly and painfully and with more pain to come A day after a second decisive defeat for her withdrawal deal with the EU and amid threats and chaos in the Westminster lobbies MPs narrowly wrested control from May by four votes over the possibility of no deal Then in a second vote they drove the message home again this time by an unambiguous majority of  We are witnessing a watershed in the Brexit process as power passes from May s government to shifting coalitions of MPs on individual issues in front of our eyes But the passing from one chapter of the story to another is unmistakable in spite of the confusion in the lobbies last night The government that had first promised a free vote to Conservative MPs ended the evening by vainly trying to whip its MPs against the toughened no deal motion and still lost lost badly 
MAR13	The middle ground is our only route out of this Brexit abyss	Brexit is a conundrum in search of a compromise The referendum after all delivered a narrow majority for leave the political convulsions ever since have torn at Britain s democratic and social fabric and no one credible believes a hard break from the EU can be achieved without significant economic pain A rational approach therefore would focus on a compromise seeking to unite the country as much as possible minimise economic damage and allow the conversation to shift on to what Theresa May diagnosed and proceeded to fuel as the burning injustices disfiguring British society But the middle ground underpinning such a compromise has been deliberately shredded torched carpet bombed from both directions  The British right and their media allies have played the decisive role Tory media outlets and the Tory hierarchy David Cameron included spent years demonising migrants scapegoating them for social problems like stagnating wages or the housing crisis that are actually caused by those with power George Osborne s ideologically driven austerity project failed 
MAR13	Did no one tell Philip Hammond that austerity is raging outside?	Listen to Philip Hammond and it s easy to get lulled into a false sense that he is an adult making sober cautious decisions Not blessed with the ahem charisma of a Boris Johnson he is happily less given to spouting headline grabbing rubbish While his colleagues have spent the past two and a half years promising voters the moon on a stick the chancellor has kept his cool The spring statement was classic Hammond Sandwiched between Tuesday s humiliation for Theresa May and the no deal vote Wednesday night he was never going to command any front pages Watching you could mistake him for the bank manager your branch doesn t have sensible dull unremarkable  In which case you d have misjudged both him and his policies Because Hammond has just taken two big risks One of those was right and could damage him the other a huge blunder and will hurt the rest of us 
MAR13	Silicon Valley is erecting a monument to itself. Will it be a giant robo-phallus?	Every city has a landmark that celebrates what its people love France has the Eiffel Tower which is both astonishingly beautiful and admittedly a bit penisy New York has the Empire State Building which is the same but bigger Rome has the Colosseum to celebrate an oiled up Russell Crowe  Now Silicon Valley power brokers want to honour the thing they truly love by building their own massive monument to themselves The San Jose Light Tower Corporation has raised m to create a statue that honours Silicon Valley itself They hope to raise up to m for a great idea according to the New York Times 
MAR13	With Theresa’s ‘turd’ deal flushed away, pray for an EU invasion	 It sends a message to the whole world croaked Theresa May to the Commons on Tuesday night about the sort of country the United Kingdom will be in the years and decades ahead  Fairly sure the world has got the message by now They are up to speed and across the detail of the sort of country the UK is The question of whether Brexit represented a midlife crisis or the descent into senility appears to have been answered The land that likes to picture itself as a David Niven world war two movie is in fact a look away episode of The Jeremy Kyle Show On close inspection the beacon of democracy turns out to be a bin fire 
MAR13	May and Corbyn will never back a second referendum – but MPs must	It s become the norm in these most extraordinary of political times the prime minister suffers another humiliating defeat after two years of negotiations on the most important decision in decades and no one in the House of Commons shouts Resign  Although there is little if any sympathy for Theresa May the consensus being that she is the author of her own misfortune no leader of any party stands up and demands she steps down Even though it s widely recognised that the prime minister is largely the problem it s accepted that the Conservative party is unlikely to find anyone much better to replace her 
MAR13	Parliament is betraying voters, but a clean Brexit is the best option	Parliament is failing to respect the wishes of the majority in the referendum Labour and Conservative MPs promised to implement the leave vote to get elected in The Conservative manifesto said no deal was better than a bad deal and confirmed we would be leaving the customs union and the single market at the same time The Labour manifesto set out a detailed and interesting new trade policy for the UK that would be incompatible with staying in the customs union and EU market arrangements  The leave voting public is in despair about this parliament s failure to agree a common line to leave Some blame the government for negotiating badly Others blame the opposition for undermining the UK negotiation by implying no deal is not an option and for having separate lines of communication with very different messages to the EU All feel democracy is letting them down It is not just the lack of enthusiasm to implement the referendum vote but also the way many MPs have torn up their pro Brexit election statements 
MAR13	Here’s our plan for an orderly no-deal Brexit, and delivered on time	From the moment that Geoffrey Cox the attorney general published his advice that despite the prime minister s efforts to secure an amendment to the backstop the legal risk remains unchanged the fate of the withdrawal agreement was sealed To some that may be taken as a signal of a deeply divided Conservative party Yet in its commitment to honour its manifesto promise to deliver Brexit by leaving the single market the customs union and the remit of the European court of justice the party is anything but  My own local association voted unanimously last month that Brexit as defined in the manifesto must be delivered on time and in full The National Conservative Convention the senior body in the voluntary party passed a similar motion by a ratio of to and also stated that Another referendum a delay beyond the European elections taking no deal off the table or not leaving at all would betray the people s vote and damage democracy and our party for a generation 
MAR13	These gaffes expose British politics’ real issue with race	Among the unremarkable racial experiences in my life I have been chased off a train as a teenager by men twice my age and size shouting nigger pursued down a main street in Edinburgh by two men with baseball bats shouting the same word had racist graffiti scrawled on my house and had countless people shout at me in the street Unremarkable not because they weren t terrifying or upsetting at the time but because such stories are relatively common among black people of my age who grew up in Britain  So when I hear that someone has failed at racial etiquette I generally roll my eyes whether or not they are a politician I have seen heard and felt worse The pattern is now painfully familiar In an unscripted moment a public figure uses a term that is either outdated coloured offensive nigger or just plain odd funny tinge Indignation caffeinated by social media erupts The person then doubles down or apologises or as often as not doubles down and then apologises I get a phone call from a radio or television outlet asking if I want to come on and talk about it I don t 
MAR14	With Brexit now on hold, there’s only one option left: compromise	The Brexit chasm has seemed unbridgeable No path has appeared through the impasse Tonight a glimmer of a route came into view Parliament decided to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day and extend the negotiating phase probably for three months It did so shamelessly because it could not agree on what on earth to do next  The EU reasonably asks why If the UK could not decide on Brexit in two and a half years what difference will three months make The answer is that Theresa May is refusing to give up on her red lines and her frantic efforts to appease the rightwing of her party Yet her deal has not so far pleased them and it has now gone down to defeat twice by huge margins Astonishingly she wants to try one more time next Tuesday 
MAR14	Theresa May has finally got the Brexiters where she wants them	MPs had the chance to take back control of Brexit wresting this tortured process from a weak flailing and moribund government and they ducked it Sure it was by the narrowest of margins losing by just two votes to but MPs passed up the opportunity to take charge and say at long last what kind of Brexit they want They preferred instead to grant Theresa May yet another lifeline for her own deal which incredibly will come back for a third meaningful vote on Tuesday  The lever that was offered to MPs by which they might have finally got a grip on the Brexit crisis was a proposal from Hilary Benn that would have seen a series of votes allowing MPs to indicate their preferred Brexit plan whether that be Norway plus or a second referendum or every shade in between No longer would May retain the initiative with the power to confine MPs to a single binary choice my way or the highway 
MAR14	The problem is not so much Theresa May – it’s that Britain is now ungovernable	Dramas need characters politics requires politicians and a storm must have an eye Which is why at the dead centre of Brexit the biggest and most multifaceted crisis to face this country in more than years there is just one person She stands at a Commons dispatch box in an elegant outfit day after day knowing that the evening will cover her in yet another dung heap of humiliation that will be daubed all over the next morning s front pages All along her frontbench are colleagues just waiting for her to go so they can take her job and move into her Downing Street home On her backbenches are MPs who shamelessly boast to journalists their fantasies about putting her in a noose and knifing her in the front She is derided she is hated she is the target for some of the most outrageous abuse ever to be heaped on a year old woman from Eastbourne  In a democracy intent on beating itself up Theresa May has become the nation s punchbag On radio phone ins the callers pour bile upon her On TV sofas pundits speculate about how many days she has left at No When she isn t attracting derision she attracts something arguably worse for a politician pity Her voice has gone and the theory goes soon she will follow 
MAR14	If children don’t join the climate strike, their schools are underachieving	There will be another large scale school climate strike tomorrow following a controversial walkout by pupils last month I say controversial the reaction in much of the grownup media was perhaps better described as a reluctant obligation to be adult about the whole thing while secretly cheering them on  Even prominent Conservatives struggled to feign disapproval of this wanton act of civic engagement by the next generation Energy minister Claire Perry wistfully told the BBC she would have joined the walkouts in her younger years She may take a different line if the kids keep it up it is after all her department they are protesting against 
MAR14	I know the panic of ‘maths anxiety’. But hope may be the best solution	I m bad at maths I want you to know that this is not a boast though to say that you are bad at maths has somehow become a badge of honour in a way that publicly saying I m barely literate never can be even Donald Trump doesn t admit that A few years ago the charity National Numeracy even criticised celebrities who boast about their poor maths skills as contributing to the national scourge of poor numeracy  Why do people do it Is it to make themselves appear quirky and creative or do we just not consider it a vital life skill Either way it isn t helping and now new research from the University of Cambridge has found that studying maths is causing some primary school pupils to feel rage and despair as a result of maths anxiety with some reduced to tears and others struggling to breathe 
MAR14	A general election is now possible. To win it, Labour must back Europe	The good the mad the dishonest and the cowardly that s roughly how the House of Commons split last night and probably will again tonight The honours go to those Tory MPs and ministers especially the four cabinet ministers who sought to ensure that whatever else happens they will not lead the country to destruction They can hardly be sacked since they were promised a free vote until only minutes before the division when the prime minister tried to swerve her troops into the wrong lobby  The no deal horses of the apocalypse were well described by the chancellor the introduction of appalling tariffs that would slaughter industry swamped with cheap goods while killing exporters whose goods get too expensive as smuggled EU loot undercuts everyone via the Irish border He couldn t have said it plainer but then what He jumped on to one of those horses and galloped into the lobby to vote to allow that to happen List him among the dishonourable 
MAR14	Marketing medication as his and hers? This is ‘anxiety economy’ at its worst	If you have ever spent more than five minutes on Instagram you ll probably be familiar with the sleek pink packages that indicate someone has bought something from Glossier The company an American cosmetics brand founded in has become famous not only for its products but also for its aesthetic cutesy minimalist pastel packaging expertly targeted at the perfect millennial customer As with many brands what you are actually getting doesn t always seem to matter photographing it being seen to have it is what you are paying for  Legions of brands have followed Glossier s example at first other cosmetic companies then homeware lifestyle and more Now it seems the Glossierification of everyday life is finally complete as the telemedicine brands Hims and Hers neatly show 
MAR14	A flawed second referendum could break our democracy	We ve been locked in a tug of war for years that has effectively shut down government and produced drift anxiety and anger Today a group of MPs will push for a second referendum to break the deadlock In Westminster their voices have dominated the Brexit debate and at times made a second vote seem inevitable But when I go home to Wigan for the most part it seems absurd  I ve never been a fan of binary choices I dislike the divisive nature of our first past the post electoral system and argued against a simple remain leave referendum on the EU which forced people to take sides on an issue that for most inspires mixed feelings I am even less convinced by the case for a second referendum in the terms proposed 
MAR14	Austerity created this mental-health crisis. Brexit has sent it into overdrive	There was something about the events in Westminster this week that made me think of the news that sales of self help books in Britain are at a record high As we encounter an ever more stressful and unsteady climate we are turning to those who offer answers an issue not least for those who can t afford the price of a book Some of this anxiety must come down to more global patterns climate change say or the fragility of democratic norms but much can come down to the more prosaic matters of life ability to pay the bills job prospects or simply the sense that we have a grasp on the future  Just look at Brexit More than four in people say that Brexit has impacted on their mental health in the past two years hardly surprising considering of respondents to the YouGov survey believed EU withdrawal will worsen their lives Some EU nationals living in the UK have even reported feeling suicidal as uncertainty about their future steps up 
MAR14	Wake up, Philip Hammond. The climate crisis needs action, not lip service	For once Philip Hammond s spring statement acknowledged the climate crisis and the collapse of wildlife and insect populations around the world  But has the chancellor been swept up by the rising tide of climate activism Has he been inspired by the courage and passion of the young people joining school strikes to defend their futures Sadly not 
MAR15	After Christchurch, Muslims need more than just your thoughts and prayers	There is a certain profundity about waking up one morning when your only plans for the day are to go to Friday prayers with your family to discover that on the other side of the world people just like you doing exactly the same thing with their Friday as you intend to do with yours have been slaughtered  My first response upon reading of the massacre in Christchurch was I admit stunned blankness I could read the words and I understood them but for a few moments there was no obvious emotional reaction Not because I didn t care about what had happened but because the enormity of it meant it was simply too difficult to immediately process 
MAR15	Brexit – the niche production that truly brought the house down	We focus so much on what divides parliament s warring Brexit factions when almost all of them are united by the guiding principle of brinkmanship Eventually someone will stop acting like a shit but it certainly won t be me The past few days have been like watching the Cuban missile crisis re enacted by the Teletubbies  A recap then Hopes that Tinky Winky would grow into the role of Bobby Kennedy were dashed this week in a series of votes in the House of Commons We are days out from the date the UK will leave the European Union without a deal unless something else is agreed upon With the threat of that something being a long extension if granted by the EU Theresa May is hoping MPs will look again at her withdrawal agreement next week in Meaningful Vote Sure they saw it lurching around the bar earlier and thought there was no way in a million years they were going home with it But this close to tipping out time are they drunk enough to panic buy If the answer turns out to be yes the prime minister s various earlier losses this week will be hailed momentarily as tactically astute Think of it as a sort of Crap Negotiations World Cup Theresa May doesn t want to finish top of the group or her Brexit will face the Treaty of Versailles in the semis 
MAR15	The climate strikers should inspire us all to act at the next UN summit	Tens of thousands of young people took to the streets on Friday with a clear message to world leaders act now to save our planet and our future from the climate emergency  These schoolchildren have grasped something that seems to elude many of their elders we are in a race for our lives and we are losing The window of opportunity is closing we no longer have the luxury of time and climate delay is almost as dangerous as climate denial 
MAR15	Four ways you can support the YouthStrike4Climate movement	Since we made headlines in February with the UK s first school strike we ve seen an outpouring of support from our peers parents carers politicians and other people from all walks of life It seems that most people know we re in a mess but they just didn t know what we can to do to get out of it  This is where the UK Student Climate Network UKSCN stepped in not necessarily out of choice but necessity There s no time left for the adults in the room to solve the climate crisis The politicians and powerful actors have failed us Youth is rising up all around the world and here in the UK we re emerging as one of the most powerful forces demanding urgent and radical change 
MAR15	Do UK politicians support the climate strike? Party leaders respond	By taking to the streets today to make their voices heard young people are educating us about how important tackling climate change is to their generation They are right to be worried about what kind of planet they will inherit and right to demand far reaching action Governments cannot sit back leaving major decisions to market forces It hasn t worked and it never will Polluting corporations will never do anything serious to solve the crisis  Climate change presents terrible risks But because it demands such massive change and government action it s also an opportunity to transform our economy making it cleaner healthier and fairer Labour already has among the most ambitions carbon reduction targets in Europe and radical plans to create a zero carbon emission economy by We plan to achieve that by ushering in a green industrial revolution 
MAR15	Bloody Sunday was a very British atrocity – the top brass got away with it	There may be only one thing that the Bloody Sunday families and the defenders of the Parachute Regiment are agreed on following the announcement that a former lance corporal is to be charged with two murders and four attempted murders that it is perverse and unfair that one low ranking soldier should be made to carry the can for what happened in Derry years ago  Once again Kipling s poor bloody infantry are to take the blame 
MAR15	The UK says it’s a climate leader. But it’s complicit in climate atrocities	It wasn t long ago that Theresa May stated boldly that she wanted the Britain of the future to be a truly global Britain which is a force for good in the world Steadfast in upholding our values not least our fierce commitment to protecting the natural environment  Not everyone was fooled least of all the thousands of young people striking from school today to call on world leaders to finally take the climate crisis seriously 
MAR15	Think we should be at school? Today’s climate strike is the biggest lesson of all	It started in front of the Swedish parliament on August a regular school day Greta Thunberg sat with her painted sign and some homemade flyers This was the first school climate strike Fridays wouldn t be regular schooldays any longer The rest of us and many more alongside us picked it up in Australia Germany Belgium Switzerland New Zealand Uganda Today the climate strike will take place all around the world  This movement had to happen we didn t have a choice We knew there was a climate crisis Not just because forests in Sweden or in the US had been on fire because of alternating floods and drought in Germany and Australia because of the collapse of alpine faces due to melting permafrost and other climate changes We knew because everything we read and watched screamed out to us that something was very wrong 
MAR15	Young climate activists around the world: why I’m striking today	We strike for the Earth to protect and save it from what the human race has done As indigenous youths we have a close connection to the Earth We know that without it we have nothing we are nothing Our community is directly affected by the Cold Lake oil sands which is a large deposit of tar sands Some of the tar sands can be extracted through drilling which is incredibly dangerous to land animals and people and affects the water and air quality in negative ways We must think of the future generations what we do today tomorrow and the next day will impact the next seven generations We must change our ways from burning natural resources from releasing so much carbon from poisoning what we need to live We cannot survive by drinking oil  I am from the Central Taiwan Plains Indigenous People As the indigenous people of Taiwan we have a particular vulnerability to climate change Our traditional culture is deeply rooted in the harmony we have with the spirit of nature We face heartbreaking loss due to increasingly extreme weather events We urge the Taiwanese government to implement mitigation measures and face up to the vulnerability of indigenous people halt construction projects in the indigenous traditional realm and recognise the legal status of Plains Indigenous People in order to implement environmental protection as a bottom up approach 
MAR15	The decision to prosecute only one soldier over Bloody Sunday is unbelievable	The dignity and determination with which the Bloody Sunday families have conducted their struggle for truth and justice over the past years has been a source of inspiration And there is no doubt that their hopes were high of another major breakthrough on Thursday morning as we walked through the same Bogside streets where the massacre happened all those years ago  For the vast majority of the families those hopes were to be dashed shortly after they arrived in the City hotel to be told by the Public Prosecution Service PPS that only one former soldier would face murder charges over the deaths of James Wray and William McKinney and attempted murder charges relating to Joseph Friel Michael Quinn Joe Mahon and Patrick O Donnell 
MAR16	To ignore Nigel Farage and the populist right is complacent	Conventional wisdom has a remarkable capacity to recover from the many batterings it receives and carry on as if nothing has happened Like Doctor Who it doesn t die but regenerates  Last week it was anticipating the defeat of the populist right that combination of opportunism utopianism victimhood wilful ignorance conspiracism and racism for which we do not yet have a satisfactory label Even though Theresa May s government is collapsing as if it has been hit by a wrecking ball even though her withdrawal agreement has been defeated by the two of the largest majorities ever conventional wisdom assures us that the Brexit ultras must support it on her third attempt 
MAR16	Americans really pay a bribe for a good education? In Britain, we’ve got far subtler ways	 Dude dude what do you think I m a moron Thus one of the parents accused of involvement in the US college bribery racket He d been warned by a wiretapped conspirator not to reveal that he paid for his daughter s fraudulent test results part of a system the fixer calls the side door  Appropriately soothed I m not saying you re a moron the accused father is recorded by the FBI assuring the scam s organiser that he ll deliver if required the agreed fiction I m going to say that I ve been inspired how you re helping underprivileged kids get into college Totally got it 
MAR16	Hungry, unwashed children fill our schools – how has it come to this?	According to a survey from the headteachers union the Association of School and College Leaders schools have become an unofficial fourth emergency service for the families worst affected by austerity across England and Wales  A majority of the school leaders surveyed said schools were increasingly forced to help pupils despite less help from councils and have had to cut budgets Schools are helping with food parcels equipment shoes and hygiene nine out of give out clothes while nearly half do laundry for them Some are running impromptu food banks or sourcing beds 
MAR16	Luke and Sophie Perry: where’s the shame in grieving your own way?	Of all the difficulties to navigate when caught up in the sickening grip of grief to be told you are not grieving correctly by strangers must be the one of the most bizarre The actor Luke Perry s year old daughter Sophie was driven to write an Instagram post in which she defended herself against criticism she had faced since her father died suddenly of a stroke aged She wrote that she had received a lot of attention online since he died She said she had not asked for this focus to be upon her and that among the kind messages she had also been shamed for her grieving process which it seems has been seen by some as not being sad enough   I m not going to sit in my room and cry day in and day out until the internet has deemed it appropriate for me to do otherwise she said with more dignity than anyone who caused her to write that really deserved 
MAR16	Excluded children can still have hope: here’s the proof	This summer when she leaves school Leah wants to become an art therapist Her classmate Holly wants to do something with psychology and for Sam it s an apprenticeship with the police None of this would be unusual except that Sam not his real name a chatty and engaging year old used to spend his days at school in isolation and his evenings getting into trouble around town with his mates He thought he had irrevocably screwed up his life and was resigned to having blown it Fortunately for Sam he found somewhere prepared to give him not just a second chance but a third and a fourth and a fifth Whatever happened yesterday tomorrow is always a new day  All three teenagers attend Restormel academy in the Cornish town of St Austell It s one of a group of alternative provision schools belonging to the Wave multi academy trust catering for children permanently excluded from mainstream secondary schools plus others who haven t been expelled but may be on the verge who come in for specialist interventions The young people I meet are friendly articulate and sick of a national debate raging over their heads that draws sometimes crude connections between exclusion knife crime and feral behaviour 
MAR16	My father was killed on Bloody Sunday. Britain must confront its colonial legacy	The decision by the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland to bring murder and attempted murder charges only against Soldier F for his alleged actions on Bloody Sunday astonished families as they gathered to hear the news It has also drawn more poison from the military establishment adding to its growing belief that its loyal foot soldiers have in recent times become the scapegoats of colonial history  The facts around the Bloody Sunday deaths and around stories affecting many hundreds of families who lost loved ones including my father who was killed that day due to the actions of state forces in the years following are that very few were actually investigated as crimes Evidence was not collected Inquests were rushed and often held without family involvement or legal awareness of rights limited as they were Only four criminal trials were held for members of the security forces during almost years of conflict No investigating policeman ever darkened the door of our house in the Brandywell area of Derry to find out about Paddy Doherty deceased In the s I served an IRA related prison sentence for a much lesser offence 
MAR16	After Christchurch, Muslims need more than just your thoughts and prayers	There is a certain profundity about waking up one morning when your only plans for the day are to go to Friday prayers with your family to discover that on the other side of the world people just like you doing exactly the same thing with their Friday as you intend to do with yours have been slaughtered  My first response upon reading of the massacre in Christchurch was I admit stunned blankness I could read the words and I understood them but for a few moments there was no obvious emotional reaction Not because I didn t care about what had happened but because the enormity of it meant it was simply too difficult to immediately process 
MAR16	Brexit – the niche production that truly brought the house down	We focus so much on what divides parliament s warring Brexit factions when almost all of them are united by the guiding principle of brinkmanship Eventually someone will stop acting like a shit but it certainly won t be me The past few days have been like watching the Cuban missile crisis re enacted by the Teletubbies  A recap then Hopes that Tinky Winky would grow into the role of Bobby Kennedy were dashed this week in a series of votes in the House of Commons We are days out from the date the UK will leave the European Union without a deal unless something else is agreed upon With the threat of that something being a long extension if granted by the EU Theresa May is hoping MPs will look again at her withdrawal agreement next week in Meaningful Vote Sure they saw it lurching around the bar earlier and thought there was no way in a million years they were going home with it But this close to tipping out time are they drunk enough to panic buy If the answer turns out to be yes the prime minister s various earlier losses this week will be hailed momentarily as tactically astute Think of it as a sort of Crap Negotiations World Cup Theresa May doesn t want to finish top of the group or her Brexit will face the Treaty of Versailles in the semis 
MAR16	The climate strikers should inspire us all to act at the next UN summit	Tens of thousands of young people took to the streets on Friday with a clear message to world leaders act now to save our planet and our future from the climate emergency  These schoolchildren have grasped something that seems to elude many of their elders we are in a race for our lives and we are losing The window of opportunity is closing we no longer have the luxury of time and climate delay is almost as dangerous as climate denial 
MAR16	Four ways you can support the YouthStrike4Climate movement	Since we made headlines in February with the UK s first school strike we ve seen an outpouring of support from our peers parents carers politicians and other people from all walks of life It seems that most people know we re in a mess but they just didn t know what we can to do to get out of it  This is where the UK Student Climate Network UKSCN stepped in not necessarily out of choice but necessity There s no time left for the adults in the room to solve the climate crisis The politicians and powerful actors have failed us Youth is rising up all around the world and here in the UK we re emerging as one of the most powerful forces demanding urgent and radical change 
MAR17	A long delay is now the only way out of this Brexit quagmire	 We are getting close to resolving this now So Philip Hammond told the BBC s Andrew Marr today delivering this fabulously silly Brexit forecast without a flicker of visible irony Who says the chancellor doesn t have a sense of humour As it happens he went on to break character pretty quickly by admitting that there may not even be a third meaningful vote on Theresa May s deal this week  If the government s managers do not think they have a chance of winning or at least of significantly reducing the margin of defeat they will not subject the prime minister to yet another humiliation on Tuesday The case for trying is the remarkable speed with which a number of previously hardline Brexiteers are discovering the merits of pragmatism and reconciliation It is amazing how quickly non negotiable objections can melt away as the clock ticks reality bites and careerism trumps principle 
MAR17	Only our compromise can break the Brexit impasse	When we go back to our constituencies it s sometimes hard to explain to people what happens in Westminster because in all honesty it doesn t always make sense  Try telling someone how Steven Barclay the Brexit secretary could speak in favour of a motion on Thursday night only to vote against it a few minutes later Or how MPs like us can vote to stop a no deal Brexit last week only to be told at the end of it that such a prospect was more likely than ever Or how a prime minister can suffer two of the biggest defeats in the history of parliament on the most important issue facing the country but then with a completely straight face say that she plans to bring it back a third or maybe even fourth time 
MAR17	Whatever Nancy Pelosi says, youthful zest is moving US politics to the left	A generational battle is taking place in US politics that could have profound consequences not just for the global left but also for the future of the planet Ever since the freshman class of Democrats entered Congress in January many of them young women of colour and supported by a young activist base they have met resistance from more established members of the party When the newly elected representative Rashida Tlaib from Detroit called Donald Trump a motherfucker hours after being sworn in she was the subject of finger wagging from politicians and pundits I don t really like that kind of language house judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler said CNN s Chris Cillizza wrote that Tlaib s choice of words was a gift to the president  When year old Alexandria Ocasio Cortez surprised everyone by seeing off an established Democratic rival and going on to win a seat in Congress her triumph after a shock primary victory in New York over the longstanding incumbent Joe Crowley who was the third most powerful House Democrat was played down by the House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi who chose to emphasise that voters had merely made a choice in one district Since then Ocasio Cortez who has become an internationally recognised figure has faced a backlash from an array of party insiders some of whom seem to resent her public profile and Twitter star status for her refusal to play by the normal rules of Washington politics 
MAR17	Technology is terrorism’s most effective ally. It delivers a global audience	Terrorism is effective because it always seems near It always seems new And it always seems personal Ever since the first wave of terrorist violence broke across the newly industrialised cities of the west in the late th century this has been true  It feels personal because although statistics may show we are many times more likely to die in a banal domestic accident we instinctively conclude from an attack on the other side of the street the city or in the case of New Zealand the other side of the world we might be next 
MAR17	My kids are genuises. Honestly. Who do I pay the bribe to?	I lie to my kids all the time without thinking in large ways and in small Yes I tell them I will organise a play date with Sammy I won t No your sister didn t mean that she did Yes everyone dies but children don t die before mummies and mummies only die when they re really really old so there s no point in worrying about it now And yes of course a million times yes that picture of a beetle is the best beetle drawn since a cave child first drew a beetle  That last lie is only a half lie to the extent that even when I am checking myself for overweening parental pride it is hard for me to judge my children s output realistically My daughter s ability to hold on to the term solar system and observe that the mouth and nose are connected is evidence of Einstein like acuity That wobbly name written with the front four letters taking up half of the page and the back four crammed into a tiny space that also careens downwards is penmanship unparalleled 
MAR17	Islamophobia is not confined to online groups. It leaks across public life	On Friday morning as the news from Christchurch was still rolling across radio bulletins Sir Mark Rowley the former head of counter terrorism at the Met was commenting on the horror on BBC Radio s Today programme Fifty Muslims had been brutally murdered and seriously injured For horrifying minutes a white supremacist terrorist unloaded round after round of bullets into men women and children  Islamophobia was undoubtedly real and on the rise and being propagated online said Rowley But he went on to quibble Islamophobia wasn t racism To conflate the two was he claimed clumsy thinking 
MAR17	Iran’s threats to BBC Persian staff must be confronted	Tyrannical regimes seek to control what their populations read see and hear lest the people obtain information that might encourage them to question the power that subjugates them Some go to extraordinary lengths reaching far outside their borders to prevent that happening  One obvious example was the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia s consulate in Turkey last October A single bloody act it made headlines around the world As it should have 
MAR17	Well done, Brexit ultras – the EU has never had more power over Britain	The rich history of these islands includes a Blessed Parliament a Good Parliament and a Loyal Parliament Also a Merciless Parliament a Rump Parliament and a Barebone s Parliament The current one could go down as the Addled Parliament or the Useless Parliament if those nicknames had not already been awarded in earlier times So let us call this the Broken Parliament  It has been bust by Brexit During the referendum three long and painful years ago it was the Leavers boast that they would restore parliamentary sovereignty to all the powers and glories they claimed had been lost to Brussels What they have instead done is to turn Britain s legislature into a theatre of anarchy that daily demonstrates that it cannot agree on anything A country once widely admired for the functioning of its democracy and the robustness of its institutions has been turned into a global joke 
MAR17	We scoffed at Grayling’s ‘ferries’ but his way is now a public service norm	Oh how we laughed Failing Grayling the transport secretary Chris Grayling the Mr Bean of contemporary politics had awarded a cross Channel ferry contract to Seaborne a company that had no ferries and had never run a ferry service Six weeks later the contract was torn up  The trouble is the laugh s on us too For it s not just Grayling who s failing The Seaborne style of awarding contracts never mind the competence just get the signature has long been the public sector norm for outsourced work The result has been scandalous services and collapsing companies 
MAR17	Where now for Mark Zuckerberg after his – and our – loss of innocence?	The Cambridge Analytica revelations the most damning of which were published by the Observer and the New York Times a year ago quickly morphed from a scandal about a British political consultancy into one about Facebook the social media behemoth  It was not the first or last of Facebook s many crises but has been the most consequential for the company and for the future of data privacy The expos which revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal information of around million Facebook users and used it for political purposes triggered congressional and parliamentary hearings multiple regulatory investigations and a fundamental rethink of Facebook s future 
MAR18	John Bercow’s ruling has breathed new life into the people’s vote	Brexit fatigue and Brexit bullying are Theresa May s instruments of torture to grind recalcitrant MPs into passing her destructive deal No more says the Speaker this war of attrition must stop Her deal must change and if she brings one back it must be fundamentally different How different He can t say until he sees what plan if any she will present  Rightly John Bercow complains of time wasted of running down the clock as she tries to crush MPs against the concrete wall she herself constructed No was not forewarned of the Speaker s ruling Oddly the Brexiteers were sounding pleased presuming her deal as it stands can t pass They hope that no deal beckons still the legal certainty unless parliament passes something else But the champion of the house will guarantee that MPs get the chance to stop no deal dead 
MAR18	The Speaker has seized his Brexit moment – and now all bets are off	It has been clear for some time now that John Bercow sees himself as a leading protagonist in our political drama not some bystander Even before Theresa May s deal was bogged down in parliamentary trench warfare the Commons Speaker had styled himself as a warrior on behalf of the legislature defending it against arrogant incursions by government But kicking May s withdrawal agreement out of the chamber altogether yesterday was a ferocious escalation  The premise is procedural and venerable Erskine May the vast tome in which are accumulated the various rules and conventions governing parliamentary business decrees that the same motion cannot be debated twice in one parliamentary session And since May s Brexit deal was rejected last week Bercow believes that the prime minister cannot simply come back as had been planned and ask MPs to reconsider What was billed as a third meaningful vote would need some substantial revision of content to qualify as truly meaningful in the Speaker s eyes 
MAR18	Farage's Brexit march: the theatre of the absurd meets storm-hit Minion	How was your weekend I am hoping that you had a good one But if you didn t console yourself that it cannot have been as grim as the leave voters who were walking from Sunderland in the driving rain the churning wind and the sea spitting in their cliffside faces To wit  That is the official photograph sent to me in a press release That is the best representation the campaign could muster 
MAR18	Why was I asked to condemn Islamist violence days after Christchurch?	Less than two days after the horror of the massacre of Muslims in two mosques in New Zealand I was asked in an interview on the BBC news channel whether or not I think Muslim communities in the UK do enough to condemn Islamist extremism   There s a straightforward problem here isn t there one of the reasons that some of this language has become common is bluntly because of the Islamist violence and the Islamist extremism that has happened one of the criticisms we hear in this country has been that there isn t enough criticism of those people by the mainstream Islamic community what do you say to that 
MAR18	For Northern Irish farmers, no-deal Brexit would be a calamity	As president of the Ulster Farmers Union UFU my last three years have been dominated by Brexit and what it means for farming families More than months on from the referendum all we have are unanswered questions and uncertainty  The threat of a no deal is still there Parliament s vote to reject a no deal Brexit and to seek an extension to article are positive steps but the legislation is clear If the UK does not agree an exit deal with the EU we leave with no deal This is a terrifying prospect for Northern Ireland farming families and their businesses 
MAR18	Ending climate change requires the end of capitalism. Have we got the stomach for it?	Climate change activism is increasingly the domain of the young such as year old Greta Thunberg the unlikely face of the school strike for climate movement which has seen many thousands of children walk out of school to demand that their parents generation takes responsibility for leaving them a planet to live on In comparison the existing political establishment looks more and more like an impediment to change The consequences of global warming have moved from the merely theoretical and predicted to observable reality over the past few years but this has not been matched by an uptick in urgency The need to keep the wheels of capitalism well oiled takes precedence even against a backdrop of fires floods and hurricanes  Today s children as they become more politically aware will be much more radical than their parents simply because there will be no other choice for them This emergent radicalism is already taking people by surprise The Green New Deal GND a term presently most associated with year old US representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has provoked a wildly unhinged backlash from the pro free market wing who argue that it s a Trojan horse nothing more than an attempt to piggyback Marxism onto the back of climate legislation 
MAR18	For all our sakes: Theresa May’s Brexit deal must be voted down	Theresa May must fail Her first two attempts to get her Brexit deal through the Commons deserved support They forestalled crashing out of the EU with no deal next month and they took the referendum process forward  She failed twice to persuade the Commons of this As a result last week her least worst Brexit strategy lost legitimacy When the Commons voted to debate other options she voted it down She insisted she put her deal to a third vote 
MAR18	Until Christchurch I thought it was worth debating with Islamophobes. Not any more	If you have been paying attention you will know that there is now a genre of response protocol that is followed after attacks on Muslims It blows dog whistles even as carnage is unfolding A ghoulish routine has become established It usually goes like this Condemn the attack in the strongest terms and then water down that condemnation We mustn t get carried away you see and forget about the context Attacks against Muslims must not stop us from continuing to criticise Islam and Muslims when it is warranted The unvoiced subtext is that maybe these particular Muslim victims didn t have it coming but such atrocities don t come out of nowhere But you know thoughts and prayers at this difficult time  Following the Christchurch massacre there is an article I could write today to explain the danger of this forked tongue response An article that exposes the fallacy of thinking that extremist hate crimes can be separated and quarantined from the fact that western societies have become radicalised against Muslims An article that tries again to show the link between mainstream fashionable Muslim bashing and its violent manifestations on the right An article that fillets the semantic tricks played to stop Muslims ever being complete victims the line that Islam is not a race the use of women s and LBGT rights as a rhetorical stick to beat Muslims with the cant about freedom of speech political correctness and the danger of identity politics the whataboutery and the strawmanning 
MAR18	Jacinda Ardern is showing the world what real leadership is: sympathy, love and integrity	Out of the horror inflicted by those who cannot accept the world as it is comes a vision of a better world It comes from above and it comes from below It comes from ordinary people Supermarkets in Wellington suburbs have sold out of flowers tough old football coaches are talking about love and most powerful of all there are the stories of the Christchurch shooting survivors themselves Those who risked and lost their lives to save their fellow worshippers or astonishingly found it in their hearts to forgive the gunman  Then there is this year old woman the prime minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern We have watched as she shows the world what real leadership is Jacinda mania had died down since when she became the country s youngest prime minister She gave birth in office taking her baby to the United Nations general assembly meeting She became something of a celebrity appearing on US chatshows But was there any substance to her That question is asked of all women leaders What is underneath Where is the steel 
MAR18	The taboos around disability and sex put limits on everyone, disabled or not	There remains a heavy taboo around sex and disability in our culture Research by the charity Scope found that only of non disabled people have dated a disabled person while disabled young people are let down when it comes to sex education often receiving none at all or nothing appropriate to their needs  The writer and activist Penny Pepper who writes extensively about disability and sex including in her erotica collection Desires Reborn told me If disabled people aren t having sex they would like to And the reasons they re not are overwhelmingly to do with the barriers in society I ve known quite a few disabled people who because of this have resigned themselves to never having sex 
MAR19	Next, the Speaker should force MPs to vote this weekend	Ever since David Cameron took it on himself to prise open Pandora s box and call the EU referendum the only thing that s been predictable has been the utter unpredictability of what has followed The prospect of Theresa May now taking on Erskine May whose work lays down the procedural rules of the House of Commons is but the latest twist in this epic Whitehall farce His book was first published in and there is a simple reason that it s still the principal point of reference when it comes to our constitution it has passed the toughest test of all time  I had hoped it would be the start of a collegiate approach but the whole process has been executed back to front
MAR19	We’re edging away from Brexit – but both sides are set to lose	If shambolic government turned leavers into remainers Britain would have decided long ago not to bother with Brexit But that isn t how it works The sight of Theresa May failing to organise a departure from the EU proves that she is unequal to the task not necessarily that the task should be abandoned For many Eurosceptics it has the opposite effect They see the fact that Brexit has broken a stolid prime minister as confirmation that gung ho leadership is the missing ingredient  The same applies with deadlock and procedural mayhem in parliament Pro Europeans cheer when a majority of MPs vote that the country should not be yanked out of the EU without a deal They salute the Speaker of the House John Bercow when he uses ancient protocol as a bat thwacking May s twice rejected withdrawal agreement out of the Commons chamber without another vote In the eyes of a remainer this is the legislature defying of bad government democracy in action The leaver sees rogue lawmakers obstructing the popular will democracy betrayed Few minds are being changed 
MAR19	Rod Liddle vilifies disabled people. I’m tired of the hate. We all should be	You would be forgiven if weighed down by the row over the Islamophobia embedded in the British press you had missed Rod Liddle s piece in the Sunday Times about disabled people specifically those with myalgic encephalomyelitis or ME  The headline Always fatigued yet they never tire of claiming their malady really is a virus gives a fair hint at the level of bile the piece contains but to summarise Liddle uses the resignation of a researcher into ME Michael Sharpe to peddle the well worn trope that the condition is all in the mind or as he puts it that their complaints about a virus have no basis in fact It has understandably distressed many people with ME with the piece going viral on social media 
MAR19	Wake up, Italians – our country is in a state of democratic emergency	This month marks a year since the last general election in Italy Three months afterwards Matteo Salvini s League and Luigi di Maio s Five Star Movement M S took power It s time to take stock even though to tell the truth we can t stop stock taking such is the desperate situation the country finds itself in First and foremost we are in a democratic emergency Some feel there s no need for alarm after all nobody seized power by force and the government enjoys a high level of popular support an approval rating of approximately according to polls But clearly just because a government enjoys support we should not stop being clear eyed about what it is doing A liberal democracy does not become authoritarian within a few months but there are signs however slight and seemingly unconnected that seem to chart this depressing journey  A few weeks ago the Italian media greeted with alarm a report the secret services had submitted to parliament The picture it painted was hugely serious especially in two areas the growth of racist incidents as we approach the European elections in May and the inability given the propaganda and focus on closing ports to migrants from Libya to curb secret landings using small fast boats which could be bringing passengers linked to terrorist groups 
MAR19	Ardern is right not to name the Christchurch suspect. What about everyone else?	DON T say his name  Don t share the livestreamed video of the killings don t read that rambling adolescent nonsense of a manifesto don t fill newspaper front pages with stories about his childhood Ever since news broke of the terror attack on two Christchurch mosques there have been calls to deny the suspect attention in favour of focusing on victims and survivors and now New Zealand s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has put her moral authority behind them 
MAR19	The death of my mate Mike Thalassitis shows that reality TV is costing lives	Those of us who are grieving the loss of our mate Mike Thalassitis who died on Saturday remain shocked at his death However even now you won t need to look very far on social media to identify attacks and trolling that are the norm for people who have been on reality TV shows One thing s for sure when the producers of Love Island sold us the dream they never warned us about the reality we could face   They know what they re getting into people say If only that were true how differently things might have turned out I m trying to get to grips with what s just happened A year old guy My friend He couldn t go on This isn t a show This is the real thing 
MAR19	Social media addiction is not natural or normal – but is it really a disease?	Is social media addictive The issue is complex and probably generational  It s obvious that what social media does to us especially those of us who are heavy users is not natural or normal It s not normal to submit opinions for approval every day to an online crowd nor is it normal to consume the opinions of strangers in bulk It s not normal to live under the surveillance of software companies which tailor their advertising with such eerie precision that it seems impossible that they are not listening in on our conversations It s definitely not normal to wake in the night to use social media or to spend roughly hours a week on it returning again and again even though it can make us feel depressed and alone None of these behaviours were normal a few decades ago nor are they especially useful to us today but they re practised by billions of people across the world 
MAR19	Universal basic income only goes so far – free public services are essential too	Almost years ago to the day during the fiery aftermath of an early Margaret Thatcher budget the prime minister was allegedly challenged to name just two economists who endorsed her agenda of cutting public spending in the midst of recession a prescription that was otherwise sending waves through orthodox academic thinking Alan Walters and Professor Patrick Minford she is said to have replied before later remarking thank goodness they didn t ask for three  The importance of those s budgets feels a far cry from the subdued status of last week s spring statement But make no mistake just as it was in the early s significant and structural economic reform is once again discernible on the UK s political breeze albeit currently blowing harder outside government than within 
MAR19	US Republicans must follow Ardern’s lead and stand up to the gun lobby	Hours after worshippers were killed at two mosques in Christchurch New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was already promising to tighten up the country s gun laws It s a stark contrast to Donald Trump s reaction to mass shootings a written by numbers offer of thoughts and prayers then a twiddle of his thumbs until the next atrocity New Zealand s response seems to have more in common with Scotland where the massacre at Dunblane primary school in led to a ban on all handguns  There are some pronounced differences between the two countries New Zealand s gun laws are lax the UK s gun laws had already been tightened and semi automatic centrefire rifles banned in the wake of the Hungerford massacre in But what Scotland and New Zealand share is little previous experience of spree shootings a visceral shock at the scale of their country s loss and a determination to prevent it happening again 
MAR19	Smear testing on a shoestring budget: so much for Theresa May’s empathy	Yes it feels almost impossible but Theresa May was actually praised for her behaviour and leadership in the House of Commons a few months ago In January prompted by Conservative MP Rachel Maclean during prime minister s questions May encouraged women to attend cervical smear screening stating that Public Health England was to launch a campaign to boost uptake I know what it s like it is not comfortable sometimes it will be embarrassing sometimes it s painful but those few minutes can save lives  The incoming samples have increased fivefold yet the number of labs testing the results is shrinking from to nine
MAR20	Britain is in a hole – Europe, we need you to dig us out	When European leaders discuss Brexit on Thursday they should have in mind a fundamental question is the EU just a union of governments or is it also a Europe of citizens peoples democracy and destiny If it s just the former they should continue the current mainstream Brussels line of trying to help Theresa May to get her deal over the line and the UK out of the European Union as soon as possible If Europe is also the latter as French president Emmanuel Macron has eloquently argued then they must recognise that May s government is the problem not the solution and give time for the citizens peoples and democracy of Britain to work their way to a better place  More than million British citizens voted for Britain to remain in the EU in Were European citizenship personal and direct rather than contingent upon being a citizen of a member state the EU would have a clear responsibility towards us the British Europeans If we were a country we would be the ninth largest in the EU after the Netherlands and before Belgium We are joined by some million citizens of other EU countries who live in Britain That makes million 
MAR20	UK politicians ignore mass public protests at their peril	It is still just about possible with a sustained deployment of the imagination to conceive of a set of circumstances in which Theresa May might still be able to regard her Brexit policy as a success If for instance she agrees in Brussels on Thursday on the conditional short extension offered by Donald Tusk on Wednesday if she gets her third meaningful vote motion past the Speaker next week if her MPs take Tusk s offer seriously if she proves better at persuading enough of them to back her deal than in the past then just possibly it may all seem to have been worthwhile Or at least it may do so for about hours until the leadership challenge begins and the policy conflicts of the next and longer phase of Brexit negotiations with the EU start to split her party yet again  That imagined moment though has now become such a vanishingly small possibility that the final verdict on May s Brexit policy must now be of its conclusive and overwhelming failure Her Brexit policy was always to get Britain out by March with a deal that postponed all the major policy implications on the basis of Tory support buttressed only by the Democratic Unionist party and Labour s handful of anti Europeans It was always going to be a close run thing But it is not going to happen now 
MAR20	May’s latest screeching U-turn makes her utterly unfit to lead	No matter how bad you think Theresa May is she always manages to get worse Her record of insisting on one thing only to U turn weeks days or even hours later is almost impressive in its scope There would be no snap election she vowed and then there was one Her Brexit deal would be subject to a meaningful vote in December and then the vote was pulled punted into the new year Brexit would happen on March and now it won t  This latest example is the Russian doll of reversals with several other reversals contained within it For just last week May s de facto deputy David Lidington was adamant that any delay to Brexit would have to be lengthy since a short one off extension would be both pointless leaving too little time to do anything and downright reckless as well as being completely at odds with the position MPs had taken the previous evening May had told the Commons that if MPs voted down her agreement with the EU which they did she would be seeking a long extension She delivered the same message to the cabinet only yesterday 
MAR20	Lives are ruined by shame and stigma. LGBT lessons in schools are vital	One of the most dangerous and destructive things in the world is shame Shame can burrow into you so deep that it shrinks the brain and constricts the heart  Right now a row although it is not a row which makes it sound harmless is continuing between the teachers and parents of certain primary schools in parts of Birmingham and Manchester The issue is that sex and relationship education is now part of the curriculum with primary school children taught about healthy adult relationships and sex education compulsory in secondary schools including LGBT relationships Some parents mainly from Muslim backgrounds have objected to this WhatsApp groups have been set up Loudspeakers have been bought 
MAR20	Why MPs will ultimately have to back Theresa May’s deal	Britain faces a constitutional crisis according to many including at least one cabinet minister But is it a crisis simply because the rules regulating parliament make life difficult for the government  A conflict between government and parliament is almost inevitable when as with Brexit the government cannot command a majority of votes in the Commons But there is a deeper crisis within parliament itself MPs have put the European Union Withdrawal Act on the statute book which entails us leaving the EU on March in just eight days time 
MAR20	HS2 gives the game away: the plan for northern towns is managed decline	Yesterday on the day a report from the New Economics Foundation comprehensively exposed the HS project as a London boosting white elephant I found myself writing this sitting in a station Wetherspoons because my train from Liverpool to Huddersfield had been cancelled Last Saturday I missed a talk for which I had tickets because my train to Manchester again from Liverpool was cancelled On Monday I was an hour late dropping my daughter at her grandma s because our train a Northern Pacer due for the knacker s yard broke down at the terminus  NEF s report which can be read as much as an utter indictment of a directionless actively neglectful government as a cool headed analysis of a single bad idea exposes the fact that high speed rail is unnecessary for everyone except London based frequent travellers who dislike leaving the capital unless they can be there and back in half a day The report demands a better service for northern commuters the electrification of rail lines stuck in the mid th century and the reopening of old branch lines to places lost to the car 
MAR20	May’s way, the highway or … a Brexit delay? The view from Europe	One thousand days since the referendum and nine to the UK s formal departure date and the EU does not yet know how when or even if the UK will leave the union The mood in Brussels and national capitals remains focused but there is growing impatience with Theresa May and her government Even those member states that are traditionally friendly towards the UK have toughened their stance The overwhelming view is that the ball remains firmly in London s court and that it has to find a way through the turmoil  Today the union will be asked for an extension of article by London Seen against the backdrop of political and constitutional chaos in the UK the request poses enormous dilemmas for Brussels There is widespread concern that the Brexit virus will spread to infect the normal day to day business of the union something that has been avoided up to now 
MAR20	The Paris of the rich is ablaze – and that image will define Macron	It s become a kind of ritual every Saturday evening there are new images of thousands of gilets jaunes yellow vests in the streets of Paris and other French cities Every week protesters are injured by the police Every week commentators claim the movement is fading And yet the following weekend the yellow wave washes over France again The attendance numbers may fluctuate but the anger remains  The March protest was the most violent in weeks Around protesters marched in Paris Shops on the Champs Elys es were looted their windows broken ATMs were smashed Several newspaper kiosks were set ablaze destroying the livelihood of their owners an act as shocking as it is cruel and stupid especially for a movement that stands for better living and working conditions 
MAR20	Come on, UK weather forecasters – tell it like it is on climate change	They have a national reach that most climate campaigners would die for They are familiar and respected experts on the science of meteorology And they have prime time slots at the end of almost every TV news bulletin morning noon and night But the weather forecasters who guide everything from our clothing choices to our weekend plans seldom if ever mention the issue that is increasingly shaping our beloved British weather climate change  This week former BBC weatherman Bill Giles broke cover and called for the BBC and other major broadcasters to overhaul their approach to forecasts and add in information about the crucial context of climate change to their predictions about the daily weather 
MAR20	Online hate threatens us all. Platforms can and must do more to eradicate it	Like so many I was shocked to the core by the recent killing of Muslim worshippers in New Zealand As I absorbed the news my thoughts for reasons I will shortly explain turned to the technology that is so closely linked to the atrocity And let me say this clearly major platforms such as YouTube and Facebook are a primary and active component in the radicalisation of mostly young men  These organisations counter that they aim to take down content that violates their rules swiftly and are increasing resources for efforts to identify and remove dangerous material before it causes harm But clearly this isn t enough And by not doing enough to police their platforms they risk being complicit in innocent lives being violently cut short It is within their power to remove extremist content and users from their platforms and they re failing to do so in any meaningful way Crucially this is not caused by insurmountable technical problems 
MAR21	Brexit is not the cause of Britain’s political breakdown. It’s a symptom	The French EU minister Nathalie Loiseau has called her new cat Brexit He wakes me up every morning meowing to death because he wants to go out she says And then when I open the door he stays put undecided and then glares at me when I put him out The Dutch prime minister has compared Theresa May to the knight in Monty Python who has all his limbs lopped off and insists It s just a flesh wound and calls it a draw She s incredible says Mark Rutte She goes on and on At the same time I do not blame her but British politics Italian friends tell me Brexit now comes on at the end of the news in that wacky slot just before the sport and weather  Everybody is laughing at us Why wouldn t they We look ridiculous If we weren t so busy feeling betrayed bored enraged or bewildered we d be laughing at ourselves Brexit according to many of its advocates would give us the chance to stand tall and independent again to fulfil the potential as May put it two years ago to become a great global trading nation that is respected around the world and strong confident and united at home Instead we look like a cross between a beggar and basket case Yesterday May pleaded for more time and the EU said only if you can get parliament to agree to your deal May displaying all the skills of brinkmanship and diplomacy that has got us to this point then went and insulted parliamentarians making them more hostile and fearful for themselves than ever 
MAR21	Apocalypse it is, then. Not now, but probably next week	Forced to summarise Theresa May s Downing Street address to the nation last night I d go with Prime Minister Kurtz she mad They told me you had gone totally insane Martin Sheen says to Marlon Brando s rogue colonel in Apocalypse Now that your methods were unsound Are my methods unsound pants Colonel Kurtz A pause I don t see any method at all sir  Or as one minister put it of May No fucking plan nothing One day there will be a public inquiry another member of the government observed and she will be judged to have been unfit for office Meanwhile in the most ambitious crossover event since Avengers Infinity War the CBI and the TUC have put out a joint plea to Theresa May to return to at least the same postcode as her senses 
MAR21	Cyclone Idai shows the deadly reality of climate change in Africa	As Africa climate week unfurls in Ghana the countries of Mozambique Malawi and Zimbabwe count the costs of Cyclone Idai which ripped through villages and towns taking hundreds of lives and leaving a trail of destruction  For a continent already racked by the effects of the climate crisis Idai is another chilling reminder of the destructive power of the kind of storms that will become more common as the world warms up 
MAR21	Being a gay Christian can be hurtful and gruelling. But I refuse to lose faith	I was at a comedy show in Soho recently when my slightly too loud cackle attracted attention from the comedian One thing led to another and I ended up being teased affably about my love life as the audience laughed on  Once my excitement about having spoken to one of my favourite comedians Mae Martin if you re curious had died down I realised something pretty significant had happened I had said I have a girlfriend in front of a room full of people without even thinking about it 
MAR21	Labour’s been mocked for calling for an election. Now it’s the only way out	We are being trolled by a prime minister who is prepared to drive a nation into the abyss to preserve the cohesion of the Conservative party Like a partner who perennially hints at a romantic three course meal and a possible popping of the question only to give you beans on toast Theresa May served up another anticlimax with her national address She provided no exit routes out of a building she has set alight merely attacking a parliament she forced the electorate to vote for less than two years previously  It is the most basic statement of political reality to say that Britain s national crisis has been manufactured by the Conservatives but it s one that needs repeating in a media environment rigged in favour of the right A generation long Tory power struggle and the disastrous attempts to navigate it by David Cameron and his successor have brought Britain to its knees The narrative over the coming days will be that the onus is on Labour to accept May s deal a deal both remainers and leavers are united in judging to be terrible or condemn Britain to no deal 
MAR21	Islamophobic attacks in the UK leave Muslims feeling increasingly anxious	Friday marks one week since the terrorist atrocity in New Zealand in which a year old Australian man published an online white supremacist manifesto and then went into two mosques in Christchurch with multiple firearms opening fire and killing Muslims as they prayed Nobody was spared from his Islamophobic massacre not even children One of the youngest casualties was three year old Mucad Ibrahim who was at the mosque with his family  One week on the implications of those terrorist crimes in New Zealand are having a profound and deep impact on Muslim communities across the world including here in the UK Many of us are traumatised Many of us feel horrified We are devastated We are broken and we are terrified 
MAR21	Too many rape and abuse victims are being let down by the police	The domestic abuse bill currently going through parliament is set to add new powers to deal with perpetrators of domestic abuse but there are already a wide range of powers available to police that are simply not being used  In fact the level of protection has declined dramatically over the past two years since changes to the pre charge bail regime in April These introduced onerous requirements on the police when bail is granted and it seems that officers are avoiding these by releasing suspects without bail and using voluntary interviews instead of arrest 
MAR21	We’re working like it’s 1975, but the UK jobs boom isn’t all it seems. Here’s why	Britain s recent jobs record has been remarkable The economy is chugging along but the last time the unemployment rate was as low as it is today was in the winter of Harold Wilson was prime minister Derby County were on course to win the old first division David Bowie was about to release Young Americans  Back then things were about to take a turn for the worse Prices were rising fast and later in inflation would hit a postwar peak of more than Unemployment also rose leading to the coining of a new term stagflation In there was the mother and father of a sterling crisis that ended with spending cuts being imposed by the International Monetary Fund 
MAR21	The depressing truth about female creativity and the pram in the hallway	There are times in every parent s life when however much they try to avoid it the professional and the domestic messily collide It happened to me a few years ago when during a teachers training day I took my seven year old with me to interview Joan Collins over lunch Collins was delighted at her presence and ordered her a giant bowl of ice cream However halfway through the conversation she suddenly looked startled fumbled under the table for a bit and then pulled out a sticky pink spattered Chanel shoe I do believe dear Lily has dropped ice cream in my shoe she announced looking a little pained  For the singer Sophie Ellis Bextor this clash of the personal and professional has become a regular ritual as she fields questions about the practicalities of child rearing and how she makes it work It was with palpable exasperation that she tweeted this week I love making music I love promoting a new record I do not love talking over and over about how I sort my childcare I am a singer I am a mum I will sort the childcare 
MAR21	Nine days from ‘Brexit day’, does anyone have a clue what’s happening?	Ask any country what are you doing in nine days time and it would go something like this  Sweden Same old same old 
MAR22	Think no-deal Brexit has been taken off the table? Think again	The cliff edge has moved a tiny bit further away but it s still there Britain will not crash out of the European Union next Friday thanks to a last act of clemency by the nations we re about to leave behind But crashing out remains a possibility even a likelihood It might not be a deliberate choice made by the people of these islands but rather an accident the product of a series of decisions that were taken and more often not taken Just as the imperial powers stumbled into a war no one wanted in so the risk remains that we will not jump off the cliff that looms ahead of us but stumble over it  Of course it s still possible that Theresa May will bring back her deal perhaps as soon as Monday that MPs will vote for it and the UK will leave in a stable and orderly fashion on May But it hardly seems likely There was a time in the middle of this week when you could imagine that happening MPs were clearly spooked by the imminence of a no deal crash out in a matter of days a prospect so terrifying that the leaders of the TUC and the CBI broke from all precedent to issue a joint warning of a national emergency predicting that if there was no deal the shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come Previously hostile MPs talked of swallowing their objections and voting for May s withdrawal agreement But two things happened to halt that shift just as it was beginning 
MAR22	For Theresa May, ‘I’m a tin-eared lunatic’ seems to be the hardest word	Arriving at the EU summit this week Theresa May had that purposeful air of a school superintendent walking up the drive to the Addams family mansion determined that Wednesday and Pugsley should be enrolled in a conventional educational establishment without delay Some long hours later May staggered back down the drive much as that school superintendent might short of having no shoes and an actual bat in her electrocuted hair  And so to the latest scenes in the Brexit farce The formula for successful farce writing as laid down in the th century is to get your character up a tree in the first act throw stones at them in the second then get them down in the third As far as Brexit goes the UK went up the tree voluntarily and has now been throwing human waste at itself for two and a half years Does anyone want to come and get us down Sorry it s quite disgusting up here now 
MAR22	How the media let malicious idiots take over	If our politics is becoming less rational crueller and more divisive this rule of public life is partly to blame the more disgracefully you behave the bigger the platform the media will give you If you are caught lying cheating boasting or behaving like an idiot you ll be flooded with invitations to appear on current affairs programmes If you play straight don t expect the phone to ring  In an age of hour news declining ratings and intense competition the commodity in greatest demand is noise Never mind the content never mind the facts all that now counts is impact A loudmouthed buffoon already the object of public outrage is a far more bankable asset than someone who knows what they re talking about So the biggest platforms are populated by blusterers and braggarts The media is the mirror in which we see ourselves With every glance our self image subtly changes 
MAR22	It’s time for my Conservative party to root out Islamophobia for good	For better or worse it s in our nature to avoid difficult conversations And no wonder a tough conversation poorly held can hurt more than it heals  But avoidance only takes you so far From my time as a youth worker I know that difficult conversations don t become easier the longer you put them off That s why I know it s time for Conservatives to have a proper conversation about Islamophobia There is simply too much hate floating around online these days and too much of it is appearing intentionally or not under our banner We must root it out now 
MAR22	Parents are exploiting their children on YouTube for fame and easy money	When my twins were babies I caught a short episode of them on video in which one leaned over and snatched the pacifier from the other one s mouth and for a second I dreamed of putting it on YouTube and scoring one of those baby does hilarious thing hits in which the ad revenue rolls in while you sleep and you are rewarded simply for being alive  I didn t upload the video in the end for the same reason I didn t do anything much in that period beyond running round my apartment in concentric circles picking things up and then putting them down again But the memory of that temptation the gold rush sense that there was easy money to be made if one could only capture a moment of spontaneous fun involving one s children remained and like most gold rushes its pull is a vortex 
MAR22	Mary Warnock embodied the best of Britain’s ruling class before Thatcher	In many ways Mary Warnock whose death was announced on Thursday represented the best of Britain s ruling class as it was between the war and the rise of Margaret Thatcher  The kind of tough minded realistic and self confident liberalism that she embodied was once a quality that foreigners admired in Britain It was elitist and not particularly democratic she and her husband rose to the very top of the Oxbridge system he as vice chancellor of Oxford University she as the head of colleges in both universities When I went to see her in her semi retirement in a village on the edge of Savernake Forest Wiltshire she was unashamed about collecting her attendance allowance from the House of Lords She needed the money she said and she earned it she did the work 
MAR22	It’s not too late to stop Brexit. Saturday’s march will force politicians to hear us	Last weekend Tim Shipman the political editor of the Sunday Times tweeted The urge to march for things and against things is one I have never understood Why not write a letter instead  He may have been referring to the start of the March to Leave Nigel Farage s much derided venture that saw a handful of bedraggled Brexit supporters trudging through the rainswept and muddy countryside But Shipman may also have been thinking about this Saturday s Put it to the People March which promises to be somewhat larger as hundreds of thousands take to the streets of London to demand the final say on any Brexit deal 
MAR22	As someone with cystic fibrosis I’m not sure I want to see Five Feet Apart – but you should	The film Five Feet Apart was released in the UK today but even as it reaches audiences it is dividing the cystic fibrosis community  The film is based on the fictional story of two teenagers with the illness Because of the huge dangers of cross infection between cystic fibrosis patients they are supposed to follow medical advice and stay six feet apart at all times However love gets in the way and they decide to take back control of their lives their relationship and just one foot 
MAR22	Teaching assistants are invaluable to learning – so why are we being axed?	Next month I could lose my job My years as a teaching assistant could be coming to an end due to government cuts in education  Across the London borough of Hackney where I work schools have had government cuts to per pupil funding since Headteachers have been left with the unenviable task of cutting back on subjects and staff to balance the books Often teaching assistants are the first to go Our role is to support pupils in the classroom through assisting teachers in the delivery of the national curriculum to all children For some of us this could involve working as a full classroom assistant while for many it is the one to one or small group interventions that are considered of greatest need 
MAR22	Are we not all Lorraine Kelly, playing versions of ourselves?	These are testing times in the theatre of the self A war is being fought over our identities The most powerful technology in the world is modelling and predicting our behaviours so that they might more effectively be monetised Some elemental human questions are suddenly in play again am I what I say I am or am I what others say I am Is there such a thing as free will Are friends electric But we contemplate them in arenas designed for profit we scream our frustration in emojis a language designed by committee  But cometh the hour cometh the daytime TV presenter Her name is Lorraine Kelly Her name is also Lorraine Kelly In Wednesday s tribunal judgment Lorraine Kelly set a worrying precedent for the future of celebrity taxation but quite an interesting precedent in the meta narrative of the human self She has reserved the right to what John Updike termed Maskenfreiheit mask freedom You see the Lorraine Kelly you see on ITV isn t Lorraine Kelly but Lorraine Kelly a fictional character who may resemble Lorraine Kelly in manner appearance and infectious Glaswegian chuckle but who isn t the real Lorraine Kelly Owing to a few peculiarities of tax law that distinction might just have saved her m 
MAR23	One thing now unites Britons – a sense of national humiliation	The hundreds of thousands marching were patriots Not patriots of the flag waving chest beating type but patriots determined to stop their fellow citizens suffering and a humiliated Britain being torn apart   Traitors saboteurs citizens of nowhere Remoaners The right has deployed the language of civil war for three years The insults carried with them the threat that dissenters would be treated as enemies within but also the promise and the hope that left to its own devices Brexit would restore Britain s greatness 
MAR23	How will British museums survive if they subject every donor to an ethical audit?	Consumers of culture will have been aware of the name Sackler above the frame of rooms and galleries in artistic institutions around the world I remember once briefly wondering when ducking under such an arch how they had made the money that permitted such extensive philanthropy  Now everyone knows The photographer Nan Goldin has advertised demonstrations outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York and threatened to withdraw a planned exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London in protest at the institutions receiving donations from the Sacklers 
MAR23	Ricky Gervais offers proof, if needed, that there is life after The Office	I kept walking in on my partner last week quietly crying over the laptop Not as might be reasonable to expect because she is stuck in an infinite current affairs loop never knowing when she might be freed from the horrors but because she has been watching Ricky Gervais s new sitcom After Life on Netflix You re not allowed to watch it with me she said pointedly closing the lid I m enjoying it and you ll ruin it Go somewhere else  Rude I thought and then said something about how the reviews hadn t been very good anyway which only proved her point The reviews I read have not been particularly kind it s true but already After Life seems to have reached Bohemian Rhapsody levels of division between what critics have made of it and what real life viewers think On a recent episode of Gogglebox the families who do not usually agree on what they re watching all collapsed into paroxysms of laughter at a gag about Gervais s character Tony being called a paedo 
MAR23	Let’s stop pretending exercise is fun. Like work, you’ve just got to do it	Here s a harsh truth about fitness that you don t often hear exercise sucks For some of us anyway I envy those people I see posting online about their completed half marathons with messianic zeal I feel so alive For people like myself there s no redemptive endorphin rush Exercising is just a repetitive bore to be dreaded and endured If a Slendertone thingy machine actually did the same job with electronic pads as I sprawled on the sofa watching Lindsay Lohan s Beach Club I d sell my children s kidneys to buy it Worst of all tedious though it is for most exercise is beyond beneficial it s vital health wellbeing weight the lot so we slackers just have to park our bad attitudes and crack on  There s a giant con at the heart of exercise that is a lot of effort goes into hard selling it as FUN when for many people it frankly isn t Right now there s a backlash against enterTRAINment see what they did there where people are enticed into boutique gyms to do classes that are new trendy fusion themed high intensity hula hooping or whatever One argument is that in this climate anything that gets people into gyms is great but others think that people would be better off with low key targeted workouts All very interesting but maybe it s fundamentally counterproductive to keep pushing this idea that exercise per se is supposed to be fun Why not just tell people the truth it s a relentless boring nightmare and you re going to have to do it anyway 
MAR23	Theresa May has failed to offer sound leadership in this toxic Brexit phase	How has it come to this Theresa May and her husband Philip have long been friends of mine and I have in the past admired her sense of duty and commitment to her party and her country So it grieves me that her stubborn choices have left both in peril  At a time when our politics needs statesmanship not brinkmanship when our divided people need time to heal and come back together and when our country needs honest leadership rooted in reality not ideology Mrs May has embraced division Rather than providing the calm compassionate and unifying leadership we so desperately needed after a divisive EU referendum campaign she rushed to own Brexit She has clung to power in the process but she is letting us all down 
MAR23	Why I am marching against Brexit today	The tide is turning and today is the day that we the people reclaim our democracy On the streets of London hundreds of thousands of us will be marching on parliament in support of parliament We reject the prime minister s assertion that she is the tribune of the people uniquely able to divine our interests divinely entitled to rule We reject her deal which leaves us poorer and more isolated We reject her government which has humiliated us on the international stage and enfeebled us at home Instead we say to MPs that now is the time to assert themselves to reject her threats and her jibes and to give back to the people the final say on Brexit  Remember why we are where we are When I resigned from the National Infrastructure Commission to campaign against Brexit and for a referendum just short of months ago it felt as though Brexit was a done deal Everywhere I went I met people who however they had voted in were dismayed by the reality of Brexit but convinced there was no alternative It was soft Brexit versus hard Brexit not no Brexit which is in truth the only alternative

MAR23	Tottenham Hotspur station? Some hate it, but branding the railways is nothing new	Names that were once freely chosen so freely that you hardly gave them a thought now come with sums of money attached Market principles operate In north London for example Tottenham Hotspur FC has reportedly gone to considerable trouble and expense to persuade Transport for London to rename the local railway station after the club The station White Hart Lane has been there since Spurs moved next door into a ground of the same name much later in A pub the White Hart had been there long before either  For all this time and more the names of public places such as stations and sports grounds arrived as the gifts of geography or history No longer In Tottenham a new stadium has recently been completed adjacent to the old one and tomorrow the first proper game of football will be played on its turf Crowd capacity has increased from to at a cost estimated between m and m according to how much non building work you include What the club needs and so far hasn t found is a business that will defray some of this expense by buying the naming rights At present the new ground goes by the name of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium but this is temporary The club needs to fit another word in there somehow Diageo Aviva Nike Sony Topshop that kind of thing

MAR24	May’s time is up. She must make way for a caretaker prime minister	There is an unforgettable moment in Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip that comes unexpectedly to mind in these strange and desperate times for our country In it the comedian recalls an encounter with his close friend the legendary NFL running back Jim Brown  Pryor is in a wretched mess confined to his room freebasing cocaine with a pipe that he imagines is whispering to him Brown is unimpressed He simply asks What you gonna do Again And again And again In March the UK is Pryor strung out in this case on Brexit and the rest of the world is Jim Brown Everyone can see that this is a country on the edge of nervous collapse 
MAR24	Can we all chill out about cannabis? Not quite yet	Occasionally during my love affair with marijuana I would experience perceptual disruptions profound enough to freak me out One time I was driving along a crowded road when my car seemed a little wobbly and then listed towards the centre an alarming thud thud emanating from the back end In the middle of a densely populated spot without a hard shoulder I crept slowly across a few lanes of traffic and pulled to a stop Concentrating very hard I got out of the car to assess and hopefully change the flat tyre I rarely got paranoid from smoking weed neither did it typically make me sleepy Instead I was among the lucky ones as the drug made everyday activities such as gardening waiting on tables and talking to my family bearable if not interesting So I was shocked and embarrassed to find after a few minutes of close inspection amid the honking horns that there was nothing wrong with the car  At the time I took hallucinations as evidence of a good score Now as an ex smoker and neuroscientist whose focus is addictive drugs I know that my resilient response to this stressful experience was contingent on having a neurotypical brain Neural pathways are forged by finely orchestrated signals for synapse growth and pruning disruptions can result in atypical neural connections that increase the risk of psychosis The liability may be unmasked by environmental conditions that can essentially be reduced to an ambiguous but well recognised bogeyman stress

MAR24	How to report terrorism: name, but don’t amplify	In one of several impressive acts of leadership New Zealand s parliament opened last Tuesday with the Speaker inviting an imam to lead prayers first in Arabic then English In Hansard the last of these verses of patience reads Oh Lord we ask you to protect New Zealand and the whole world from such calamities Amen  Would we be better protected if journalists followed the urging of New Zealand s prime minister Jacinda Ardern and did not name the perpetrators of acts of terrorism We can acknowledge her skilful and empathetic response to the shooting of scores of people at two Christchurch mosques on March We can recognise that Ardern s purpose as prime minister was rightly to turn the focus on those lost and mourned But is she correct in implying that acts of terror will be deterred if no one speaks the names of perpetrators Can should notoriety as distinct from glorification or anti hero status be denied 
MAR24	MPs must seize control of the Brexit calamity. Mrs May has already lost it	A symbolic casualty of Britain s rolling roiling Brexit debacle is the commemorative p coin bearing the date March which the government had planned to release It was one of their more idiotic ideas to put such an item in the nation s pockets and purses when the country is so divided and its destiny is swirled with such a dense fog of uncertainty The coin is now as redundant as the prime minister who signed off on it Britain won t be leaving the EU to the deadline that Theresa May has held so sacred that she swore she would not be deflected from it on more than occasions  Her inability to meet her own date is one illustration of the failure of her broken Brexit strategy Another is the heel stamping manner in which she responded to this latest episode in her thick volume of humiliations Shortly before she went to Brussels to seek a postponement to Britain s withdrawal from the EU the prime minister had a temper tantrum that was no prettier for being dressed up as a televised address to the nation The inflammatory speech from Number in which she sought to rouse voters against parliament by displacing the blame on to MPs was thought appalling by her own chief whip Other cabinet colleagues condemned it in much riper language 
MAR24	Christchurch attacks: the media's rush to be first causes its own kind of harm	Rookie journalists struggling with their copy are often told by news editors Just tell the story An esteemed colleague once told me his first editor told him to imagine shouting the intro to an aged relative moving away at speed on a bus  Boiling an event down to who what why where and when is the basis of all news coverage for a reason it tells the story But what happens when being fast and crafting a simple narrative becomes misleading or causes its own kind of harm 
MAR24	Public intellectuals have never been more vital. Let Mary Warnock be a guide	A couple of years ago the death of a public intellectual such as the philosopher Mary Warnock who died on Thursday would be marked by reflections on whether we have seen the death of the public intellectual as a phenomenon  In when an academic psychologist can do sell out lecture tours off the back of YouTube success there s less reason to believe that the public is repulsed by big ideas unfussily presented Unfortunately that psychologist is Jordan Peterson and his big ideas are a mush of homily and conservatism making it tempting to wish that public intellectuals really weren t a thing any more

MAR24	Does Britain really want an isolated future, buffeted by forces beyond our control?	Leave our shores and Brexit appears even more hopelessly strange and the people perpetrating it even more peculiar than they do when you are at home In Asia where I have spent the past week figures such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees Mogg are seen as curiosities with views that are openly risible Of course it s stupid to leave the world s biggest trading bloc and make your now lonely future dependent upon the kindness of unforgiving strangers Can t they see that  No country has ever done what Britain is attempting because it is so obviously crazed Trade agreements are a carefully balanced mutual opening of partners markets with a hard to work through calculus of gains and losses that takes years even decades to negotiate Brexiters promised that Britain would be different and that unravelling a year old web of deep relationships would be quick and effortless with Britain holding all the cards All palpably false 
MAR24	Silencing Islamophobes is as futile a response as banning the Qur’an	What drove Brenton Tarrant the Christchurch gunman to commit his heinous acts It s a question that has understandably occupied much media space A key debate has been over the role of anti Muslim hatred and its entrenchment in mainstream society  In an open letter Britain s counter terror chief Neil Basu called out the mainstream media for the messaging that fuels far right terrorists It s a theme echoed by many on the left 
MAR25	The Tories are no longer a party, and Theresa May must know that	Just another day in Brexit deadlock as the prime minister rose to address the parliament she had so brutishly insulted with her demagogic I am on your side attempt to speak to the people over MPs heads No apology but she came to admit that her deal was in the quicksands sinking fast and she dared not bring it back for another trouncing She is where she put herself disgracefully in hock to the bigots and bullies of the Democratic Unionist party who act against the will of remain majority Northern Irish voters Jeremy Corbyn was polite to call this a national embarrassment this is far far worse than a few blushes  For parliament to seize control would May wrongly claimed set a dangerous precedent
MAR25	With millions on the streets or signed up, remainers cannot be ignored	The anti Brexit rally on Saturday was probably the first central London demonstration in living memory that Jeremy Corbyn hasn t attended except for the last People s Vote march of course Instead he was on a campaign visit to Morecambe There was deliberation to all this in a childishly provocative tweet the Labour party chirpily asked last Friday Big weekend plans Find an event near you In bitter spirits I put in my postcode Vauxhall central London and was invited to rebuildbritain by attending a meeting in Swanley miles away in Kent on the day of the largest demonstration since Iraq  Corbyn s motivation in this steadfast abstinence from a swell of protest at which he should naturally be at the crest is always put down to his Euroscepticism which has morphed among commentators from he s not too keen on Europe to he hates Europe This is overstatement and a diversion what s really happened is that a strategy devised for has failed to update 
MAR25	Theresa May is effectively gone. She is a leader in name only	Brexit is the biggest peacetime crisis we have faced and a no deal Brexit could provoke a national emergency The depth and scale of the divisions and the narrowness of the majority in favour of leaving the EU mean that the most sensible step would be to put the issue on hold complete the negotiations and then hold a referendum Sadly that option is not available  But it is in the next phase of negotiations that the details of the UK s future relationship with the EU will be fleshed out Depending on what happens in those negotiations either we will see virtually no change to our current status in which case what is the point of leaving Or as is much more likely the Brexiteers will demand significant changes to reflect their own views views that will appal and frighten much of the electorate when they realise the enormity of what is being done In essence Brexiteers want to dismantle much of what we regard as the underpinning of civilised life in the modern world 
MAR25	Thank EU for the music – not the grasping tech giants	Shakespeare writes about a man who sold his goodly manor for a song The way I read it the Bard implies that a song would be worth very little if not to himself at least to the people in his audience A song is such a weightless elusive phenomenon How can anyone put a value on that  Ever since Shakespeare s day for a song has been an idiom that represents something you get very cheaply The YouTubes of this world know this and they d like to keep it that way They say thank you for the music and make millions off songs we all love and cherish while the writer gets a pittance 
MAR25	Women’s lib freed us from domestic drudgery – so what’s with today’s competitive cleaning?	The world is a mess Pollution and all that eco jazz Your body is also a mess full of toxins that need cleansing Your skin is ungodly and needs a good hot cloth treatment and expensive cream And your house Well it s an absolute tip  Foxes have eaten my recycling so rubbish is strewn all over the road A card was popped through my door offering to steam my carpets a treatment that seemed more expensive than buying some new carpets The last man who cleaned my windows disappeared after a complicated divorce and quite frankly I can t be bothered any more 
MAR25	Brexit: what’s the least worst outcome of this week? Our panel responds	Stalemate impasse roadblock was the ineluctable result of a crude in out referendum dangling a dozen Brexit rainbows No one true Brexit was ever put to voters The closest to a healing compromise now is the well constructed Kyle Wilson amendment let parliament agree a Brexit but only if voters confirm their support Put it to the people as pressed by the million marchers not a second referendum but a new proposition on an actual Brexit seen in the cold light of day is this what you meant  This week a series of indicative votes may find a parliamentary majority for something else customs union Norway or indeed the prime minister s miserable offering Polls show that people have changed their mind quite radically an percentage point lead for remain Perversely Theresa May insists scores of MPs should make a U turn but refuses voters any right to a change of heart 
MAR25	No collusion, plenty of corruption: Trump is not in the clear	Suspend your disbelief for a second  Assume that the Trump administration which lies so easily and so often on matters big and small can tell the truth about the Mueller investigation Forget the cover up about separating families at the border and jailing children Pretend it has fully embraced the death toll of more than Americans in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria Imagine Trump s inauguration crowds really were exceptionally large 
MAR25	The global battle for the internet is just starting	If only for a moment set aside the comparatively parochial drama of Brexit think about the giant swath of humanity that now uses the internet and consider one of the most basic facets of how billion of us live our lives This is a st century story but it will ring bells with people old enough to remember the cold war how people understand their own experience and events in the wider world is increasingly decided by the version of the internet they use  On one side sits the system used in China which produces vast amounts of personal data and blurs into a huge apparatus of state surveillance and censorship This model is centred on two online behemoths whose dominance partly comes down to the fact that Chinese consumerism is all about paying via your smartphone rather than an old fashioned plastic card There s the e commerce conglomerate Alibaba and Tencent which owns WeChat the platform used by more than billion people every day It does so many things payments social networking messaging travel booking gaming that participating in society without it seems all but impossible 
MAR25	May’s time is up. She must make way for a caretaker prime minister	There is an unforgettable moment in Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip that comes unexpectedly to mind in these strange and desperate times for our country In it the comedian recalls an encounter with his close friend the legendary NFL running back Jim Brown  Pryor is in a wretched mess confined to his room freebasing cocaine with a pipe that he imagines is whispering to him Brown is unimpressed He simply asks What you gonna do Again And again And again In March the UK is Pryor strung out in this case on Brexit and the rest of the world is Jim Brown Everyone can see that this is a country on the edge of nervous collapse 
MAR26	Get set for Brexit: Indicative Day – the one where the Grand Wizards turn on each other	Draw near true believers for these are dark days for the ERG Brexit ultras The Fellowship of the Ringpieces finds itself divided on their next move and may yet be bitterly sundered as they ponder the big question could they honestly have played it worse  Before we help them answer it a quick update on which bit of Blunderland we ve tumbled into now Late on Monday night the House of Commons voted to take control of the parliamentary agenda and attempt to break the Brexit deadlock via a series of indicative votes masterminded by former Tory minister Oliver Letwin A clue a clue Our kingdom for a clue Like all initiatives handled by Oliver Letwin since the s it promises to go spectacularly wrong in ways we haven t even thought of yet but let s pretend otherwise before the shitstorm gets properly under way on Wednesday 
MAR26	Playgrounds only for the rich kids? What grotesque social apartheid	One playground for the children of the rich another for the poor  It s hard to think of an idea more crassly offensive than a supposedly mixed housing development where even toddlers are deliberately segregated by their parents salaries where small children have to be told they can t play with their friends on the swings their flats actually overlook because that s not for the likes of them But that is what appears to have happened at the Baylis Old School development in south London where an impenetrable hedge separates the owner occupiers children s playground from the social and affordable rented housing in the same block 
MAR26	Jamie Dimon, spare us your crocodile tears about inequality	If I may be so bold as to try to lure your attention away from Trump and Mueller for a moment consider Jamie Dimon s lament delivered a few days before Mueller delivered his report  Dimon is the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase and wrongdoing by him and the CEOs of other big corporations is more responsible for Trump s election than anything Russia dreamed of as I ll explain 
MAR26	Don’t knock the humble vox pop. It’s a vital tool of journalism	A lot of people it seems are sick of vox pops With British politics becoming ever more bitterly dysfunctional debate becoming more polarised and the media less trusted the humble vox pop has become a symbol of what has gone wrong with the way we talk politics  The comedian David Baddiel complains that those chosen to give their views are always from a leave constituency Because that s where people will be crossest His fellow comedian and broadcaster Danny Baker agrees suggesting that the media crews always go to cliched haunts where they think they can find real people The political scientist Rob Ford says the people and places are picked according to the stereotypes and usually just confirm the biases of said narratives 
MAR26	You can give all your money away, but it won’t solve poverty	Globally income inequality is rising Poverty remains a very real and very visible ill in most of the world It is humbling then to hear of Peter Tabichi a science teacher from rural Kenya who has won the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher prize for donating of his annual salary to charitable causes primarily in supporting the poorest pupils at his school to buy necessities such as uniforms and books  It s undoubtedly a generous act and almost certainly one born of noble ideals Whether you re religious or not Tabichi is a good example of the ideology espoused by Franciscan orders There is a strong tradition in Franciscan thought of social entrepreneurship and of taking steps to alleviate poverty collectively It s a rare thing to see in practice though and there are many religious people of all faiths who don t feel such an imperative to support philanthropic causes 
MAR26	Don't say Trump is exonerated. It's too soon for that	To listen to the Trump administration right now you would think that Robert Mueller has exonerated the president found Hillary Clinton and the liberal media guilty of treason and definitively proven once and for all that Donald Trump s inauguration crowd really was the largest in world history  Indeed the initial rollout of Mueller s conclusions has been a public relations triumph for the president mainly because it was in the hands of Trump s hand picked attorney general William Barr In the four page letter which Barr delivered to Congress less than words are quoted directly from Mueller s report But while these words certainly tell us something they hide much more than they reveal And Barr s decision to exonerate Trump on the charge of obstruction of justice something Mueller himself declined to do likewise raises a suite of questions about his reasoning and motives 
MAR26	Michael Jackson’s life showed us the journey from abused to abuser	Jimmy Savile Harvey Weinstein R Kelly Kevin Spacey We are not exactly short these days of celebrities accused of exploiting their fame to mask predatory behaviour Yet the Michael Jackson case is different And that s not just because he is still so passionately defended by some including most recently Barbra Streisand and Diana Ross while he also simultaneously did so little to mask his predatoriness  In his lifetime he talked happily about sharing his bed with little boys and was rarely photographed more than six feet away from one even after he was publicly accused four times of child sexual abuse by Jordy Chandler Gavin Arvizo and two boys who accused him of molestation during the Arvizo trial both of whom received financial payouts But with every other high profile story of child abuse the adult predator is presented solely as just that an adult predator a fully formed inexplicable monster 
MAR26	Is it too soon, too unsettling, for pro-IRA chants to be trivialised?	When does Up the RA not mean Up the RA When the England footballer Declan Rice who played for the Republic of Ireland before switching allegiance apologised for using the pro IRA slogan on a recently unearthed social media post he made as a year old it added to a strange momentum the aesthetics of Irish republicanism are gaining as they are repurposed by a new generation  The website Vice recently published an article headlined How militant Irish republican slogans went viral and they are on to something The appropriating of slogans and imagery that were once dangerous is happening and it is happening among a generation that lacks a memory of the peak of the Troubles simply because they hadn t been born In Up the RA is layered and esoteric For some it s mindlessly chanted without any context bar a sense of misplaced patriotism and ignorance For others it s subversive and transgressive playing with a taboo with the safe benefit of distance For yet others it is the trivialising of the slogan to the point of undermining the perceived power of the IRA itself its authority is so depleted that it s now a joke and only the slogan remains as punctuation Or it s just a dumb meme 
MAR26	After Mueller, the need for oversight of Trump is as urgent as ever	The Mueller report is finished and Donald Trump was found not to have colluded with Russians during the presidential election in And Trump based on his attorney general s four page summary was quick to declare victory Complete and total EXONERATION he boasted  Once again Trump misled America 
MAR26	Wales is right to ban smacking. But it’s not the whole solution	When you ve been awake since dawn you haven t spoken to another adult for six hours you re having your first period in two years and your baby is refusing to go to sleep despite having been awake since am there is a very fine line between playfully flicking bits of sheepskin out of your child s hand before they eat it and just hitting your child  I know because a few months ago I found myself alone in a park bathed in golden springtime sunshine genuinely worried that I was about to hit my son This was not some theoretical musing about the nature of reasonable force but the frayed nerve feeling of a parent reaching the very end of their ability to cope Had I grown up in an environment where smacking had been part of my family s emotional language if I d been smacked as a child and lived to tell the tale if slapping smacking pinching or hitting children had been considered normal during my childhood then I might very well have smacked my own child that day Luckily very luckily I was able to walk into a nearby children s centre plonk him by a miniature sandpit full of plastic dinosaurs watch him wave cheerfully to the play worker laying out a rainbow of jumbo felt tip pens walk into the corner out of sight and let out all the fury and fatigue that had been welling up inside me all day in one huge sigh 
MAR27	Farewell to the worst prime minister bar none – until the next one	Theresa May will leave office in an orderly handover whenever an EU withdrawal deal is done No one is weeping The oddity is we may yet come to miss her though she has been the worst prime minister of our political lifetimes bar none Yet there was one great good purpose in her premiership by occupying the space however vacuously she kept out the barbarian hordes of Brexiteers barging one another out of the way to seize her throne  Now she has surrendered that one useful role leaving the country to the untender mercies of those competing in Europhobia for the votes of some dwindling Tory party members To use her deathless phrase nothing will be changed by her departure Parliament will be as gridlocked as ever the combat deadlier with an avowed Brextremist at the helm 
MAR27	To kiss or not to kiss the pope’s ring? He needs to make it clear	There are some very odd videos of the Pope online see this one in which he responds with anger when some overexcited Mexican pilgrims pull him into the crowd  But his latest weird gone viral video shows Francis pulling his hand away as a long line of Italian worshippers try to kiss his ring after a religious service earlier this week in the town of Loreto Apparently he doesn t want to lord it over his flock in a way reminiscent of emperors and absolute monarchs of yore but in that case why hasn t he simply made an announcement to the effect that ring kissers aren t welcome and that he doesn t want that kind of no holds barred adulation which seems to belong to another century and like so much of what s outdated at the Vatican not even the last one He has after all been pope for six years now long enough one might have thought to lay down some guidelines about how he expects to be treated 
MAR27	Stop and search in schools would be a terrible indictment of society	Conservative MP Robert Halfon s suggestion that stop and search procedures are used in schools raises questions not only about the statutory responsibilities of schools and colleges and their limits but also about the role of education in a much broader context The chair of the education select committee s remarks follows hot on the heels of a recent Ofsted report researching knife crime in education  It has been widely acknowledged that the roots of youth violence are complex and varied and the solutions must be equally far reaching and multilayered Education does have a role to play in addressing some causal factors that lead young people into harmful behaviours and in preventing those already at risk from further harm either to themselves or others One element of this is indeed to build relationships with the police and to work collaboratively to ensure that when stop and search procedures are necessary in public spaces they are conducted in ways that are safe and non confrontational 
MAR27	I worked for Waterstones for 11 years – low pay has long been an issue	When I saw the staff petition for Waterstones to become a living wage employer earlier this week along with the open letter supporting it signed by numerous authors of note my first thought was why hasn t anyone done this before I worked for Waterstones for more than a decade and the issue of low pay for shopfloor staff is by no means a new one within the company Managing director James Daunt s dismissive response in the Guardian on Tuesday is one that will be familiar to every Waterstones bookseller both current and former full of distant promises and regretful rationalisations  I started with Waterstones as a bookseller in and over the next years worked in seven different branches taking on a range of positions I was a supervisor trainer healthy and safety auditor and by the time I left in I was running goods in operations at one of the company s largest stores In his response to the living wage petition Daunt made mention of rewarding employees with a stimulating job and while I can certainly say that the variety of roles kept my work interesting there was always one constant low pay When I finally left the company in after a lengthy period of service I was doing a job that left me utterly exhausted at the end of every work day and earning roughly p an hour more than the minimum wage 
MAR27	Amoral and venal: Britain’s governing class has lost all sense of duty	Even as doodlebugs smashed into the surrounding streets George Orwell consoled himself with this thought One thing that has always shown that the English ruling class are morally fairly sound is that in time of war they are ready enough to get themselves killed Present those who governed us with an existential crisis he argued in his essay England Your England and they would do what they believed to be right for the country  Almost eight decades later the UK stands on the verge of a calamity as great as any since the war Whatever the protestations in parliament we could within days crash land into a world of medicine shortages and food riots And where are our political classes According to the lobby correspondents Monday s cabinet meeting was spent war gaming general election strategies and thinking how to timetable voting so as to scare Labour Wherever the national interest actually featured it was buried under a thick dollop of party interest 
MAR27	Hats off to Nan Goldin for calling out UK arts institutions on the Sacklers	Opioid addicts die in horrific pain Their breathing slows their lungs fill with fluid They die vomiting You won t see that on a plaque in the V A  What you will see is the Sackler Centre It is a name visible in rooms courtyards and even escalators at our most esteemed art institutions But last week the National Portrait Gallery bowed to pressure and said that it will not accept a m grant from the Sackler family a billionaire branch of which owns the pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma the producers of OxyContin a painkiller that has been implicated in the opioid crisis The Tate Group followed suit several days later Then on Monday the Sackler Trust announced that it would be halting all new donations as the controversy was proving a distraction for institutions they say they vigorously deny allegations of having helped fuel the crisis 
MAR27	The answer to climate breakdown and austerity? A green new deal	Faced with unprecedented challenges politicians appear more divided than ever that s why Labour s Clive Lewis and I are doing something bold We are jointly tabling a bill in parliament designed to address two of the greatest threats we face climate breakdown and spiralling inequality Our bill would introduce a green new deal an unprecedented mobilisation of resources invested to prevent climate breakdown reverse inequality and heal our communities It demands major structural changes in our approach to the ecosystem coupled with a radical transformation of the finance sector and the economy to deliver both social justice and a livable planet  It s an idea congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has recently reinvigorated in the US And it could scarcely be more urgent The UN s top scientists have warned we have just years to halve global emissions and avoid climate catastrophe Global wildlife populations have collapsed by nearly in our lifetimes This has led million young people to join the inspiring global school strikes movement to demand change The response from ministers To continue to force fracking on local communities and to hand millions in tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry Last week unbelievably a new coal mine was given a green light on their watch 
MAR27	European football bosses can no longer turn a blind eye to racism	The shameful racist abuse of Raheem Sterling Danny Rose and Callum Hudson Odoi during England s Euro qualifying match against Montenegro on Monday understandably triggered outrage in British football Sadly however it is not the first time that black England players have been targeted during games in the Balkans The scenes in the Montenegrin capital Podgorica were grimly similar to those in when again Rose was subjected to monkey chants during an England U game against Serbia in Kru evac and to Zagreb in when Emile Heskey suffered the same ordeal playing against Croatia England s black players are not alone A banana was thrown at the Italian international Mario Balotelli by Croatian fans at Euro Partizan Belgrade s Brazilian midfielder Everton Luiz was abused by FK Rad fans in the Serbian SuperLiga a couple of years back the list is depressingly long  Racism in Balkan football is not new and other forms of discrimination including homophobia antisemitism or anti Romany sentiment are widespread in the game and beyond On top of that frequent expressions of ethnic hatred towards teams or players from neighbouring countries remain at the core of Balkan football fan culture The lack of diversity and social debate about racism in the region leads many to trivialise the severity of racist behaviour and reduce it to a form of acceptable football related banter It is widely acceptable as a form of psychological terror against an opposing team and more importantly particular players The fans doing the monkey chants on Monday were sitting in the main stand They were most likely not fanatical hooligans but ordinary supporters for whom this sort of behaviour is regarded as normal 
MAR27	Trump's Golan Heights proclamation is a cynical, dangerous move	No country in the world recognizes Israel s rule over the Golan Heights occupied by Israel in and unilaterally annexed in no country that is until now  Donald Trump signed a presidential proclamation on Monday formally recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights still considered Syrian territory under international law Standing by President Trump s side during an address by the two heads of state in Washington DC the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly called Trump s decision historic justice and gifted the president a box of wine from the occupied territory As they embraced Israeli forces began an aerial bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip after rockets launched from Gaza hit a house in a community north of Tel Aviv earlier that day 
MAR27	Playgrounds only for the rich kids? What grotesque social apartheid	One playground for the children of the rich another for the poor  It s hard to think of an idea more crassly offensive than a supposedly mixed housing development where even toddlers are deliberately segregated by their parents salaries where small children have to be told they can t play with their friends on the swings their flats actually overlook because that s not for the likes of them But that is what appears to have happened at the Baylis Old School development in south London where an impenetrable hedge separates the owner occupiers children s playground from the social and affordable rented housing in the same block 
MAR28	We’re led by a party not fit for power in a system not fit for purpose	A few days before the general election the prime minister David Cameron tweeted Britain faces an inescapable choice strong and stable government with me or chaos with Ed Miliband Cameron won the first general election the Tories have won outright since followed through on his pledge to hold a referendum on staying in the European Union promised not to resign if he lost lost and then resigned as chaos ensued  Theresa May took over after all other challengers either fell on their swords stabbed each other in the back or put their foot in their mouths It is as good a time as any to recall that of all the jokers and hucksters standing for the Conservative party leadership she was probably the best candidate It really could have been worse It could have been Andrea Leadsom 
MAR28	What the withdrawal agreement ‘separation’ actually means for Brexit	So we now know that the third attempt at the meaningful vote will not take place this week In its place the government will instead hold a vote on the divorce deal only the withdrawal agreement setting aside the future partnership for now  This is a desperate attempt to meet the European council s conditions for offering an extension to May If the withdrawal agreement does not pass this week the UK will almost certainly be required to participate in European parliament elections as a condition of an extension beyond April Passing the withdrawal agreement without the political declaration would meet the conditions of the European council for the extension but would not satisfy the domestic ratification requirements which would require a further act of parliament 
MAR28	Spartans don’t hug it out. Except for Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker	Since it s rather difficult to know where to start on what happened on Wednesday let s begin in the future I want to assure you that when the apocalypse has come and you re living in the bombed out remnants of civilisation clad in rags and distilling drinking water from your own urine the one crackling radio in your resistance bunker will still be bringing news of Conservative party leadership contests Even as your crew crawl over ghost cities scavenging electronic equipment that some androgynous teenage savant is going to solder together to see if you can discover if there are Others Like You you ll be doing it to a soundtrack of the last radio announcer going Aaannnnd Liam Fox has indicated he will not put his name forward for the next round of balloting He will instead transfer his votes so that whichever self interested timebomb wins will make him minister of food spores  Still back to the present day where it s arguably not all good news On Wednesday evening Theresa May offered Tory MPs her pending resignation if her deal was passed but the DUP trophy brides she spent a billion quid on have still declined to back it Thus the prime minister crosses into the realm of philosophical paradox she is too weak to resign May has now surpassed C Montgomery Burns as Earth s puniest big hitter Meanwhile the Tories launch another competition to see who will be the next one of them to have their prime ministerial career curtailed by the issue of Europe 
MAR28	Why do councils encourage profiteering from homelessness?	Early last year I was working for the homelessness department of a London council when a woman approached me for assistance The excited chatter of her two young children was at odds with the confusion and worry etched across her face She told me how her landlord had issued her an eviction notice but bewilderingly he didn t actually want to evict her Instead he d told her to go to the council get them to pay me the incentive and you can stay  Landlord incentives are essentially a bribe councils pay private landlords to persuade them to house homeless families or individuals They are used to either keep tenants at risk of being homeless in their current property or help ease the process of finding a new place to live This practice is widely known of within the housing sector yet is almost unheard of elsewhere So I sent freedom of information requests to every local council in London to find out how prevalent the practice was The results as reported in the Guardian are staggering Between them London councils spent more than m of public money on landlord incentives in paying incentives on more than separate occasions I would regularly hear of stories of one council offering a landlord a incentive only for them to solicit a better offer from another borough playing the two authorities off against each other until they pocketed a incentive to rent out a damp mouldy studio flat in Harrow 
MAR28	Have the Boeing crashes shaken our faith in flying?	Transport bosses need little prodding in public to utter the words safety is our number one priority a mantra so widespread that as with an English person inquiring How do you do the inherent insincerity is barely noted  Clearly the main objective of rail companies airlines or carmakers is moving people or things for profit with all the risk that entails What those industries have excelled at is vastly reducing that risk In Britain more than years have elapsed since a passenger was killed in a train crash Fatality rates in car accidents are declining particularly for drivers yesterday the European commission announced that extra safety features including automatic speed limiters would soon be mandatory 
MAR28	Brexit has ganged up with Alzheimer’s against my mother	It s tempting to think that the sudden deterioration of my mother s mental health could be linked to Brexit and our country s collective nervous breakdown I know it s just a coincidence But I believe that she and many others with Alzheimer s disease are Brexit victims because the government s focus on leaving the EU has created a policy vacuum that has cut adrift the most vulnerable people  A few months after my mother went into a care home with dementia my brother and I are once again navigating the care system on our own after she was told that the home could no longer cope with her challenging behaviour Mum a retired cookery and needlework teacher now aged seemed to have settled until about three weeks ago when she became paranoid and delusional The staff told us of aggressive behaviour requiring more specialised dementia care which they cannot provide 
MAR28	France is addressing black people’s invisibility in art. When will the UK?	An exhibition taking place at the Mus e d Orsay in Paris is breaking new ground on race and representation in the arts Black Models From G ricault to Matisse displays masterpieces by some of France s most important artists but renamed in honour of the black subjects who are in the pictures yet absent from their narratives  The exhibition is a welcome reminder that black people have been indispensable to nations such as France for centuries even if we have been overlooked One of the most toxic myths so central in shaping society is that Europe was once white and pure until the invasion of the dangerous and dark foreigners who have polluted the ideal society By renaming the pictures the curators are rightly staking a claim to a society that predates mass migration from the colonies to the mother country 
MAR28	Denying our man in New York a £16m penthouse? That would be churlish	Diplomacy is about communication Diplomats particularly senior ones often have to deal with the rich and powerful They cannot of course match the lifestyle of kings presidents feudal lords business tycoons press barons and so on But all governments except the most impoverished and some of them as well find it wise to have them deal with such people on something like equal terms That requires a base with a bit of style which can be expensive  A million penthouse fit for a UK civil servant is never going to be popular But the role of such homes provided at the taxpayers expense is perhaps misunderstood As well as allowing diplomats to do their jobs they also have to provide a decent normal family home That may not always be achieved I m thinking of my own time in South Arabia now Yemen but it is vital The Ferrero Rocher image of diplomacy is by no means the whole story but if Mr Big keeps inviting you to his mansion and all you can do in return is take him out to a restaurant he will soon mark you down as a cheapskate and that is not a good beginning Diplomats are not unique in this you don t see many big business representatives living in shoeboxes 
MAR28	Why we need to talk about the media’s role in far-right radicalisation	When it comes to the threat of Islamist terrorism no one doubts the role of radicalisation The internet hate preachers such as Anjem Choudary and Abu Hamza and the western armed extremism exporting state of Saudi Arabia all play their part in radicalising the impressionable When it comes to the far right however this consensus is absent The reason for this is as obvious as it is chilling the hate preachers recruiting sergeants and useful idiots of rightwing extremism are located in the heart of the British European and American establishments They are members of the political and media elite  Less than two weeks ago dozens of Muslims were murdered in Christchurch Before the lethal rampage the shooter is said to have inscribed For Rotherham on one of his gun magazines in reference to the English town s grooming scandal In Britain far right terrorist attackers have ranged from David Copeland who detonated a nail bomb in a Soho gay pub in after decades of media hatemongering against LGBT people to the murderer of Jo Cox whose despicable act was cheered by people online to Darren Osborne who ploughed his van into worshippers outside a mosque As one radicalisation expert Abdul Azim Ahmed of the Centre for the Study of Islam in the UK at Cardiff University told ITV news Osborne s extremism also came from the mainstream media It came from mainstream politicians both here and abroad 
MAR28	The destruction of the Earth is a crime. It should be prosecuted	Why do we wait until someone has passed away before we honour them I believe we should overcome our embarrassment and say it while they are with us In this spirit I want to tell you about the world changing work of Polly Higgins  She is a barrister who has devoted her life to creating an international crime of ecocide This means serious damage to or destruction of the natural world and the Earth s systems It would make the people who commission it such as chief executives and government ministers criminally liable for the harm they do to others while creating a legal duty of care for life on Earth 
MAR29	This defeat is the end of the Brexit PM. Bring on the general election	Force feed them back their words Theresa May s deal was even worse than staying in the EU declared Dominic Raab the Brexit secretary who resigned to oppose a deal he helped negotiate This is a man who once publicly confessed he didn t understand Britain s reliance on the Dover Calais crossing  The deal would turn Britain into a vassal state declared Boris Johnson a man who had penned a column backing remain days before endorsing leave it was about as bad as it could possibly be 
MAR29	The Tory leadership contest: your handy idiots guide	There s a photo from Pompeii that s been doing the internet rounds a while showing the plaster cast of a naked man He appears to have died masturbating even as he must have known the Vesuvian ash cloud was approaching Did he Science says it s a bit more complicated than that but science isn t important right now because in every psychological aspect that guy is the Conservative party No matter what holy terror was raining down upon our land no matter what the peril the Conservative party would always decide to crack out a leadership contest  And so inevitably to the situation in which we find ourselves at this moment of national crisis with Theresa May having agreed to depart The mad bastards of the Tory party are at it again in a competition you should think of as Mastershit The Professionals I collect the full range of Franklin Mint commemorative crockery for every Tory leadership battle So if you need a vignette to remind you how the last one unfolded there was one day when Andrea Leadsom went so fully Handmaid s Tale on May in an interview for the Times that the paper was only able to give a side column to fellow contender Stephen Crabb being a sex case 
MAR29	Pinch of Nom suddenly makes Delia and Heston look a little stale	Pinch of Nom isn t a phenomenon A phenomenon has a beginning and an end but this thing at first a Facebook group then a food website now a record breaking cookbook is as vast as unstoppable as the universe expanding Authored by duo Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson Pinch of Nom was published in the UK on Thursday last week and in just three days it sold more than copies To put this into perspective in Ella Mills became the fastest selling debut cookbook author of all time selling copies in one week  There s no doubt that Pinch of Nom has benefitted from the path forged by food blogger cum author stars such as Mills or Joe Wicks who wrote Lean in But the success of Featherstone and Allinson who in years have gone from running a Wirral restaurant together to topping the book charts outstrips anything we ve seen before How did a simple diet book come to break the world of cookbooks as we know it 
MAR29	Chris Grayling's worst failure? Not transport: the probation services	Chris Grayling s decision to part privatise the probation service is arguably his worst failure On Thursday it was thoroughly blasted by the chief inspector of probation Dame Glenys Stacey She described the current system as irredeemably flawed and said we would all be safer if supervision of offenders in England and Wales was back in public ownership  More than a quarter of a million people are living under probation supervision that s three times as many people as are locked up in prison Probation staff struggle to cope while our communities are hit with more crime because of a misplaced ideology of privatisation Probation just like other vital public services such as the NHS social care and schools doesn t belong in private hands Privatisation leads to inefficiency fragmentation and the wrong incentives 
MAR29	Those gunning to be caretaker PM should take notes from Solskjær	Meet the new boss not quite the same as the old boss Ole Gunnar Solskj r the year old caretaker manager of Manchester United football club has seen his temporary appointment become a permanent one  Having arrived in December after the departure of Jose Mourinho the Norwegian former Man Utd striker was only supposed to be in charge until the end of the season 
MAR29	The funeral industry is preying on grieving people. This must stop	Price increases at double the rate of inflation for years certain unscrupulous funeral directors targeting bereaved customers vulnerability people left unable to afford to bury loved ones due to vicious benefits cuts No wonder the Competition and Markets Authority has announced it will launch an in depth market investigation into the funerals sector Frankly it s dystopian  At Down to Earth the only UK wide advice service for people in financial need arranging a funeral I get a unique insight into the effect I ve called around five funeral directors in the area and none of them want to know as soon as I tell them I have no money a caller told me recently I can t sleep I don t know what to do I can t stand the thought of him lying in that morgue for months Lorraine not her real name had been advised that without at least a deposit of the funeral wouldn t go ahead Where am I supposed to get that she said 
MAR29	Replacing May is not just a game for the entitled. We must all have a say	Jacob Rees Mogg is famously not short of nannies  So whatever persuaded him to bring his year old son with him to last weekend s council of war at Chequers it probably wasn t a childcare emergency Apparently Mogg the Younger sat outside and read a book about cricket before joining the grownups for coffee 
MAR29	Why I have organised a march against UK-wide school funding cuts	Fund our schools I hate foolish funding cuts This is what my daughter has written on a homemade banner she has made for the April Fools Day march in Cambridge when she and I and hundreds of other parents teachers and children will march into the city to protest against school funding cuts  Why Because schools in Cambridge like many across the country are facing a financial crisis My daughter Flora is seven and attends St Matthew s primary school an inner city Cambridge school Her school budget will be reduced by next year but other schools face far worse cuts 
MAR29	War has broken Yemen. A new route to peace is needed, now	Yemen has long faced structural economic social and security challenges The war that started in has only exacerbated Yemen s many previous woes The conflict gradually escalating from a political impasse into full scale hostilities is quickly becoming intractable  The war which entered its fifth year this week with an exceedingly complex political and military situation is being worsened by an overwhelming humanitarian crisis that keeps growing in scale where almost of the population is in need of aid The peace process is currently at a deadlock while the war is deepening grievances ripping the social fabric and shattering an already fragile state 
MAR29	Toxins in the air, toxins in the soil – still ministers won’t act on Grenfell	It is news that no one wants to hear Independent research from Prof Anna Stec at the University of Central Lancashire released on Thursday shows heightened levels of cancer causing chemicals in the area around Grenfell Tower Phosphorous flame retardants toxic to the nervous system were found in soil samples metres from the tower Dust and oily deposits were wiped from the blinds of homes close to the tower months later Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found at times the level of reference samples m from Grenfell along with chemicals that can cause asthma with a single exposure These are not at naturally occurring levels in most urban environments  This is truly shocking From the beginning residents have asked the local authority and Public Health England about contamination The problem was obvious For days after the fire black smoke hung in the air and contaminated homes clothing and furniture For months charred black ash rained down on people s balconies gardens clothes lines and bins 
MAR30	It’s far easier to be hoodwinked if you really think they’re out to get you	Do they think I m a fool Do they take me for a total bloody idiot They fix the game They take the piss They laugh at me behind my back despise me ignore me and then try to order me around  Who s telling me that Everyone is telling me that Jeremy Corbyn says The people who run Britain have been taking our country for a ride They ve stitched up our political system to protect the powerful they ve rigged the rules to suit themselves And they expect me to do what obey them Accept their rigged fixed stitched up system and be grateful 
MAR30	Labour’s plan for a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal can heal the country	Like someone who works with heavy machinery or lives next to a railway line it s possible to get so accustomed to the ugly noise that blasts out of our political system that you don t always hear it  But whenever I step back I can tell the sound of our politics has become shriller and angrier particularly since the referendum of that split our country in half 
MAR30	Me and the woman in the pink coat (by the woman in the yellow coat)	I hoped that if anything I ever did went viral it would be because I d uttered some profound insight too good not to share Last week put paid to that dream A BBC Breakfast video clip of myself and Sherelle Jacobs assistant comment editor at the Telegraph from Thursday had garnered more than m online views by Saturday afternoon As much as I d like to think it was due to my incisive Brexit analysis I have to concede it was as a result of me being well and truly upstaged  After a call from a BBC producer on Wednesday night off I trundled bleary eyed at next morning to the green outside parliament where all the television channels have gazebos set up I argued that Wednesday s indicative votes showed there was still hope of a referendum on any Brexit deal Sherelle as eloquent as ever said she thought we d see a Theresa May resignation before too long 
MAR30	What Apple could teach mom Gwyneth Paltrow about technology	Gwyneth Paltrow is many things an A list actress an entrepreneur a woman who has built a business empire on charging eye watering amounts for self care products that sound as if they were invented during a free association session at the local poetry night but she is not known for being relatable Yet on Instagram as she was told off by her teenage daughter Apple with a statement one door slam away from You re sooooo embarrassing something human began to manifest Paltrow had posted a picture of herself with Apple wearing ski goggles Mom we have discussed this You may not post anything without my consent the year old wrote underneath it as crisp as the snow behind them  Paltrow s audience of m was torn the comments turning into a battleground of pro privacy advocates surely ironic to argue that via Instagram where one click on a single pair of leggings means never being able to escape from leggings ads for the rest of your mortal days and people who think Paltrow is perfectly entitled to post pictures of her progeny 
MAR30	Sure, he might say he’s on the pill, but would you really trust him?	Once again there are reports of the male contraceptive pill being tantalisingly imminent And once again a mental image occurs of a man and woman looking at each other arms folded as if to say Sorry I don t trust you a bit  A University of Washington study involving men showed that sperm production could be disrupted with minimal side effects and everything returning to normal once men stop taking the pill Which all sounds intriguing though it wouldn t resolve the other major issue the intrinsic lack of contraceptive trust between the sexes which seems impossible to resolve leastways to the point where the chemical baton could pass from women to men 
MAR30	The UK needs a year-long extension on Brexit – to really take back control	After a week that ended in an atmosphere of chaos confusion acrimony hostility and mistrust MPs are once again trying to construct a Brexit majority for something or anything Having lived for years now away from the Westminster bubble I am clear that even if parliament struggles to an th hour compromise on Monday there will be little buy in from the public And even if for a moment there are sighs of relief the country will still be as divided as ever  Opinion poll after opinion poll has rejected not just Theresa May s deal and the no deal option but the Canada Norway Switzerland and Efta options the last three of which would leave Britain as a rule taker rather than a rule maker And while MPs deserve credit for trying there is unlikely to be a majority in the country for a deal cobbled together over a weekend on the basis of MPs third or fourth choices that could decide the next years of our history 
MAR30	Amid the overalls and the flat caps, I found my voice in Cambuslang	At a certain point in the last few miles of the train journey from London to Glasgow I sometimes catch a glimpse of the building that was my workplace for most of The sight of it comes and goes in a moment single storey and backing on to the railway cutting no building could be plainer or less conspicuous The touching thing is that it survives when far grander sights in the district have disappeared  Clydebridge ironworks gone the Hoover factory gone Ravenscraig rolling mills gone Stewarts and Lloyds steel tubes gone smoke is no longer general all over Lanarkshire But there still standing in Tabernacle Lane Cambuslang is the former office of the Cambuslang Advertiser and the East Kilbride News 
MAR30	Brexit has nearly broken British politics. Here’s how to fix it	For those who live in the shadow of one of the most remarkable states to emerge in world history the image of the UK now floundering in prolonged indecision over Brexit is shocking  Decisive rejection of the UK EU withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons for a third time following hot on the heels of the House s rejection of eight alternative approaches raises uncomfortable questions about the quality of the UK s decision making process 
MAR30	Barclays funds climate breakdown. We are determined to make it stop	From Cyclone Idai which has killed hundreds in south east Africa to flooding in Bangladesh where my family is from for decades climate change has been devastating communities in the global south More recently these effects have begun to be felt by people in the UK too just last month wildfires raged on Saddleworth Moor while where I live in Brixton the air is so polluted I suffer from breathing problems  We all know that the impact of climate change is felt unequally depending on where you live how wealthy you are and how easily you can shield yourself from its effects Less widely known however is that responsibility for the crisis is unequal too In recent years we have been sold a lie that ordinary people are to blame for the climate crisis It s our spending and our consumption habits that have created the mess we re in we are told not the bankers oil companies and a rich elite 
MAR30	Beware the great betrayal myth. This debacle is the work of hard Brexiters	There is no deader horse in the kingdom than the deal brokered by Theresa May Flogged and flogged again it expired for a third time at pm today on the floor of the House of Commons Something else lay dead alongside it the illusion that the objection of MPs was not to the precise terms of Britain s proposed exit from the European Union contained in the withdrawal agreement but rather to the sketched vision of our future relationship with the EU the so called political declaration That fond thought was also bludgeoned to death for MPs had the chance to vote on the withdrawal agreement alone and they rejected it by votes to  Now we face a new cliff edge with pm on April the new day of destiny At that hour Britain will crash out of the EU with no deal in a scenario those charged with stewarding our economy our industry and our safety warn will be catastrophic The only way to avoid that fate is for MPs to agree on something else fast and once they have to impose their will on a reluctant prime minister That is harder than it sounds 
MAR31	Don’t rely on Mueller and Russia: there is no magic wand to rid us of Trump – or Brexit	Almost a year ago the US public radio network NPR interviewed Robert Mueller s biographer Garrett Graff The book was a classic American hagiography The wealthy Mueller went to Princeton University where he played lacrosse then followed his teammate David Hackett to Vietnam after Hackett had been killed trying to rescue an ambushed platoon  His biographer was keen to mention early on that Mueller had in fact not been eligible to serve in the military An injured knee had ruled him out but he took a year off then doggedly re enlisted In Vietnam he covered himself in glory and earned a Bronze Star with valour for rescuing two wounded marines 
MAR31	Give the people a final say: the case for a referendum is far stronger than in 2016	It is astonishing to reflect that the prime minister s announcement on Wednesday of her resignation plans was by no means the most important political story of the week Far from it in fact In normal circumstances of which you may have a dim recollection Theresa May s declaration that she won t stand in the way of a new leadership once her Brexit deal was approved would have driven all other news to the margins rocked the markets gripped the world But in these extraordinary times such a story is just another day at the office  And rightly so As significant as the identity of the next Conservative leader undoubtedly is not least because that person will probably be the next prime minister it is small potatoes compared with the redefinition of Britain s relationship with the European Union and the scandalously amateurish process by which that matter is being decided 
MAR31	If you can’t embrace regional dialect, you can kiss my chuddies	In a rare piece of happy news to distract us momentarily from all the chaos those lovely linguists at the Oxford English Dictionary have announced an abundance of new words all taken from regional dialects  The new entries include the Indian English phrase kiss my chuddies the delicious word jibbons which is what spring onions are called in Wales and the Scottish words sitooterie which is obviously a place to sit out and bidie in a person who lives with his or her partner in a non marital relationship which surely should have been in the dictionary ages ago since the author Val McDermid a fine connoisseur of the English language uses it in her Twitter bio 
MAR31	I’m trans and I love swimming. Why must going to the pool be an ordeal?	Swimming was one of my favourite things to do when I was younger I grew up in rural north Iceland but once a year my parents travelled to the capital Reykjavik to attend the annual agricultural senate of Iceland Above all this meant to me that we would be able to visit all of the local swimming pools I have warm memories of racing up the cold and icy stairs to the outside slide before throwing myself down the slide again and again with contentment until my parents had to physically drag me out of the pool  In Iceland there is a pool for every inhabitants Swimming is one of the nation s favourite pastimes It s so ingrained into our culture that we have what we call pottamenning which describes a cultural phenomenon of having public discussions about politics in the hot tub Journalists go to public pools and interview local swimmers to get their take on recent events 
MAR31	While newsrooms have shrunk, investigative journalism is thriving	One of the enduring myths espoused by veteran reporters is that investigative journalism is dead I think I heard it first in when I joined the Sunday Times the newspaper generally considered to have pioneered agenda setting investigations Several of my new colleagues were convinced despite ample evidence to the contrary that the paper was no longer committed to providing the necessary resources for lengthy probes into institutional bad behaviour They held fast to the myth even as the paper went on publishing investigations  Later I discovered that the same mistaken belief existed across the industry and has persisted over the course of years It gained ground once the digital revolution took hold and I admit to sharing concerns about the negative effects of the resulting cuts to editorial staffs But digital tools have turned out to be a wonderful addition to the reporting armoury and it is possible to argue that investigative journalism today is in a healthier state than ever before Computer terminals have proven more effective in discovering secrets than shoe leather 
MAR31	Archaic, authoritarian, unequal to the challenge – parliament is broken	After every shattering bungle some PR creep says Lessons have been learned and appropriate changes put in place Well and British Brexit What lessons and what hope for changes  There s one obvious lesson which Westminster despite centuries of dire experience still fails to learn Do not kick Irish cans down the road Some contain Semtex All have a way of rolling back and tripping you up There s an English habit of not thinking about Ireland lest it spoil a nice afternoon If David Cameron had thought of the British border in Ireland he would have called his referendum off But he kicked Arlene Foster and two Irish taoiseachs down the road Now British politics lies sprawling on that same hard tarmac 
MAR31	I’ll never see Mum again. But I’ve learned to live with Mother’s Day	I can t remember the last Mother s Day I spent with my mum It would have been in since in August of that year she died but the day itself is lost in the memories of all those that came before it Those past Mother s Days were a mad rush to buy a card and a bunch of flowers lilies always the haphazard breakfasts in bed made with my brother when I was a child and one year even writing a poem the flowers must have all sold out  In the six years since my mum has died though each Mother s Day is now a looming presence one that cannot be passed over and forgotten Rather than fret over the day as a commercial inconvenience as I did when she was alive now it is something I grit my teeth through a different kind of endurance test 
MAR31	Theresa May was dealt the worst of hands and has played it spectacularly badly	It nearly always ends in tears whether they are shed publicly or just inside but few premierships have drawn to a close with such wretchedness as that visited on Theresa May She s not quite out of the door yet and other Tories are already describing her as the worst prime minister in a hundred years That is a savage verdict when the competition for this dismal accolade includes Neville Chamberlain Ramsay MacDonald Anthony Eden and David Cameron  I think we can safely say she will not be remembered as one of the more strong and stable occupants of Number Hilarious as it may seem today she seized the keys in the summer of because colleagues thought her a safe pair of hands She commended herself to Tory MPs and was pretty popular with a lot of voters as she seemed to promise a premiership of common sense and calm after the anarchic orgy of backstabbing unleashed by the Cameronian Johnsonian and Goveite cliques In that largely forgotten period when she appeared to be monarch of all she surveyed and the cabinet was terrified of her she was variously compared to Boudicca and Elizabeth I To some of us the early cult of Theresa was ridiculous even at the time It is now so risible that thinking about it for too long risks permanent injury to your abdomen 
MAR31	Drug trips, not broken hips: let later life be the age of irresponsibility	Contemplating getting old and thinking about what it would be like living out your last years institutionalised in a care home is enough to make anyone feel depressed Sure there are some excellent care homes out there but there are also plenty that are steeped in loneliness and misery And the prospect of losing your physical or even worse your mental faculties is deeply scary  That gut reaction an inherent fear of decline is a very strong one difficult to overcome It infuses our attitudes towards ageing and helps bake ageism into society Ageing is culturally all about managing decline rather than living the good life until the very end That in turn affects how older people are looked after by their families and the care system 
MAR31	Dividing rich and poor is inevitable when developers run open spaces	There s no good way of looking at this Sometimes when waves of outrage break a contrarian voice might ask if it s as bad as all that if there isn t another side to the story In the case of the Baylis Old School development in south London where children from affordable housing have been excluded from a playground used by the children of private owner occupiers there is no excuse  This segregated playground is plain mean spirited It goes against a strength of London and other British cities which is that people of different backgrounds both live close together and share spaces It contradicts the planning application made by the project s developers which says that play areas will be designed to maximise their inclusivity and that open spaces will emphasise the sense of community within the scheme stressing that the common areas are there for the use of all the residents 
APR1	This is no time for a compromise with Brexiters: there is no middle way	 Believe in Britain say leavers posters outside parliament What sort of belief as things fall apart While Brexit voting consumed Westminster last Friday another austerity tragedy slipped by unnoticed In Hastings the doors shut for the last time on a day centre that was life support comfort and company for old people I met Rose Mary and Sal who had sat together for years and were now to be separated Some of those ejected from the Isabel Blackman Centre will stay home alone Some will soon go to expensive residential care in the absence of the centre s daily respite for their partners Expect many to be in A E more often along with others of the million older people denied care Some older people died waiting for a care package last year according to Age UK In East Sussex seven local care centres have shut The council is near bankrupt due to cuts As the Isabel Blackman Centre shut the new minister for loneliness Tracey Crouch was not there to say goodbye to Rose Mary and Sal  I left to catch the train back for the next episode of the Westminster psycho drama to see the MPs consumed by the furies ambitions and panics of another Brexit vote These things are linked Believe in Britain The real patriotic cause is to save us all from Brexit from the damage any variety of Brexit will do as the grip of austerity inevitably tightens following departure Closing day centres wasn t on the side of that notorious leave bus of course 
APR1	Jeremy Corbyn needs to get behind the people’s vote to fight the far right	For many in the Labour movement the socialist diverse left bloc of last week s Put it to the People march may have felt more of a political home than say the main continuity remain element and that also highlights the big Jeremy Corbyn shaped hole both at the event and in the wider campaign For it actually to be more Corbyn left the campaign would need the leadership s buy in and the grassroots organising that would flow from that Instead it was down to the left bloc of Love Socialism Hate Brexit MPs and campaigners to present the radical left anti racist arguments for a second referendum They did a great job even though their message did not necessarily chime with everyone one organiser told me they overhead someone at the main demo ask why the left bloc kept going on about socialism at an anti Brexit march  This statement encapsulates the problem with a people s vote campaign led by the centrist status quo that much of the leave vote was a protest against Meanwhile the anti racist component of arguments over Brexit is too often ignored as we pore over the parliamentary politics of who might vote for which Brexit option and what happens next Here we are with only bad choices mounting chaos reckless rhetoric a terrible democratic failure and a febrile political climate all of which is firing up a hate and anger filled far right already emboldened by Brexit Whatever happens next none of that is going away quickly 
APR1	Tory MPs’ no-deal fetish is making a cross-party Brexit solution impossible	The number of Conservative MPs who are prepared to take Britain out of the EU with no deal is now greater than the total number of Conservatives elected to parliament in That is not the only way that British politics has changed since then Parties have a lot of different positions over years but the capture of the Tories by no dealism has happened within months  When Tony Blair s landslide victory reduced the Tory MPs to a rump of Euroscepticism meant something different It was all about obstructing Britain s entry into the single currency resisting new treaties and grumbling about old ones Only on the outermost political fringe would anyone advocate shredding the treaties kicking away the legal and diplomatic foundations of Britain s partnership with the continent and seeing what happened Even three years ago no one in the official leave campaign thought that was a good idea Now Tory MPs more than half of the party s parliamentary cohort are signed up That number which includes many cabinet ministers is reported to have endorsed a letter urging the prime minister to deliver the UK out of the EU promptly and regardless of the terms 
APR1	A customs union would not solve the Brexit conundrum	Parliament has a little over one week to prove that it can do what Theresa May should have allowed it to do after her failure in the election and come up with a plan that saves us from the Brexit cliff edge The question is whether it can without the constraints of Mrs May s self imposed red lines agree a deal based on the creation of a permanent customs union and perhaps also continuing membership of the single market  Only a minority of the Conservative party which now looks increasingly like the leave campaign would buy into this as most now want to leave the EU with as clean a break as possible however painful But we may find in the coming days that there is a cross party majority of MPs including possibly the DUP who are willing to back a softer form of Brexit Negotiations to see whether a compromise is possible are the only alternative to what the former Brexit minister Lord Bridges has described as the British public being asked to walk a gangplank into thin air 
APR1	Remainers, take note: much of Europe just wants to excise the British cancer	The mood in Brussels is pessimistic Most of those closely involved in the Brexit talks think the likeliest outcome is for the UK to leave without a deal There is also tremendous frustration with what EU officials see as the incompetence ignorance and irresponsibility of swaths of the British political class Over the past three years much of the goodwill that people held towards the UK has evaporated  The EU expects no deal because it does not trust British politicians not to screw up There is not much faith that indicative votes among MPs will produce a coherent way forward We don t see the transmission mechanism that forces the executive to bend to parliament s will said one EU official We cannot negotiate with a parliament 
APR1	Government can’t regulate Facebook – it’s up to all of us	I didn t see this coming but I agree with Mark Zuckerberg The Facebook chief executive has called for more government regulation of the internet And what he has said is pretty sensible if a little light on detail The four areas Zuckerberg wants governments to regulate more are harmful content election integrity privacy and data portability I know what you re thinking isn t Zuck just passing the buck Hasn t his company very publicly failed to tackle all of the issues he s saying it s up to governments to fix You re not wrong The four areas he s concerned about do happen to overlap with recent Facebook scandals But that doesn t mean his announcement isn t good news  Big companies hardly ever call for more regulation It sometimes feels as if people in Silicon Valley view laws and indeed nation states as some quaint th century tech that will disappear in a few years like CDs or fax machines Businesses such as Uber and Facebook pride themselves on being disruptors arguing the existing rules are too outdated to apply to them at all And until now they haven t been keen on any new rules to replace the old ones The change of heart should be welcomed 
APR1	Dear Robert Smith – spare a thought for us poor interviewers	My how we laughed at Robert Smith s reaction when the Cure were inducted into the Rock Roll Hall of Fame Deadpan he responds to giddy over eager interviewer Carrie Keagan who bubbling with gleeful enthusiasm asks him Are you are as excited as I am Glumly he replies By the sounds of it no  When I wrote about music my life was frequently complicated by interviewees who could or would not cooperate The interview process is seldom sparkling but we do what we can with occasionally fatigued overwhelmed intoxicated arrogant tedious musicians some are lovely admittedly A friend attempted to liven up his days on the interview circuit treadmill by posing questions cut from random magazines including gardening publications to the initial bewilderment then eventual amusement of his subjects I still have fond memories of interviewing Edsel Auctioneer for the NME a Leeds band with the nous to tell benign lies in order to enliven the process who offered a welcome slightly ribald fib about song lyrics and a Jacuzzi 
APR1	Turns out posh boys are better bullshitters. That explains a lot	If you ve ever wondered why the most overconfident embarrassments in the headlines and in your life are so frequently young posh and male wonder no more It s a thing Bullshit can be packaged in so many ways but it frequently comes in a certain form According to a new study from University College London young men who come from advantaged backgrounds are more likely to be bullshitters That is they believe they re smarter stronger and all round better than they actually are  He could sniff out insecurity like a truffle hunting pig and play with it until hard working colleagues cried
APR1	Petitions and jokes will not halt this march into Brexit calamity	It could conceivably have happened on any day over the past couple of years but my own peak of anger about Brexit and its absurdities arrived last Wednesday Jacob Rees Mogg was in the Commons chamber making quips about the fact that another Conservative MP had been to Winchester rather than Eton My honourable friend makes a characteristically Wykehamist point highly intelligent but fundamentally wrong how we all laughed  My mind s eye was still switching back to the spectacle of Iain Duncan Smith arriving at Chequers in an open topped vintage sports car Meanwhile there were reports of Theresa May s address to Conservative MPs being made all the more dramatic by the sound of her voice cracking something conspicuously absent when she has talked about everything from the Grenfell Tower disaster to her role in the Windrush tragedy but there we are 
APR1	To understand the far right, look to their bookshelves	I used to live in Tucson teaching at the University of Arizona The post US just half an hour away from the Mexican border was a strange place to be Armed vigilantes patrolled the desert hunting for illegal immigrants Every day the local radio spewed paranoia and xenophobia They talked about true Americans in small towns with pure values as opposed to the corrupt liberal elite in the cities A radical right rhetoric was beginning to form but it was still on the margins  Poll after poll showed that trust in basic democratic institutions was diminishing It was against this background that the rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh claimed there were four corners of deceit media academia science and government Conspiracy theories mushroomed about how liberal lobbies had usurped the system Populist demagogues began to advise building alternative rightwing institutions A parallel universe Information wars Culture and knowledge which have for centuries bound us together as human beings were now regarded as a battleground 
APR2	May’s desperate pitch for cross-party unity is a leap into the dark	One way to identify Britain s next Brexit panic is to look for a problem that was foreseen in Brussels ages ago For example the European commission seeing that Theresa May s deal was failing decided in January that Britain would need to have European parliamentary elections if Brexit ended up being delayed into the summer Three months later it is the prospect of holding that ballot that has provoked May into a desperate pitch for collaboration with Labour in pursuit of some version of Brexit that stands a chance of Commons ratification  This has been the pattern from the start The EU anticipates problems makes choices and waits for British politics to catch up Even before the referendum there were warnings about the impossibility of frictionless borders outside the single market The specific challenge that posed for Northern Ireland was identified and baked into the commission s negotiating mandate in May But in February Dominic Raab a man who briefly led Brexit negotiations and fancies himself as a potential prime minister admitted he had not read the Good Friday agreement It is only pages long 
APR2	May’s bombshell means the Little English nationalist revolution is over	The carefully crafted illusions the May administration were founded on have crumbled into dust After three years of civil service expertise wasted billions of pounds of growth lost and two years worth of legislative time squandered Theresa May stopped trying to get Brexit through with Tory votes and turned to Jeremy Corbyn  Corbyn will be asked to co author a new version of the political declaration acceptable to Labour or failing that to help engineer a majority in the Commons either for a Norway style deal or a customs union 
APR2	May’s can-kicking changes nothing – MPs must stop a no-deal Brexit	Theresa May has proved herself once again to be an expert at kicking the can down the road  Her pitiful appeal for still more time to fix Brexit changes nothing The Irish border will remain an intractable problem and the DUP for all the money it has pocketed will continue to withhold its support 
APR2	The macho drama queens of Brexit are about to be knocked out by reality	The closer the Brexit doomsday clock ticks to midnight the more of a certain type of machismo we get I find it extremely encouraging It suggests that if and when all else fails the Brexit ultras can either fight or fuck their way out of this  Happily not one of them feels miscast in this hypersexualised action hero role How are you feeling tonight Sky News inquired of Steve Baker who last week was wishing he could tear down parliament and bulldoze it into the Thames Well everyone knows I m Brexit hardman Steve Baker came the reply from the man everyone knows needed a cuddle off Jacob Rees Mogg after the aforementioned dozer speech 
APR2	A comedian could be Ukraine’s next president. How did that happen?	A politically inexperienced comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy is in the lead after the first round of presidential elections in Ukraine and by a huge margin He is almost percentage points ahead of the incumbent president Petro Poroshenko Zelenskiy s unconventional campaign relying primarily on Instagram and a TV show in which he plays a fictional Ukrainian president proved to be far more successful than Poroshenko s attempt to impose a choice of me or Putin  Poroshenko s main messages of army language and faith as well as his recent nationalist initiatives would easily see him branded as far right in any other European country Yulia Tymoshenko a veteran of Ukrainian politics who led the polls until January failed to present a clear alternative to Poroshenko s aggressive nationalism and ended up in third place in Sunday s first round vote The candidates appealing to Russian speaking voters in Ukraine s south eastern regions failed to unite The most popular among them Yuriy Boiko came fourth 
APR2	May’s failure to tackle Tory Islamophobia sends a dangerous message	Theresa May and the Conservative party are refusing to take the action needed to tackle the growing problem of Islamophobia and anti Muslim sentiment among Tory members and politicians and in our wider society At a time when hate crime against all minority communities is rising and when far right extremism is a growing problem they simply must not be allowed to get away with it  Just over two weeks ago people around the world were left heartbroken and scared when innocent people were murdered in a terrorist attack in Christchurch New Zealand for no reason other than their faith 
APR2	Jacinda Ardern’s grief should not eclipse that of Muslims	Since the Christchurch terror attack much of the focus has been not on the mourning of New Zealand s Muslim community but on white people This has been repeated across the west and in parts of the Middle East Jacinda Ardern s face was projected on to the outside of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai days after the attack  The prime minister s response to the shooting has indeed been exemplary but the reaction to it has left little space for the victims or the wider Muslim community in New Zealand or around the world While many of us are still coming to terms with the events that happened in Christchurch I have seen more pictures of Ardern s grief and mourning than of the Muslim community in New Zealand the victims or those who acted bravely on the day to save lives and fight against the terrorist 
APR2	Rees-Mogg and the AfD’s Alice Weidel have a lot in common – all of it nasty	My first reaction on hearing that Jacob Rees Mogg had retweeted a video by the populist German Alternative f r Deutschland AfD was Well that figures And not just because the AfD is the nasty party in German politics and because Rees Mogg represents the faction that wants the Conservatives to remain the nasty party in Britain One of the driving forces behind the AfD is a very German inferiority complex regarding the second world war Rees Mogg with his foppish retro look and accent embodies the Britain that German nationalists think they lost the war to A Britain they despise envy and admire in almost equal measure  What binds Alice Weidel to a party of older white males is her almost pathological hatred of foreigners
APR2	Government can’t regulate Facebook – it’s up to all of us	I didn t see this coming but I agree with Mark Zuckerberg The Facebook chief executive has called for more government regulation of the internet And what he has said is pretty sensible if a little light on detail The four areas Zuckerberg wants governments to regulate more are harmful content election integrity privacy and data portability I know what you re thinking isn t Zuck just passing the buck Hasn t his company very publicly failed to tackle all of the issues he s saying it s up to governments to fix You re not wrong The four areas he s concerned about do happen to overlap with recent Facebook scandals But that doesn t mean his announcement isn t good news  Big companies hardly ever call for more regulation It sometimes feels as if people in Silicon Valley view laws and indeed nation states as some quaint th century tech that will disappear in a few years like CDs or fax machines Businesses such as Uber and Facebook pride themselves on being disruptors arguing the existing rules are too outdated to apply to them at all And until now they haven t been keen on any new rules to replace the old ones The change of heart should be welcomed 
APR2	How Gary Lineker and Luciana Berger helped me take the fight to the trolls	I remember the day I joined Twitter On the set of The Infidel in May I d been telling Omid Djalili and the Davids Baddiel and Schneider that I didn t have a Facebook account and all social media was a pointless waste of time On the spot they signed me up to this newish site saying You ll love this it s fun And to be fair it was With just characters you had to be pithy and bright Here was a site that had all the enjoyment of being invited to the best party in town full of the funniest most well informed people on the planet from all walks of life All this without having to leave the house It was addictive  I barely received a single negative tweet If anything unsavoury did come my way abuse or dick pics I just pressed the block button 
APR3	Muslims and Jews face a common threat from white supremacists. We must fight it together	The two of us have been having the exact same conversation for the past decade About antisemitism and Islamophobia One of us a Muslim the other a Jew we have conducted it in public and in private on Twitter and on TV We ve agreed we ve argued we ve even wandered off topic to trade tips on how to get through a fast Now we ve come together because of the urgent and common threat that we face Both of our communities are under violent attack from far right white supremacists  In Christchurch New Zealand last month a white supremacist gunned down Muslims at prayer In Pittsburgh Pennsylvania last October a white supremacist gunned down Jews at prayer Both killers were clear in their loathing of both Jews and Muslims Both subscribed to the great replacement theory which casts Muslims and other minorities as invaders of western societies and a threat to white Christian majorities In this narrative the supposed invasion is a wicked plot orchestrated by the same hidden hand behind all malign events through world history the Jews The point was put concisely in an online remark reposted by the Pittsburgh murderer It s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country 
APR3	Britain needs a Brexit compromise. Forging one could be the making of Corbyn’s Labour	The national tragedy of Brexit sweeps on In the end Theresa May s opening to Jeremy Corbyn to help solve it may prove to have been just another brief episode in its awful unfolding But even the greatest tragedies occasionally have space for epic moments of boldness and inspiration when a moment can be seized and an outcome reshaped This could perhaps be one of them  The appeal to Labour may soon prove to be little more than another of the tactical feints that May sometimes attempts in search of a Brexit solution Through thick and thin the prime minister has doggedly tried to get her deal through with Conservative and DUP votes Occasionally though she has tacked a little towards the centre When she does her main motive seems to be to frighten her rebel rightwingers back into her hard Brexit pen rather than to reveal any lurking centrist convictions or because she accepts she has no alternative 
APR3	Could Macron knock Britain out of the EU next week?	Brexit has been blocked by the most head banging of Brexiteers Leavers are now hoping for a sweet paradox of their own They are looking to President Emmanuel Macron a remainer super hero to boot Britain out of the European Union next week  Recent remarks made by the French president suggested that he might summon the spirit of Charles de Gaulle vintage and and veto come what May extended British membership of the EU at the Brussels summit on April 
APR3	So Brits have a lot of sex on drugs – why?	The news that Brits are the greatest practitioners of sex on drugs in the western world may have come as a surprise to you but only if you ve never paid attention to the amorous preamble which takes place in our pubs clubs and private dinner parties on a Friday night  In an extensive Guardian survey five years ago of those surveyed admitted to taking drugs to improve their sex life Now people have voluntarily informed the Global Drug Survey of their occasional to habitual predilections for combining alcohol cocaine MDMA and a raft of other substances with sexual activity 
APR3	Joe Biden's policies are as troubling as his inappropriate touching	As the Democratic primary heats up Joe Biden who hasn t even formally declared yet is the latest candidate in the hot seat At issue his handsiness which is generally notorious and specifically detailed by Nevada politician Lucy Flores his moderate policies which seem painfully out of touch in today s Democratic party and the promise that his supporters make which is that he s the only candidate who can defeat Donald Trump  One thing is clear Joe Biden is the wrong candidate for 
APR3	If only bums on glass was the oddest thing to happen in parliament this week	People pressed their semi naked bums on the gallery glass in the House of Commons and had to be peeled off by police and it still wasn t the stupidest thing that happened in parliament this week  On Monday the night that parliament was supposed to take back control protest group Extinction Rebellion got into the gallery took their kit off and tried to stick a variety of body parts to the glass turning the House of Commons into some kind of X rated human zoo 
APR3	James Corden is right: chubby bodies like mine should not be confined to radio	James Corden has reminded us this week that chubby actors rarely get cast as romantic leads I can confirm that this has most definitely been the case with me the offers have been very thin on the ground indeed I have only had one film role playing myself as the host of a sex party in the in my view unfairly maligned film Sex Lives of the Potato Men The sight of me clad only in an ungenerous towel was enough to convince this viewer for one that naked chubby men have no place in any form of mainstream entertainment  So since I couldn t bear the sight of myself how can I agree with James But I do it s just mad The Channel programme Naked Attraction has been widely excoriated as brainless smut But it does have the merit of being just about the only place on film or television you can see ordinary human forms in a state of undress 
APR3	I helped stop a far-right terror plot. Are UK police ready for the next one?	Robbie Mullen joined the neo Nazi group National Action in He d been impressed by what he had seen of it in the media He was angry at the world And he was in search of friends But he contacted the organisation I work for Hope not Hate in April when he realised that National Action was turning to terrorism He came to us because unlike the authorities we d never stopped going after the group after it was banned by the home secretary in December  Robbie s story of how he came to be a member of National Action how he foiled Jack Renshaw s plot to murder an MP and how he has been treated by the authorities can tell us so much about the threat posed by the far right today 
APR3	Don’t celebrate more domestic flights, Chris Grayling. Think of the planet	It s not hard to see why Chris Grayling jumped at the opportunity to visit Heathrow airport early on Tuesday to welcome passengers landing on a dreary morning at Terminal He was marking the launch of an air service from Flybe which will now be operating four return flights from Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall to London seven days a week  This is a transport secretary made famous for his inability to actually transport things whether that be people by train or goods over water he s even managed to stop cyclists making it safely from A to B and so for Grayling a plane on a new flightpath taking off and landing on time is a much needed chance to claim an easy win and arrange a photo op 
APR3	Look past the May-Corbyn Brexit talks. There’s another solution	The objections to Theresa May s th hour offer to work with Labour on Brexit are obvious It goes without saying that this is not how the process should have ended but how it should have begun the day after the referendum or at the very least the day after the June election wiped out May s Commons majority Instead Brexit has been like one of those high end artworks where the narrative runs backwards Think of it as Brexit in the style of Harold Pinter s Betrayal to pick a play whose title the hard Brexiters might find bleakly resonant in which first comes the triggering of article and two years of negotiations with Brussels followed by cross party talks to find a parliamentary consensus when it clearly should have been the other way around  Equally obvious is that if Brexiters are looking for someone to blame for this development they need to look in the mirror May is only compelled to seek Labour s help in taking Britain out of the European Union because the Tory votes in the Commons were not there Brexit was on offer but the Brexiters repeatedly refused to vote for it because it wasn t Brexity enough for their tastes They re now crying betrayal accusing May of making Jeremy Corbyn the de facto prime minister but this situation is entirely on them It s their fault 
APR4	How Labour can resolve the Brexit crisis – and tear down the Tories too	Consider this scenario The Brexit national crisis is resolved on terms that protect the economy and hard won workers rights The national conversation moves on to the NHS remember that child poverty and housing Another referendum more poisonous and bitter than the last and one that could easily be won by leave all over again polling currently shows more people would prefer to leave without a deal than to stay in the EU outside of London and Scotland is avoided A transformative government comes to power which rips up a four decade old market fundamentalist experiment that has been an endless generator of insecurity and social turmoil The Conservative party which for entirely partisan ends has brought chaos and humiliation to Britain is torn asunder ejected from office for a generation  This could be the prize if Labour agreed a deal with the Tories that forced Theresa May to reject her party s red lines There are the obvious pitfalls to be navigated May using the talks to run down the clock or to displace responsibility for a national calamity of the Conservatives own making to Labour or to provide a pretext for a long extension that torments the Brexiteers Every promise would have to be written in legislation and passed by the House of Commons or be simply tossed on a bonfire by May s hard right successor Labour agreeing to any deal with May will cause a paroxysm of fury from those remainers who understandably anguished by this wretched mess will be satisfied by no less than another referendum 
APR4	Joe Biden’s inappropriate touching is the embodiment of male privilege	We tell our children to let us know if a grownup touches them in a way that they don t like or makes them feel uncomfortable don t we Although we also then plonk them on the laps of strange men in fake beards and suggest they tell them their secrets The whole Santa Claus thing has always been extremely weird and you often see little ones far from enchanted and actually scared by this tradition  But do we afford grown women the same privilege of being able to express unease at the way some men touch us and make us feel uncomfortable Not really We don t want to make a fuss Nothing that bad happened thank you for not sexually assaulting us is so much the internalised female default that many women tolerate a range of creepiness from men who plead ignorance about what they are doing 
APR4	Europe is a dysfunctional family, but divorce is not the answer	For years Axel Scheffler the German born illustrator of The Gruffalo has made his home and his career in Britain His contribution to the lives of millions of our children has been simply immense If we leave Europe his hitherto guaranteed right to call the UK his home is under threat Can we imagine how this affects his life how it makes him feel And how do we feel that such a circumstance might yet come to pass in our country This man is a treasured friend to us and to our children We have to think again and think hard  The European Union as we know it now was created after the second world war by France and Germany to ensure peace and prosperity There was a determination that war should be no more They had good enough reason In the preceding years there had been many wars between these two countries the last two catastrophic not just to them but to us in the UK and to people all over the world There has been peace in Europe since mostly And democracy mostly And for many people though not enough there has also been great prosperity Peace and prosperity and democracy these are fine aims for us and our children 
APR4	It’s gender pay gap reporting day. Treat claims of progress with a pinch of salt	Wouldn t it be neat if we could put a number on gender inequality If we could quantitatively measure the challenge women face every day to be treated on a par with their male counterparts financially socially and culturally Then we could track precise progress numerically and hold ourselves accountable undeniably because statistics are great like that They don t lie and they don t tell half truths  Except unfortunately when they do 
APR4	Ddu-du you know? English is losing its grip as the language of pop	A band has attained a certain stature when its world tour consists of an imperial sweep through four continents with just half a dozen concerts in each The South Korea based girl group Blackpink are currently midway through just such a jaunt next month they arrive in Europe to play six dates London and Manchester included  Remarkably this high visibility procession is the first time the K pop quartet have toured outside Korea or Japan more remarkable still they ve released just one album and a scant handful of tracks and while they ve made English language videos most of their material is in Korean or Japanese Nonetheless they re adored by a worldwide fanbase for whom language is no barrier Recent industry figures underline the strength of the global music market with some suggesting the place of the English language at the forefront of pop is diminishing 
APR4	Chernobyl’s disastrous cover-up is a warning for the next nuclear age	In the Soviet minister of hydrometeorology Yuri Izrael had a regrettable decision to make It was his job to track radioactivity blowing from the smoking Chernobyl reactor in the hours after the April explosion and deal with it Forty eight hours after the accident an assistant handed him a roughly drawn map On it an arrow shot north east from the nuclear power plant and broadened to become a river of air miles wide that was surging across Belarus toward Russia If the slow moving mass of radioactive clouds reached Moscow where a spring storm front was piling up millions could be harmed Izrael s decision was easy Make it rain  So that day in a Moscow airport technicians loaded artillery shells with silver iodide Soviet air force pilots climbed into the cockpits of TU bombers and made the easy one hour flight to Chernobyl where the reactor burned The pilots circled following the weather They flew km chasing the inky black billows of radioactive waste When they caught up with a cloud they shot jets of silver iodide into it to emancipate the rain 
APR4	How should Britain commemorate a world war? Include the uncomfortable parts too	Vera Brittain in her moving autobiography Testament of Youth recalled that when the sounds of victory burst over London on November men and women alike did not proclaim victory but simply said with relief The war is over And yet in so many ways and for so many people it would never be over For the bereaved like Brittain herself pain would continue for the rest of their lives while for the survivors of the battlefields there would be constant reminders physically and mentally of their terrible experiences  Nor did conflict and war end for everyone in November This was after all not a war to end all war as was so easily proclaimed in Nor did the peace settlement solve very much in the longer run The collapse of empires in central and eastern Europe paved the way for a much more unstable political world with the advent of national and independence struggles and revolution while the isolationism of the United States undermined the broader ambitions for a new international world order 
APR4	This US supreme court ruling on how a man must die is a study in cruelty	When does the execution of a prisoner cross a line and become cruel and unusual In the strange world of the US death penalty that is an all important legal question The US constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishments but condemned prisoners seeking relief have to prove their executions meet this definition as opposed to just being painful  This week the US supreme court handed down a ruling that sought to clarify what manner of execution would meet constitutional standards of cruelty and unusualness The court s answer Disembowelling 
APR4	Muslims and Jews face a common threat from white supremacists. We must fight it together	The two of us have been having the exact same conversation for the past decade About antisemitism and Islamophobia One of us a Muslim the other a Jew we have conducted it in public and in private on Twitter and on TV We ve agreed we ve argued we ve even wandered off topic to trade tips on how to get through a fast Now we ve come together because of the urgent and common threat that we face Both of our communities are under violent attack from far right white supremacists  In Christchurch New Zealand last month a white supremacist gunned down Muslims at prayer In Pittsburgh Pennsylvania last October a white supremacist gunned down Jews at prayer Both killers were clear in their loathing of both Jews and Muslims Both subscribed to the great replacement theory which casts Muslims and other minorities as invaders of western societies and a threat to white Christian majorities In this narrative the supposed invasion is a wicked plot orchestrated by the same hidden hand behind all malign events through world history the Jews The point was put concisely in an online remark reposted by the Pittsburgh murderer It s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country 
APR4	Why did Trump say his dad was German? He lies so much he doesn’t know the truth	The world can be a confusing place for Donald Trump  There are so many countries some of them of the shithole variety some less so It can be fiendishly hard to keep track of all the comings and goings of all the people who just show up at the door of your golf club or your border claiming to have a good reason to enter 
APR5	The lesson of this Brexit ordeal? The EU is a club worth belonging to	Consider it preparation for a self sufficient future after Brexit now our politics generates its own satire with metaphors included On Thursday the proceedings of the House of Commons came to a halt because the roof was leaking  The New York Times ran a story headlined Parliament really is broken The Commons press office put out a statement clarifying that this was not a sewage leak 
APR5	The People’s Vote campaign is about Brexit, not patching up broken parties	The People s Vote campaign has always been strictly non partisan and the cause is bigger than any allegiance to any political party This is its biggest strength Now more than ever it is vital that this remains the case  On Monday in a series of indicate votes in parliament a People s Vote damn nearly fell off the list of options when Labour MPs voted for a customs union Members of the Independent Group like me voted against it primarily because it will not deliver the frictionless trade British business demands being one step up from a ruinous hard Brexit The Liberal Democrats split on the matter but the SNP and Green MP saw the trap that had been laid and joined us in the no lobby Had we not the customs union option would have won a majority and the campaign would have fallen by the wayside In the event a motion for a confirmatory public vote was defeated but it gained the most votes of all the options put forward on Monday and a second referendum remains the only way out of the Brexit crisis 
APR5	Fleabag has gloriously affirmed every woman’s right to screw up in style	It isn t just because of the hot priest Although to be honest the hot priest does have quite a lot to do with it But the other reason almost every woman I know is gripped by the bittersweet BBC comedy Fleabag is that there s something so exhilarating about its attitude to women getting things wrong Its heroine leads an intensely interesting life but a faintly disappointing one at least in the eyes of her well to do family she is the classic underachieving younger sister the screw up the damaged one always on the verge of doing or saying something inappropriate Compared with older sister Claire she of the hysterically uptight manner creepy husband and tediously successful corporate career she s a mess  Yet nobody watching this really wants to be Claire Fleabag s habit of needily seeking sex from all the wrong people looks significantly more fun than her sister s miserable compromise of a marriage and even her financially precarious cafe business beats sitting in Claire s enormous office fretting about keeping the clients happy 
APR5	May is seeking a short extension to Brexit. How utterly contemptuous	There are only so many times you can or should give someone the benefit of the doubt In asking Donald Tusk and the European council for a ludicrous pointless extension just until June Theresa May has surrendered any right to be seen as a prime minister acting in good faith  The truth is that the last five months have been by far the worst in modern British politics Because of May From the moment that she pulled the vote on her withdrawal agreement because she knew that our democratic institutions would not consent to it she has consistently placed her own narrow interests above those of this country She has ignored and misled parliament She has acted as a demagogue giving licence to those who threaten and harass MPs She has burned bridges with our European partners and has treated the British people with contempt 
APR5	Go on, EU, ban the ‘veggie burger’ – it will be a blessing for vegans	Famously Jacob Rees Mogg has never cooked in his life But do not be surprised if this summer you see him on the news ordering a brace of carrots from a confused greengrocer before spatchcocking an aubergine and provocatively mincing an onion to snub the European parliament which has announced plans to ban meat free products from using any terminology commonly associated with meat No more bean burgers no more cauliflower steaks no more seitan ribs  MEPs will vote on the agricultural committee s recommendations in May urged on by the French socialist MEP ric Andrieu who insists People need to know what they are eating Similar laws exist in France and Missouri and at first glance seem reasonable enough 
APR5	Holidays and arms deals with Brunei don’t trump gay people’s right to exist	Gay lives either matter or they don t Declaring that you support LGBTQ rights is cost free so is wrapping yourself in the rainbow flag smiling at a same sex couple publicly holding hands with that Good for you look in your eyes or waving on a Pride parade with your kids But what happens when a dictatorship allied to Britain and linked to the British establishment announces that it will stone gay people to death and torture lesbians  A protest outside the Dorchester on Saturday should be well attended it will shame and embarrass this grubby regime
APR5	The joys (and pains) of living alone	 Hell is other people wrote Jean Paul Sartre in a quote whose meaning has been the subject of hot debate ever since Some say it should be taken literally some clever dicks say it s more about the loss of identity we suffer via the company of others But are we absolutely sure he wasn t referring to his chambre mate who ate the last of his Cathedral City Because that is seriously annoying  We may never know what prompted his existential zinger but what we do know is that the number of people living alone is rising fast at least in the UK According to the Office for National Statistics the figure went up by as much as between and and will hit million people by That s a lot of unanswered honey I m home s But as someone who lives alone I can attest to the joys of such an arrangement And so with apologies to the genuinely brilliant housemates I had for many years who could reasonably see this as a needlessly passive aggressive revenge article and with apologies to my temporary cohabitee Dan who is clean considerate and coherent the three Cs here are six reasons why living solo is easily the best thing I ve ever done bar none 
APR5	Either way, it’s just not Brexit: pro-leave MPs like me must reject May’s false choice	To a leave voter it is a false choice to say we either sign the withdrawal agreement or we delay our exit from the EU Neither of these is Brexit  The prime minister seems to think if she keeps making that the choice pro Brexit MPs will eventually cave in and vote for her withdrawal agreement As Keir Starmer tellingly said the agreement stays the same but the threats used day to day and person to person are different The government has both told Labour they need to vote for it to avoid a no deal exit and told Conservatives they need to vote for it to avoid a delay or no Brexit at all 
APR5	Failing healthcare in jails is killing female prisoners	Those in prison and other places of detention are entitled to a standard of healthcare equivalent to that offered in the community as established in both national and international guidelines Yet the inquest into the death of Annabella Landsberg concluded on Thursday that her death was contributed to by serious failures at HMP Peterborough including the absence of diabetic care that is readily available in local health services  The work of Inquest the charity I m a director of shows that prisons consistently fail to provide care and support for physical and mental ill health But these state failures begin far beyond prison walls 
APR5	A room of one’s own? Today’s writers can’t afford such a luxury	A room of one s own Endless biscuits Coffee democracy a cleaner an osteopath reliable wifi and an ergonomic chair with lumbar support These are some of the things that contemporary authors say they need in order to write  These requirements have been shared in response to a new survey from the Royal Society of Literature which will be published to mark the th anniversary of Virginia Woolf s A Room of One s Own Woolf said that a woman needed a year and a lock on the door in order to stand a chance as a writer of fiction and not much seems to have changed since then 
APR6	If identity politics is a force for good, how does white nationalism fit in?	 You turned the issue on its head someone said to me after I gave a talk on identity politics in Melbourne last week I ve never thought of it that way round It always was on its head I said to her It s just that we ve never noticed  I ve been in Australia over the past week talking among other things about the politics of identity The issue has in the wake of the Christchurch mosque massacres acquired new resonance The gunman who has been charged in a New Zealand court with counts of murder was Australian It has led to much soul searching about white nationalism and its roots and about the role of mainstream media and politics in fuelling hatred 
APR6	For me, fear about drug supplies is real. I could go blind	Matt Hancock has his fridges They ll see us through won t they They have to The alternatives don t bear thinking about A year ago in a busy neuro ophthalmology clinic I steeled myself to ask what would happen to me after Brexit Let s hope it doesn t come to that the neurologist said stuffing my paperwork years of terror and hope back into my NHS file It wasn t a particularly useful answer but it was the best I was going to get  I am registered blind I have crion chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuritis an autoimmune disorder affecting the optic nerve and I have lost all sight in one eye Limited vision in the other is maintained with daily steroids and infusions of IVIg intravenous immunoglobulin which I receive every weeks 
APR6	Oh do look at the tin-pot Brexiters, having their moment in the spotlight	Sick of Brexit Yeah me too Partly because it becomes clearer with each chaotic day that for some of the second tier Brexit ultras no one much cares about Mark Francois Steve Baker Andrew Bridgen Bernard Jenkin et al this is the most attention they ve ever had and are ever likely to get in their sad blustering self important lives While it s Remainers who are supposed to be the soppy drama queens just look at this bunch flapping about the media mouth breathing through their camera time sparkly eyed with their own significance Brexit as a debilitating national crisis Hardly They ve never felt so alive  It s increasingly difficult to ignore the fact that some very unimpressive politicos appear to be having a good Brexit achieving a prominence that until now not so mysteriously eluded them When the likes of Boris Johnson scuttled off to perfect leadership bids a vacuum appeared and into it swooped who s that characters to variously spray sub military spittle flecked drivel into television cameras Francois rant about bulldozing Westminster Baker brag about refusing to compromise Bridgen and wail about no deal all of the above Politically they re hardened Brexiters having their moment but a dark psychological subtext also hints at near nonentities lapping up the attention they ve long craved 
APR6	Britney Spears and a civilised response to her mental health	When Britney Spears shaved her head and took an umbrella to a paparazzo s car in the events of a night turned into a circus like spectacle gobbled up by a bloodthirsty audience When a few months later she was taken into psychiatric care photographers jostled and pushed around the ambulance trying to snatch an image of the singer in obvious distress adding the flashes of their cameras to the flashing lights of the emergency vehicle An episode of South Park that was broadcast in Britney s New Look offered a surprisingly furious satirical riposte famous young women become sacrifices for a baying crowd who nitpick at every flaw literally hounding their target to death  What a difference a decade can make Last week Spears posted a quote on her Instagram page Fall in love with taking care of yourself mind body spirit along with a caption that read We all need to take time for a little me time followed by a smiley face It was timed to coincide with reports that she had checked herself into a mental health facility for days This news has been unaccompanied by frenzy or hysteria Instead though widely reported and unpicked it has been treated with something approaching respect and certainly a wider understanding of the situation The messages of love and support posted by fans seem supportive and empathetic the tabloid reports relatively muted and factual 
APR6	The sex revolution of my youth wasn’t so great. Maybe today’s celibacy is a sign of progress	In in the so called summer of love hippies drug dealers and the homeless young filled San Francisco s Haight Ashbury saturated with the scent of incense and dope Flower power love and peace were visibly fraying into psychedelic seediness I was a British student on a full grant travelling by Greyhound bus I had stopped off in California to see what the revolution was all about  While I dressed the part mini skirt and silver boots the s for me until then had been identical to that experienced by the poet Michelene Wandor full of people I didn t sleep with joints I didn t smoke plays I wasn t in On this particular afternoon a heavily bearded male not much interested in personal hygiene and festooned in beads stopped me in the street Wanna ball he asked speculatively So much for free love I politely declined 
APR6	James Corden as Mr Darcy is more likely than a fat British politician taking high office	James Corden the celebrity wit and actor complains with justice of discrimination against chubby artists like himself  They are never cast straightforwardly in romantic roles A visiting alien could he says easily get the impression supposing it relied on films for information that if you are chubby or fat or big you never really fall in love you never have sex He s right You d need a heart of stone not to mourn the loss assuming that more conventionally handsome actors can t be made to step aside of say James Corden s Vronsky James Corden s Heathcliff and or Mr Darcy James Corden reminding us in a remake of Brokeback Mountain just how long audiences have had to tolerate the unconscionable tyranny on screen of the beautiful and muscular 
APR6	Another young life failed by what now passes for justice in Scotland	Successive Holyrood administrations have provided a dizzying array of legislative bells and whistles to make Scots feel all warm and pure They are all well meaning of course but some were tinged by a degree of sanctimonious self indulgence such as the named person proposals and sank accordingly A similar fate lay in store for the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act which was badly drafted and ridiculed out of court by judges who grew weary of clumsy attempts by police to criminalise innocent young men guilty of nothing more than singing dodgy songs and waving political flags  Occasionally cracks become apparent in this carefully constructed liberal facade and through them we are granted a glimpse of something more sinister Curiously these appear in the realm of crime and punishment a jurisdiction in which Conservatives are usually to be found fulfilling their fantasies 
APR6	We can cry for Alan Kurdi, but living migrants get no pity	The Alan Kurdi picked up migrants last Wednesday Neither Italy nor Malta will allow the ship to dock It s the latest standoff between national authorities and migrant rescue boats in the Med  The policy of zero tolerance towards undocumented migrants is borrowed from Australia The current centre right coalition in Canberra came to power in promising to stop the boats of asylum seekers A military operation Operation Sovereign Borders was set up to intercept migrant boats Posters boasted No Way You Will Not Make Australia Home 
APR6	May I have a word about… hubs, upticks and spikes	How insidiously certain words inveigle themselves into everyday discourse Take hub which in my day meant the centre of a wheel No longer Just consider these from recent press reports   Cromer tennis club member slams toffs of north Norfolk over m sports hub plans Shiseido opens m research hub in Japan to spur creativity and collaboration Scandalous waste Council spent m on business hub worth m Anger over claims that new bus hub that threatens local businesses is for greater good Jack Sargeant AM gathers cross party support for Heathrow Logistics Hub bid 
APR6	Luton’s cabbies are giving Brexit Britain a lesson in political courage	For a lesson in how politics should be done don t look at Westminster as politicians um and ah and slump into their umpteenth mutinous Brexit stalemate Instead head miles north to Luton airport where a bunch of minicab drivers are getting on with the real business of politics battling to improve their and others lives And in a few weeks they will make history for the right reasons  The fight of these odd drivers for Addison Lee looks nothing like the zombie politics of parliament These aren t English public schoolboys waging decades old grudge matches but working class cabbies almost all of Asian origin They don t lunch with top journalists but worry about how they re going to afford the family s groceries And their politicking is done not inside a Gothic debating chamber but over post shift Happy Meals 
APR7	Brexit may destroy parties. So what? It’s the country that matters	There is a much disputed legend that when the conquistador Francisco Pizarro first approached the shores of South America the indigenous peoples were so psychologically overwhelmed by the scale and alien nature of his ships that they saw only inexplicable ripples in the ocean  Accurate or not the tale has unhappy resonance in Westminster this week Far from rising to a historic challenge the political class seems paralysed by the terrifying proximity of Brexit taking refuge in the comparative trivia of party and factional politics instead of addressing with clarity and courage the greatest prospective change since the second world war in our institutional economic and social arrangements 
APR7	Bulldozing mosques: the latest tactic in China’s war against Uighur culture	Ten years ago I started researching Islam among the Uighurs I spent my summers travelling around the Xinjiang region in western China I took long bus journeys through the desert to Kashgar Yarkand and Kucha slept on brick beds in family homes in remote villages stopped off at Sufi shrines and visited many many mosques My husband was working with me and we dragged our kids along for the ride The kids were quite small and not at all interested in our boring interviews with imams and I bribed them with treats I have a lot of photos of them sitting in the dust outside mosques faces smeared with ice cream playing on their iPads  It was an incredible time for mosque building in Xinjiang After the Cultural Revolution Uighur and Kazakh Muslims began to reconnect with their faith They resumed the traditional practices of pilgrimage and festivals at the shrines that lie deep in the Taklamakan desert They began to learn about Islam in the wider world people who could afford it travelled to Mecca for the hajj and they began to rebuild their mosques As local communities grew richer they invested in bigger and more beautiful mosques people crowded into them for Friday prayers and they served as living symbols of community identity and pride 
APR7	Netanyahu’s fearmongering is working. Israelis have forgotten how to hope	I work in the Israeli industry of melancholy and I didn t even know it Luckily over a year ago the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu boldly exposed this enterprise and helped me and my coworkers realise that we are part of it In several scoffing speeches and a memorable photograph in which he was beaming like only truly happy people do his left arm resting on a can of pickles which in Hebrew denotes sourpusses Bibi saw through us and showed us for the whiners that we are Now with elections looming even a taxi ride reflects his insight Look at the traffic to the airport at the bustling cafes my driver told me Life is good Bibi is great what are you leftists complaining about all the time My response could only betray that I am indeed a kvetch  Discarding such relics as a political platform under Netanyahu the Likud s party line is party time while centre left contenders try to fathom how to urge voters to opt for real change without saying things are really bad And in a way they are Even without Israel s year occupation and retreating democracy security concerns social rifts struggling health and transportation systems and the high cost of living make Netanyahu s plea for glee look incongruous 
APR7	In May’s home county, Tory problems run much deeper than Brexit	 It s a shithole she said It s supposed to be Theresa May s area and I m not being funny but would you want to live here  I ve seen worse places I said 
APR7	Facebook is asking to be regulated but wants to choose how	A year on from the Cambridge Analytica scandal two and a half years on from the advent of fake news and the presidential elections and many years on from academics and occasional journalists raising their hands in concern about the emerging issues of our information environment are we any closer to fixing the problem  Like climate change and the financial system the answer to this question is both yes and no Yes in that we now at least have a shared understanding of just how great the problems are we have a totally unregulated media environment run by a handful of giant US corporations that built their companies so fast it is now clear they had no idea what they were doing Or indeed how to effectively stop some of the unwanted consequences such as genocide live streamed terror attacks and stolen elections And no in that our capacity to agree on what fixing might look like is extremely limited 
APR7	‘Creepy Joe’ Biden made women uneasy. Sorry shouldn’t be the hardest word	Joe Biden doesn t do apologies The former US vice president and leading but still not formally announced candidate for president sympathises and empathises He understands and reaches out He shares But he doesn t say he s sorry  This has never been a big deal given his famous agreeableness his easygoing manner and his much touted common touch For a guy who sometimes comes across more like an overgrown puppy than a potential commander in chief it might even have seemed an asset to stand his ground and show a little spine But over the last week after eight women have accused Biden of inappropriate touching aka handsiness his no apology stance has turned into a very big deal 
APR7	Theresa May, I’d gladly never see your boat race again	In the quest to understand Theresa May which capricious fate has imposed on us all the key is to think of James Cracknell At time of writing Thursday the year old is expected to take part in Sunday s Boat Race and the year old is expected to be Sunday s prime minister The former expectation seems marginally more solid than the latter but both are likelier than not  Before then of course Theresa May may announce or should that be might Theresa Might may announce no May may announce her intention to step down Then again she s announced her intention to step down a couple of times already But May may have announced her intention to step down again Possibly more than once 
APR7	The Boeing scandal is an indictment of Trump’s corporate America	America First nationalism indulgent free market economics Republican libertarianism and a political system in hock to corporate lobbying has just contributed to killing innocent people The more we know about the crashes of Boeing Max planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia after anti stalling devices locked both aircraft into unrecoverable nose dives the more shocking the story becomes  It is not just Boeing a once magnificent company that is being condemned it is the US s wider economic political and regulatory structures What is not required is a short term software fix on the faulty MCAS system that automatically adjusts the plane s flight trajectory along with an improved safety manual and training for pilots which is Boeing s response so far What is needed is a root and branch overhaul of the intersection between capitalism and democracy in the US The current set up and the accompanying libertarian anti state anti regulation philosophy literally kills people 
APR7	If identity politics is a force for good, how does white nationalism fit in?	 You turned the issue on its head someone said to me after I gave a talk on identity politics in Melbourne last week I ve never thought of it that way round It always was on its head I said to her It s just that we ve never noticed  I ve been in Australia over the past week talking among other things about the politics of identity The issue has in the wake of the Christchurch mosque massacres acquired new resonance The gunman who has been charged in a New Zealand court with counts of murder was Australian It has led to much soul searching about white nationalism and its roots and about the role of mainstream media and politics in fuelling hatred 
APR7	Should democracies leave voters to their handheld devices?	It feels urgent with elections approaching in several democracies to focus on lessons from when the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election were both marred in ways still coming to light Among several valuable reports a recent study for the European parliament s Panel for the Future of Science and Technology usefully encapsulates the challenges without unremitting alarmism and pessimism It is clear eyed about both the benefits and dangers to democracies of technologies that are in the handheld devices of most voters  Against a backdrop of increasing polarisation new digital technologies have taken centre stage in political processes both as a source of information and a campaigning platform says the study Polarisation and the use of technology in political campaigns and communication Such new and relatively unregulated platforms create new opportunities for nefarious actors to deliberately push false content and distort information flows for political gain But artificial intelligence will also offer new opportunities for better accountability and transparency 
APR8	Should Labour support a second Brexit referendum?	I didn t come easily to the position of supporting another vote on leaving the EU I resisted for more than a year for a number of reasons The main reason was that my constituency was a leave majority but also I found some of the arguments and rhetoric of the campaign for a People s Vote arrogant It was some way distant from my experience of leave voters The people where I live are not stupid they are not racist they are more than capable of looking at the facts presented at any given time and deciding with either their heads hearts or in most cases both what is best for them and their families  The facts of course have changed We now know much more about what is on offer The political class has been forced to remember that Northern Ireland exists and has come face to face with the reality of leaving an institution we have become completely integrated with 
APR8	Britain is in a grimmer state than I can ever remember	The mood has turned nastier since I first visited the Big Help Project food bank in Knowsley Merseyside two years ago Back then the Brexit poison hadn t seeped so deep But now when the call goes out for food donations to feed its clients things have changed says Peter Mitchell the project leader I get people asking Is this food for British people I never used to hear that never It s hideous it makes my blood boil  How does he reply I say this food is for hungry people He sighs heavily Brexit did this It gives permission to copy Farage and Trump to say things they never used to say He points to the rising racism in football with a coconut thrown at a black player over the weekend It makes you despair Brexit is doing this to us 
APR8	Don't dread the European elections – they could fix our broken politics	After months and months of picking over the minutiae of negotiations in parliament and beyond the UK is tired of Brexit I know I am you take one day off from following the ins and outs and even though nothing has changed for weeks you re somehow behind You know it s important but watching politicians and commentators trade macho insults is incredibly tedious And now there could be European elections on the cards  A European election might seem like a distraction when it can t deliver what the country desperately needs a general election and with it a new government that will fund our schools so they aren t at the point of collapse and design an economy where the norm is not plummeting living standards and rising homelessness 
APR8	The Windrush compensation scheme adds serious insult to serious injury	Sajid Javid the home secretary promised to make things right by the victims of the so called Windrush scandal He now has his chance to live up to the promise but the much needed and welcome compensation scheme announced on Wednesday has some potentially serious flaws  Guidance which runs to pages details all the documents that the people affected will have to present to apply for compensation for the hardships they have endured over many years loss of jobs and income debt homelessness stress physical and mental health problems detention and even deportation 
APR8	Three cheers for Holly Willoughby's refusal to talk about her diet	 It s not up to me to give you a blow by blow account of what I ve eaten that day It s not helpful and it s not what s important Holly Willoughby told the Sunday Times presumably to the cheers of women everywhere  The This Morning presenter s weight loss last year was predictably picked over by the tabloids And Willoughby is used to attention for how she looks she shares her wardrobe with her million Instagram followers daily But she explained that the silence over the issue of her smaller frame has been intentional 
APR8	In May’s home county, Tory problems run much deeper than Brexit	 It s a shithole she said It s supposed to be Theresa May s area and I m not being funny but would you want to live here  I ve seen worse places I said 
APR8	Barack Obama is stuck in the past. He represents the old Democratic party	Barack Obama is worried about the Democratic party This weekend he told a crowd at an Obama Foundation event in Berlin that the party is becoming a circular firing squad targeting those straying from purity on certain issues  Leading figures around the party have indeed moved to the left since he left office two years ago Thanks in no small part to the Bernie Sanders campaign and the rise of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Medicare for All free public higher education a minimum wage and action on climate change have become mainstream positions 
APR8	The secret of Netanyahu’s success? A simple tale of good versus evil	Israel is a land of storytellers Authors such as Amos Oz and David Grossman are acclaimed worldwide and the political thriller Fauda has the nation well and truly addicted But the best storyteller in our country is Benjamin Netanyahu The prime minister s talent allows him to construct a narrative so realistic one could actually believe in it Above all it is his great skill in manipulating characters that makes him transcend mere politics In fact I would hazard a guess that Netanyahu is the best storyteller in the world  The word storyteller might sound disrespectful In the streets where I grew up in the heart of Tel Aviv it was usually used as an insult Jewish mamas want their sons to be doctors not storytellers But storytelling is a very serious business In the case of Netanyahu you could say it s deadly serious 
APR8	Were all your teachers white? I’ve often been the only one who looks like my students	These are banner times for the education system across Australia and North America  The New York Times has revealed that out of almost students admitted into the top selective public school in New York City only seven were black 
APR8	Bulldozing mosques: the latest tactic in China’s war against Uighur culture	Ten years ago I started researching Islam among the Uighurs I spent my summers travelling around the Xinjiang region in western China I took long bus journeys through the desert to Kashgar Yarkand and Kucha slept on brick beds in family homes in remote villages stopped off at Sufi shrines and visited many many mosques My husband was working with me and we dragged our kids along for the ride The kids were quite small and not at all interested in our boring interviews with imams and I bribed them with treats I have a lot of photos of them sitting in the dust outside mosques faces smeared with ice cream playing on their iPads  It was an incredible time for mosque building in Xinjiang After the Cultural Revolution Uighur and Kazakh Muslims began to reconnect with their faith They resumed the traditional practices of pilgrimage and festivals at the shrines that lie deep in the Taklamakan desert They began to learn about Islam in the wider world people who could afford it travelled to Mecca for the hajj and they began to rebuild their mosques As local communities grew richer they invested in bigger and more beautiful mosques people crowded into them for Friday prayers and they served as living symbols of community identity and pride 
APR9	At last, Brexit explained in two words: Basil Fawlty	In a crumbling edifice a farce plays out The hapless central character fawns on an aristocrat who turns out to be a conman He then fails to disguise his unease when confronted with his European neighbours doesn t bother to mask a thorough contempt for the Irish and enters a love hate relationship with ostentatiously wealthy Americans Meanwhile there are questions over food safety and supply specifically kippers duck and veal cutlets as workers scurry around trying to pretend that nothing out of the ordinary is happening Always disaster hovers at the edge of vision  Forty years after the finale of Fawlty Towers which has just been named the UK s best ever situation comedy its eerie prescience seems even more important than the cringing laughter it gifted us For Fawlty Towers was above all an ensemble piece about isolation It was a portrait of rage and frustration an exploration of the impotence that results when the world as we wish it to be is so agonisingly at odds with the world as it is It was the Brexit mindset incubating in the shabby surroundings of a down at heel hotel that had seen far better days 
APR9	Is Brexit still worth it? Only the public can answer that question	Britain is still a member of the EU thanks to people who wished it wasn t Brexit has already been delayed once because MPs who think it should happen voted against the deal that would have made it happen Now Theresa May is going to Brussels to postpone it further Such self thwarting is a feat of slapstick political gymnastics like falling up a flight of stairs  Eurosceptic hardliners don t see it that way of course They believe that May s deal does not qualify as a proper Brexit and would rather leave with no deal at all They also think parliament is stuffed with Europhiles who are obstructing our departure Even then the logical thing for the ultras to do is vote for May s deal then resume agitating for harder severance terms The no deal scenario is a fantasy anyway a utopia of pristine liberation As such it can be revived within days or indeed hours of a deal being ratified Some of the more tactically astute Brexiters have understood that and their cynical pragmatism is causing a split within the Tory European Research Group the cold blooded fanatics are falling out with the hot tempered maniacs 
APR9	It won’t undermine marriage to make divorce easier. It’s simple humanity	He was one husband for the first eight years of their marriage and someone quite different for the next eight  Or so the former Olympic rower James Cracknell whose separation from his partner Beverley Turner was recently announced apparently put it Like most elite athletes he had always been formidably driven obsessive even in pursuit of extreme sporting challenges But a head injury sustained during one of them caused changes to his personality that were clearly hard for everyone in the family including him to live with Arguing about whose fault the breakdown of their marriage was in these circumstances seems ridiculous and petty and yet that s what the law would currently require them to do 
APR9	My young son was 'approached' online. Does that make me a bad parent?	 No one in the world has done this before Jeremy Wright secretary of state for digital culture media and sport said of the government s newly launched internet regulations And it s important that we get it right Perhaps because Wright has kept a low profile in the recent psychedelic months of government it sounded like the first mature and reasonable thing I had heard from a minister in a long time  Sajid Javid meanwhile gave this pugilistic description of the same white paper I m giving tech companies a message that they cannot ignore I warned you and you didn t do enough It s not controversial it s not authoritarian right now we re failing Children leave behind their protection and supervision when they go online to a place that is a hunting ground for monsters 
APR9	Should Labour support a second Brexit referendum?	I didn t come easily to the position of supporting another vote on leaving the EU I resisted for more than a year for a number of reasons The main reason was that my constituency was a leave majority but also I found some of the arguments and rhetoric of the campaign for a People s Vote arrogant It was some way distant from my experience of leave voters The people where I live are not stupid they are not racist they are more than capable of looking at the facts presented at any given time and deciding with either their heads hearts or in most cases both what is best for them and their families  The facts of course have changed We now know much more about what is on offer The political class has been forced to remember that Northern Ireland exists and has come face to face with the reality of leaving an institution we have become completely integrated with 
APR9	Britain is in a grimmer state than I can ever remember	The mood has turned nastier since I first visited the Big Help Project food bank in Knowsley Merseyside two years ago Back then the Brexit poison hadn t seeped so deep But now when the call goes out for food donations to feed its clients things have changed says Peter Mitchell the project leader I get people asking Is this food for British people I never used to hear that never It s hideous it makes my blood boil  How does he reply I say this food is for hungry people He sighs heavily Brexit did this It gives permission to copy Farage and Trump to say things they never used to say He points to the rising racism in football with a coconut thrown at a black player over the weekend It makes you despair Brexit is doing this to us 
APR9	A Brexit compromise is in view. A customs union is the only solution	The gates are sliding shut The options are closing The extremists are refusing to budge and the centre cannot agree The only god is time and she is ticking ever louder  Within the next two days Theresa May must manoeuvre herself a Commons majority behind a deal that will win another Brexit extension from the EU on Wednesday That majority deal is now in full view it would mean the UK leaving the EU with a customs union in place as agreed with Labour This would honour the frankly vague wish of the referendum and it would provide continuity in trade with Europe It is a palpable compromise but for either extreme to present it as a national humiliation or catastrophe is absurd We have been in that customs union without obvious harm for years 
APR9	My brother was fatally stabbed. Don’t let knives become normal	My younger brother Colin was fatally stabbed when he was just in a case of mistaken identity To this day the impact of my brother s death is something that my family and friends still struggle with Sadly since Colin s death in knife crime has continued to rise at an alarming rate  It seems like barely a day goes by without a headline or a piece on the evening news about the tragic loss of young life due to knife crime The coverage is relentless Even at a good secondary academy like the one at which I am a deputy headteacher where knife crime simply isn t an issue I worry about the impact that this continuous stream of reports is having on our young people As teachers we re not doing our jobs properly if we shy away from it our students are hearing about these crimes so their opinions must be heard 
APR9	Mental health problems don't end with age. Older people need help too	After years languishing in the dark mental illness is finally getting its moment in the spotlight Frustrating political football it may be but one thing can t be denied it s making headlines more than ever Focus largely has been on young people crises in child and adolescent mental healthcare and in student populations have been both persistent and significant But mental illness doesn t end with reaching adulthood often in fact it doesn t end at all  New research from the British Journal of Psychiatry into self harm in older people puts this into stark perspective A meta analysis of studies found that yearly self harm rates were about per people with risk of repetition and of suicide also higher than average Self harm is still seen as a problem among younger demographics and while that remains true this data proves that the issue is even more complex and diffuse than we thought 
APR9	Moise Kean’s story shows the far right haunts Italy’s football stadiums	On Saturday Moise Kean a year old footballer born in Italy to Ivorian parents scored his fifth goal in five games playing for the country s biggest team Juventus and its national team The most exciting player to burst on to the Italian football scene for years Kean should have enjoyed an uncomplicated moment of adulation Instead he was put in his place  In a previous goal celebration at Cagliari the week before Kean had responded to racist abuse from fans by standing stock still arms spread wide and palms upwards His face wasn t vengeful he appeared peaceful through the sweat But afterwards Leonardo Bonucci Kean s captain in the national side and his Juventus teammate said Kean was half to blame for the racism because of his reaction to his goal 
APR10	I can feel it: the Tory Brexiteers are starting to crack	As a remainer who has grown up among traditional Conservatives where anti Europe instincts run deep I was deeply affected by reading Peter Oborne s heartfelt piece this week in which he suggested that Brexit may need rethinking altogether Was this finally a pivotal moment Reading it repeatedly on Sunday night I even sacrificed Line of Duty  Oborne is the former political editor of the Daily Telegraph a prominent and respected Brexiter and a lifelong Conservative And here he was with quiet intelligence talking directly to his fellow Eurosceptics persuading them to take a breath swallow their pride and consider again We will never be forgiven if and when Brexit goes wrong Future generations will look back at what we did and damn us He and his wife have five children so for him this is not metaphorical 
APR10	Sorry, guys, you can’t be an actor and moan about body image	I should as someone who repeatedly complains about the objectification of women have some sympathy for a young male actor who complains that they feel bad for actively participating in the whole objectification process Richard Madden who had the lead role in the BBC drama Bodyguard says he has been told to lose weight has to go to the gym twice a day and do the no carbs thing when he is preparing for nude scenes  His actor mates face a similar plight We re just feeding this same shit that we re against Madden said This shit is what he calls a very unrealistic body image So the terrible thing that has been happening to women for ever is now happening to men as well That s feminism for you making men feel equally inadequate the world over Seriously I am aware that many young men feel in despair about their bodies and that eating disorders are on the increase But no one has to present an unrealistic body image do they Madden said he has started asking if a plotline requires nudity Again another question that women actors have never not had to deal with Yet Chris Hemsworth felt the pressure to get in shape for his Avengers role Then there is Aidan Turner the Poldark guy and Jude Law pictured in his tighty whities filming The New Pope 
APR10	Neoliberalism promised freedom – instead it delivers stifling control	My life was saved last year by the Churchill Hospital in Oxford through a skilful procedure to remove a cancer from my body Now I will need another operation to remove my jaw from the floor I ve just learned what was happening at the hospital while I was being treated On the surface it ran smoothly Underneath unknown to me was fury and tumult Many of the staff had objected to a decision by the National Health Service to privatise the hospital s cancer scanning They complained that the scanners the private company was offering were less sensitive than the hospital s own machines Privatisation they said would put patients at risk In response as the Guardian revealed last week NHS England threatened to sue the hospital for libel if its staff continued to criticise the decision  The dominant system of political thought in this country which produced both the creeping privatisation of public health services and this astonishing attempt to stifle free speech promised to save us from dehumanising bureaucracy By rolling back the state neoliberalism was supposed to have allowed autonomy and creativity to flourish Instead it has delivered a semi privatised authoritarianism more oppressive than the system it replaced 
APR10	Schools, put down your begging bowls. Unite and protest instead	Given the billion shortfall in funding that schools across England have suffered in the last three years it s little wonder that school fundraising efforts to plug these gaps have had to become increasingly creative  In the school I taught in last year the school building was hired out in the evening to raise extra cash so it wasn t unusual to finish my marking to the lively sounds of the local Ghanaian church service in the canteen next to my classroom At the end of last term my current school hosted a conference for teachers from across the country for a lively day of collaborative discussion on classroom pedagogy with tickets costing visiting teachers a head 
APR10	My cousin has been killed in Sudan’s protests. His death must not be in vain	On Sunday morning the day after renewed protests in Sudan calling for the resignation of President Omar al Bashir a message came through on the family WhatsApp group Ma ab has been shot in the heart  My heart skipped a beat and I couldn t breathe Ma ab Hanafi My cousin The funny photographer The tall skinny one who was shier than his brother but who always had a kind word to spare 
APR10	Netanyahu’s victory means life is about to get worse for Palestinians	Think of it as Israel s groundhog night It begins with exit polls that delight Benjamin Netanyahu s opponents and send a shudder through Likud headquarters and ends several hours later with a crowd of supporters cheering Bibi king of Israel It happened that way in when Netanyahu won his first term as prime minister it happened again in and it happened once more last night The initial projection which saw Netanyahu lagging behind Benny Gantz a former chief of staff of the military melted away as the night wore on until both men had an even number of seats but with Netanyahu the obvious winner thanks to the overall strength of the bloc of rightist and religious parties that he calls his natural partners in coalition Not all the votes have been counted but barring an arithmetical miracle he will soon embark on his fifth term in power  How did he do it Credit belongs in part to his own mastery of politics dark arts At Likud HQ his supporters hailed him as a magician and it is true that there is no more able sorcerer when it comes to playing on the prejudices and fears of his base Donald Trump is a novice by comparison I was in Israel for the last few days of his campaign watching as Netanyahu pressed the panic button in a bid to bring rightwing voters back home to Likud rather than opting for any of the smaller even more ultra nationalist parties He went on the radio warning that he was losing the election persuading his base that the only way to keep out Gantz whom he repeatedly branded as left and weak was to give Likud the status of largest single party 
APR10	I’ve got the best job in British politics: being an MEP	Arriving in Brussels was like the first day of school There were hundreds of us all coming from the four corners of the continent to be inducted as MEPs Exactly as I would have done at school I made a beeline for the only people I recognised my Labour colleagues  As we chatted nervously we were guided through various stations of induction photograph badge finances logistics office accommodation and finally IT I handed over my phone to be enabled and within a few seconds I had an inbox full of hundreds of unread emails I told the technician these couldn t possibly be my emails I had walked through the door only that day Welcome to the European parliament was his dry reply 
APR10	My son is dead, but how can you grieve when you can’t afford a funeral?	I was at work My boss came down and said to me The police are coming to see you I was like what have I done Half an hour later I was serving a customer when the police came up to me and said We need to speak to you It s very serious you need to sit down They said We re not here to arrest you It s to do with Rahim   What has he done now I asked 
APR10	Glaciers and Arctic ice are vanishing. Time to get radical before it's too late	Forget early warning signs and canaries in coalmines we re now well into the middle of the climate change era with its epic reshaping of our home planet Monday s news from two separate studies made it clear that the frozen portions of the Earth are now in violent and dramatic flux  The first led by the veteran Greenland glaciologist Jason Box looked across the Arctic at everything from increased tundra biomass to deepening thaw of the permafrost layer Their conclusion the Arctic biophysical system is now clearly trending away from its th century state and into an unprecedented state with implications not only within but beyond the Arctic To invent a word the north is rapidly slushifying with more rainfall and fewer days of hard freeze the latest data shows that after a month of record temperatures in the Bering Sea ocean ice in the Arctic is at an all time record low for the date crushing the record set last April 
APR10	Ireland's attempts to secularise its schools have turned to farce	In Ireland of primary schools are Catholic This religious domination of public education is anomalous in a developed nation It does not meet the needs of Ireland s increasingly diverse population or of the many citizens religious or otherwise who would rather that Catholicism was not afforded a privileged place in public life  In a government report recognised the need for change and recommended that some schools divest their religious patronage Progress has been slow Though the church agrees that some divestment is necessary at local level it is reluctant to cede power 
APR11	Whatever happens next, the nationalist right has lost the battle for Brexit	MPs reflex reaction to the new six month Brexit delay was a very human one They decided to take a break They have awarded themselves an Easter chill out starting tomorrow following the most punishing peacetime session of parliament in modern times They need it We all need it Theresa May certainly needs it  But they and we also need to use the Brexit break to relearn the art of thinking straight and seizing the moment The delay imposed by the EU on Wednesday night was not simply another familiar can kicking exercise Instead it may mark a pro European turning point in the battle of Brexit It is a moment not of enduring impasse but of real opportunity 
APR11	Julian Assange’s cyber-sins seem quaint in comparison to those of big tech	The eviction of Julian Assange from London s Ecuadorian embassy is a strange irony He saw himself as a warrior for truth across the boundless paradise of the web where people could make their own rules Now he finds himself badly in need of a secure border a friendly judge and legal protections  Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in He was fleeing not a furious US government seeking revenge for his placing a million of its secret cables on the internet but a Swedish arrest warrant for something as un digital as a suspected rape which he has always denied Two years ago the Swedes dropped the warrant and suspended its investigation while a change of regime in Ecuador led to negotiations for his eviction 
APR11	Omar al-Bashir is gone. It was Sudan’s 30 years of anger that ousted him	As the Sudanese army announced the overthrow of president Omar al Bashir after almost years in power it could look to the untrained eye as if his fall has only been weeks or months in the making The most recent protests began last December as economic conditions worsened culminating in an almost week long sit in outside the army headquarters But resistance to his regime dates back to the very day he seized power in a military coup in Since then successive waves of dissent have all been brutally quashed by him and his coterie of Islamists and mercenaries  First they came for the civil servants liquidating labour unions and throwing dissenters in jail without trial to be tortured and broken The pogrom of middle class professionals unaligned with the government was so intense in those early days that for a brief period it became a regular occurrence that entire families fled the country at short notice Every few weeks I would go to school and another face in the class was gone their desk empty without warning or a goodbye 
APR11	Brexit is delayed, so what needs to happen now? Our panel responds	Suddenly the wind dies The ship is becalmed Will the crew return to squabbling The second postponement of Brexit seems likely to bring out the worst in parliament Theresa May will be under resumed pressure to resign which will solve nothing Remainers and no dealers will return to their tribes It is hard to disagree with France s president Emmanuel Macron that a six month delay beyond June will merely encourage them  The one thing that matters now is votes in the House of Commons The prime minister has lost her party If she wants to be true custodian of Brexit the only requisite votes are sitting opposite her in her talks with Labour s Jeremy Corbyn They depend on the UK negotiating to remain in some form of European customs union and or single market It might not be ideal but it is the only deal in sight 
APR11	Merkel dresses to deflect attention – May could learn from that	Theresa May and Angela Merkel are more alike than is often thought and now we have the pictures to prove it Their twinning wardrobes of royal blue jackets and a shared joke about it over an iPad warmed the permafrost that often pertains between two leaders one of whom is trying to hand in delayed Brexit homework the other feeling that as the head prefect in the rowdy EU school she is stuck with a particularly awkward pupil  The two looked like clones at that meeting on Wednesday in matching blue But the running commentary on May s clothes is linked to the narrative of her political decline That expensive pale blue jacket of despair is starting to look like the unluckiest outerwear in the spring collections Clothes and power are interlinked from Queen Elizabeth I s competition in ruffs with Mary Queen of Scots to Margaret Thatcher s neat collars signalling prim authority and control 
APR11	More women like Shana Grice will die unless police sexism ends	Shana Grice one of the many women killed by a violent ex partner would probably be alive today were it not for widescale failures of police to act properly on incidents of stalking and domestic abuse The complacency about male violence towards women across our criminal justice system is a major symptom of endemic institutionalised misogyny within the police service  When Grice called police on Michael Lane after he chased her down the street snatched her phone and pulled her hair it was Grice not her abuser who felt the long arm of the law In the proud tradition of blaming women abused by men they once said yes to the police decided Grice was lying because Lane showed a number of text messages from Grice that indicated they had been in a relationship Lane had been reported to police in by a woman accusing him of harassment but no action was taken Following Grice s death in more women came forward to accuse Lane of stalking and harassment 
APR11	Virgin Trains is a Bransonian dystopia – good riddance to it	I ll believe it when I see it but the news that Virgin Trains could disappear from the rail network within a year has given me as much succour as the prospect of Theresa May disappearing from power With home family work and friends arranged at various points along the west coast mainline I have been to all intents and purposes a captive of Virgin s malodorous Pendolino service for my entire adult life  The best thing that can be said about them is that they get you there As a regular rail traveller however it s what they do to your soul along the way that really matters For the duration of a Virgin trip you are trapped in a red plastic Bransonian dystopia 
APR11	The EU’s new October extension finishes off May and her deal	Britain will remain in the EU until the end of October this year but diminished in power and status with a review of its conduct set for the end of June It is the marital equivalent of being sent to sleep in the spare bedroom if not quite the garden shed  Wednesday night s humiliation when other nations decided our fate a taster of Norway plus or common market where decisions are made about the UK without our presence exposes the lies of the Brexiters and the impossibility of a strong and stable position outside the EU History will recall that Britons did not value their power in Europe until they lost it Theresa May too was humiliated once again but it does not cut deeply since she appears to feels no shame She remains convinced she was and is right that blame is to be found with her detractors and not with her deal or leadership 
APR11	The Trump-Netanyahu relationship is sowing disaster for both countries	In the run up to the Israeli elections Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu took a series of irresponsible steps to help the Israeli prime minister s electoral prospects Trump announced support for Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights Netanyahu said he would annex parts of the West Bank and claimed he had US support and Trump designated Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization a move for which Netanyahu immediately took credit  Though Netanyahu may be the apparent winner of the Israeli election Trump and Netanyahu should be careful what they wish for While pleasing their rightwing supporters the two leaders are doing severe damage to the interests of both countries 
APR11	Why the black hole is a ray of light in these dark times	 The gates of hell the end of space and time That was how black holes were described at the press conference in Brussels where the first ever photograph of one was revealed to an excited audience And this black hole a super massive object at the centre of the galaxy Messier M really is a monster Everything unfortunate enough to get too close to it falls in and never emerges again including light itself It s the point at which every physical law of the known universe collapses Perhaps it is the closest thing there is to hell it is an abyss a moment of oblivion  And yet I saw the photograph as a ray of light On our own turquoise speck in the cosmos we re living through ecological breakdown the rise of authoritarianism and the appallingly unequal distribution of resources We re devoting a lot of time and energy to destroying our home and to hurting one another It can be hard not to feel like the human race has become trapped in its own event horizon and we re inevitably and inexorably being pulled towards the darkness The grainy image those scientists released on Wednesday reminds us of something different 
APR12	Trump and his imitators are out to nobble the world’s referees	A plea to those of you who are not fans of sport There might be a little bit of football and to my own surprise even some basketball in what follows But I promise it s not the whole story My concern here is with something that goes far beyond sport that points to a trend spreading into every aspect of our lives and across much of the globe But I confess it begins at the Emirates stadium watching Arsenal  I came late to the beautiful game drawn to it by the enthusiasm of my young sons One thing that happened in the stands came as a surprise to me Of course I knew emotions would run high with fury expressed in a stream of four letter abuse But the target was unexpected To this day the greatest rage of those who sit around me is never directed at Arsenal s opponents Sure there s anger at Arsenal s manager for his decisions or the players for their mistakes But the most frequent object of my neighbours ire is the referee or his fellow officials They are slammed for being either blind a fatboy or driven by what s assumed to be an unbending loathing of Arsenal Football Club 
APR12	Nigel Farage’s Brexit party? Sorry but I’ll be washing my hair	Can there really be just spellbinding days to go until the Brexit deadline The answer is maybe Having played to extra time without a result the UK is now subject to the controversial golden own goal rule a form of sudden death meaning this electrifying war of attrition could end the minute any EU exit deal is got over the line However scrappily What we can say for sure is that Betamax prime minister Theresa May has been made to accept a flextension by the EU So instead of screaming NO really urgently as we have been in recent weeks we will instead be screaming Noooooooooooooooooooo in slow motion till the end of October We hold all the cards and the sunlit uplands are within our grasp  Naturally not everyone is happy Nigel Farage is so angry that this morning he came out of retirement to launch his new party in Coventry with a rally in Birmingham promised tomorrow Yes Maverick is re engaging sir The small man s back in town Like me you probably missed Farage s latest retirement which involved him being on the airwaves more than even Holly Willoughby who people actually like He is now the frontman for something called the Brexit party which in the usual way of these things was led until last month by a Catherine Blaiklock before she was forced to resign after some unfortunate social media posts were unearthed 
APR12	Whatever you think of Julian Assange, his extradition to the US must be opposed	States that commit crimes in foreign lands depend on at least passive acquiescence This is achieved in a number of ways One is the othering of the victims the stripping away of their humanity because if you imagined them to be people like your own children or your neighbours their suffering and deaths would be intolerable Another approach is to portray opponents of foreign aggression as traitors or in league with hostile powers And another strategy is to cover up the consequences of foreign wars to ensure that the populace is kept intentionally unaware of the acts committed in their name  This is what the attempted extradition of Julian Assange to the US is about Back in the then US soldier Chelsea Manning downloaded hundreds of thousands of classified documents relating to US led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan US state department cables and inmates imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay Assange s alleged role consists of helping Manning crack an encrypted password to gain access to the US defense department computer network 
APR12	The culture war over ‘LGBT lessons’ is based on distortion. Here are the facts	If you are the parent of a school aged child you ve probably heard that primary sex ed will be mandatory from September Even if you aren t a parent you ve likely heard of No Outsiders the LGBT curriculum that has sparked protests by a number of Muslim parents at Parkfield community school in Birmingham resulting in hundreds of children being withdrawn  No Outsiders has been suspended but the protests have spread throughout Birmingham and to Manchester with hundreds more parents threatening to withdraw their children from schools Two weeks ago BBC Question Time brought this conflict to the nation at large by asking Is it morally right that five year old children learn about LGBTQ issues in school 
APR12	Amritsar, 100 years on, remains an atrocity Britain cannot be allowed to forget	Tomorrow marks the centenary of a British general gunning down unarmed Indians who had gathered peacefully in a park in Amritsar In India you only have to mention the name of the park Jallianwala Bagh for everyone to know what you are talking about Yet hardly anybody in the UK has heard about Jallianwala Bagh let alone knows why the event was one of the worst atrocities of British rule in India Nor do they appreciate why its legacy still lingers and colours relations between the UK and India to this day  The Amritsar massacre fundamentally changed how the Indians saw the Raj the era of British rule which ran from to It led Mahatma Gandhi who during the first world war had forsaken his pacifism to help recruit soldiers to preserve the empire to see British rule as satanic 
APR12	Medical cannabis isn’t reaching NHS patients. And I’m in too much pain to wait	I was delighted when the home secretary Sajid Javid announced that medical cannabis would be made available on prescription from November including the two main active ingredients cannabidiol CBD and the psychoactive component of the plant tetrahydrocannabinol THC Having used the drug for years to alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis MS I and thousands of others would benefit from the change or so I thought  I d hoped that acquiring cannabis oil legally would be a formality by now but the door still remains firmly closed Having recently moved house I registered with a new doctor and enquired about getting the oil for my pain management The request for oil containing THC was met with incredulity and a lecture on the dangers it could have on my mental health I had to bite my tongue as I was offered ibuprofen or OxyContin instead the former can rot your guts and the latter can leave you addicted to opiates To say the least it was a disappointing appointment 
APR12	I can afford to buy supplies for my kids’ schools. What about those who can’t?	When my kids started pre kindergarten in New York last year the school issued parents with a long list of items to buy and bring in This was not as in state school in Britain a list of uniform and PE kit requirements but rather necessities including paper towels glue sticks a year s supply of paper plates and plastic cutlery cups napkins board markers crayons and packing tape Classroom supplies in other words  These donations were discretionary no one was going to yell at you if you didn t bring them in And in the sheer volume of stuff being asked of each parent for two kids in separate classes it was way too much to be carried in on a single trip the tacit understanding was that those who could afford it were providing for those who could not 
APR12	I saw the brutality of Bashir’s regime. Now Sudan can rediscover a lost identity	More than years ago I hid in a Khartoum University toilet stall with three other students We held our scarves over our noses to limit the stench as well as the teargas that was streaming through the doors A student union election had not gone the way the government liked and soon the campus was stormed by security forces armed with batons and gas grenades At one point security pickup trucks drove around campus apprehending students at random and beating them  Eventually the campus was cleared and we ventured out retching I remember as we tried to make our way home down the Nile on the north side of the campus a long stream of choking crying and coughing students Security officers stood in the street randomly striking students with sticks and batons meting out humiliating insults as they did When I walked past one struck a male student on the back He teetered Where are the heroes mocked the officer as he beat the student again I thought you were heroes The young man took the blows and never looked back as he walked away

APR12	Staying in a customs union after Brexit won’t resolve the Irish border issue	Common sense has at last prevailed The UK parliament has rejected the prospect of a no deal Brexit and stepped back from the cliff edge But while the limited extension of the article timetable postpones the threat of no deal until the end of October it does not remove it Unless parliament can reach agreement about how to break the impasse the new cliff edge will soon come into view It is vital that this does not happen A way forward must be found  It is therefore significant that Labour is holding discussions with the government Perhaps these talks can eventually lead to a compromise and a change to the political declaration If they do it is important that any new proposal is properly scrutinised It would be a mistake to sign up to something that cannot carry popular consent or is not sustainable in the long term 
APR13	Trump and his imitators are out to nobble the world’s referees	A plea to those of you who are not fans of sport There might be a little bit of football and to my own surprise even some basketball in what follows But I promise it s not the whole story My concern here is with something that goes far beyond sport that points to a trend spreading into every aspect of our lives and across much of the globe But I confess it begins at the Emirates stadium watching Arsenal  I came late to the beautiful game drawn to it by the enthusiasm of my young sons One thing that happened in the stands came as a surprise to me Of course I knew emotions would run high with fury expressed in a stream of four letter abuse But the target was unexpected To this day the greatest rage of those who sit around me is never directed at Arsenal s opponents Sure there s anger at Arsenal s manager for his decisions or the players for their mistakes But the most frequent object of my neighbours ire is the referee or his fellow officials They are slammed for being either blind a fatboy or driven by what s assumed to be an unbending loathing of Arsenal Football Club 
APR13	Nigel Farage’s Brexit party? Sorry but I’ll be washing my hair	Can there really be just spellbinding days to go until the Brexit deadline The answer is maybe Having played to extra time without a result the UK is now subject to the controversial golden own goal rule a form of sudden death meaning this electrifying war of attrition could end the minute any EU exit deal is got over the line However scrappily What we can say for sure is that Betamax prime minister Theresa May has been made to accept a flextension by the EU So instead of screaming NO really urgently as we have been in recent weeks we will instead be screaming Noooooooooooooooooooo in slow motion till the end of October We hold all the cards and the sunlit uplands are within our grasp  Naturally not everyone is happy Nigel Farage is so angry that this morning he came out of retirement to launch his new party in Coventry with a rally in Birmingham promised tomorrow Yes Maverick is re engaging sir The small man s back in town Like me you probably missed Farage s latest retirement which involved him being on the airwaves more than even Holly Willoughby who people actually like He is now the frontman for something called the Brexit party which in the usual way of these things was led until last month by a Catherine Blaiklock before she was forced to resign after some unfortunate social media posts were unearthed

APR15	Why won’t the remain parties work together for the EU elections?	European elections take place on May almost certainly For this great chance to summon the pro EU pro referendum vote give thanks from the bottom of our hearts to the unbelievably useful idiots of the European Research Group hard core Special thanks to Mark Francois idiot in chief to Peter Bone Steve Baker and all the other refuseniks including our friends the doughty DUP  Were it not for them we would by now have left the EU on time on March We would be on our way out of all EU political institutions out of the common agriculture and fisheries policies no freedom of movement but free to trade with the Faroe Islands Ahead would lie a hard Brexit prime minister forging the hardest trade policies Reasonable Brexit voters will look back in anger at what these fruitcakes have rejected in pursuit of an impossible no deal crash out Idiocy is just a polite word But let s give thanks for their pig headed obstinacy Long may it last 
APR15	David Lammy was right to name and shame the ERG	They really don t like it up em do they The horrific mutation of Eton ego and the European Research Group ERG that produces the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees Mogg must not be called nasty names Oh no It has been suggested that the Labour MP David Lammy went too far on The Andrew Marr Show when he said that comparing the ERG a group of Tory MPs that supports a hard Brexit to Nazis was not strong enough Marr challenged Lammy on his language pointing out that the MPs he was referring to were elected representatives Lammy responded I don t care how elected they were so was the far right in Germany  Lammy s rhetoric has been criticised but let s join the dots Johnson says he is pro immigration and says he has only met Steve Bannon twice I haven t got all day to rehearse the racist remarks Johnson has made over the years 
APR15	Niall Ferguson isn’t upset about free speech. He’s upset about being challenged	I would pause for at least a few seconds if I found myself arguing that my freedom of speech was in a state of extreme jeopardy in this my column in a national newspaper The historian Niall Ferguson it seems did not pause when making such an argument in his column in the Sunday Times this week For Ferguson speaking to the masses online and in print the ability for him and his fellow travellers to freely speak their mind is in such dire jeopardy that the only answer is to set up a defence treaty a form of Nato for academics who experience backlash when they express their views  The people it would protect he argued include Roger Scruton the academic sacked from an unpaid government post for expressing views he d previously expressed in an interview with the New Statesman Jordan Peterson the bestselling author who had the offer of a Cambridge visiting fellowship revoked after posing with a fan wearing a T shirt bearing the slogan I am a proud Islamophobe and Roland Fryer a Harvard economist under investigation for sexual harassment which he denies That Fryer has not received a wave of support from academic colleagues Ferguson blames on political correctness 
APR15	Sajid Javid, the answer to youth knife crime lies in hospitals – and it’s been proven	In Sajid Javid s first major speech on crime today marking one year since the launch of the serious violence strategy the home secretary said the government will look at using data from multiple sectors to improve understanding of the causes of serious youth violence  This year so far young people have been killed by knife assaults and thousands of knife crime victims were treated in our hospitals in But with only half of all NHS trusts currently recording data for weapon assaults on to year olds we can t fully diagnose the size and shape of the problem we seek to prevent 
APR15	All hail Michelle Obama: like Beyoncé, she has fully upstaged her husband	Michelle Obama returned to the UK for her book tour at London s O Arena last weekend On her last visit in December over people tried to get tickets some queueing from am to get to the box office in person The last time I recall this level of excitement over an event Britain was basking in the brilliance of another black woman Beyonc during her Formation tour  The parallels between the two women are obvious they are both pop cultural juggernauts great unifiers across class race and gender divides As they have grown in their influence and ubiquity they have only become more unapologetic about their blackness And they both are partnered with initially more famous but now undeniably less universally beloved husbands 
APR15	Good news for UK renters at last – now here’s what else we can fight for	Monday marks a huge victory for private renters Theresa May and the communities secretary James Brokenshire have announced that the government will abolish section a little known law that means landlords can evict tenants without good reason Right now section is used every day to send renters packing Your landlord might decide they want to hike the rent up sell the house or just that they don t want to make the repairs that need doing It doesn t matter whether you ve been a good tenant or not whether you ve paid your rent on time The landlord is in control not the tenant I should know because it happened to me  Last year my partner Simon and I were living in Walthamstow north east London when we noticed a huge patch of damp on our ceiling We did the usual and contacted our landlord asking for them to take a look But as is the case in many disrepair stories of private renters for the next nine months nothing happened despite regular calls texts and emails So we escalated and reported the issue to our council which said the damp now developing on our ceiling wasn t severe enough for it to take action It was just days later as we were sat thinking through what to do next when a section notice came through the post asking us to leave the property in just two months time We felt we were being evicted for reporting the leak 
APR15	Extinction Rebellion protesters who want to be arrested: be careful what you wish for	When I was arrested I did not hear most of the words of the police caution I was being led from the front wheel of a deportation charter flight that I d helped blockade at Stansted airport in March There were of us in total four around the wheel and around a tripod behind the left wing One of our number had been arrested before locking on As an officer put handcuffs on me and walked me to the waiting bus he started to arrest me I am arresting you on suspicion of aggravated trespass You do not have to say anything When I rounded the corner glimpsing the collection of my fellow activists who I d not seen since we d cut through the fence many hours before we all cheered obscuring the words Once I was arrested though and sat alone in a police cell for hours on end those cheers rang hollow When we were released and eventually charged with a terrorism related offence one carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment that jubilance was replaced by endless worry stress and pain  We must be wary of glorifying arrests and incarceration as the only valid way of engaging with a movement
APR15	Twitter’s ‘PC brigade’ aren’t killing comedy – they’re shining a light on bigotry	Great leaps forward in comedy happen by asking the big questions What if you created a show that unapologetically showed the horror of war You get M A S H What if you created a sitcom about nothing You get Seinfeld What if you filmed a dog falling into an indoor swimming pool while a disembodied Harry Hill makes snide comments about the wood panelling You get You ve Been Framed from onwards And so we witnessed another great moment in comedy this week when the BBC s head of comedy asked the question we didn t realise needed to be asked is comedy dying because the internet is turning people into Victorians  Last week at the launch of the well meaning British Comedy Foundation Shane Allen railed against the way social media has imposed a Victorian moral code on comedians which damages the medium s ability to test boundaries and challenge orthodoxies 
APR15	I’m a scientist studying laughter – and it’s funnier than you might think	The American writer EB White famously said Analysing humour is like dissecting a frog Few people are interested and the frog dies of it But is the same true of analysing laughter  I am a brain scientist who studies laughter and I find it quite interesting not least because scientific analyses tell us that pretty much everything we humans think we know about laughter is wrong We think laughter is primarily something we do when we find something funny but in fact most laughter is produced for social reasons we are times more likely to laugh if there is someone else with us than when we are on our own We all laugh much more often than we think we do studies find an average of seven laughs per minutes of conversation between strangers and an average of all of a conversation between friends We think we are the only animals that laugh but laughter has been described in other apes parrots and even rats 
APR15	Only rebellion will prevent an ecological apocalypse	Had we put as much effort into preventing environmental catastrophe as we ve spent on making excuses for inaction we would have solved it by now Everywhere I look I see people engaged in furious attempts to fend off the moral challenge it presents  The commonest current excuse is this I bet those protesters have phones go on holiday wear leather shoes In other words we won t listen to anyone who is not living naked in a barrel subsisting only on murky water Of course if you are living naked in a barrel we will dismiss you too because you re a hippie weirdo Every messenger and every message they bear is disqualified on the grounds of either impurity or purity 
APR16	France is a divided nation – but Notre Dame has brought us together	Emmanuel Macron is apparently agnostic But if he believed in God he might have wondered if the Lord was sending him a message on Monday evening At around pm just as the French president prepared to record a highly anticipated address to the nation to be broadcast on TV later flames were overwhelming Notre Dame Cathedral Macron s team first thought of postponing the broadcast which was scheduled for pm before it became clear that the disaster was so grave it would have to be cancelled altogether Instead the president went from the Elys e to Notre Dame and stood among the crowds looking as flabbergasted as the rest of us stunned by the violence of the flames and the extent of the devastation It was exactly pm when the spire of the world s most famous cathedral snapped in two and collapsed into the furnace  Macron s address was to have been a key political event after months of unrest unleashed by the gilets jaunes uprising which first prompted and then threatened to derail Macron s great national debate on the future of the divided country Earlier on Monday the big question was how was Macron going to respond politically to a politically unclassifiable movement a movement without parallel in recent French history disparate leaderless legitimate in its initial demands but containing elements that are violent racist populist undemocratic with no other aim than taking over the Elys e the National Assembly and the institutions of the Republic How was he going to respond to a people who claim they are undivided while expressing multiple and contradictory aspirations lower taxes but more public services more democracy and more referendums demanding to be listened to but rejecting the notion of being represented 
APR16	Why I went viral on Twitter after talking about being evicted on Sky News	On Tuesday I had the weird experience of going viral on Twitter after an altercation with a Sky News journalist Following the government s announced plans to scrap section eviction notices I was invited on to Sky News to talk about the time I was served such a notice in February I made a complaint about the serious disrepair in the flat I have been renting with a friend since August We now have to get out by the end of the this month  As it stands section gives landlords huge power over our lives and discourages renters from making complaints or requesting repairs for fear of section revenge evictions Since around other tenants have been victims of revenge evictions making section the leading cause of homelessness in England displacing huge numbers of working people and migrants from their communities each year 
APR16	I have no time for the ERG, but David Lammy was wrong to compare them to Nazis	I am a big fan of David Lammy I think he has spoken out courageously in the past on the issue of absent fathers and I applaud his opposition to Brexit I even backed him to be the Labour mayoral candidate in  In contrast I have no time whatsoever for Jacob Rees Mogg and the rightwing ideologues of the European Research Group ERG whom even the Conservative chancellor Philip Hammond has referred to as extremists for their intransigence over Brexit 
APR16	Flexible working for parents is great. But child-free people need it, too	Fresh rallying calls for greater equality and support for mothers in the workplace are made in two recent books Heading Home Motherhood Work and the Failed Promise of Equality and Making Motherhood Work How Women Manage Careers and Caregiving  In the latter the sociologist Caitlyn Collins casts her net wide to explore how work and family tensions are exacerbated by both a long hours culture and what she sees as society s dismissive attitudes towards care giving Stressed exhausted and unappreciated mothers in Italy and the US share anecdotes that contrast markedly with those of their Swedish counterparts In Sweden more progressive social policies mean that fathers take days of paternity leave and play a bigger role in childcare bringing the nirvana of work life balance closer to reality This approach Collins argues should be more widely embraced 
APR16	Who is really responsible for Brexit? The Queen	Activate the Queen She is the only person who can sort out this chaos Politicians can t and the people certainly can t because the will of the people is a floating buffet at which all stuff their faces but still yearn for a proper dinner So for instance a people s vote will either undermine democracy by ignoring the first people s vote or underscore democracy by having more of it  Theresa May can t sort it out I feel about her as my friend used to feel about her husband He has been dead for years it s just that no one has told him 
APR16	Those left behind by the contaminated blood scandal shouldn’t have to fight for support	My husband Steve Dymond was a mild haemophiliac and a victim of the contaminated blood scandal He was a funny clever gentle man for whom tributes have not ceased since he finally died in late December aged In the s he was infected with hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products on the NHS British haemophiliacs were infected with the product at the time and many have subsequently died  When I kissed his cheek for the last time and then stepped out into that lonely night I had no idea what was awaiting me 
APR16	Want a larger penis? Then your problems may be upstairs, not downstairs	A massive penis please That s most guys answer to a question many of us have at least thought about before what part of your body would you like to surgically improve and how  I remember when there was a rumour went round that Peter Andre had undergone plastic surgery on his abs to make them as pristinely popping as they were in the Mysterious Girl video and I remember even then as an eight year old boy barely aware of anything except strawberry laces and Arsenal goalkeeper kits thinking Why did he do that when he could ve got a massive penis instead 
APR16	Good on Meghan and Harry for letting the curtain fall on the royal birth media circus	News if you could call it that that Meghan Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry will not reveal the location of or plans surrounding the birth of their first child This will no doubt frustrate the swarms of paparazzi accustomed to camping out outside the Lindo wing of St Mary s hospital in anticipation of the now familiar sight of Kate Duchess of Cambridge groomed trussed up and probably still bleeding in a pair of high heels performing the whole Simba routine to the nation The strangeness of the sight has never been lost on women last year when Prince Louis was born women took to social media to share snaps of how they looked after giving birth ecstatic yes but also exhausted dazed clammy reeling Trauma aside these postnatal photos end up resembling a kind of freedom when put side by side with the stage managed spectacle of the duchess  Some of the press coverage of Meghan s pregnancy has been appalling tinged with sexism and racism
APR16	Don’t bet against the Brexit party winning the EU elections	In Nigel Farage shocked Westminster by leading Ukip to victory in the last European parliament elections the first time the Conservatives or Labour hadn t topped the ballot in a nationwide election since Since then Farage has left the party and officially launched the new Brexit party to fight this round of somewhat unexpected EU elections At the launch Farage put his money where his mouth is announcing he had placed a bet on his newly formed party topping the ballot in next month s vote  At the weekend YouGov released the first YouGov Times poll of the EU election campaign Farage s party currently finds itself in third place on within the margin of error of the Conservatives on but currently a way behind Labour who are on However there are many reasons to believe they will make up that ground over the coming weeks and Farage s gamble looks like a fairly smart bet 
APR17	Notre Dame has always been a work in progress – let’s embrace its restoration	The flames leaping above the towers of Notre Dame Cathedral as crowds of dazed onlookers sung hymns in the twilight looked apocalyptic a sight from the end of days or at least the climactic scene of a Dan Brown novel The destruction of a building so iconic so symbolic of a nation is deeply unsettling And so it should be for this irreplaceable loss of year old heritage is tragic But setting the calamity in historical context shows us how unusual our age is in investing so greatly in the veneration of ancient buildings and how accustomed we have become to thinking they can be frozen in time  Happily Notre Dame seems to have emerged less ravaged than was initially feared The main fabric of the church has survived and the relics and other holy items inside were largely rescued It was easy to forget as smoke and flame belched heavenwards that the roof made from a forest s worth of medieval timber was separated from the interior by the high arching stone vaults Some of those have collapsed but most seem still in place The glorious stained glass rose windows dating from the th century when the cathedral was completed have been mercifully spared too 
APR17	Let's join the Tories and sabotage them, like they sabotaged Britain	The thought of another unelected Tory prime minister and this time in all likelihood a rightwing fanatic is almost too much to bear If a general election isn t called before the date set by the Fixed Term Parliaments Act then we face the prospect of our next prime minister being one of the following a serial liar out only for himself a man who gambled the life of a newborn baby to appease populist zeal a guy who managed to piss off almost the entirety of our NHS workforce a woman whose rise remains unfathomable but who is definitely unmistakably a mother and Michael Gove being his stubborn best It s like being offered a Revel but only the coffee ones are left  It is no wonder that much national opinion oscillates between disbelieving despair and incredulous laughter at our current political class Perhaps then we the sensible on the left or centre or centre left should hold our noses and do something spectacular join the Conservative party I understand this is about as enjoyable a prospect as taking a dip in a sewer but shall we sabotage from the inside We could hold fringe meetings in ironic burgundy trousers Who s in 
APR17	More women over 40 are getting pregnant. But is that really about their choices?	The trend for later motherhood is continuing apace This week the Office for National Statistics released new data on conception rates for women in England and Wales showing that teenage pregnancy rates continued to decline in and that for the first time more women are getting pregnant in their s than in their s But perhaps the most striking trend concerns fortysomethings the only age group for the second year running whose conception rates are on the increase This reflects a dramatic long term shift they have more than doubled since  These are important trends but the figures give us little information about the broader social relational and even reproductive contexts within which women over are becoming pregnant and how their experiences of pregnancy might compare with those of younger women This is something we are looking to examine with a new interview based research project at the Institute for Women s Health at University College London exploring the life stories feelings and opinions of women who are pregnant in their s While the project is still in its infancy it has already provided some key insights as to why increasing numbers of women are having children after and how they feel about later motherhood 
APR17	What unites naked protesters and Mark Carney? Climate change	This morning two very different kinds of harbingers brought us a message of climate doom One was a colourful crowd of climate activists called Extinction Rebellion who have been blocking traffic in London for the last two days and who are today planning further economic disruption aimed directly at the city s jugular the tube and rail networks  The other was less expected Mark Carney the governor of the Bank of England along with the governor of France s central bank Villeroy de Galhau has written an article for the Guardian warning banks and insurers that climate change threatens them too In the wallet Insurance claims from droughts and floods are bad for business Then there s the fact that governments are now taking carbon emissions seriously which means companies that don t adjust will likely be adjusted out of existence And at a certain point when climate catastrophe deepens there will be a Minsky moment a sudden collapse in asset prices true economic disruption 
APR17	The misogynist trolls attacking Katie Bouman are the tip of the trashpile	The researcher Katie Bouman played a leading role in taking the first photograph of a black hole A photo of the year old Bouman taken the moment the photo was processed shows her with her hands clasped in front of her mouth looking at the camera with a mix of shock and excitement It went viral both a testament to the groundbreaking work itself and a moment of victory for women in the sciences whose contributions have long been ignored downplayed and erased  The giddiness didn t last long 
APR17	Progressive Muslims, Jews and Christians must stand together for LGBT rights	Struggling to come to terms with being gay as a child is by no means an experience unique to those who grow up religious For as long as being straight remains the dominant sexuality and despite the best efforts of the homosexual agenda it looks like that ll forever be the case being gay lesbian bisexual trans or queer still means working out what it means to be something other something different a journey of self acceptance we all embark on if we can  If you happen to be born into one of the Abrahamic religions however you are presented with a unique obstacle on that path You re not just dealing with friends family and a society that continues to be far from accepting but have the added complication of God who hasn t traditionally been understood to be the greatest of queer allies to contend with too 
APR17	Theresa May’s successor will be a crucial choice. Are the Tories capable of making it?	Last time the Tories had a leadership problem they settled on Theresa May as the solution That isn t a mistake the party will make again although other mistakes are available Half of the cabinet and just as many backbenchers are parading themselves in speeches and newspaper articles The competition to be the Conservative party s next problem is under way before the current problem has stood down  The usual practice when picking a new leader is to overcompensate for faults in the old one May s methodical chilliness appealed as the antidote to David Cameron s careless charm The same trait expressed as lack of agility and diplomacy made her a poor choice to negotiate Brexit But it is easy to say what May got wrong The more interesting question is what she almost got right 
APR17	If you believe in human rights, Madonna, don’t play Tel Aviv	Madonna s acceptance of an invitation to perform in Tel Aviv at the Eurovision song contest finals in May raises yet again fundamentally important ethical and political questions for each and every one of us to contemplate  In Paris in the then fledgling United Nations drafted and subsequently adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights which enshrined in international law that all our brothers and sisters all over the world irrespective of their ethnicity or nationality or religion have certain basic human rights including but not limited to the right to life liberty and self determination 
APR17	Macron vowed to change the EU – but his chance may have gone	Last week s European Union summit on Brexit may have looked like a unique case of Emmanuel Macron finding himself extremely isolated in Europe Rather it was the latest proof that the French president s European strategy needs a profound rethink Two years ago Macron took France and Europe by storm For the first time he had been elected on a staunchly pro EU platform This opened the door to potentially momentous changes in the EU  Britain s vote to leave the aftermath of the transatlantic financial crisis and the failed French and Dutch referendums on the EU constitution project had already made clear that institutional reforms were needed In sweeping speeches Macron set out a bold vision But now that ambition has waned and many hopes have evaporated His European strategy contained important flaws and he made mistakes in trying to deliver it 
APR17	The financial sector must be at the heart of tackling climate change	The catastrophic effects of climate change are already visible around the world From blistering heatwaves in North America to typhoons in south east Asia and droughts in Africa and Australia no country or community is immune These events damage infrastructure and private property negatively affect health decrease productivity and destroy wealth And they are extremely costly insured losses have risen five fold in the past three decades The enormous human and financial costs of climate change are having a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing  The impact of climate change has compelled governments to act Catalysed by the Paris agreement governments around the world are putting policies in place to limit the global rise in temperatures to C and preferably as close to C as possible The actions undertaken by individual countries will deliver a collective transition to a low carbon economy But this transition brings its own risks Carbon emissions have to decline by from levels over the next decade in order to reach net zero by This requires a massive reallocation of capital If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world they will fail to exist 
APR18	Memo to Tory MPs: denigrating the membership is a really bad idea	In the wake of the Brexit referendum one Labour MP rationalised the effort to unseat Jeremy Corbyn who had been elected party leader less than a year earlier with one of the greatest mandates in the party s history as an act of mercy There are always going to be people in the country who are off the page nuts The problem we ve got is that they have all joined the Labour party because of Jeremy Corbyn he told Tim Shipman in All Out War It slowly dawned on us that the man s insane and the people around him are too To think you can run a political party with of your colleagues having no confidence in you is insane  A few months later Labour members returned Corbyn with an even greater majority less than a year after that he led the party to an increase of seats and in vote share at a general election It turned out that thinking you can run a party while ignoring what of it wanted was the truly ridiculous idea Who knew 
APR18	The Home Office is cruel and incompetent – it is time it was abolished	The Home Office is a remorseless engine of cruelty incompetence and Kafkaesque bureaucracy It cannot be reformed but should be scrapped Consider the case of an year old British citizen taken up by Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill who has Alzheimer s He has lived and paid taxes and national insurance in Britain for half a century most of his extended family as well as grandchildren and great grandchildren are British citizens The Home Office is currently attempting to deport him to India Or take year old Alfred Jahn who told me that he was woken up two years ago by armed police officers looking for an Albanian they d got the wrong address He says only after prolonged chasing was a lacklustre explanation forthcoming Or year old Paige from Enfield north London who was saved from jumping from a bridge and sectioned after her Albanian fiance s visa application was refused in December She had submitted all the documents proving she met the necessary income threshold but the Home Office ripped the two apart for more than weeks Her fiance was hospitalised at least times because of the stress Paige lost her job It turned out that the Home Office had mislaid a payslip  Deport as many as you can with any excuse by any means that is the underlying ethos of this morally bankrupt regime
APR18	The billionaires’ donations will turn Notre Dame into a monument to hypocrisy	In a welter of stories appeared in the international press pointing out the brokenness of Paris s Notre Dame Cathedral officials showed journalists how patches of limestone would crumble at a finger s touch Gargoyles that had lost their heads were patched up with plastic pipes while fallen balustrades were replaced with wooden planks All this decay was caused by pollution acid rain and eight centuries of use but also official neglect was to blame Keepers of the building had begged for more money but neither the belt tightening French government nor the wealthy grumbling about higher taxes gave enough  Then came Holy Week and the inferno by the Seine and all of a sudden nobody can give too much After years of preaching the shrinking of the public sector the French president Emmanuel Macron now wants to mobilise the full resources of the state to get the roofless cathedral rebuilt within just five years And money from France s billionaire class keeps raining down In three days the cathedral has been pledged m m from Francois Henri Pinault the ultimate owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent m m from the Arnault family of Louis Vuitton fame another m from L Oreal owners the Bettencourt Meyers family and m from French oil giant Total 
APR18	#Change UK – really? If you don’t get the internet, you shouldn’t be in politics	If you want to vote in the European elections next month your ballot paper will have a helpful logo next to the candidate s name to show which party they re running for that is unless you want to vote for Change UK The Independent Group Despite their logo being the most boring thing in existence they still managed to have it rejected by the Electoral Commission in part because it contained the hashtag change  It s just more of the same for TIG CUK who at this stage are basically the party political wing of the sad trombone waah waah waaahh sound In all likelihood the commission has done them a favour The thing about hashtags is that anyone can use them for anything There s absolutely nothing to stop people to take one incredibly obvious example taking to Twitter to post I m voting for change I m voting Labour And as the Boaty McBoatface episode should have conclusively demonstrated if you give the internet a chance to royally stitch you up thousands of people will gladly do so and not even out of malice just for a bit of a laugh 
APR18	The Extinction Rebellion protest is inspired. But what comes next?	Day four of Extinction Rebellion which has been a phenomenal success as climate protesters occupy four pressure points in Britain s congested capital Everything has conspired to maximise attention for their climate cause with the news unnaturally quiet in this pause in Brexit hostilities  Compared to Brexit rage and fury climate protesters are the soul of peace and goodwill their pink boat welcoming Oxford Street shoppers who mainly stop to talk The surprisingly few police are friendly with the arrests curiously voluntary people well warned in advance so those who can t be arrested step back Is it true the police cuts have left too little capacity to arrest everyone Two officers laugh You might say that we couldn t possibly comment 
APR18	The big four auditors are failing – and the watchdog’s report won’t change that	What do BHS Carillion Conviviality Quindell Aero Inventory the Co op Bank and London and Capital Finance have in common They were all audited by the big four accountancy firms PwC KPMG EY and Deloitte which audit of FTSE companies and collect of audit fees In each case these firms collected huge fees and delivered little of any public value Their failure to spot the fragility of those businesses resulted in the loss of jobs savings pensions and tax revenues  Yet the victims of these failures have no legal recourse to seek compensation because auditors owe a duty of care only to the company that hires their services not to any individual stakeholder or creditor 
APR18	Mark Carney’s warning on climate change is timely, but it’s only a start	Mark Carney got right to the heart of the matter in his message to the City about the risks of climate change take global warming seriously or you will lose money This is the sort of language foreign exchange dealers and derivatives traders understand For the most part they don t tend to be eco warriors even though their sons and daughters might be What they care about is profit and loss the good old bottom line  So that s how the Bank of England s governor approached his subject Companies that don t adjust to the reality of global warming will simply cease to exist You don t get much blunter than that 
APR18	My team lost, but Man City v Spurs was better theatre than Shakespeare	Football killed my favourite uncle Theo was a Manchester United fan He knew he shouldn t watch the FA Cup final in because he had a dicky heart So he waited till it was all over to turn on the telly Only it wasn t the teams were deadlocked at and the match had gone into extra time Norman Whiteside scored the winner for United Theo had a heart attack and died It was shocking to lose such a lovely man But what a way to go  Like all great matches this one swung like a demented pendulum
APR18	Britain will have its second referendum – at the EU elections on 23 May	In just five weeks time Britain will have a referendum on Brexit This will take the form of elections to the European parliament but in reality this will be a pre referendum or if you like your neologisms ugly a preferendum So there is now one simple task to maximise the vote for parties that support a confirmatory referendum on Brexit giving the British people a democratic choice between accepting the negotiated Brexit deal and remaining in the EU  If Labour s manifesto clearly commits to that confirmatory referendum then Labour is among those parties If Labour is not clear enough then turn to the Liberal Democrats Change UK the Green party the Scottish National party or Plaid Cymru At the end of the day what will matter more than the precise allocation of seats is that we can say X million people voted for pro European pro referendum parties while only Y million voted for unambiguously pro Brexit parties such as Ukip Nigel Farage s new Brexit party and the Conservatives In this vital bottom line reckoning there is no such thing as a wasted vote Every single voice will count 
APR18	UK universities must break their silence around harassment and bullying	The revelation that UK universities have spent around m on payoffs to staff that come with gagging orders in the past two years has again highlighted concerns that such secretive clauses are being used to conceal the extent of harassment and bullying at higher education institutions  Dozens of academics told BBC News they were harassed out of their jobs and forced to sign non disclosure agreements NDAs by their university after making complaints Although the BBC admits it does not know how many of these gagging clauses relate to sexual misconduct or other kinds of harassment or bullying the findings highlight a wider lack of transparency in the way universities handle all kinds of misconduct and discrimination 
APR19	Lyra McKee: a letter to my 14-year-old self	Kid  It s going to be OK 
APR19	Climate campaigners may sound naive. But they’re asking the right questions	Spring has sprung and overnight the high street is awash with miraculously cheap summer dresses  Flick through the racks of floaty swishy nothings in any H M store right now however and it s clear something has changed in the last few summers Swinging from all that throwaway polyester are tags bragging about how much of it is sustainably made from recycled plastic bottles not oil Their tights and knickers use a man made fibre made from recycled fishing nets and by the till is a bin of reusable shopping bags 
APR19	Only remainers could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory like this	Having endured the past few months in Brexit how are you feeling about the prospect of the European elections campaign Please rate your satisfaction on a scale of one to the survivors of the USS Indianapolis These sailors got through the worst naval disaster in American history when their ship was torpedoed by the Japanese in and were then left bobbing in the Pacific Ocean Subsequently and over several days they were subjected to the worst recorded shark attack in history  The lesson of Brexit is that no matter how stomach voidingly ghastly it feels it can always always get much worse
APR19	The Mueller report shows that bad guys who play dirty, like Trump, always win	Those who had long hoped that Robert Mueller the mostly silent sheriff riding into town to ensure good triumphed over evil would be the saviour to deliver America and the world from Donald Trump are naturally disappointed Mueller s report released on Thursday did not quite deliver the smoking gun Trump s enemies had dreamed of Instead it handed the American public and their elected representatives a fully loaded revolver with a note attached Now it s up to you  The page Mueller report even in its redacted form pockmarked with blacked out names and passages serves up enough ammunition to destroy this president whether through impeachment proceedings this year or by denying him re election in Its pages confirm one scandal after another supplying the detailed hard facts to vindicate the very claims that Trump breezily dismissed at the time as fake news That Mueller did not take the final step accusing the US president of both collusion with the Russians and obstruction of justice tells its own story which we ll come to But it was hardly for lack of evidence 
APR19	France’s shame at the Notre Dame fire shows the west still believes in society	It s easy to understand the grief that the French people are feeling in the wake of the devastation of Notre Dame More puzzling is the sense of shame that the Guardian s Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis highlighted in her report On our watch we let it burn she quotes an older woman in tears saying  This sentiment was echoed in Jonathan Miller s Spectator blog in which he wrote There is also a shame to this How could this have happened Isn t France better than this Both Chrisafis and Miller have lived in France for years and are reporting from the ground The shame they have identified seems real 
APR19	Arms cannot end Libya's agony – whatever its would-be strongman claims	With heavy fighting on the outskirts of the capital threatening more uncertainty for thousands of migrants and refugees Libya lurches deeper into crisis The assault on Tripoli was launched earlier this month by the self styled Libyan National Army LNA commanded by General Khalifa Haftar as the answer to years of instability and entrenched divisions between the UN backed government in the west and the LNA aligned government in the east But in trying to force a military solution Haftar s partisan campaign to unify the country portends further fragmentation and chaos  The LNA has begun to compel civilians in Benghazi to report for military duty according to sources within its eastern stronghold This is a worrying indication that Haftar s supposed lightning offensive has a lot longer to run 
APR19	Do millennials opt for a ‘fur baby’ because they’re broke – or scared of responsibility?	About three months after I d given birth I was invited to a recently befriended mum s house for a gathering of new parents and babies As my bleary brain tried desperately to remember each adult s name and at least the gender of their corresponding tot I suddenly realised we were one cooing spewing infant short of a full set How odd  Later as I happened on the lady I d identified as childless refilling her mug in the kitchen I inquired about the little one wholly prepared to praise her willingness to leave him or her with someone else at such a young age The tiny dote she explained was indeed with a neighbour I gave her an encouraging smile Then she got out her phone and proudly showed me a snapshot of her bundle of joy on Instagram of course Blinking into the sun from the comfort of his very own swaddle Buster was the smuggest schnauzer I d ever seen 
APR19	Hundreds of Bahrainis like me are being made stateless – and the UK is complicit	This week a court in my home country Bahrain reached a verdict in one of the largest mass trials in the nation s history Jail terms were handed to people including life sentences ostensibly for terrorism related offences All but one were stripped of their citizenship  In a huge number of Bahrain s citizens took to the streets to demand democratic change from the al Khalifa family who have ruled the country for some years Since then it has ramped up repression outlawing opposition groups closing the only independent newspaper and restricting freedom of assembly The United Nations has condemned the widespread use of torture in Bahraini prisons and has expressed concern about the latest convictions Anti terror legislation has been expanded and is used extensively to harass journalists human rights defenders and anyone who dares contest the legitimacy of the government 
APR19	Why does the EU need a €13bn defence fund? It should be waging peace	It is often said that the European Union is the most successful peace project in the world Those arguing the case will point to the centuries of war that preceded its founding and the relative peace that has followed There are many times when that claim has been severely tested with European governments playing a central role in fuelling global conflict while pursuing repressive anti refugee policies that have punished people escaping war  This week the EU s reputation for peace building has come under further question with the European parliament overwhelmingly voting to finalise the funding for a European Defence Fund The fund commits billion over a seven year period to the collective research and development of cutting edge weapons and military technology The concept of the fund was announced by the European commission president Jean Claude Juncker in and backed by the European council later that year A handful of pilot projects were launched in with a total of million committed for funding The scale of the projects and spending will be totally eclipsed by this week s increase 
APR19	The Extinction Rebels have got their tactics badly wrong. Here’s why	Over the past few days I have watched members of the Extinction Rebellion movement block bridges disrupt public transport and lock themselves to lorries I have been moved by their bravery and inspired by their message but puzzled by their strategy On the face of it the rebels have been effective They have disrupted major cities gained publicity and built bonds of solidarity But are they achieving their aim of building a more sustainable world  According to Stanford University s Doug McAdam the climate change movement has historically been a failure when compared with other movements Climate activists have struggled to engage politicians been unable to build influential organisations and failed to connect with the wider public The Extinction Rebellion may mark a turning point The rebels have injected a sense of urgency and emotion back into the issue of climate change but creating meaningful and long lasting change requires more A movement must reach out beyond true believers and connect with a wider base of potential supporters wherever they might be found on the political spectrum 
APR20	This paralysing lack of leadership leaves Remainers with nowhere to go	Once political parties were meant to solve the voters problems Now it s the other way round Voters must be experts in the most arcane details of the d Hondt system of proportional representation and make predictions that are next to impossible while receiving no help from the politicians who claim to lead them  The chaos Brexit has brought has stopped Britain dealing with every real issue from street crime to climate change According to the polls a clear majority of the population now realises Brexit merely worsens old problems then adds some new ones just for fun 
APR20	Daphne du Maurier’s hidden treasure gives hoarders hope	I suspect that those of us of a mildly hoarder ish persuasion all secretly believe that we re going to have an Antiques Roadshow moment when something we ve held on to that isn t one of several hundred branded tote bags turns out to have been truly worth keeping Bookish types have had a bumper week of evidence that this discovery fantasy may one day come true  A handful of poems written by Daphne du Maurier two previously unknown have been found in an archive of letters and the unknown ones hidden behind a photograph of the author in a swimming costume It is believed they have lain untouched for years 
APR20	Labour can’t defeat Nigel Farage by sitting on the fence	One of the many strange things about Nigel Farage is that for a politician who has made a career out of attacking the European Union his status in public life and his lucrative media career have been largely based on him being a member of the European parliament for the past years  He s never been elected to anything else but to give him credit he has become a specialist at inventing or reinventing positions that have hoovered up publicity generated endless controversy and harvested enough votes to win four successive terms as an MEP Now he is back again with his new Brexit party and leading the early polls for elections being held in the midst of a huge political crisis over our relationship with Europe 
APR20	Why are airlines so keen on the fantasy of the Mile-High Barbie?	How did it come to this women required to produce a sick note because they ve been struck down by unsexiness It seems that Norwegian Air requires female flight attendants to wear heels or have a note from the doctor other rules cover everything from makeup to false eyelashes  How mortifying for Norway in the country was rated second for equality after Iceland in the Global Gender Gap report Norwegian politician Anette Trettebergstuen said rang and it wants its rulebook back Norwegian Air responded that flat shoes are worn in the cabin there are also dress guidelines for male stewards and other airlines have similar rules but it must be aware that last month Virgin ditched requirements for heels and makeup with others following suit

APR20	One church, two popes: why Catholicism is in crisis this Easter	In his pre Easter address to pilgrims gathering in Rome Pope Francis highlighted Jesus s words as he died on the cross on the first Good Friday Forgive them Father for they know not what they do We all the Argentinian pontiff stressed need to find the courage to forgive those who have wronged us  Those remarks sparked speculation about who exactly Francis was struggling to forgive Top of most lists in Rome this Easter is his predecessor Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI who decided in to break with years of work unto death papal tradition and retire This opened Catholicism s door to the breath of fresh air that is Francis And for the past six years as the winds of change have blown through the church Benedict has by and large kept a respectful silence ignoring the ever louder pleas of traditionalist Catholics who want the year old to join them in opposing Francis s reform agenda 
APR20	Climate campaigners may sound naive. But they’re asking the right questions	Spring has sprung and overnight the high street is awash with miraculously cheap summer dresses  Flick through the racks of floaty swishy nothings in any H M store right now however and it s clear something has changed in the last few summers Swinging from all that throwaway polyester are tags bragging about how much of it is sustainably made from recycled plastic bottles not oil Their tights and knickers use a man made fibre made from recycled fishing nets and by the till is a bin of reusable shopping bags 
APR20	What makes a great place to live? Answer: it’s not a shopping plaza	The best place to live in Britain today is Salisbury So says the Sunday Times The Office for National Statistics disagrees It says the best place is Farnborough No says the Royal Mail it is Winchester The Provident says it is Worcester The Halifax says it is Stornaway And so it goes This is listicle season and not a magazine is without some daft survey of topographical superlatives Each year groups of travel editors get together over a good lunch with a road atlas and contented sponsor to hand  Salisbury s award appears to be in compensation for last year s novichok nightmare To be free of novichok is clearly a marketing asset but it is hardly a standout virtue Other criteria include a low crime rate good schools transport links air quality nice buildings and friendly neighbours The one thing these lists have in common is that nobody agrees Apparently if you ask most people the best place to live they say their home Good for them There is nowhere like home But dig deeper and the trends in modern liveability are intriguing 
APR20	Only remainers could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory like this	Having endured the past few months in Brexit how are you feeling about the prospect of the European elections campaign Please rate your satisfaction on a scale of one to the survivors of the USS Indianapolis These sailors got through the worst naval disaster in American history when their ship was torpedoed by the Japanese in and were then left bobbing in the Pacific Ocean Subsequently and over several days they were subjected to the worst recorded shark attack in history  The lesson of Brexit is that no matter how stomach voidingly ghastly it feels it can always always get much worse

APR21	Sri Lanka’s Christians were left unprotected for far too long	My first reaction was panic As I woke up to the horrific scenes from churches and hotels in Sri Lanka to news of the dead dying and injured on a day of Christian celebration I desperately rang loved ones checked on cousins uncles aunts and friends As further explosions occurred and more deaths were reported my heart pounded Finally I learned that my relatives were all OK and I began to reflect on an atrocity that must not be allowed to divide Sri Lankans and take us back to the darkest days of the recent past  I was born in Britain to Sri Lankan parents and have a Sri Lankan husband As a Muslim I know too well the feeling of shock and fear when someone has tried to harm you in a place of worship I felt today as I felt when I woke to news of the attack on worshippers in Christchurch New Zealand which left people killed and dozens injured Those Muslims had gone to Friday prayers on Jummah a holy day 
APR21	As the Sri Lanka attacks show, Christians worldwide face serious persecution	I was up before dawn this morning preparing for our first service of Easter This meant that around the same time as bombs were going off in churches in Sri Lanka I was reading a passage to my congregation taken from the book of Ezekiel The passage tells of dead bones coming back together of bodies being re clothed in flesh and of life being breathed back into them Over in Sri Lanka bones were being blown apart and flesh stripped from skin These people woke up this morning full of hope excited in anticipation of the story of Jesus s resurrection They put on their best clothes and polished their shoes Now their blood is being mopped from the sanctuary floor  I was talking the other day to the classicist Mary Beard about Christian persecution in Roman times all that stuff about lions and the Coliseum She was of the opinion that it might not have been quite as big a deal as later Christians made it out to be And no doubt there is nothing quite like a few overegged stories of gory martyrdom to deepen a sense of group solidarity among a struggling religious community Well I bow to Mary s greater knowledge of classical Rome But while it may have been true that too much was made of Roman persecution the very opposite is true now We are living though one of the most serious phases of Christian persecution in history and most people refuse to acknowledge it 
APR21	The Australian court ban on reporting George Pell’s trial was bound to fail	It may be apocryphal but there is enduring value in the story of the headline in a small antipodean newspaper that in the th century became agitated by events in Crimea We warn the Tsar The story came to mind late last year when the judicial system in the state of Victoria Australia attempted to suppress news that a senior Vatican figure Cardinal George Pell had been convicted of sexual offences against choirboys in Melbourne s Saint Patrick s cathedral between and  Although it had been known that Pell was being prosecuted the precise charges had not been disclosed and the trial had not been permitted to be reported while it was taking place The reason for suppression had been concern that potential jurors for an expected second Pell trial on separate abuse charges might be prejudiced by public reports of the first As it happened not long after the first trial ended the second was abandoned due to evidentiary issues 
APR21	This paralysing lack of leadership leaves remainers with nowhere to go	Once political parties were meant to solve the voters problems Now it s the other way round Voters must be experts in the most arcane details of the d Hondt system of proportional representation and make predictions that are next to impossible while receiving no help from the politicians who claim to lead them  The chaos Brexit has brought has stopped Britain dealing with every real issue from street crime to climate change According to the polls a clear majority of the population now realises Brexit merely worsens old problems then adds some new ones just for fun 
APR21	Raise a can to Diane Abbott, a politician who can mix (mojitos) with the people	In the good old days of course you wouldn t dream of venturing on to the North London line a trundly old thing connecting Stratford in the east to Richmond in the south west without being at least mildly flutered Journeys could be long the atmosphere anywhere between carnival and Beckett bleak and you had to hold your nerve if you were travelling as many of us did without a ticket not for nothing was the largely barrier free and inspectorless route known as the Free Line But they liked to surprise you I believe I once saw the comedian Arnold Brown being taken to task but am happy to correct if it was mistaken identity With all that going on a drink or two was a bare necessity  Anyway that was then and now the whole shebang has had a rebrand subsumed into the labyrinthine London Overground on which you can zip about between Fritz Lang stations from Dalston to Penge West But you must do so without an accompanying slug of Teacher s for which we must thank none other than former mayor Boris Johnson who deemed a decade ago that Transport for London must become a dry zone 
APR21	One thing unites snobs of all persuasions: contempt for the middle class	As painful as it is to admit Jacob Rees Mogg did once have his uses Or one at least It emerged during one of his earlier Question Time appearances when the BBC could still just about pretend ignorance of the then embryo demagogue s tendresse for racists Responding to a question about Heathrow Rees Mogg volunteered that he hadn t minded the planes when he lived in Slough Eton chaffed the host David Dimbleby I was at school with your son said Rees Mogg  Anyway thanks to this contribution along with other BBC presenter on BBC presenter squabbles about who is or is not posh it can be demonstrated that Sky News Adam Boulton is not the only mature white male TV presenter to suffer from pot kettle syndrome to the possibly debilitating extent of wanting although not for the purposes of satire to belittle others for enjoying the same social capital and privileges as himself 
APR21	Carlsberg’s honest new ad campaign leaves a funny aftertaste	What went through Orson Welles s mind I wonder when he first growled the line Probably the best lager in the world into a microphone He may have been pondering his fee He may have reflected on how well suited his distinctive gravelly voice was to the slogan s understated confidence It may have made him fancy a drink It probably didn t make him think that Carlsberg was probably the best lager in the world because it probably isn t And last week its manufacturers admitted it  In fact they launched a new slogan Probably not the best beer in the world So we ve changed it This marketing admission raises a few questions the first of which is How likely is it to be the best this time I mean they ve been calling their previous version probably the best for years It doesn t feel like they re adherents to a rigorously self doubting approach to product development 
APR21	Mueller’s account of Trump’s world acts as a cautionary tale for UK politics	Trump was right His presidency was fucked the moment the investigation into Russian involvement in the US presidential election led by special counsel Robert Mueller was announced  It s tantamount to treasonous to work so closely with the Russian secret services during the campaign with the Russians plainly hoping a Trump presidency would turn a blind eye to the partition of Ukraine in return It was tawdry deploying the promise of pardons to instruct his aides to stay strong in giving their account of what took place The whole affair stinks as does the Trump presidency 
APR21	As Brexit absorbs all political energy and guile, the country’s problems mount	We can all list our favourite reasons why the Brexit promised in the pale dawn sunlight of June has not turned out to be a walk in the park or even a final date with EU destiny But whatever we now think of the outcome of the referendum we are all trapped in the old Indian saying about the banyan tree under its shade little new can grow Sometimes I miss my role writing about politics of the kind that was not just about meaningful ish votes all or nothing dates leading to the next cliff edge scoldings from EU leaders and whether Theresa May is on her way out only to be there the next week and off on another walking holiday  One day political archaeologists will dig into the frozen tundra and find the remains of government activity preserved under the permafrost It might well start with HS which was once a glorious project slashing commuting times to Birmingham with vague promises of what it might achieve for the North Westminster has a terminology as inexact as Narnia for areas outside the south east Now unnoticed by all but high speed train spotters the project s completion cost date capacity speed and even where it should terminate in London are in question Sir Terry Morgan the outgone chairman has described the price tag as a guesstimate New sums suggest the cost might rise from bn to nearly twice that amount before we add on trains and power costs 
APR21	The tragic killing of Lyra McKee in Derry shows how hard it is for wars to end	The killing of Lyra McKee is a devastating loss for Northern Ireland and for all those who value integrity and thought I knew her through her work which was exceptional everything I ve read about her since the shooting has made me wish we had met  I am shaken by her killing but I am not surprised that such a horrific thing happened Northern Ireland overall is a much better place than it was years ago when the Good Friday agreement was signed However for some it is not that there may be a return to the Troubles but that the Troubles have never ended Others forget the concept of the peace process in favour of simplistic narratives which insist that Northern Ireland is either at peace or at war when the reality is more nuanced 
APR22	Sri Lanka needs exemplary leadership during this national catastrophe	The bombings in Sri Lanka targeting Christians as they prayed on Easter Sunday and tourists in hotels have struck the country like a hammer blow a decade after its agonising civil war came to a close The news of nearly lives lost will have sent a shiver down the spine of all peace loving Sri Lankans bringing back memories of a violent past when terror attacks dominated the national agenda  For nearly three decades we were known as the place that gave birth to a ruthless guerrilla organisation the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE Its use of suicide bombings as a tactic was chillingly replicated by the perpetrators of Sunday s atrocities But while it is no stranger to terrorism Sri Lanka has never witnessed violence on this scale and with this level of coordination on a single day Our return to normalcy nurtured through years of relative peace has been effectively shattered 
APR22	This man had to fight for benefits just before he died – when do we start to care?	You may not remember the name Stephen Smith but his body is hard to forget a photo taken by the Liverpool Echo emerged in February that showed a skeletal Smith sitting in a hospital gown his spine protruding from his six stone frame He had just had his disability benefits stopped  It quickly became one of the most notorious images illustrating the cruelty and unreliability of the disability benefits assessment system Smith had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease osteoarthritis and an enlarged prostate that left him barely able to walk and in pain but regardless he was found fit for work and told to look for a job 
APR22	Zelenskiy’s victory in Ukraine was extraordinary. But now he faces a real test	On Sunday night Volodymyr Zelenskiy jumped up and down on stage as exit poll results flashed on a giant screen behind him He now knew he would be Ukraine s next president Zelenskiy kissed his wife high fived his team and turned around to send his first message via hundreds of reporters and TV cameras that crammed his election headquarters It was meant for the post Soviet countries Look at us anything is possible  Zelenskiy s own story is proof of that and nothing short of extraordinary A year ago he was a comic a character from a TV series portraying a simple man who becomes president by chance after a video recording of his rant about corruption goes viral On Sunday the hologram became reality as Zelenskiy s victory smashed national political records 
APR22	Only Labour can stop Nigel Farage and his Thatcherite revival	In the European elections in just days time Britain faces a stark choice Will we back Nigel Farage or stop him To stop Farage Labour must come out on top This isn t just a mathematical and presentational reality no other opposition party is likely to outpoll him it is also a political imperative For to defeat Farage it is essential that we not only outvote him but also overwhelm his hard right Thatcherite ideology  Only Labour pro European and committed to social and economic transformation can defeat Farage and Faragism with the credibility of an alternative government That is why I am standing to become a Labour MEP with a mission to remain and reform big time 
APR22	Greta Thunberg’s visit to Britain is a huge moment for the climate movement	This afternoon an international sensation is taking to the stage in central London She s young admired around the world and her name is Greta Thunberg She s a year old climate hero and I couldn t be more proud to be co hosting her visit  Greta s rise to fame has been vertiginous Last year she skipped school and sat in front of the Swedish parliament in protest against inaction on climate change and now she is one of the figureheads of a school climate strike movement that has swept the globe which more than a million young people taking to the streets last month to demand that world leaders step up to this monumental challenge 
APR22	Victor Hugo gave Notre Dame life as the vibrant heart of France. It can be reborn	Victor Hugo was not enamoured with the title of Frederic Shoberl s English translation of his novel Notre Dame de Paris For the future great man of French literature the book s main attraction was the gothic cathedral itself not its hunchbacked bell ringer Hugo thought that Notre Dame s sublime features could take us to new heights both physical and spiritual from which we could sense a fervent connection to our world and to one another Nearly two centuries later his words still compel us to consider the cathedral with awe  This is not to discount the Hunchback of Notre Dame s importance Proving that a monster can still be a man Quasimodo s awakening humanity is integral to the novel s pathos and to its many adaptations on stage and screen from th century theatre and opera to the Disney animated film and the hit French musical Moving performances from actors such as Charles Laughton and Anthony Hopkins have helped to solidify Quasimodo s place at the story s centre even if they were more than twice as old as a character who s barely in his s and no less than three different versions using the Hunchback title have been announced by Netflix Disney and ITV over the past year alone 
APR22	Extinction Rebellion is leading a new, youthful politics that will change Britain	I am a fan of generation gaps Though academics and the media love to identify new demographic cohorts Generation X Generation Z Net Gen Gen Wii such distinctions often confuse mere fashion with decisive transformations in behaviour social priority and worldview But we need such transformations the inter generational arguments that they spawn and the changes that sooner or later they compel upon us all  The last authentic generation gap a period in which the old order was categorically at odds with the new ended with punk in the late s The next such period of deep change has taken its time to arrive 
APR22	Smaller parties have a surprisingly big impact on British politics	Technology sometimes reminds you that the unpredictable is actually all too predictable At its last extraordinary general meeting the national executive for the Women s Equality party finalised a snap general election strategy Now I was emailing for the fifth time in as many months to request yet another EGM the word extraordinary was beginning to lose all meaning I began typing apprehensively I m afraid it looks as though we are headed for only for Gmail s autocomplete function to suggest without pause or irony another election  Don t get me wrong the WE desperately wants to fight the European elections And we will The resurgence of far right politics across Europe threatens women and minorities in ways the political establishment cannot begin to understand The two largest political parties are tying themselves in knots in their attempts to take back control of their own backbenches Both the government and opposition will be asking voters to send their candidates to Europe in order to ensure that we leave 
APR22	Our schools are beyond breaking point – where is the outrage?	Last summer as the politics of Britain s exit from the EU staggered on and England s World Cup run offered some kind of respite I spent an afternoon in Brownhills near the West Midlands town of Walsall I was there to try to get beyond the deafening inanities of Brexit and report on the mounting financial crisis facing England s education system At Millfield primary school everything once again became clear  Millfield serves a deprived catchment area and is the kind of place whose everyday magic becomes obvious as soon as you walk in It has an imaginative approach to education and a track record of helping children in difficult circumstances Despite its location among tarmac and trunk roads it specialises in outdoor activities such as canoeing and hiking But the day I was there all the talk was of which bits of its provision would have to go Its headteacher Michelle Sheehy was blunt We re heading for a deficit So we need to cut 
APR22	On the first Stephen Lawrence Day, let’s admit our communities are still unequal	The nd of April is the first National Stephen Lawrence Day a day commemorating the life of my son Stephen Lawrence who was killed in an unprovoked racist attack  Stephen s story is both tragic and inspirational But I wish for Stephen s name not to be identified just with his murder but with the impact he has left on this country and the hope and inspiration he continues to give many young people 
APR23	Our Brexit limbo has given us two new parties, but the same old politics	Imagine that for some reason you want to lose an election You need a vote repellent campaign something really unsupportable You would probably form the Establishment party passionately in favour of the system cheering for the status quo Your candidates would boast of their credentials as career politicians Their slogan would be business as usual  This imaginary party is the perfect adversary the most beatable thing in British politics which is why real life parties all want to run against it Everyone claims to be the new politics and pins the despicable badge of oldness on their rivals 
APR23	Integrate, migrants are told. But can they ever be good enough for the likes of Blair?	Rarely do I associate Tony Blair with my mother After all they have little in common One was prime minister and marched the UK into five wars in six years the other taught for decades in east London primary schools to which she drove in a cheery red Nissan Micra But seeking respite from the oven of this weekend I began reading Blair s latest remarks on migrants and found myself thinking instead of a beaming lady in a classroom  Like so many of us the former Labour leader is worried about far right bigotry However he has a solution It is simple It is confident It comes in his trademark declarative sentences And it says that to beat racist thugs their targets must try harder to blend in They should be forced to do so by the government acting as an enforcer of the duty to integrate You see failures around integration have led to attacks on diversity and are partly responsible for a reaction against migration 
APR23	The government’s olive branch to Christians is tinged with hypocrisy	Even before news of the horrendous Sri Lanka bombings which killed Christian worshippers tourists and locals from many faiths Theresa May had already focused this year s Easter message on the global persecution of Christians The foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt sent letters to faith leaders saying he was appalled that million Christians worldwide faced discrimination  It is appalling And so is the hypocrisy of a government that has itself poured scorn on Christians in recent years People seeking asylum a tradition well known from the Bible have been denied by Home Office officials for reasons including that if an applicant really believed in Jesus they would not have needed asylum in the UK in the first place You affirmed that Jesus is your saviour but then claimed that He would not be able to save you from the Iranian regime the Home Office told an Iranian woman in a particularly nightmarish example of circular reasoning Your belief in Jesus is halfhearted 
APR23	Innovate? Big tech would rather throw us a broken Samsung Galaxy Fold	If you ever wondered whether the tech business is thrashing around in search of something anything to make people Buy More Unneeded Stuff Samsung s Galaxy Fold is all the proof you need Heralded as the first phone that unfolds to become a tablet or possibly the first tablet that folds up into a phone its worldwide launch has now been delayed because the units sent to some reviewers broke  In some cases they peeled off a protective layer over the folding screen thinking it was just a protective layer but it turned out that it was actually Very Important and Not To Be Removed Others found their screen gave up or seemed to be cracking which worried Samsung so much that it demanded the units back Now the company is taking a few weeks while it figures out whether to go ahead and demand for a phone that might break in a few days 
APR23	There is a thread running through Sri Lanka's cycles of violence	As mass burials for some of the Christian worshippers killed in the Easter Sunday bombings take place today claims that the attackers were local Islamic extremists have left Sri Lanka s Muslims who make up of the population devastated Although details are scant and doubts exist about the official government account a senior minister announced on Monday that the attackers belonged to a new fringe jihadist group the National Thowheeth Jama ath that military intelligence had been aware of but had not acted against Even amid news that Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attacks it is still unknown whether the bombers were homegrown or connected to international terror groups  Yet again Sri Lanka especially its Christian minority has paid a severe price for government failures Muslims already the target of hate campaigns will no doubt face repercussions Part of the tragedy is that since independence Muslims have stayed away from violence both during Sri Lanka s civil war and more recently when they have been the target of religiously motivated attacks 
APR23	Children’s prisons inflict unspeakable damage on inmates. Close them now	The th anniversary of Gareth Myett s death in a children s prison is being commemorated by a campaign to end child imprisonment in the UK It is hugely appropriate because in the intervening years those responsible for running children s prisons have repeatedly shown that they are incapable of nurturing and rehabilitating the children in their care Time and again we have seen children leave these institutions abused and irreparably damaged That is if they are lucky enough to come out at all Gareth Myatt wasn t  In April Myatt died while being restrained by three custody officers at Rainsbrook secure training centre in Northamptonshire operated then and now by G S The restraint followed his refusal to clean a sandwich toaster Gareth was under ft tall and weighed six and a half stone One of the restraining officers was ft tall and weighed stone During the restraint Myatt said he could not breathe He was told If you can talk you can breathe He died from positional asphyxia choking on his own vomit He was years old and had been in custody for three days 
APR23	Greta Thunberg teaches us about autism as much as climate change	Greta Thunberg is an impressive individual Just years old she has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize after sparking environmental protests around the planet There is a glorious simplicity to her arguments that makes them hard to refute What she asked was the point of pupils like her learning anything if politicians ignored the glaring facts on climate change So she sat down outside the Swedish parliament with a hand painted banner declaring a school strike and eight months later is a global icon who has helped to fire up a resurgent green movement  Thunberg s parents say their daughter once painfully introverted was always a bit different to other children Four years ago she was diagnosed with Asperger s on the autism spectrum which helps explain her remorseless focus on the core issue of climate change after overcoming depression Being different is a gift she told Nick Robinson when interviewed on Radio s Today programme It makes me see things from outside the box I don t easily fall for lies I can see through things If I would ve been like everyone else I wouldn t have started this school strike for instance 
APR23	It's time for nations to unite around an International Green New Deal	In times of crisis and catastrophe children are often forced to grow up quickly We are now witnessing this premature call to action on a planetary scale As the adults in government accelerate their consumption of fossil fuels children are leading the campaign against our species looming extinction Our survival now depends on the prospects for a global movement to follow their lead and demand an International Green New Deal  Several countries have proposed their own versions of a Green New Deal Here in Europe DiEM and our European Spring coalition are campaigning under the banner of a detailed Green New Deal agenda In the UK a new campaign is pushing similar legislation with MPs such as Caroline Lucas and Clive Lewis And in the US dogged activists in the Sunrise Movement are working with representatives such as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez to push their proposal to the front of the political agenda 
APR23	Is Netflix killing sex, stopping us having babies – or neither?	It s hard to keep up with the whole sex thing One minute we are being told that dating apps have unleashed an epidemic of casual sex and millennials are hooking up willy nilly The next minute we are being told that technology has propelled us into a global sex recession none of us can turn our screens off so no one is getting it on There seems to be a new article about the decline of sex every few days the latest was courtesy of the Wall Street Journal which recently argued that we are too busy binge watching Netflix to bother bonking  This isn t just kinky conjecture the Journal has the stats to prove it According to a poll commissioned by the paper one in four adults in relationships have turned down sex with their partner in favour of streaming TV Younger generations are more likely to eschew intimacy for entertainment of to year olds said they had chosen streaming services over sex compared with of people over Netflix and chill it seems has gone from being a spicy euphemism to a mundane descriptor 
APR23	To stop global catastrophe, we must believe in humans again	Because I am concerned about inequality and about the environment I am usually classed as a progressive a liberal But it seems to me that what I care most about is preserving a world that bears some resemblance to the past a world with some ice at the top and bottom and the odd coral reef in between a world where people are connected to the past and future and to one another instead of turned into obsolete software  And those seem to me profoundly conservative positions Meanwhile oil companies and tech barons strike me as deeply radical willing to alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere eager to confer immortality 
APR24	She’s an icon of Sudan’s revolution. But the woman in white obscures vital truths	It was the image that finally drew the eyes of the world to Sudan s revolution a young woman swaddled in white standing on top of a car with her hand aloft and a finger raised in rebuke as she addressed protesters gathered around her A sea of mobile phone cameras beneath her lights up the dusk The Sudanese had been protesting against the now former president Omar al Bashir for months demanding the fall of his government but with little global media attention Until that image It cut through Within hours the picture had been circulated at dizzying speed Media outlets rushed to determine who the woman was What did her outfit signify Sudanese people on social media provided explanations She was dressed in homage to a generation of Nubian warrior queens her white toab a Sudanese cloth wrapped round the body and looped over the head was a nod to the uniform of the average Sudanese working woman The actor Halle Berry posted a picture The US congresswoman Ilhan Omar tweeted it The New York Times s fashion director wrote a feature on the girl wrapped in white She became an icon of the protest movement and of womanhood on the frontline  The woman in white is now at the sharp end of a misogynist harassment campaign from change averse parts of society
APR24	Integrate, migrants are told. But can they ever be good enough for the likes of Blair?	Rarely do I associate Tony Blair with my mother After all they have little in common One was prime minister and marched the UK into five wars in six years the other taught for decades in east London primary schools to which she drove in a cheery red Nissan Micra But seeking respite from the oven of this weekend I began reading Blair s latest remarks on migrants and found myself thinking instead of a beaming lady in a classroom  Like so many of us the former Labour leader is worried about far right bigotry However he has a solution It is simple It is confident It comes in his trademark declarative sentences And it says that to beat racist thugs their targets must try harder to blend in They should be forced to do so by the government acting as an enforcer of the duty to integrate You see failures around integration have led to attacks on diversity and are partly responsible for a reaction against migration

APR24	Greta Thunberg is right – only a general strike will force action on climate change	Climate change is hurling humanity towards disaster There is no more room to question the science when nearly every climate scientist is in agreement that the implications of a global rise in average temperature will spell drastic changes for human civilisation In the face of such a rapidly encroaching threat political niceties and traditional incrementalism and compromise cannot come close to the level of change and upheaval required to solve or even mitigate the problem of global climate change  Climate scientists continue to stress the importance of lowering carbon emissions significantly yet they are currently increasing at an accelerating rate A UN study found that unless promised emission reductions under the Paris agreement were tripled they would cause the global temperature increase to reach C by and continue to rise after that Meanwhile some of the most influential people in the world continue to deny the very existence of climate change Even as the relatively tame IPCC report states that we must cut our emissions in half within the next decade people are feeling that their elected leaders and mainstream political avenues as a whole cannot measure up to this task 
APR24	As Europe builds its 5G network, security – not cost – must come first	On March the European commission published a recommendation designed to ensure the security of Europe s G networks You could be forgiven for having missed it given that it was announced in what could hardly have been described as a quiet EU news period  However the proposals are far reaching and reflect the urgent need for coordinated action as we fast approach a technological tipping point of potentially profound significance G licence auctions are ongoing and the scale of investment required and the complexity of the kit involved means that any decisions made will have long term implications so the need for action is now EU member states have already made legal commitments that require them to prioritise security in electronic communication data privacy and critical infrastructure By bringing these together and throwing a spotlight on their strategic importance our aim is to ensure that they are applied fully in practice 
APR24	The EU won’t change course on Brexit – look at the Greek debt crisis	The UK s Brexit debate has restarted after a day break just as before only with a new end date of October Brexiteers continue to press for the Irish backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements while the government and the Labour front bench seem to be making little progress in finding a consensus position  But once again scant attention is being paid to the other side of the negotiating table If we look more closely there we find hardening attitudes across the EU to anything other than the UK leaving on the basis of the withdrawal agreement regardless of the flaws that have seen this rejected three times by parliament Just as with the Greek debt crisis the EU now wants to see proposals adopted direction set and to deal with the problems later 
APR24	Sajid Javid must act now to right the wrongs of the latest immigration scandal	It s only been a year since the Windrush scandal broke but a very similar tale is issuing from the very same place the Home Office during Theresa May s time there Again a hostile environment towards illegal immigrants leaked into the rights of those who are entitled to stay here Thousands have been unfairly deported or blocked from getting visas Many have then been left in limbo for far too long their appeals for justice ignored  This time the scandal involves students and an English language test The test of English for international communication Toeic was introduced as a compulsory part of a visa application programme In Panorama found clear evidence that candidates were cheating at at least two test centres In one an invigilator was filmed reading out the answers to candidates In another paid proxies turned up to take the test for them 
APR24	Greta Thunberg teaches us about autism as much as climate change	Greta Thunberg is an impressive individual Just years old she has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize after sparking environmental protests around the planet There is a glorious simplicity to her arguments that makes them hard to refute What she asked was the point of pupils like her learning anything if politicians ignored the glaring facts on climate change So she sat down outside the Swedish parliament with a hand painted banner declaring a school strike and eight months later is a global icon who has helped to fire up a resurgent green movement  Thunberg s parents say their daughter once painfully introverted was always a bit different to other children Four years ago she was diagnosed with Asperger s on the autism spectrum which helps explain her remorseless focus on the core issue of climate change after overcoming depression Being different is a gift she told Nick Robinson when interviewed on Radio s Today programme It makes me see things from outside the box I don t easily fall for lies I can see through things If I would ve been like everyone else I wouldn t have started this school strike for instance

APR24	Elizabeth Warren was once conservative – now she’s heading to the left of Bernie Sanders	 If a person is not a liberal when he is he has no heart if he is not a conservative when he is he has no head No one is sure who said that it s sometimes erroneously attributed to Churchill like everything else but everyone is familiar with the sentiment we are supposed to get more conservative as we age  Elizabeth Warren didn t get that memo The year old Democrat and US presidential hopeful was a free market loving Republican when she was younger described by old friends as a diehard conservative Now Warren isn t only a Democrat she is one of the most progressive voices in US politics with a similar ideological stance to Bernie Sanders Indeed Warren may be heading even further to the left than Sanders On Monday she proposed a plan to forgive of student loans for people earning less than a year with the money coming from a new wealth tax Warren also proposed an ambitious plan for free higher education which she described as bigger than Sanders free college bill 
APR25	From Christchurch to Colombo, Islamists and the far right are playing a deadly duet	How should we make sense of the Easter Sunday church and hotel bombings in Sri Lanka that killed more than people and wounded Now that Islamic State appears to have claimed responsibility for the attacks the question arises is this merely the latest symptom of an epidemic of Islamist violence motivated by a belief in offensive jihad holy war  The answer is complex and not necessarily in line with public perceptions Islamist terrorism has been decreasing globally and particularly in the west since its peak in when Isis established its caliphate In recent years however far right supremacist terrorism has risen sharply to more than one third of terror attacks globally even accounting for every extremist killing in the US in Yet it was more likely to be overlooked or tolerated by western polities because of cultural history familiarity and legal protections extended to domestic groups such as US constitutional safeguards for freedom of speech and the right to bear arms Thus attacks by Muslims between and received times more coverage in US media than other terrorist attacks controlling for target type fatalities arrests 
APR25	How to stop climate change? Nationalise the oil companies	If only the Daily Express was right That is not a sentence I ever expected to type Extinction Rebellion protests have WORKED as MPs succumb to calls for change bellowed the rightwing rag Alas the government has not capitulated to demands to declare a climate emergency let alone to decarbonise the British economy by But Extinction Rebellion has retaught a lesson every generation must learn that civil disobedience works Amid the spluttering of obnoxious news presenters it has forced the existential threat of climate change on to the airwaves and into newsprint  But as this phase of protest winds down the demands must radicalise With capitalism itself rightly being challenged the focus must shift to the fossil fuel companies and the banks As long as they remain under private ownership on a global scale humanity s future will be threatened 
APR25	Like Greta Thunberg, I am on the autism spectrum. She gives me hope	Rarely have I identified with anything so strongly as when I listened to Greta Thunberg the year old Nobel peace prize nominee talking to Nick Robinson on BBC Radio s Today programme Like her I have been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum and it is rare that women like me appear in the media  Yet Thunberg s rise to prominence has been accompanied by a kind of thoughtlessness and intolerance that you might have expected society to have moved beyond Some reactions expose how much ignorance and malice remains towards autistic and neurodivergent people especially among those who don t share their political views Spiked s editor Brendan O Neill seized upon autistic traits Thunberg exhibits such as her monotone voice and forthright manner to liken her to a cult member in an attempt to delegitimise her message 
APR25	Northern Ireland’s abortion laws are an abomination. Westminster must step in	They were all there Northern Ireland s DUP and Sinn F in leaders side by side with the Good Friday agreement s guarantors the British and Irish prime ministers All were gathered at the funeral of the journalist Lyra McKee Why in God s name asked Fr Martin Magill had it taken her death to bring them together But his exasperated tone implied he didn t expect a political miracle  Visit this deadlocked region the UK s poorest and it feels transformed from the dark days of the troubles But its political paralysis is partly a product of Westminster s longstanding neglect of the region at least until the DUP unexpectedly came to play a pivotal role in the Brexit psychodrama The red hand of Ulster holds in its palm the fate of May s Brexit deal though the DUP doesn t represent the far more progressive and forward looking remain voting country The party may yet become Boris Johnson s kingmakers through its refusal to back Theresa May s deal 
APR25	Zelenskiy’s election proves Ukraine is a healthy democracy. Putin hates that	On the night of Ukraine s presidential election last weekend Vladimir Putin did not pick up his phone to congratulate the winner Nor has he since Putin is in waiting mode Perhaps that s because what Ukraine has achieved a free and fair genuinely pluralistic election and the prospect of a democratic transfer of power is something the Russian president has trouble getting to grips with in his own country  But surely nothing will have struck Putin more than the words Ukraine s new president elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy uttered on the night of his victory To all countries of the post Soviet Union look at us Anything is possible That particular call for change and for an overhaul of old power structures even beyond Ukraine will not have gone down well in the Kremlin 
APR25	There will be no soft Brexit now. It’s no deal or another vote	Ever since the Brexit vote in June many of us pro Europeans have had to live with a dilemma On the one hand we regarded the vote to leave the European Union as a disaster for our country On the other we accepted the galling reality that it was the democratically expressed view of the majority Three years on I still think we were right about Brexit But we still lost the vote  At times in the past five months a pragmatic compromise has seemed tantalisingly viable
APR25	While Britain forces its disabled people to food banks, it is unfit for the 21st century	It is and the UK is one of the wealthiest countries in the world But today s figures released by the Trussell Trust show that more than million emergency food parcels were given to people going hungry across the UK last year  This country is home to billionaires yet food banks for the poorest are becoming the norm Today s Britain is far from fit for the st century It is marked by soaring child poverty poor housing and rising homelessness 
APR25	Father Magill is right: Lyra McKee’s shocking death must not be in vain	Like the life that preceded it Lyra McKee s funeral was completely unique and utterly unforgettable  Thousands of mourners from every community in Northern Ireland lined the streets of Belfast to pay our respects to the extraordinary young journalist and to tell the world that we are not defined by our worst citizens but by our best 
APR25	Dare to declare capitalism dead – before it takes us all down with it	For most of my adult life I ve railed against corporate capitalism consumer capitalism and crony capitalism It took me a long time to see that the problem is not the adjective but the noun While some people have rejected capitalism gladly and swiftly I ve done so slowly and reluctantly Part of the reason was that I could see no clear alternative unlike some anti capitalists I have never been an enthusiast for state communism I was also inhibited by its religious status To say capitalism is failing in the st century is like saying God is dead in the th it is secular blasphemy It requires a degree of self confidence I did not possess  But as I ve grown older I ve come to recognise two things First that it is the system rather than any variant of the system that drives us inexorably towards disaster Second that you do not have to produce a definitive alternative to say that capitalism is failing The statement stands in its own right But it also demands another and different effort to develop a new system 
APR25	As a teacher, I know parents are right to march against unfair tests for under-fives	When I imagine the perfect way for a four year old to spend an afternoon it chiefly involves making mud pies eating raisins finger painting with friends all topped off by a much needed afternoon nap What it does not include is marching to Downing Street to protest against government education policy Nor does it involve being subjected to a high stakes assessment in the first six weeks of beginning school  Yet the government s plans to reintroduce compulsory baseline assessments for four year olds next year means that parents and their young children have been left with little choice but to protest The baseline tests will supposedly assess the maths and literacy ability of children when they start school Schools can then be held accountable for the progress students make from reception to year six But the March of the Four Year Olds will descend on Downing Street on Thursday to deliver a petition signed by people demanding that the government listens to the growing evidence that these tests are both damaging and unnecessary 
APR26	Brady, Batten and the bloody backstop (again): it’s still dark in the sunlit uplands	As the local and European parliament elections hove enticingly into view you will likely find yourself moved by the Conservative party s attempt to expand its electoral appeal beyond recent head trauma victims The Tories are keen to move past the notion that a vote for them is a vote in favour of a government with no pending legislation at all bar the one piece it can t pass  Fire up your thousand yard stares then as Graham Brady chairman of the backbench Committee has apparently got a plan to fix that In general I try not to pay too much attention to Graham who deliberately cultivates the air of a man who d tell someone politely but firmly to move their car at a point to point then nix their planning permission application if they didn t But how can we ignore his reported suggestion that Theresa May should bring the withdrawal agreement bill before the House except with the backstop either stripped out or time limited That Graham and others reckon could command the elusive majority 
APR26	Roger Scruton is not the victim of a leftwing witch-hunt.

APR26	Our school climate strikes have been a success and we’re only getting started	April has been quite the month for climate action The organisation I co founded the UK Student Climate Network held its third Youth Strike Climate demonstrations just two weeks ago which for the third month in succession saw tens of thousands take to the streets across the UK demanding climate justice and a Green New Deal Extinction Rebellion also kicked off a huge act of extended nonviolent civil disobedience by reclaiming public spaces in London and causing widespread disruption to protest climate breakdown Many hope this could be a crucial turning point in Britain s political approach to addressing the climate crisis  Thousands of people taking positive climate action for the very first time are feeling empowered by bringing their rage and frustration at climate inaction to the streets visibly demonstrating their discontent Looking at those taking part in all of these actions shows the potential of an emerging group to drive necessary legislative change At the youth strikes I look around and see today s brave and courageous climate activists and tomorrow s voters Meanwhile lots of current voters have been frequenting Marble Arch Parliament Square and other sites previously occupied by Extinction Rebellion All of these people alongside those engaged by TV shows such as Our Planet and Climate Change The Facts are becoming a new voting demographic the climate vote bloc 
APR26	To rage against Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK is simply childish	What is the matter with us A US president has been invited to Britain on a state visit and is coming in June It is a state courtesy between one democracy and another on the occasion of a wartime anniversary No conceivable purpose is served by people coming to London to shout insults at him  I cannot think what possessed Theresa May to invite Donald Trump in the first place but she did State visits are like that The Queen entertained Romania s Ceau escu Zimbabwe s Mugabe and Zaire s Mobutu Alongside them Trump might seem an angel Britain has the deepest of bonds with the US with ties of history commerce culture and education Washington s present leadership may embarrass even outrage people on both sides of the Atlantic That is no reason for childish protests against a guest invited in Britain s name 
APR26	Avengers: Endgame may well be brilliant – but the pressure to say so isn’t	In search of the new No l Coward You should probably give a wide berth to the Twitter mentions of critics sceptical about Avengers Endgame Eat dirt and die trash is typical feedback Likewise I hope Stan Lee haunts you slut and Fuck you bro fuck you Fanboy ire is not new But its power both in the moment and over the longer term is on the rise Not that Avengers Endgame is necessarily the best example of course The final instalment in a film cycle has earned almost universal five star reviews including in this paper  Tony Stark s climactic battle with Thanos and his Infinity Stones may well be up there with the best of Kubrick Hitchcock and Kurosawa If a professional believes this to be the case it is their job to tell us The certainty of being slagged off on social media as being bitter angry moronic whiny bitchy brain damaged drug addled outstandingly incompetent and unloved by your mother should you suggest otherwise would not sway most of those critics I have come across 
APR26	I’d like to ban screens. But sometimes domestic harmony depends on Peppa Pig	It is the Easter holidays and on the streets of New York the happy sounds of the coming of spring children s laughter birdsong and the thin repetitive jingles turned out by animation factories in the far east and uploaded on to kids YouTube to be consumed like crack A few days into the holiday and you can t stand in line in a supermarket without the strains of a smartphone issuing from the depths of a stroller  I have never banned screens in my house partly through laziness and partly through some vague notion that banning things only adds to their appeal This has had mixed results in line with most of my efforts to do psychology on my kids I let them choose not to do homework with the result that after four months of not doing homework they now rush in to do homework as if it s the most thrilling thing 
APR26	With his money-grubbing speeches, Boris Johnson cheapens our politics	What does a person say in two speeches that is worth Do they vomit gold This is the amount that Boris Johnson made last month He made a speech for the India Today conference and he got Accommodation and transport provided of course On the day Theresa May lost the second Brexit vote in the House of Commons he gave a speech for to Citigroup Global Markets Ltd Johnson is certainly taking advantage of the more liberal rules about income and interests now that he is no longer a minister  Taking advantage is after all his modus operandi These huge sums of money are staggering It takes a special kind of cognitive dissonance to read the news lately Are we to accept that politics is simply the hobby of rich men and the rest of the world can go to hell because we are a rich country and thus it is fine 
APR26	Forget Andrew Adonis’s U-turn on Brexit. It’s Labour that should really make one	On Wednesday Andrew Adonis a leading anti Brexit champion appeared to put the strangest statement on his Facebook page I am deeply sorry for off the cuff comments I made during a live LBC radio phone in last September he wrote I encourage all voters whatever their position on Brexit to vote Labour in the upcoming European parliament elections He then began a very uncharacteristic officious policy sermon including the statement Labour has put forward a sensible alternative plan that would ensure a close economic relationship with the EU after Brexit  The first part is easy to explain In September Adonis had been asked who Labour voters should vote for if they wanted to see Brexit happen He said they shouldn t vote Labour It was awkward Given that Adonis is now newly announced as a Labour MEP candidate and pro Brexit social media channels had begun circulating the clip of the discussion it was appropriate to apologise for that However how to explain the second part 
APR26	In the Brexit era, Britain is more Mr Bean than James Bond	We spend far too much time getting down about the state of the country the whole international laughing stock spinning manically out of control and generally going nowhere thing is pretty draining Yet hardly any effort is spent crudely shoehorning in film references to explain our political plight This is a real shame because for the Tory Brexiteers who valiantly yelled Charge then promptly led us off a cliff the story of the past three years has fundamentally been a clash between self perception and reality  Our macho superhero will gloriously defend a country whose government has wet itself while everyone else was watching
APR26	Remainers: don’t panic about European elections. Just participating is a win	Shall we start with the good news or the bad news The bad news is that the remainers European election campaign has so far proved an amateurish shambles The anti Brexit parties have refused to coalesce and are arguing among themselves the Labour party is still pretending it doesn t want the election to happen while Change UK is campaigning under three aliases and has already lost two candidates to historical racist tweets  The good news is that it almost certainly doesn t matter Of course the European elections are important and of course remainers should aim to succeed The European parliament gives legislators and by extension ordinary voters direct power and influence over the EU project Consequently the election will help shape our contribution to the EU in the coming months or perhaps years What it will not do is change any of the facts or dynamics over Brexit 
APR27	If an illegal drug let me finish the London Marathon, I’d take it like a shot	If you are reading this on Sunday morning I should be running the London Marathon I say should because as of Friday night I have no idea if I will be able to run at all  I have been training since December Baby runs at first Then longer Then I got lost an unjustly underrated training strategy and turned what was meant to be a mile run into a mile run I finished it without too much trouble and thought for the first time that I just might get there 
APR27	The story isn’t ‘crowgate’ – it’s Britain’s heedless killing of birds	Last week TV naturalist Chris Packham woke to a scene out of Game of Thrones Hanging in front of the gate of his New Forest home a gate whose lock had been glued shut two dead crows swung by their necks in the breeze Packham cut them down called a cab he couldn t get his car out of the drive and carried on  It was the latest chapter in the strange history of the general licences a story that has seen petitions and counter petitions threats and smears and says a great deal about the caustic and polarised nature of debate in Britain in 
APR27	Anna Sorokin proves we’re all soft touches for glamour scammers	On Thursday in a New York courtroom Anna Sorokin was convicted of a litany of charges four counts of theft of services three of grand larceny and one of attempted grand larceny The story of her brief bright career as a scammer when she floated around the city claiming to be an heiress called Anna Delvey on a cycle of borrowing and defaulting has proved so gripping that it is already being turned into competing projects A New York magazine report from was optioned for Netflix a Vanity Fair story written by the photojournalist who had been swindled by Sorokin and who testified against her is being adapted for HBO by Lena Dunham  Sorokin s convictions for which she faces a prison sentence and deportation to Germany make her the latest in a line of high level fakers elevated to celebrity status by our fascination It s no wonder that Netflix and HBO are involved in turning the saga into entertainment from the Fyre festival to Elizabeth Holmes the disgraced CEO of Theranos not in a week of Avengers overload to be confused with Thanos tales of people promising something they could never or never intended to deliver are everywhere 
APR27	Memo to Debenhams: don’t remind your customers they are middle aged	My branch of Debenhams in Wimbledon south London is one of branches set to close next year with more to follow putting an estimated jobs at risk  How horrible particularly for the workers Losing our Debenhams huge with three floors will leave the shopping centre looking hollowed out Sadly I saw it coming Just before Christmas I was berating myself for getting to the store so late dreading the festive crowds I needn t have worried two days before the big day and it was deserted like a scene in a post apocalyptic disaster movie where of humanity has perished and survivors break into shops to steal provisions I half expected to see a zombie lurch towards me through the rails of discount fleeces If Debenhams were a human being it would have been my cue to scream for the defibrillator 
APR27	Anti-vaxxers are taking populism to a new, deadly level	The two men rode into the village on a motorbike eyewitnesses said and opened fire They left one woman dead and another injured and a trail of fear in their wake Both women were vaccination workers trying to save children from polio and in parts of Pakistan that is a dangerous thing to be Medical teams have repeatedly been attacked amid rumours fuelled by Islamist militants that a national drive to eradicate the disease is cover for a western plot to sterilise children or gather intelligence  In Nigeria too the extremist group Boko Haram has murdered vaccination workers attempting to frighten families out of having their babies protected British parents don t know how lucky we are with our nice safe NHS surgeries and our children who have the vast unfathomable luck to be born right here and now winners of the historical lottery a generation for whom the eradication of so many infectious diseases is within sight Or it could be if some in the west seemingly weren t doing their damnedest to die of ignorance instead 
APR27	Voters are right to fear for their dying villages as Spain goes to the polls	Ra l Romano is proud of Otones de Benjumea his village near Segovia central Spain where he recently organised a feast for people together with music and a talk But Romano does not live in Otones Nor do the vast majority of the members of the village s strong corral n cultural association which organises the annual extravaganza to celebrate the slaughter of pigs and their conversion into cuts of meat sausages and offal  Romano lives in Torrej n de la Calzada a Madrid dormitory town Most of the others live in Segovia or Spain s capital which lies an hour and half away by car All call this my village but it is really where their parents or grandparents come from a place of nostalgia and identity not of daily life At most some have kept up a family house rather then letting it fall down since there are no buyers and spend weekends there The village s permanent population has dropped below down by half in two decades There are no children now Romano s mother passed away last month His father is In a few years time only a dozen or so residents will be left 
APR27	Brady, Batten and the bloody backstop (again): it’s still dark in the sunlit uplands	As the local and European parliament elections heave enticingly into view you will likely find yourself moved by the Conservative party s attempt to expand its electoral appeal beyond recent head trauma victims The Tories are keen to move past the notion that a vote for them is a vote in favour of a government with no pending legislation at all bar the one piece it can t pass  Fire up your thousand yard stares then as Graham Brady chairman of the backbench Committee has apparently got a plan to fix that In general I try not to pay too much attention to Graham who deliberately cultivates the air of a man who d tell someone politely but firmly to move their car at a point to point then nix their planning permission application if they didn t But how can we ignore his reported suggestion that Theresa May should bring the withdrawal agreement bill before the House except with the backstop either stripped out or time limited That Graham and others reckon could command the elusive majority

APR28	My England is in a mess. Scotland’s case for splitting away is stronger than ever	The day of the Scottish independence referendum of I was in Hallglen a large housing estate on the edge of Falkirk As it turned out the town would vote to remain in the UK by to but where I was droves of people were turning out to support the end of the union and the creation of a new country  I had spent time on the estate over the previous weeks and observed a remarkable upsurge of both interest in politics and optimism not least at a Sunday evening public meeting at which hundreds had gathered to talk about how badly their area had fared since the Thatcher years and how breaking from the rotten Westminster consensus might serve it better Now as people went in and out of the polling station I fell into conversation with a thirtysomething man who had a vision of what an independent Scotland might mean for the rest of the UK If we start this we could make a big proper movement for the rest of the country he said And I think we should The poverty in this country us and England and everywhere else shouldn t be happening in 
APR28	I worked on David Attenborough’s documentary. The grim reality gave me climate anxiety	We live in a time of loss Wild places dwindle the animals and plants that live in them disappear Climate change is now a certainty and it will without a doubt lead to the loss of land species and ways of life In the abstract this is disconcerting Up close it is devastating I worked on the BBC s Climate Change The Facts presented by David Attenborough and have felt this pain first hand  Last year I was living a charmed life I graduated from university and jetted off painfully ironic I know to lead an expedition on a remote South Pacific island where I studied one of the world s rarest parrots and the role of culture in conservation Within a few days of my return I somehow stepped into a job at the BBC on a documentary about climate change initially called Two Degrees the name changed when the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change s report released last October informed us that C would be more appropriate and that isn t really very catchy I was to be the show s researcher tasked with finding stories that would best educate and entertain the British public 
APR28	Wife-tracking apps are one sign of Saudi Arabia’s vile regime. Others include crucifixion…	Credit where it s due The Saudi Absher app just described as inhuman by two clearly terrified Saudi refugees also has some fabulous user reviews on its supplier websites Apple and Google Play  To read the surge of five star tributes placed after the app s invaluable contribution to human enslavement was widely exposed earlier in the year is to understand that aside from adding value to Apple and Google Absher is a boon to harassed owners of subordinate women at a time when more and more of this human property is reportedly becoming fractious 
APR28	Forty years ago, Thatcherism swept Britain. Could our new parties repeat the trick?	Forty years ago this week the Conservative party won the UK general election with of the vote netting the country s first female prime minister Margaret Thatcher a comfortable overall majority of seats and setting her up nicely for what turned out to be more than a decade in Downing Street  How things have changed No s current occupant may still be a Tory woman but she presides over a minority government barely worth the name and she s unlikely to be there for more than a few months let alone years And zooming out to look at the party system as a whole the Conservatives now find themselves in a far more diverse and challenging environment than the one that Maggie confronted as she stood on the steps of Downing Street paraphrasing St Francis of Assisi 
APR28	Time has run out. Labour must seize its last chance to take a stand on Brexit	Over the next hours a battle will take place that will settle the future of the Labour party and arguably the country Is Labour to be the party of Europe in uncompromising opposition to the rise of an ugly hard right English nationalism Or will it continue to temporise over Europe so enabling the centre of political gravity to shift towards the English nationalist right  The issue that cannot be fudged is the manifesto on which prospective Labour members of the European parliament will fight the elections on May As it stands the draft is unambiguously pro a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal with remain as the other option That is the position of European MEPs party members and trade unions as it has gone through the varying consultation processes over the last week 
APR28	If an illegal drug let me finish the London Marathon, I’d take it like a shot	If you are reading this on Sunday morning I should be running the London Marathon I say should because as of Friday night I have no idea if I will be able to run at all  I have been training since December Baby runs at first Then longer Then I got lost an unjustly underrated training strategy and turned what was meant to be a mile run into a mile run I finished it without too much trouble and thought for the first time that I just might get there

APR28	Talk of integration is a sideshow in a society where many feel unheard	Uncontrolled migrant flows have made many in Europe more hostile to immigration The failure of migrants to integrate has helped create more fractured societies and exacerbated fears The combination of the two has driven support for the far right  These are almost uncontested views these days The latest warning came from Tony Blair s Institute for Global Change which insists in a new report that a credible policy agenda on integration is a crucial task for social democratic parties necessary to combat the electoral success of rightwing populism 
APR28	Anti-vaxxers are wrong but ridicule is no way to win them over	If someone asked you to describe a typical flat earther what comes to mind Thick headed Witless Just plain crazy Those are certainly adjectives that would have comfortably tripped off my tongue before watching Behind the Curve a documentary on the flat earth movement that s just started streaming on Netflix What s fresh about the film is not what it reveals about the absurdity of flat earther beliefs one of the main areas of contention within the community is whether or not our flat as a saucer planet is covered by a Truman Show style dome It s the affection it makes you feel for its key players  The documentary s director Daniel J Clark wanted to develop our understanding of why flat earthers embrace a belief that science shows to be untrue And so it s the believers enthusiasm their relationships and the sense of community that has built up around this dangerous rejection of science that take centre stage over cheap potshots 
APR28	Anna Sorokin proves we’re all soft touches for glamour scammers	On Thursday in a New York courtroom Anna Sorokin was convicted of a litany of charges four counts of theft of services three of grand larceny and one of attempted grand larceny The story of her brief bright career as a scammer when she floated around the city claiming to be an heiress called Anna Delvey on a cycle of borrowing and defaulting has proved so gripping that it is already being turned into competing projects A New York magazine report from was optioned for Netflix a Vanity Fair story written by the photojournalist who had been swindled by Sorokin and who testified against her is being adapted for HBO by Lena Dunham  Sorokin s convictions for which she faces a prison sentence and deportation to Germany make her the latest in a line of high level fakers elevated to celebrity status by our fascination It s no wonder that Netflix and HBO are involved in turning the saga into entertainment from the Fyre festival to Elizabeth Holmes the disgraced CEO of Theranos not in a week of Avengers overload to be confused with Thanos tales of people promising something they could never or never intended to deliver are everywhere 
APR29	My sexual assault case was dropped when I refused to give police my phone	A few years ago I was violently sexually assaulted by a friend on a night out It was a sustained and sadistic attack that in no way began with consent I made the incredibly difficult decision to report it to the police because I needed to take power back I wanted to look him in the eyes in court and watch him feel a fraction of the helplessness and humiliation that I felt that night I wanted to tell him I had the power now with the full weight of the law behind me Unfortunately it didn t work out as I expected  Even though some time had elapsed between the assault and my reporting of it there was evidence that the police acknowledged as compelling Despite this my case was dropped not because of an unlikely prospect of conviction but because I refused to hand over my mobile phone to be downloaded in its entirety 
APR29	Labour members know what we need: a referendum and a campaign for remain	Jeremy Corbyn s leadership campaign motivated thousands Enthused by an unequivocal principled call to build a fairer Britain and a more peaceful world I was one of hundreds who joined volunteer phone banking sessions In Labour s general election team I played a small part in the by then huge movement which inspired millions to vote for the party and which has since inspired socialist parties across Europe and beyond  Making a decisive break with lowest common denominator politics calling out austerity as a political choice and not a necessity our reinvigorated party has forced cracks into the consensus supporting neoliberal economics worldwide It has helped to restore the fight for social justice to the heart of left politics 
APR29	Why we need to pause before claiming cultural appropriation	Is Gordon Ramsay allowed to cook Chinese food Is it OK to dress up as Disney s Moana Can Jamie Oliver cook jollof rice despite plainly not knowing what it is Exactly what is cultural appropriation To take a glance at Good Morning Britain the ITV show that never takes its finger off the pulse of Middle England s clogged arteries you d think it s a question of white people seeking permission to have fun And in return new media outlets have guaranteed traffic from anxious millennials by listing things that fall into the category of problematic when white people adopt them blaccents bindis and box braids  Why has cultural appropriation an imperfect term mobilised in imperfect contexts become such live ammunition for the socially conscious And what does it mean especially for people of colour when we turn our fire on each other It is striking that a phrase intended to sharpen a political analysis of life under postcolonial capitalism seems to have drawn the most blood between people who share overlapping experiences of racism and displacement 
APR29	I was lied to by a police spy. The inquiry promised the truth but we’re far from it	So now we know When asked the chair of the undercover policing inquiry Sir John Mitting has granted anonymity to two thirds of the police spies who asked for it I am dismayed that Mitting has erred towards keeping the police s secrets although I m not really surprised The chair who is a member of the men only Garrick Club and has described himself as old fashioned has repeatedly shown himself to be out of touch with the realities of institutional sexism racism and political persecution which are what the inquiry is about It is hard not to conclude that he is biased in favour of the police As someone who has invested so much into the fight for answers I am deeply concerned  If you haven t followed my story in I fell in love with a man who did not exist He was charismatic and romantic and shared my interests and dreams We lived as lovers for more than a year He was close to my family and we were the closest friends Then in I received a phone call Mark Stone was not the man I thought I knew He was Mark Kennedy an undercover police officer paid to infiltrate political groups provided with resources to deceive me supervised and followed by a team of cover officers and senior police He was under orders manipulating my emotions and actions according to their operational aims 
APR29	Private schools claim to help the taxpayer. But they serve only the rich	The heads of Britain s private schools are really feeling the pressure How else do you explain their desperate plea to leave them alone because super rich parents are saving the taxpayer billions of pounds a year by sending their offspring to Eton and Harrow  This self serving study in public school economics published by the Independent Schools Council ISC was given pride of place in at least two national newspapers last week It s an old argument that was first shot down in by a panel of academics and private school leaders set up to integrate the public schools with the state system The Public Schools Commission found the claim that parents who choose to pay for their child s education are being hit with a double taxation unimpressive likening it to a childless couple asking for a tax rebate because they weren t drawing any benefit from the schools system 
APR29	Fear of the far right and the collapse of Podemos gave Spain’s socialists victory	Pedro S nchez is the clear winner of Sunday s snap elections in Spain With the highest turnout since the prime minister s Socialist Workers party PSOE won nearly double the number of seats of its closest competitor the conservative Popular Party PP But in the country s highly fragmented political system it is unlikely to govern alone Instead S nchez must look for support from other parties Like many progressive parties in Europe he will have to choose between a technocratic party looking to centralise power and a radical left party that favours decentralisation  S nchez s victory is the result of two main trends First and foremost is the rise of Vox a new openly misogynistic and xenophobic party that toys with nostalgia for Franco s dictatorship Backed by the likes of Steve Bannon Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini and indirectly financed via the Madrid based CitizenGo organisation by a US super PAC with ties to Donald Trump Russian oligarch Aleksei Komov and the Italian MP Luca Volont who is accused of bribery Vox rode a wave of anti Catalan sentiment into the government of Andaluc a in December Sunday s massive turnout was most likely driven by widespread fear of a rightwing coalition government that would include it 
APR29	Some sort of Scottish independence is inevitable. May needs to face up to it	Scotland s first minister Nicola Sturgeon yesterday reiterated her promise to give her country another referendum on independence within the next two years After all if there s an argument for Britons having another Brexit referendum just three years after the last Scotland can surely have another on independence after five years Besides Sturgeon must be thinking was there ever a better moment for divorce from a marriage so dysfunctional as the United Kingdom  Some might wonder what new horror history could unleash on poor Britain After Brexit comes Scexit But Sturgeon is in the ascendant The weekend s polls put her SNP s lead over all other parties at between and points astonishing for a governing party that has been in office for years with Sturgeon as its leader for five In that time the popularity of Scottish independence has risen to an unprecedented support With an electorate that strongly rejected leaving the EU Sturgeon reasonably calculates that this is the moment to strike The difficulties of the Northern Ireland backstop will pale into insignificance beside an Edinburgh one 
APR29	Why aren’t remain-backing parties doing more to attract young people?	Are we entering a new era of political campaigning As Westminster grinds to a halt and the traditional party system teeters at the edge of collapse those seeking progress need only look across the road to Parliament Square where the grass is worn from a year of new protests and new faces  Young people have been a driving force in almost all of these From school climate strikes Extinction Rebellion occupations and multiple Brexit demonstrations my generation has led a new peaceful era of political campaigning 
APR29	Fourth-wave feminism can learn a thing or two from the 1980s play Top Girls	There has been a trend in fourth wave feminism for exploring the stories of women overlooked by history but almost years before Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls Top Girls did it for grownups Caryl Churchill s play now revived at the National Theatre by Lyndsey Turner is perhaps best known for its opening scene a Saturday night dinner party featuring Pope Joan Lady Nij Dull Gret Isabella Bird Patient Griselda and a Thatcherite recruitment manager called Marlene It s a genius opener a dreamlike sequence in which the women share their tales of suffering and patriarchy poignantly but also hilariously as they proceed to get more and more wasted on Frascati It s very very funny It sticks the knife in while you re laughing off guard and then twists it  When I first read Top Girls at the age of I would never have called myself a feminist and I didn t understand it as I do now but I loved it and it was wondrous to finally see it staged since it was written it has hardly been performed which is at odds with the high regard in which the play is held But what I was unprepared for was how little it has dated You come away from the performance not only with a broad perspective of women s history but also with the feeling that not as much has changed as Churchill perhaps would have hoped 
APR29	Nigel Farage is fuelled by the betrayal myth. And Brexit is only the start	It is a grim reflection that no contemporary British politician better understands the networks dynamics and ever changing rules of modern politics than Nigel Farage  He is as effective as he is awful His fledgling Brexit party is not fielding candidates in Thursday s local elections though its baleful spirit will surely loom over the battle for control of English councils in which the Tories are expected to suffer serious losses 
APR30	With the delay to Brexit, Westminster has retreated into fantasy again	The eye of a hurricane can be strangely quiet an ominous calm that presages collision with another wall of storm There is something of that eeriness about the current lull in Brexit related political frenzy The wind dropped before Easter The departure date was delayed to October and parliament went into recess MPs are now back in Westminster and the crisis is not settled yet there is still barely a breeze of urgency  When the cabinet met on Tuesday Brexit was not even on the agenda There is no significant government business scheduled for the Commons chamber all week It is hard to legislate for life beyond Brexit without having legislated for Brexit first But Theresa May still doesn t have a majority for her deal and Jeremy Corbyn has no interest in bailing her out with opposition votes 
APR30	Judging by the Home Office, it’s now Tory policy to ruin Britain	It is now exactly a year since Amber Rudd resigned as home secretary and it feels as if the Home Office is as broken as ever if not more so There is something of the bleakness of the Arab spring about it all An unimaginable revolt happened a despot was overthrown and for a brief moment it seemed that the time of dystopian oppression was over before the deep state regrouped and imposed a tyranny redux  Since Windrush all we have seen is pathetic attempts at compensating victims and more scandals Presiding over it all is the new benevolent dictator Sajid Javid who speaks in the language of a man who knows how to pay lip service to the forces that removed his predecessor while doubling down on policies that have not changed but are merely fronted by a new more media friendly face One that does not hesitate to point out as often as possible that it is a brown one 
APR30	Cambridge is right: you can’t take pride in the past and ignore the horror of slavery	There is almost nothing Oxbridge people enjoy more than a really intense no holds barred argument about themselves  So it s perhaps not surprising that the University of Cambridge s decision to launch an inquiry into its links to the slave trade has prompted some soul searching On the one hand is a student body increasingly vocal about the legacy of colonialism and academics arguing as Prof Martin Millett the archaeologist chairing a panel overseeing the work does that Cambridge must confront its own role in a shameful episode of history On the other is a handful of academics grumbling about rewriting history and no doubt some unspoken fears about what all this is going to cost both financially and in curricular terms After investigation invariably comes reparation 
APR30	Labour needn’t worry: in its northern heartlands, Brexiters are not the only voices	 I voted out Out means out and I d do it again said the old man as he harrumphed off up Kirkgate on his mobility scooter Wakefield voted to in favour of leave so here was the perfect vox pop Bank it let it stand for northern working class leavedom and head back south  But what of the other voices I heard in the windswept West Yorkshire market precinct outside the cathedral Fed upness with all politics indignation at Westminster chaos resentment at three wasted years of empty argy bargy A few people said they wouldn t vote again in another referendum they were just too disillusioned Bring back Guy Fawkes one man joked Plenty of well justified grudge but there were plenty of switchers too Resentful not ode to joy converts but weary givers in to the realities trade offs and hard choices that were never revealed during the referendum 
APR30	Clinton-era politics refuses to die. Joe Biden is its zombie that staggers on	You cannot understand politics in America until you understand that in the Democratic party which ostensibly represents the left side of our nation s political spectrum there are a significant number of people who genuinely believe that Joe Biden is the best possible presidential nominee Their belief is not cynical or at least not wholly cynical  His constituency is real It is not illuminating to think of them just as centrists arguing for the gentlest sprinkling of sugar over the top of America s poison It s better to think of them as zombies the product of three decades of self serving triangulating brainwashing They are the Democrats who had their eyelids propped open and were forced to watch the Clinton era year after year after year It is not so much that they do not deep down harbor a vague wish for a better world it is that like stray dogs dining exclusively on garbage life has taught them that this is the best that they will ever get 
APR30	Tommy Robinson wants to be an MEP. But we in the north-west can stop him	Tommy Robinson or Stephen Yaxley Lennon if we want to refer to him by his real name announced last week that he s standing for the north west of England in the European elections The former British National party BNP member wants to take the same seat that his then leader Nick Griffin held from to Tommy Robinson is a far right thug who went from being a member of the BNP to co founding the English Defence League EDL  He talks about standing up for ordinary working class people but he is not interested in real solutions to the problems faced by the working classes in the north west His answer to the despair people feel after more than a decade of austerity and Tory attacks on the welfare state is to scapegoat Muslims and migrants Robinson s EDL was an inspiration for far right terrorist Anders Breivik who killed people in Norway on 
APR30	Gwyneth Paltrow and Pete Buttigieg: a match made in intellectual hell	There are so many people running for president in the US it is hard to keep track of who s who So let s begin with a reminder that year old Pete Buttigieg known as Mayor Pete by those who like him and Mayo Pete by those who don t is the Smart Candidate He speaks eight languages he taught himself Norwegian so he could read an author s untranslated work he plays piano he loves Ulysses Imagining yourself in a book club with Pete Buttigieg is this election s having a beer with George W Bush the New York Times recently opined  It is not clear whether Gwyneth Paltrow has been imagining herself in a book club with Buttigieg but the actor certainly fancies the well read wunderkind for president She will be co hosting a fundraiser for the candidate on May tickets start at gets you a picture with the man himself Knowing Paltrow you might even get a Buttigieg branded vagina egg to go home with 
APR30	Of course the Victorians walked faster. They didn’t have Instagram and map apps	It turns out that for the past years anyone following standard walking directions has unintentionally been playing a game of Are you fitter than a Victorian mountaineer As a result Ordnance Survey has finally decided that it is going to shake things up and provide st century directions for st century walkers with an update to the way it works out how long a given walk should take  Something obvious you want to know before you lace up your walking boots and set off into the wilderness is when you might expect to reach your destination and the standard rule of thumb for working out whether you re about to set out on a brief stroll or a back breaking endurance test was formulated by William Naismith the founder of the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 
APR30	Humanity has truly lost its way if we’re weaponising beluga whales	Last week a curious scene played out in the small Norwegian fishing village of Inga Here a mysterious white beluga whale appeared from out of the water and proceeded to behave very strangely Upon the body of this whale there was a strap Upon the fabric of this strap was written a long chain of human hieroglyphs Equipment of St Petersburg the writing said And then almost as if it were all a dream the whale disappeared Although it sounds like something Douglas Adams could have written I want to welcome you to the dizzying age of weaponised whales Because as well as poisoning oceans we humans are also capable of poisoning the minds of the animals that live there  First some background If the idea of the Russians using such a beautiful and intelligent organism to further their military aims disgusts you I should tell you that many countries particularly the US have programmes that train dolphins and other species including sea lions for military exercises These marine mammals can be trained to detect mines or assist in object recoveries They can be trained to do search and rescue missions too In fact as of the US navy was spending m a year on its marine programme involving mine sweeping dolphins 
APR30	Looking for comment on the royal baby? Don’t ask me	Here are some of the things that people are saying about mixed race babies at the moment websites have run stories about the viral mixed race children of Instagram who are trending because of their gorgeous blonde hair light eyes and golden skin that looks like sand White teenagers in conversations that I have both overheard and been privy to say I really want to have kids with a black guy because mixed race babies are so cute I just love their curly hair and oh my God the ones with freckles  The Kardashians who have been accused by some people of turning that particular fantasy into reality are a never ending source of related commentary Kylie Jenner is currently causing people to fall all over themselves with praise because she learned how to do her mixed race daughter s hair 
MAY1	May was right to sack Gavin Williamson. No one will be sorry to see him go	There have been spectacular resignations of British defence secretaries Michael Heseltine over the Westland affair in comes immediately to mind But there has not been a spectacular sacking of a defence secretary in the modern era until now with the firing of Gavin Williamson The contrast does not end there Heseltine was a genuinely major figure who quit over his belief in backing British and European defence suppliers Williamson is a genuine minnow who got himself fired because of his ambition   No government can be successful which cannot keep its secrets the Labour premier Clem Attlee famously said
MAY1	The hounding of Greta Thunberg is proof that the right has run out of ideas	Over the past few days something extraordinary has happened in our politics A bunch of grown men have begun bullying a schoolgirl Perhaps you already know who I mean Greta Thunberg she of the pigtails and school strikes who came to Westminster last week and slammed adoring MPs for posturing rather than taking action on climate breakdown then hoofed it over to St Pancras for the hour train ride back to Stockholm  Which left the eco denialists back here with a stonking great headache how to bash this year old celeb Not by dismantling her arguments not when the scientists and Sir David of Blue Planet back her up Nor by sniffing around her record since by definition a teenager hasn t much of a past to rake over The standard methods of political warfare off limits to them they are trying something new and unusual They are sinking their teeth into her 
MAY1	I was sore about losing to Caster Semenya. But this decision against her is wrong	A lot will be written by scientists activists lawyers bureaucrats and others about Caster Semenya s discrimination case But women athletes are rarely heard from especially those who have competed against Semenya and other women alleged by the International Association of Athletics Federations to have unfair athletic abilities as a result of naturally elevated testosterone levels  I competed for Australia in the m against Semenya at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin Today I am convinced that the court of arbitration for sport s decision to endorse rules aimed at excluding Semenya and other women athletes with naturally high levels of testosterone is the wrong one 
MAY1	Jeremy Corbyn is either blind to antisemitism – or he just doesn’t care	I m trying to imagine the left s reaction if it emerged that a leading politician had once lavished praise on a century old book that not only trotted out racist stereotypes about say black people and their supposed characteristics but whose central thesis rested on an ancient hostile assumption about that group Would good progressive folk be rushing to defend that politician by saying the author of the book in question had also written lots of important non offensive things and that other people had quoted that author too so this was a fuss about nothing or would they be appalled and even sickened that a contemporary politician could praise such a text without so much as mentioning the racism within it  It turns out that the answer is it depends which side the politician is on and also perhaps which ethnic minority is involved If the politician is the current leader of the Labour party and the minority involved are Jews well then it seems the usual progressive reflexes don t always kick in 
MAY1	Poverty is holding Britain’s young people back. They deserve so much better	As A level exams draw nearer I have returned to teaching Arthur Miller s Death of a Salesman A cautionary tale on being wedded to an ideal that is unattainable it has left my students ultimately frustrated with the central character Willy Why can t he think outside the box he hems himself into they wonder He could have been bolder with his ambitions in the way we their teachers encourage them to be  Making young people aspirational is the bread and butter of teachers everywhere It forms the background noise of our daily dealings with our students Each lesson of each day we bargain with them if you stop fidgeting and concentrate if you apply yourself with maximum effort you will eventually be rewarded For students from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds it s a carrot forever dangled before them Hard work begets success a future of fulfilment and financial ease they are told Will Smith said so in his umpteenth motivational video so it must be true What is left unspoken but no less definitively delivered is that failure can only be considered a predictable result of indolence 
MAY1	How ultra-remainers could score a spectacular own goal on Brexit	In three weeks time it is entirely plausible that Nigel Farage s Brexit party will triumph in the European parliamentary elections It will be the greatest victory for bigotry in politics since the EU referendum campaign it will be a shot in the arm for the Tory hard Brexiteers emboldening them and providing them with renewed legitimacy it will damage the chances of a soft Brexit and it will inflict probably terminal harm on any prospect of a second referendum Preventing this completely and utterly inarguable outcome should you would think preoccupy every single remainer and every single self declared opponent of Tory rule It doesn t because for the stop Brexit or bust brigade punishing Labour for failing to repudiate a referendum that it lost less than three years ago is all that apparently matters in politics and if the country burns as a consequence then so be it  Yesterday Labour s national executive committee reaffirmed the party s position on Brexit that is it would prioritise a general election to remove the Tories from power and if that wasn t possible it would support all options remaining on the table including campaigning for a public vote This isn t controversial you would think it would be odd for the NEC to usurp the decision of the party s sovereign body and until now the conference policy has been lauded by advocates of a second referendum Yet for the monomaniacal ultra remainers who treat those of us who campaigned and voted for remain but are willing to accept compromise as bitter enemies on a par with Nigel Farage or Jacob Rees Mogg this is a great betrayal that makes voting Labour a disgrace 
MAY1	Why I will be protesting against Mark Carney on Thursday	As the adage goes There are decades when nothing happens and there are weeks when decades happen After decades of climate complacency for those in the environmental movement it certainly feels like we might be living in those weeks  Direct action by striking students and Extinction Rebellion has propelled the climate emergency to the top of the news and the political agenda But while protesters have quite rightly called on the government to take more responsibility the City of London has largely escaped the firing line 
MAY1	Now we know: conventional campaigning won’t prevent our extinction	The fact of the matter is finally settled Not the fact that if we do not stop putting carbon into the atmosphere our children will starve That was settled three decades ago Rather that the only way to prevent our extinction is through mass participation civil disobedience thousands of people breaking the laws of our governments until they are forced take action to protect us In less than a year Extinction Rebellion has gone from people in a room to creating the biggest organised civil disobedience campaign in British history In the past two weeks more than a thousand people have been arrested and as a result the climate and ecological crisis is finally on the political agenda Everyone from the Labour party to the Sun newspaper is accepting we are right we face the destruction of the next generation unless immediate emergency action is taken For millions of people this week the penny has finally dropped this is real and it s terrifyingly serious Even Michael Gove says he is hearing the message and held a meeting with XR on Tuesday  None of this was unplanned Extinction Rebellion didn t come out the blue Two years ago a group of researchers and activists started to meet to seriously consider two questions why has campaigning failed so catastrophically over the past generation and how can we make it work There are no more important questions facing our society and the global community 
MAY1	Britain’s countryside is dominated by bullies – as Chris Packham has found	I ve often thought watching the felling of ancient trees the slaughter of wildlife and the stripping of topsoil I love this land more than the owner does While there are plenty of careful landowners there are others who seem to despise their own property Those of us who love the land struggle against its owners to protect it from ruin  For centuries challenging the way the land is used has been treated as a trespass we are told that it is none of our business Yet this is the very fabric of our nation Conflicts over its treatment are portrayed in the billionaire press as a war between town and country But this isn t about rural versus urban it s about power As Guy Shrubsole s crucial book Who Owns England shows major rural and urban landowners are often the same people 
MAY1	High streets can be saved. Here’s how to reinvent them for the 21st century	The statistics on high street decline are bewildering The average high street in England and Wales has lost shops in the past five years More than retail jobs are expected to be lost this year After a certain point the numbers stop meaning anything We lose sight of the real picture So when Debenhams last week named the stores it plans to close in many will have tuned out Haven t we heard this before  But in reality that announcement will have hit people hard and not just because of the jobs at risk In Ashford and Kirkcaldy the Debenhams closures come soon after the shuttering of the local Marks Spencer Wolverhampton s Debenhams only opened in amid much fanfare that this was the start of a new wave of regeneration Make no mistake these announcements matter 
MAY2	Rat or stitch-up victim: how will history judge Gavin Williamson?	Is Gavin Williamson a disloyal rat or is he a Tory Julian Assange a valiant champion of open government in an age of secrecy Is he a menace to national security or is he the innocent victim of a toffs stitch up For an answer we may have to await a future memoir from one of the participants in this episode But even then the essence of a leak is deniability The wink the nod the I could not possibly say or ask me and watch if I smile followed by a ring round to substantiate  What is clear is that Williamson was accused by the prime minister of leaking a National Security Council discussion of the Chinese corporation Huawei s involvement in the G mobile phone network was found guilty and was sacked This was done before he was put in a position to prove his innocence 
MAY2	I’m a police officer in London. Here’s why we’ve lost control of the streets	There s a saying in the police It s not sophisticated or clever really and it s been passed down from generation to generation of coppers it s not new The job is fucked they say Only now it doesn t feel as flippant as it used to  I m a police officer in the Metropolitan police and have been since I have anxiety and PTSD I am and I cannot say this strongly enough exhausted I do not feel safe policing London s streets and moreover increasingly I do not feel that people in London are safe Just last night there was another double stabbing in east London resulting in the death of a year old boy 
MAY2	A Tory/Labour Brexit deal is further away than ever. Here’s why	For a few weeks there seems to have been an unspoken but collective decision to take a breather from Brexit After months of high drama the will of the people appears to be to talk about almost anything else Even a grievous national security leak has been seen by some as form of respite  But as people look the other way are things actually moving behind the scenes Briefings from both the government and Labour have claimed the talks have made progress and are heading towards a conclusion Could we at last be about to see a genuine Brexit breakthrough 
MAY2	Trump Jr, Bolsonaro Jr … beware the Adult Idiot Sons of unhinged presidents	There is an emerging political phenomenon that poses a unique threat to international stability and our collective sanity It is the growing influence of what is sometimes known in political jargon as the Idiot Adult Son From Donald Trump to Benjamin Netanyahu Jair Bolsonaro to Rodrigo Duterte the world s most awful leaders all seem to have knuckleheaded offspring who are doing their best to be just like Dad and doing a lot of damage in the process  The Idiot Adult Son by the way should not confused with the Large Adult Son a meme that sprung up recently The latter is basically an overgrown overprivileged man child annoying but largely harmless The IAS on the other hand is a loose cannon whose attempts to gain the attention and affection of his father often result in a diplomatic incident Eric Trump is a Large Adult Son Donald Trump Jr he of the awkward Russian meetings is an Idiot Adult Son Ivanka is a Machiavellian Adult Daughter but that s another article 
MAY2	Today’s vote must give the Conservatives the fatal blow they deserve	This could be the day the dam breaks the day that collapses what s left of the Tory party which on Wednesday night found itself embroiled in another hasty rearranging of the cabinet after the firing of defence secretary Gavin Williamson Today the country may finally rebel as people get out there and vote against a near decade of senseless slash and burn Enough  The conventional complaint is that people voting today will not cast their ballot on the quality of their local authority services but lazily use it as a vote on national politics Please begs the Westminster government judge your council not us But that has become an absurdity The government has cut councils so close to the bone that there is less and less difference between their political complexions on the ground Labour and Tory councils alike struggle to cover their barest statutory duties to safeguard children at risk and care for the frail elderly with little leeway to choose other political priorities 
MAY2	It’s disgraceful that nuclear weapons are being celebrated at Westminster Abbey	On October at the height of the Cuban missile crisis the US navy dropped depth charges on the Soviet nuclear submarine B With the vessel damaged and cut off from communication with Moscow its captain Valentin Savitsky assumed that the US and USSR were now at war and thus initiated steps to fire its nuclear torpedo at US forces Protocol demanded that all three of the senior officers should approve the launch Although one officer agreed with Savitsky the other Vasili Arkhipov vetoed the decision The world came within a whisker of thermonuclear war  The continued proliferation of nuclear weaponry represents one of the greatest threats to humanity s long term survival Yet tomorrow Westminster Abbey is hosting a service to celebrate years of Britain s continuous at sea deterrent that is having a nuclear armed submarine on constant sea patrol ready to attack or threaten anyone anywhere any time As part of a series of events led by the Royal Navy the invitation only congregation including Prince William will be asked to rejoice at this dubious achievement and somewhat incongruously to pray for peace 
MAY2	It's painfully clear: today's Congress wouldn't have impeached Richard Nixon	There was a point during the Senate s alternate grilling and chilling with Attorney General Bill Barr when you could hear the ghost of Richard Nixon crying  Nixon took one final helicopter flight from the White House a generation too soon He shuffled off this mortal coil a decade too early for redemption 
MAY2	The hounding of Greta Thunberg is proof that the right has run out of ideas	Over the past few days something extraordinary has happened in our politics A bunch of grown men have begun bullying a schoolgirl Perhaps you already know who I mean Greta Thunberg she of the pigtails and school strikes who came to Westminster last week and slammed adoring MPs for posturing rather than taking action on climate breakdown then hoofed it over to St Pancras for the hour train ride back to Stockholm  Which left the eco denialists back here with a stonking great headache how to bash this year old celeb Not by dismantling her arguments not when the scientists and Sir David of Blue Planet back her up Nor by sniffing around her record since by definition a teenager hasn t much of a past to rake over The standard methods of political warfare off limits to them they are trying something new and unusual They are sinking their teeth into her 
MAY2	Instagram hiding its likes is no bad thing, but young people will find a way round it	I used to love Instagram Amid the family politics and local gossip of Facebook and the unpredictable snark of Twitter my little private Instagram account felt like a pleasant place to be It s still the only social media app I use with any regularity But lately I ve been trying to extricate myself from its surprisingly tight grip My muscle memory still goes to press the icon when I m on the train with no signal but my brain has started to wonder why Why keep checking this when it s unlikely to have changed from when I last checked it two minutes ago And there s a quieter voice too more frank and ashamed why am I still looking at something that has a tendency to make not just me but plenty of people I know feel bad about our own lives  For those who use comparisons as a stick to beat themselves up with this is a step in the right direction
MAY2	My organisation helped Leeds lower child obesity. Here’s how to do it nationwide	With nearly a quarter of five year olds starting school overweight or obese the need for effective action to tackle obesity has never been greater Just one in children obese at age five will return to a healthy weight by age so focusing efforts on the early years is the most effective strategy That is why the success of Leeds in lowering its obesity rate has made the news and why the charity I work for Henry Health Exercise Nutrition for the Really Young is so keen to continue its good work there across the country  At Henry we have developed an innovative and effective approach with training for early years workers and eight week family programmes delivered in Leeds for years particularly in more disadvantaged areas The initiative uses a model that can be adopted anywhere and so could potentially be rolled out across the country as a key part of obesity reduction efforts 
MAY3	Labour’s bid for leave voters is failing. It must now look to remainers	The voters blow a big raspberry to the two main parties and both react the same way OK OK we hear you You just want us to get on with Brexit That was the line following Thursday s council elections across much of England from both the prime minister and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell although the latter was quick to clarify that when he tweeted Brexit sort it Message received that didn t strictly speaking mean he wanted Brexit to happen just that the issue needed to be sorted out whichever way So that clears that up  Reading losses for both the governing and main opposition parties as a rejection of their handling of the issue that has consumed them both has an obvious logic It s a logic likely to gain extra force in less than three weeks when Nigel Farage s Brexit party could well top the poll at the European elections Why else would voters call down a plague on both the Tory and Labour houses unless they were furious at their failure to implement what the public voted for in 
MAY3	Is fair play in running more important than fairness to Caster Semenya as a human?	When she was a girl growing up in rural South Africa the runner Caster Semenya would sometimes face a humiliating ritual before a race She grew accustomed her coaches once said to having to retreat to the bathroom with a member of a suspicious rival athletics team and physically show them that she was not a boy From her childhood people had gossiped about her body by the time she had begun competing internationally she must have been used to the whispers the open stares in changing rooms  All her life she has been portrayed as a freak an anomaly of nature undeserving of her gold medals And as if having her femaleness constantly questioned wasn t enough as a black South African athlete and a lesbian she attracts more than her share of kneejerk prejudice To argue that this Olympic athlete has somehow had it easy because of her biology feels grotesque in the circumstances But nothing about this case is simple 
MAY3	The silence on Christian persecution is because of trade, not political correctness	The foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has been denouncing the persecution of Christians around the world in advance of a report he has commissioned from the Bishop of Truro It s true and important that Christians are being persecuted in large numbers especially in the Middle East and that this has been largely ignored by the British media for decades But there is something very jarring in Hunt s discovery of their cause  In remarks to the press in Addis Ababa the capital of Ethiopia one of the oldest Christian countries in the world he blamed political correctness as well as post colonial guilt for the British indifference to the suffering of Christians in Asia and Africa There is certainly some truth to these accusations The view that all religious believers were weird at best and that anyone enlightened must be an atheist were quite fashionable in the early years of this century It was usually expressed as hostility to Muslims as much as in indifference to the sufferings of Christians but it certainly wasn t sympathy 
MAY3	Rory Stewart's promotion to DfID is bad news for Britain's prisons	Rory Stewart wasn t responsible for the National Security Council Huawei leak His move from prisons minister to the Department for International Development was not of his own doing But it nonetheless came at a good time for the Eton educated ex soldier who according to rumours may be played by Orlando Bloom in a biopic of his life  Stewart leaves behind a failing prison system in which violence is at record levels and according to the most recent prison watchdog report is struggling to deal with a drugs crisis that is out of control It comes as little surprise that British prisons are failing there s been a increase in the number of offenders locked up in the last years reoffending leading to a return to prison is rising and according to the Prison Reform Trust there s soon to be a cash shortfall of m in the government s investment proposals While some working around the prison system have praised Stewart for his energy focus and critical thinking his efforts were actually failing 
MAY3	The Lib Dems forgot that success was possible. That could now change	There is a clear story from the local elections last night a Liberal Democrat surge It is important to note that voters see local elections as an opportunity to protest and register their discontent with the sitting party Even so the Tory party s performance was excruciatingly bad One might have expected those gains to have gone to the main opposition party too Instead Labour has lost seats Those wishing to protest the current government have voted for the Lib Dems or Greens instead  But it is the Lib Dems that have gained territory all over the map They increased their majorities in places they already hold such as North Norfolk They crept into Brexiteer areas such as Hinkley and Bosworth in Leicestershire which voted to leave in the EU referendum In Theresa May s constituency of Windsor and Maidenhead they cut a Tory majority of down to five But a major part of the story is the huge swing from Tories to Lib Dems in the area often referred to as the former Lib Dem heartlands the south west The Lib Dems were almost wiped out there in the general election now they are claiming it back 
MAY3	Could Penny Mordaunt become Theresa May’s emotionally intelligent successor?	When Penny Mordaunt moved into her ministerial office in the Department for International Development she was offered a choice of items from the government art collection to adorn the walls It s a perilous process for any politician choose something classic and appear uncool go for something contemporary and risk looking try hard or worse if you re a Tory politician have the artist declare that they despise the government As communities secretary Eric Pickles tried to show he had an open mind with both a portrait of Benjamin Disraeli and William Gladstone while George Osborne caused a stir by picking Grayson Perry s Print for a Politician  Mordaunt in the end opted for neither option She shunned the convention and the collection instead bringing in her own picture from home of Admiral Lord Nelson Expect the same picture to hang in her new office in the Ministry of Defence following Mordaunt s promotion this week to one of the great offices of state in the wake of Gavin Williamson s sacking for allegedly leaking details of a National Security Council meeting to the press 
MAY3	It’s hard for us on the Israeli left – liberal antisemitism makes it worse	The New York Times apologised this week for a cartoon published recently in its international edition The drawing was of a blind Donald Trump wearing a skullcap led by the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was depicted as a dog wearing a star of David collar The cartoon evoked caricatures of evil Jews misleading blind nations of a kind popular in the German media during the Nazi era  The reaction in both the US and Israel was first shock then a furore The cartoon couldn t have come at a worse time the San Diego synagogue shooting last weekend proved that antisemitism is still deeply rooted in the US And it came just as Israel prepared to remember million Jews on the national Holocaust Remembrance Day For New York Times columnist Bret Stephens the cartoon checked so many antisemitic boxes that the only thing missing was a dollar sign The Jew in the form of a dog the small cunning Jew leading a naive American hated Trump depicted as blind and Judaised a puppet of the Jewish state as if Trump needs Netanyahu to make him act the way he does 
MAY3	Kids hugging: that’s no big deal. Or so I used to think	I don t remember being ordered to hug people when I was a child but I remember being made to hold hands Sweaty papery vice like limp God all the hands one has to hold as a child It s not a big deal And of course it s unavoidable for safety but I remember disliking it the sense of obligation and the fact you never knew what hand you would get Long after the fact there came a moment when I realised merciful heaven I didn t have to hold any more hands  Hugs were different a social necessity rather a safety measure and in the s and s and probably s they were also something from which you couldn t opt out Again it didn t seem like a big deal at the time There were circumstances in which it was polite to offer a hug and polite to accept one Weathering a bad hug meant standing still while someone crushed you vaguely to their midsection before wandering off to do something else If you didn t enjoy this too bad 
MAY3	Men, don’t fear the snip – it’s the best way to share the burden of birth control	My husband doesn t want a vasectomy I don t blame him it might be a minute procedure carried out under local anaesthetic but it s not exactly a spa treatment When I suggested it might be the answer to our family planning he winced and joked that he had seen what the snip did to the dog  He s not alone in his reticence there was a decline in the number of men getting the procedure in the years to But the thing is he and I have finished having babies and I feel like my turn should be over A vasectomy would feel like a feminist action on his part an acknowledgment of everything I have been through that has got us to this point in our lives 
MAY3	William Barr is acting like Trump's henchman	William Barr has shown himself to be a loyal foot soldier for the president who appointed him From his March summary of the principal conclusions of the Mueller report to his press conference on the day he released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress to his testimony on Wednesday before the Senate judiciary committee Barr s recent performances have demonstrated the extreme loyalty Donald Trump found wanting in his first attorney general Jeff Sessions  And what is good for the president is bad for America 
MAY4	A girls’ night out with the PM and her posse for £135,000? Bargain	As if Conservative donors were not resentful enough where they haven t already complied with Boris Johnson s injunction to fuck off it is now clear thanks to the Treasury secretary Liz Truss by what a prodigious margin some of them must have overpaid for a basic minister experience It s ages since a party chairman quoted as the starting price to get near David Cameron  A photograph posted on Truss s Instagram account last week showed six female cabinet members and the prime minister assembled beside a wealthy woman of Russian origin Lubov Chernukhin had gifted herself their presence in an auction at the latest Black and White Tory fundraiser for ie less than apiece for hours of proximity to Karen Bradley Northern Ireland secretary Baroness Evans leader of the Lords Caroline Nokes immigration Amber Rudd Andrea Leadsom Truss and smiling alongside Mrs C Theresa May 
MAY4	Is Line of Duty Britain’s first gender-neutral police drama?	At the time of writing there was no way of knowing how Line of Duty will unfold  Will Superintendent Ted Hastings played by Adrian Dunbar be revealed as criminal overlord H Will the antidote finally be found to stop characters saying OCG every seconds Over on Sky Arts a South Bank Show featuring writer Jed Mercurio interviewed by Melvyn Bragg looks interesting I ve long been impressed by Mercurio s penchant for stuffing his dramas full of working class talent 
MAY4	Jamie Bell and why it’s time to talk turkey about accents	By This Morning s standards its interview with Jamie Bell who stars as Bernie Taupin in the new Elton John biopic Rocketman was pretty by the book The mid morning show has after all featured women who have had sexual encounters with ghosts more than once Phillip Schofield testing a nipple clamp celebrity foot readings and a woman with a phobia of Simon Cowell so a promotional chat for a film was unlikely to be weirdest daytime TV moments ever listicle fodder  Bell came across well was enthusiastic about Rocketman and happy to talk about his career But as one tabloid pointed out viewers were left confused by his American twang Bell who is from Teesside but has lived in the US for the past or so years has picked up a bit of an accent by not living in the place he s from for pretty much half of his life and noticing when people have picked up a bit of an accent is something of a national sport 
MAY4	Thursday's results mean there's only one way forward: ask the people	Local elections are inevitably and rightly about local issues but there s no getting away from the reality that Brexit played a big part in the shocking results that began rolling in on Thursday night  Those votes make clear that a general election would not deliver a decisive victory to either side A new parliament would be just as split both on Brexit and on all the other issues that face our country as the existing one The Tories had a catastrophic night losing more than seats but Labour s support is draining away as well John McDonnell said on the evening of polling day that he expected more than gains And hours later it looks like Labour has lost almost councillors since these seats were last up for election in when we had one of the worst results in the history of our party 
MAY4	Labour’s bid for leave voters is failing. It must now look to remainers	The voters blow a big raspberry to the two main parties and both react the same way OK OK we hear you You just want us to get on with Brexit That was the line following Thursday s council elections across much of England from both the prime minister and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell although the latter was quick to clarify that when he tweeted Brexit sort it Message received that didn t strictly speaking mean he wanted Brexit to happen just that the issue needed to be sorted out whichever way So that clears that up  Reading losses for both the governing and main opposition parties as a rejection of their handling of the issue that has consumed them both has an obvious logic It s a logic likely to gain extra force in less than three weeks when Nigel Farage s Brexit party could well top the poll at the European elections Why else would voters call down a plague on both the Tory and Labour houses unless they were furious at their failure to implement what the public voted for in

MAY4	Goodbye, intrepid soldier Gavin Williamson – here are your best bits!	Straight off the bat I ll remind you that Gavin Williamson s Instagram avatar is a picture of him standing in a risk free environment in a flak jacket and we ll go from there  Everyone s favourite purchaser of Action Man toys has been sacked from the cabinet after being fingered for a leak from the National Security Council NSC The defence secretary leaking from a national security meeting is not the best look but is anybody really surprised If Williamson worked for MI he would be sure to mention it at every single party he wasn t invited to 
MAY4	Countryside versus town? Please don’t turn this into a culture war	Selina Scott is rewilding her acre farm on the edge of the North York Moors She says she reluctantly decided to control crows to protect endangered ground nesting birds including lapwing and curlew that nest on her new wetlands But the Yorkshire born broadcaster turned farmer complains she cannot save her threatened birds because her brother Robin a former editor of Sporting Gun magazine is now banned from shooting the crows that prey on helpless chicks  Town and country need each other From one flows ideas and people The other provides peace and quiet space and food
MAY4	It’s hard for us on the Israeli left – liberal antisemitism makes it worse	The New York Times apologised this week for a cartoon published recently in its international edition The drawing was of a blind Donald Trump wearing a skullcap led by the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was depicted as a dog wearing a star of David collar The cartoon evoked caricatures of evil Jews misleading blind nations of a kind popular in the German media during the Nazi era  The reaction in both the US and Israel was first shock then a furore The cartoon couldn t have come at a worse time the San Diego synagogue shooting last weekend proved that antisemitism is still deeply rooted in the US And it came just as Israel prepared to remember million Jews on the national Holocaust Remembrance Day For New York Times columnist Bret Stephens the cartoon checked so many antisemitic boxes that the only thing missing was a dollar sign The Jew in the form of a dog the small cunning Jew leading a naive American hated Trump depicted as blind and Judaised a puppet of the Jewish state as if Trump needs Netanyahu to make him act the way he does 
MAY4	The silence on Christian persecution is because of trade, not political correctness	The foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has been denouncing the persecution of Christians around the world in advance of a report he has commissioned from the Bishop of Truro It s true and important that Christians are being persecuted in large numbers especially in the Middle East and that this has been largely ignored by the British media for decades But there is something very jarring in Hunt s discovery of their cause  In remarks to the press in Addis Ababa the capital of Ethiopia one of the oldest Christian countries in the world he blamed political correctness as well as post colonial guilt for the British indifference to the suffering of Christians in Asia and Africa There is certainly some truth to these accusations The view that all religious believers were weird at best and that anyone enlightened must be an atheist were quite fashionable in the early years of this century It was usually expressed as hostility to Muslims as much as in indifference to the sufferings of Christians but it certainly wasn t sympathy 
MAY5	Saudi Arabia’s sudden interest in Sudan is not about friendship. It is about fear	In the days following the Yom Kippur war after the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat agreed to a ceasefire and subsequent peace treaty with Israel he faced questions at home about his climbdown When confronted on his capitulation he is reported to have said that he was prepared for battle with Israel but not with America On the third day of the war President Nixon had authorised Operation Nickel Grass an airlift from the United States with the purpose of replenishing Israel s military losses up to that point In November of the New York Times reported that Western ambassadors in Cairo confirm Egyptian accusations that American Galaxies were landing war equipment in the Sinai  There was something of Sadat s realpolitik in the realisation over the past few weeks that Saudi Arabia has no intention of letting Sudan s revolution achieve its objective of removing the military once and for all and installing a civilian government In the period preceding the revolution Saudi Arabia had grown relatively lethargic and jaded about Sudan a country it saw as good only for providing bodies as battle fodder for its war in Yemen When Sudan s then president Omar al Bashir fearful of his demise took his begging bowl to his allies in the region Saudi Arabia demurred But this lack of interest evaporated the moment it became clear that there was real power in Sudan s streets and Bashir was deposed 
MAY5	Don’t look to national politics for hope: you’ll find it thriving in local councils	Last Friday morning my head spun Having voted in two local elections for our town and district councils and then spent the first few hours of the next day following the results my partner and I got our polling cards for yet another contest This caused a brief fit of amusement about Brexit Britain s weird addiction to sending us to polling stations before we realised we had effectively received our tickets for an awful reality TV show  Thanks chiefly to Nigel Farage s Brexit party and the pithily named Change UK the Independent Group many of the contestants in the looming European elections form a rum old crowd From a former BBC newsreader through superannuated Tories and newspaper columnists on to the former editor of the lads magazine Loaded with the independent candidate who calls himself Tommy Robinson as the rubbish punchline God knows what the poor souls who have diligently served as MEPs must feel about this sudden gatecrashing of their world here is yet another woeful instalment of the Brexit drama now replayed by celebrity leave and remain campaigners as a pantomime of futile gestures 
MAY5	For our dedicated food readers, the dinner is in the detail	It is delicious to think that the Guardian s weekly food magazine Feast now comes along with the other Saturday supplements in a compostable bag made partly from potatoes Selection preparation presentation and consumption of food is universal Readers care about the topic and have a lot of knowledge to contribute Constructive contact is regular among readers my office and the editorial team involved in this heartily appreciated section of the Guardian and Observer  Inevitably my office may be involved when things go wrong but overwhelmingly things go right I may use corrections here to illustrate points but I write in praise of what is a skilful and sophisticated journalistic operation Thought goes into what ingredients are seasonal and sustainable Footnotes give specific fish sustainability policy for each of the UK US and Australia Expertise and practicality are prized and shared 
MAY5	Why are so many afraid to confront Britain’s historical links with the slave trade?	Seldom have so many people taken to print and the airwaves to make the case for academic incuriosity Rarely has the search for new knowledge undertaken by a university of world renown been so vocally condemned That is what happened when Cambridge University announced a new academic research project to determine the extent to which the university although not its wealthy colleges contributed to benefited from or challenged slavery and the slave trade  Cambridge and its colleges are rich Staggeringly rich And spoiler alert some of the gifts and bequests buried deep within that mountain of wealth will have come from benefactors who were slave traders and slave owners This is true of other universities here and abroad Yet the same commentators who endlessly accuse students of being closed to new ideas and unwilling to face uncomfortable facts have rushed to condemn the university s investigation into its own past Their argument in essence is that we re better off not knowing 
MAY5	A cynical Westminster fix won’t end the Brexit nightmares of May and Corbyn	British politics was designed to be idiot proof It had some simple rules that anyone could follow One of the most basic of those rules was the law of the seesaw When one of the major parties plunged the other soared A terrible day for the Tories would be a triumphant day for Labour and vice versa  This previously reliable rule is one of the many that has been unravelled by Brexit It is now possible for both the major parties and their leaders to be in crisis at the same time It is also possible for neither party to be able to agree how to extract themselves from their respective emergencies The latest evidence of this is provided by the local elections and the conflicting responses of both Tories and Labour people to results that were harrowing for each 
MAY5	Caster Semenya is a victim of rules that are confusing and unfair	Should women with naturally elevated levels of testosterone be able to compete in women s events That s the question with which athletics has been grappling over the past decade Last week the Court of Arbitration for Sport Cas international sport s highest court ruled that such athletes could be banned unless they took medication to reduce their testosterone levels  The Cas case had been brought by Caster Semenya the South African Olympic champion who after winning her stunning th consecutive m victory in Doha on Friday insisted that she would carry on racing in middle distance events but would not take testosterone reducing medication From the moment she burst on to the international stage a decade ago questions were raised about her sex Semenya is hyperandrogenic she has a much higher level of testosterone than most women 
MAY5	A girls’ night out with the PM and her posse for £135,000? Bargain	As if Conservative donors were not resentful enough where they haven t already complied with Boris Johnson s injunction to fuck off it is now clear thanks to the Treasury secretary Liz Truss by what a prodigious margin some of them must have overpaid for a basic minister experience It s ages since a party chairman quoted as the starting price to get near David Cameron  A photograph posted on Truss s Instagram account last week showed six female cabinet members and the prime minister assembled beside a wealthy woman of Russian origin Lubov Chernukhin had gifted herself their presence in an auction at the latest Black and White Tory fundraiser for ie less than apiece for hours of proximity to Karen Bradley Northern Ireland secretary Baroness Evans leader of the Lords Caroline Nokes immigration Amber Rudd Andrea Leadsom Truss and smiling alongside Mrs C Theresa May 
MAY5	Remember Orwell’s chilling warning to boot-licking propagandists...	The Labour left presumptuously claims to represent the British tradition of dissent but never tolerates dissent against its command and control politics  At the meeting of Labour s national executive committee last Tuesday to take the most recent example Diane Abbott preferred abandoning a lifetime of support for the EU to accepting a challenge to the party line 
MAY5	The infected blood inquiry reminds us we need a less painful way to deal with health failings	No one watching the heartfelt testimony of witnesses patients family members and carers at the opening sessions of the infected blood inquiry could fail to be moved The inquiry will examine how and why thousands of people were given blood infected with hepatitis and HIV in the s the harm this caused and how government then dealt with this avoidable tragedy and its consequences  However you have to ask why do we need public inquiries like this one and what do they achieve Just as importantly why do we have so many of them In healthcare alone alongside the infected blood scandal there s an inquiry into disgraced breast surgeon Ian Paterson the recent Gosport Memorial Hospital panel report and a trail of past cases too long to list in full Bristol Shipman Mid Staffs The bald truth is that most public inquiries represent a double failure First the organisations and systems that should keep people safe and deal immediately and effectively with any problems with the quality of care have failed often over many years Second the authorities that investigate complaints and problems which in health include the General Medical Council the Department of Health DoH and in some cases the police also failed 
MAY5	It was all going well until the nail polish incident...	One way to look at parenthood is as perpetual failure Taking full responsibility for the upbringing and socialisation of another human from birth through to adulthood means that at some point you are going to find you ve messed things up  Don t console yourself that cheap calories and modern medicine mean your children are vastly less likely to die than they would have been in previous generations This simply opens new realms for you to screw up and feel terrible about 
MAY6	Loss of biodiversity is just as catastrophic as climate change	A colleague recently described how fish would swim into her clothing when she was a child bathing in the ocean off the coast of Vietnam but today the fish are gone and her children find the story far fetched  Another recalled his experiences just last year in Cape Town one of the world s most attractive tourism and leisure destinations when more than million people faced the nightmare prospect of all taps in every home and business running dry 
MAY6	Sorry, Emma Thompson, but you’ll never be perfect enough to save the planet	Hold the front page Emma Thompson protester against climate change scourge of the fossil fuel industry herself takes aeroplanes There she was bold as brass in a seat about to burn through rainforests of unknown dimensions with her cross Atlantic travel on the cover of the Mail on Sunday  On some level we must have known this all along since mostly she is in the UK sometimes she is in the United States and we know although sometimes I wonder she isn t magic But still doesn t that put the old tin lid on it What s the point of it all when even people who care about the future and believe in science aren t perfect 
MAY6	Looking for comment on the royal baby? Don’t ask me	Here are some of the things that people are saying about mixed race babies at the moment websites have run stories about the viral mixed race children of Instagram who are trending because of their gorgeous blonde hair light eyes and golden skin that looks like sand White teenagers in conversations that I have both overheard and been privy to say I really want to have kids with a black guy because mixed race babies are so cute I just love their curly hair and oh my God the ones with freckles  The Kardashians who have been accused by some people of turning that particular fantasy into reality are a never ending source of related commentary Kylie Jenner is currently causing people to fall all over themselves with praise because she learned how to do her mixed race daughter s hair 
MAY6	If Labour really wants to move on, it has to back a second referendum	Since the local elections protagonists on either side of the Brexit divide have sought to marshal the poor result for Labour to advance their cause Predictably many MPs from leave supporting areas have argued that it means Labour has to deliver on the referendum result their remain supporting counterparts argue that the strong performance of the Liberal Democrats and Greens means Labour should come out unambiguously as the party of remain Here s an alternative strategy  Politics is not about two competing answers to the same question it is about which question is being asked in the first place So the core strategic insight of the Labour leadership is correct that so long as the question is Brexit the party will suffer at the polls That means Labour s primary political objective should be to change the question away from Brexit and towards domestic concerns Put simply to move on 
MAY6	I’m a Labour MP, and a second referendum was a difficult sell on the doorstep	On Thursday evening in the local elections Labour had disappointing results in some parts of the country But it was a mixed bag Amid the raging what does it mean for Brexit discussions we made gains in key marginal constituencies which on the basis of the vote share mean Labour would win bellwether seats that we need to form the next government  By contrast the Tories had one of the worst kickings from the electorate in recent memory to misquote the Liberal Democrats they were losing everywhere Their disintegration in Westminster was mirrored by their woeful performance on the ground and it s only the fear that grips the Tories and their wealthy backers of a radical redistributive Labour government that is slowing its inevitable collapse 
MAY6	Convinced this stitch-up can end the Brexit ordeal? Think again	Those who argue for a people s vote on Brexit are frequently warned that a fresh referendum would infuriate millions of voters who thought they had made their position perfectly clear in It would be idle to deny that many might indeed be affronted especially if the campaign to stay in the European Union were foolish enough to frame the argument as a rematch rather than as a completely new judgment upon the shambles of the past three years  But the anger that such a vote could conceivably trigger is as nothing compared with the democratic recoil there will be from the Labour Conservative stitch up that many at the apex of both parties now favour 
MAY6	Women dressed ‘provocatively’ are being arrested in Nigeria. The law’s still failing us	Nigerian media has been awash with news of a recent police raid in the capital Abuja in which dozens of women were arrested in and around nightclubs on charges of prostitution A city official said one way police assessed the potential guilt of the women was if they were dressed provocatively No men were arrested in the raid There was also an ominously conspicuous absence of any evidence of soliciting which is a crime under Nigerian law Most alarming of all there are witness reports of rape sexual assault and financial extortion of the women by the policemen who arrested them Some of the women were taken to a mobile court and allegedly pressured to plead guilty to charges of prostitution on the spot  Such arrests don t just disregard due process but send a clear message as to who s in charge men
MAY6	It is not up to the UK government to decide whether I’m Irish or not	The Good Friday agreement is widely revered as a model of peace and celebrated worldwide Yet the Home Office has openly disregarded the agreement and is actively seeking to undermine its very foundation I should know I have spent the past four years in legal proceedings battling the Home Office  The people of Northern Ireland are unique within the UK in that we have the birthright to identify and be accepted as Irish or British or both However contrary to the statutory duty on the Home Office to accept the birthright provisions of the Good Friday agreement it is arguing through the British courts that the people of Northern Ireland are automatically British as we were clearly born in the United Kingdom The department regularly and repeatedly forces British citizenship on Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland citizens who are Irish by birth and by choice a choice the people of this island voted for overwhelmingly in the Good Friday agreement referendum With Brexit on the horizon and EU citizens rights in the balance the situation has become urgent 
MAY6	From Spain to Turkey, the rise of the far right is a clash of cultures not civilisations	I spent part of my childhood in Ankara and part of it in Madrid Commuting between Spain and Turkey in the early s was a strange experience Spain had recently returned to democracy after years of dictatorship and Turkey had experienced yet another military coup Both countries were at the fringes of Europe neither part of the EU It was said that Europe finishes at the start of the Pyrenees but if the mountain range between France and Spain was regarded as a border another frontier was the waters of the Bosphorus It often felt as though I was travelling from one end of Europe to the other  The Spain that I experienced was vibrant welcoming and warm hearted Despite the occasional pro Franco mutterings of an older generation Spain embraced democracy How I wanted my motherland to follow suit But one day on my way to school I saw something that made me stop in my tracks All the walls down the street were plastered with posters of dead babies thrown into bins I froze The disturbing and distorted images had been distributed by an ultraconservative Catholic group that claimed family values were being attacked women had gone too far in the name of emancipation A patriarchal backlash still lurked under the surface The culture wars were under way 
MAY6	Universal basic income doesn’t work. Let’s boost the public realm instead	A study published this week sheds doubt on ambitious claims made for universal basic income UBI the scheme that would give everyone regular unconditional cash payments that are enough to live on Its advocates claim it would help to reduce poverty narrow inequalities and tackle the effects of automation on jobs and income Research conducted for Public Services International a global trade union federation reviewed for the first time practical projects that have tested different ways of distributing regular cash payments to individuals across a range of poor middle income and rich countries as well as copious literature on the topic  It could find no evidence to suggest that such a scheme could be sustained for all individuals in any country in the short medium or longer term or that this approach could achieve lasting improvements in wellbeing or equality The research confirms the importance of generous non stigmatising income support but everything turns on how much money is paid under what conditions and with what consequences for the welfare system as a whole 
MAY7	Britain needs to recognise Palestine as an independent state	Over the Bank Holiday weekend coinciding with the start of the Ramadan fast for Muslims and the run up to Israel s Independence Day it was touch and go whether the latest outbreak of violence fatalities on the border rockets fired into Israel airstrikes against the Gaza Strip would escalate into all out war Twenty five Palestinians and four Israelis was a modest death toll compared with summer when Palestinians and Israelis were killed in Operation Protective Edge  The ceasefire negotiated by Egypt and the UN should ease the punishing blockade imposed by Israel since the Islamists of Hamas took over Gaza in Millions of dollars donated by the Gulf state of Qatar will continue to pay official salaries and help needy families Palestinian fishermen will be able to operate farther out to sea Electricity and fuel supplies should be boosted 
MAY7	So Harry and Meghan want to do things differently? Fat chance of that	What a curious nation we are that thinks itself modern because a man who is sixth in line to the throne marries a woman of mixed heritage but is then expected to provide a level of gynaecological detail about her pregnancy and labour that is frankly weird  Prince Harry s goofy happiness at becoming a father is of course lovely to behold No one begrudges the man who walked behind his mother s coffin a rush of joy at the birth of his first child He is just like every other sleep deprived new dad So relatable so human and ordinary 
MAY7	No wonder transport in the north is pitiful. Money is on a one-way path to London	To live outside London and not drive a car is an exercise in resilience and stoicism In the north west of England where I live public transport exists mainly to drive people bonkers If you ve lived in London or the south east as I did for many years the effects of extreme regional inequality are plain to see as soon as you step on to a bus or train  Distances that took half an hour to cover in London can take three times as long and cost twice as much I m lucky I can afford for a single bus fare as opposed to in London Yet everyday journeys on public transport are blighted by car oriented planning deregulation and a lack of investment none of which apply in the capital If that doesn t illustrate how underinvestment reduces productivity and destroys quality of life I don t know what can 
MAY7	It’s not just Cambridge University – all of Britain benefited from slavery	Cambridge University has announced that it will finally just two centuries after the abolition of slavery and about years after the end of the British empire conduct an in depth academic study into ways in which it contributed to benefited from or challenged the Atlantic slave trade and other forms of coerced labour during the colonial era  I m not sure in depth is how I would describe an inquiry which omits all of its colleges which hold most of the wealth in Cambridge and some of which already have verified slavery connections And it is worth pointing out that while Cambridge has framed this inquiry as part of its race equality initiatives this conversation was forced on it by students activists and brave academics 
MAY7	The only Brexit is a hard-right one. Labour must back another vote	As the Labour party resumes negotiations with what can only be described as Theresa May s faction of government Labour members and voters across the country are increasingly concerned as to what any deal might look like especially as the local election results are used to justify each and every option But there is something that all of us in the Labour movement need to keep at the forefront of our minds something substantive we have learned since the Brexit referendum  While Brexit voters come from all classes and all political stripes and voted Brexit for many different reasons the people driving Brexit in the Tory party have a very specific economic agenda one that is now at the heart of these negotiations Labour is the party of social solidarity and the Tories want Brexit because they want to destroy social solidarity in Britain To all intents and purposes they want to eliminate the Labour movement 
MAY7	Something is going very wrong for vulnerable kids – but is the school to blame?	Whose fault is it that more children are being excluded from schools  Teachers parents politicians and seemingly everyone else with a passing interest in children s long term happiness have been arguing over this one for years but now a long awaited review of exclusions from the former schools minister Edward Timpson is shedding some carefully filtered light on the question 
MAY7	Young people could turn the Brexit tide – if they register to vote today	To vote in May s election you must be registered to vote be or over on May be a British Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of an EU country other than Malta and Cyprus You have to be either resident at an address in the UK and not be legally excluded from voting or be a British citizen living abroad in which case you can vote in European elections for up to years after you have left the country  If you are not already on the electoral roll you can register to vote online You may need your national insurance or passport number 
MAY7	Looking for comment on the royal baby? Don’t ask me	Here are some of the things that people are saying about mixed race babies at the moment websites have run stories about the viral mixed race children of Instagram who are trending because of their gorgeous blonde hair light eyes and golden skin that looks like sand White teenagers in conversations that I have both overheard and been privy to say I really want to have kids with a black guy because mixed race babies are so cute I just love their curly hair and oh my God the ones with freckles  The Kardashians who have been accused by some people of turning that particular fantasy into reality are a never ending source of related commentary Kylie Jenner is currently causing people to fall all over themselves with praise because she learned how to do her mixed race daughter s hair 
MAY7	Racism in political parties reflects pervasive prejudice in Brexit Britain	It s hard to avoid noticing that most of our political parties seem to be embroiled in rows over racism and prejudices Two Conservative local election candidates were suspended over racist social media posts last week and that s after a steady drip of revelations over Islamophobic comments made by members and candidates alike Labour suspended several local election candidates over antisemitic comments and is still accused of failing to tackle hundreds of complaints of antisemitism within the party Now new political parties are apparently keen to catch on Few will have had the highest expectations of Nigel Farage s latest vehicle the Brexit party or indeed of his old one Ukip But for some hopes were set higher with Change UK where one candidate for the European election resigned after sexist and racist tweets he wrote were uncovered while another did so just a day earlier having made disparaging comments about Romanian people in Another of its candidates is accused of Islamophobia though she has refuted this This is the party that was accused of racism within hours of launching in February when one of its members referred to people from black Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds BAME as being of a funny tinge although she apologised  Predictably all of this has fuelled the never ending political game of your party is more racist than my party This depressingly superficial approach feeds into a standard response pattern Assuming parties get beyond kneejerk denialism granted a big assumption since this has been at points the response from both main parties candidates or members making prejudiced comments are ejected or deselected and this process is itself held up as proof of taking racism seriously Such a response if done transparently and speedily is welcome and promotes trust in a complaints process But this approach does not get to why it keeps happening and across our political parties in the first place 
MAY7	I love swimming, but I’m sick of the sexist behaviour in British pools	A friend told me recently that of all animals I most resemble a Shetland pony In other words my physique doesn t exactly scream athlete And so when I go swimming it comes as something of a surprise to others that I am actually quite good at it  The more I swim the more I notice that a not insignificant number of men seem to take against my swimming abilities and respond with an array of irritating behaviours They push in front of me they take up the whole lane or my personal favourite they expend all of their energy on overtaking me just to prove that they can and then spend the rest of the lap swimming desperately slowly in front of me 
MAY8	Brexit has robbed Labour of its insurgency. It’s time to claw it back	The supposed iron law of British politics back when an economy dominated by Big Finance seemed to be a never ending fountain of growth and tax revenues used to go like this you had to present yourself as a steady pair of hands pro business competent exuding stability not someone to rock the hull of HMS Britain Tony Blair speaking of Margaret Thatcher once described his political formula I always thought my job was to build on some of the things she had done rather than reverse them  But whether you re a politician of left right or so called centre insurgency has become the iron law of our time Labour has been robbed of that sense of insurgency by Brexit its political fortunes depend on reclaiming it 
MAY8	Welcome to team Archie, royal baby. Here are some tips from an old hand	Well I m sure we all know why I m here don t we So let s get on with it Here is my advice for my adorable little namesake although quite honestly all he has done so far is cause me unending quantities of grief So if you ever come across this when you can read Arch in the long run an OBE would seem about right Anyway welcome to team Archie and  Be grateful it s not Archibald 
MAY8	‘Global Britain’ is doing its foreign policy on autopilot	The European elections Theresa May never intended Britain to participate in are now only two weeks away They are inevitably being fought as a proxy contest for Brexit by all the political parties The results will be interpreted as a verdict on Brexit too just as last week s English local elections have been and probably in much the same careless way  Yet it would be a stretch to pretend that for once in our recent history the UK s European elections are actually focusing on Britain s and Europe s place in the st century world The truth is far less flattering These elections can better be understood as another episode in the national and in particular Conservative trauma over the historic decline of British power of which the referendum was an interim climax The elections are therefore unlikely to be cathartic or cleansing On the contrary they are dragging us deeper into the ongoing psychodrama that was intensified by the vote in 
MAY8	Young Brits say they are having less sex. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing	Too much porn Too much screen time Too much anxiety Too little alcohol There are myriad theories about why the British are having less sex but none of them seems to offer relief  Importantly it s not because we feel we re already having enough And that s according to the Brits who took part in research between and During that period the percentage of men and women reporting that they had not had sex in the last month defined as vaginal oral or anal sex with opposite or same sex partners rose to overall from of men and of women in More than half of men and women and respectively were unhappy with the amount of sex they were having in up substantially from the unhappiness that is not the sex 
MAY8	Trump’s antics over Iran have endangered us all. The stakes are now lethally high	Such is the carnival of the Trump presidency it can be tempting especially for those outside the US to view it as spectacle a long running reality TV show that veers between The Apprentice and House of Cards But every now and then comes a reminder that for all the cartoonish absurdity of the central character the Trump administration is all too real that its actions matter and that the stakes are lethally high  A fresh and urgent reminder of that has come today with Iran s declaration that it will no longer fully comply with the nuclear deal it reached with the US and Europe in by which Tehran agreed to a year pause on its nuclear programme in return for the easing of economic sanctions In a televised address this morning exactly one year after Trump withdrew the United States from the deal Iran s president Hassan Rouhani announced a series of moves that would inch the country closer to acquiring the ability to produce nuclear weapons moves that would only be averted if Europe defied Trump and allowed Iran once again to sell its oil and have access to the international banking system For the most severe of these steps Rouhani gave the Europeans days to make up their minds either resume trade or watch Tehran resume its nuclear efforts 
MAY8	As a doctor, I say it’s time to nationalise GP surgeries	General practices support patients through every stage of their life They are the heart of their communities and the gateway to our NHS Every day around a million GP consultations take place in English practices We should rightly be very proud of our system of primary care  But it isn t perfect As data published this week shows patient demand for general practice services is increasing while the number of GPs is actually falling according to the survey one in GPs are in contact with or more patients a day which is double the safe limit At a time when people are living longer and health problems are becoming more complex the government has spectacularly failed to deliver its promise of an extra GPs Not enough medics want to be GPs and too many doctors leave general practice too early 
MAY8	Welcome to parenthood, Meghan and Harry – you’ll never get a good night’s sleep again	The Duke of Cambridge welcomed his brother to the sleep deprivation society that is parenting this week That is sweet obviously Most parents have been members of that society But do we believe that he or his brother or indeed the mothers of their children will have struggled with this like the rest of us  I ask the question because I really don t know the answer and neither do I know what honest answer I d want to hear Are we supposed to imagine that the three members of the Sussex family will now be rugged up in the same room with the parents leaping out of bed at every snuffle from their bairn 
MAY8	Why doesn’t Britain have a Huawei of its own? The answer speaks volumes	Chances are that you have learned rather a lot about Huawei That the Chinese giant is one of the world s most controversial companies That security experts those people we pay to be paranoid on our behalf warn its telecoms kit could be used by Beijing to spy on us That Theresa May was begged by cabinet colleagues to keep the firm well away from our G network yet ignored them And that one or more senior ministers were so eager to prove their concern for national security that they leaked details of their meeting thus breaching national security  So you can already guess what will happen when Donald Trump s secretary of state Mike Pompeo meets May and her foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt on Wednesday Once the pleasantries about Harry and Meghan s baby are over top of America s agenda will be to warn No of the threat Huawei poses to British privacy and to restate that Washington may retaliate by freezing London out of its intelligence network 
MAY8	Mark Zuckerberg has to go. Here are 25 reasons why	Everyone wants there to be a silver bullet A single policy solution that will fix Facebook restore our privacy and clean up the tech industry There isn t one  Hefty fines civil rights audits antitrust data privacy legislation shareholder activism and employee organizing can all play a role But we don t just need regulation we need a revolution a massive cultural shift in how we think about our personal information and the companies that profit by collecting it 
MAY8	AOC’s boyfriend is a reminder of the importance of a supportive partner	Behind every successful congresswoman is a strong bin raccoon boyfriend apparently  Over the past few days the internet seems to have become obsessed with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez s boyfriend a web developer called Riley Roberts Ocasio Cortez is pretty quiet about her private life but Roberts makes an appearance in Knock Down the House the new Netflix documentary about four women who ran in the midterm elections And though brief his appearance generated rather heated discussion 
MAY9	We’ve seen Carl Benjamin’s rank misogyny before – remember Gamergate?	For luckier people than me this week will have been the first time they ve ever heard of Carl Benjamin or Sargon of Akkad as he is better known online The fact that a Ukip candidate has been discovered to have said something hideous felt like such routine news it would hardly have registered with me if I hadn t immediately recognised the candidate in question  Benjamin or Sargon of Akkad as he is better known online tweeted in that he wouldn t even rape the Labour MP Jess Phillips He revisited the topic in a recent video on his million subscriber YouTube channel and is now being investigated by the police It s a sorry story from a candidate in the European elections but Phillips is far from the only woman Benjamin has harassed online He has built his entire platform on it 
MAY9	Baby Archie’s first race row may be a taste of things to come	A chimpanzee in a suit It s a racist caricature associated with times gone by ones we d like to imagine we had left behind in the th century a period characterised by segregation dehumanisation and well comparing black people to animals So understandably all hell broke loose on Wednesday when the BBC Radio Live presenter Danny Baker tweeted a picture of a couple with an ape descending a flight of steps captioned Royal baby leaves hospital  Baker was sacked faster than you can say racism but nonetheless claimed the tweet was misinterpreted Never occurred to me because well mind not diseased was his initial response He later clarified that he intended it to be a gag comparing the royal family to circus animals in posh clothes This defence seems like a reach to me But even if we give Baker the benefit of the doubt the incident shows that a subset of the population seems to be on a different planet when it comes to conversations around race 
MAY9	Trump’s foolish Iran policy only makes war more likely	It is unclear what if anything Iran can do to induce the United States and its regional allies to halt their escalating war of attrition before it provokes all out conflict When Donald Trump reneged on the UN ratified nuclear agreement with Tehran last year he said he wanted a better deal Iran must change its behaviour he said and act like a normal country  This was always disingenuous Iran s authoritarian and abusive rulers certainly need to mend their ways But what Trump and his imperious advisers really meant was that they must do what America says in conformity with American interests What they want is an end to years of post revolution defiance What they want is regime change in Iran 
MAY9	The navy shamed me over my sexuality. Now I’m suing it to get my medal back	I joined the Royal Navy in June a scorcher of a summer I was years old A Liverpool boy I d had an unsettled early life and it was only when I found myself living in a house share with some navy lads that I found my calling Seeing the lives they led and the pay they were getting made my life as a gas fitter seem dull by comparison  So I joined up trained hard and quickly worked my way up to the rank of lead radio operator Over nearly years I served my country during the Falklands war in Northern Ireland Syria Hong Kong Egypt and beyond I had an impeccable service record and numerous medals and badges to show for it both for conflict and good conduct I was a trusted and respected naval operator had wonderful colleagues and friends and felt blessed to be leading a life I loved 
MAY9	The Lib Dems’ ‘Bollocks to Brexit’ is crass, but it might just work	 When the general atmosphere is bad language must suffer wrote George Orwell in his famous essay Politics and the English Language just after the second world war Things are bad and our language is getting worse  The Liberal Democrats have adopted the slogan Bollocks to Brexit in their campaign for the on again never really off European elections on May This has certainly won them some attention Critics were quick to denounce what they saw as a sorry decline in standards of taste and decency James Forsyth political editor of the Spectator and a columnist for the Sun tweeted that the slogan does nothing for civility and makes the public square a less pleasant place He acknowledged there was a chance he might sound a bit prim in offering this view 
MAY9	Stop eating fish. It’s the only way to save the life in our seas	It is the most important news humanity has ever received the general collapse of life on Earth The vast international assessment of the state of nature as revealed on Monday tells us that the living planet is in a death spiral Yet it s hardly surprising that it appeared on few front pages of British newspapers Of all the varieties of media bias the deepest is the bias against relevance The more important the issue the less it is discussed  There s a reason for this Were we to become fully aware of our predicament we would demand systemic change Systemic change is highly threatening to those who own the media So they distract us with such baubles as a royal baby and a vicious dispute between neighbours about a patio I am often told we get the media we deserve We do not We get the media its billionaire owners demand 
MAY9	Becoming PM would be the easy part for a British populist such as Boris Johnson	Britain may be in the mood for a nationalist prime minister who is prepared to see minorities lose out according to an alarming poll on populism in Prospect magazine The poll mines a worrying seam of anti democratic anti civil rights instincts on the right with Conservatism moving rapidly rightwards  By to a meagre voters agree with the sentiment that a prime minister should always put the British majority first even if it means minorities lose out That might embolden Boris Johnson to make more controversial jokes about Muslim women suggests Prospect s editor Tom Clark Johnson last summer suggested that Brexit might get somewhere if it were being run by Donald Trump of whom he was increasingly admiring But he may be feeling out Trumped as he watches rowdy Nigel Farage rallies where audiences shout Lock her up about Theresa May 
MAY9	A pub with no booze will never generate the warm, jovial chaos that alcohol brings	There is a certain irresistible symbolism in a man from Burton upon Trent historic centre of British brewing opening the first alcohol free pub in Dublin one of Europe s great booze capitals We are drinking less in the UK and Ireland young people in particular and Vaughan Yates much reported Virgin Mary seems a sober sign of the times one that heralds a dire future for pubs generally  Read the pub trade press and you will find a steady drip drip of advice about how bars can woo abstinent Gen Z ers Only this week Nescaf dropped a report that recommended outdated pubs must make themselves more inviting to non drinkers spoiler they should serve better coffee But in this struggling sector where boozers a week are closing is looking at ways to draw in non drinkers an urgent priority Could more pubs follow the Virgin Mary s lead and ban alcohol 
MAY9	Want to stop Nigel Farage storming the European elections? Then vote tactically	With two weeks until the European parliamentary elections on May pollsters are predicting that no fewer than of the candidates for Nigel Farage s Brexit party will be elected and so could be taking their seats when the new parliamentary session begins on July That s more than is predicted for all the remain supporting parties put together excluding Labour which still says it wants to get a Brexit deal which is quite a feat for a man who hasn t presented a manifesto disclosed his funders or come up with any details of how a post Brexit Britain would function  There is a very simple reason for Farage s rosy prospects he is facing no resistance even though opinion poll after opinion poll shows the remain majority growing by the day At last week s local elections Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would have had you believe that people deserted them and voted in record numbers for remain supporting parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Greens because they want to leave the EU as soon as possible no matter how dire the consequences That verges on open contempt for the electorate and Trump like spin The EU elections provide an opportunity for the people of the United Kingdom to knock some sense into the heads of their political leaders 
MAY9	Pakistan: where the daily slaughter of women barely makes the news	You can find the news about Pakistan s war on women buried deep inside the metro pages of Urdu newspapers I stumbled upon it a few years ago I noticed that I could pick up my newspaper and almost every day find news about a murdered woman I thought maybe it s a coincidence maybe Karachi is a huge city these things happen But it went on and on It became so routine that I could pick up the paper open the exact same pages just like you can bet that you ll find a crossword or letters to the editor and it was always there  Names changed localities changed the relationship between the murdered and her murderer changed and of course there were minor variations on how she was killed and where the body was found but it was always there single column one and a half inches Often the woman wasn t even named she was someone s sister or mother of four or the girl who ran away with her lover or the girl who refused to marry a suitor Sometimes the news made it to the front page of the metro section but for that the murder had to be particularly gruesome or the killer had killed himself after killing the woman or the victim was very young or the murderer killed the children along with the mother That last one usually ends up on the front page if it s a slow news day 
MAY10	You don’t have to be great to hear the Tory call to greatness	You may have become aware of a worsening background hum to British public life Think of it as the clamour This is the very specific sound heard by Tory MPs reluctantly deciding that it falls to them to answer the call for a leadership bid The clamour So many separate clamours The Tory leadership field is now the size of the Grand National though unfortunately many of the runners would find themselves intellectually outclassed by a steeplechaser  In time the race will be attended by the usual ethical dilemmas Are the jumps simply too high or should Andrea Leadsom be able to clear basic questions about gay rights without the screens having to be erected For now we must simply welcome newly declared entrants into the paddock who this week include Andrea and dishonesty s Esther McVey 
MAY10	The secret to stopping Brexit: keep it simple	Here s how we can halt Brexit in its tracks Uefa the governing body of European football should announce that from now on participation in the Champions League and the Europa League will be limited to members of the European Union If Britain leaves the EU the Premier League s finest will be barred from taking part The response would be immediate support for Brexit would plummet with the plunge most visible in Liverpool Chelsea and concentrated parts of north London  All right maybe Uefa would be wary of appearing to punish the country that had just taken without precedent and in thrilling fashion all four spots in the finals of those two competitions So here s a more modest proposal Why doesn t Uefa announce that if the UK leaves the single market and thereby abandons free movement of people English clubs will be allowed to employ only a limited number of European players Say two Or one Suddenly a whole lot of onetime Brexiters would find themselves passionately making the case for a borderless Europe arguing that the young and hungry should be free to move wherever their dreams and their talent might take them 
MAY10	Sorry, Danny Baker – sometimes comedy is just off limits	When the doctor sat Danny Baker down to break the news of his cancer the broadcaster s first instinct was to defuse things with a joke Realising how much the doctor was dreading it he writes in his autobiography that he deliberately derailed the moment It may not have been that funny but it was kindly meant There is much black humour on cancer wards as there is anywhere people deal routinely with things nobody wants to think too hard about  There should be room for jokes that are inappropriate jokes that come from places so dark they make you gasp although as with all high wire acts that doesn t excuse comedians from the consequences of a mistake But the licence to offend still matters in comedy at least so long as you re punching up not down 
MAY10	Sunk by my age and weight, now I’m at the bottom of the swimming pool food chain	Round Short Female And the wrong side of middle aged to boot Try being all of those things and see what happens when you go swimming  A lively debate erupted this week after Ellie Mae O Hagan wrote about being sick of sexist behaviour by men in British swimming pools But I find that I am liable to be judged by everyone in the pool regardless of their gender As I get older and rounder it seems I have sunk to the bottom of the swimming food chain not only prey to sexist men who splash and duck but also young svelte women with no cellulite who see me as fair game Move over Granny I m coming in 
MAY10	Paddy Jackson’s revived rugby career is a backward step for feminism	The rugby team London Irish announced this week that Paddy Jackson will join their squad ahead of a return to the English premiership next season Jackson who has previously played for Ulster and represented Ireland was once famous solely for his talents as a fly half on the pitch but now is infamous for his role in a gruelling much publicised rape trial last year  The week trial in Belfast of Jackson and his three compadres was followed in acute detail Evidence presented included the complainant s bloody knickers medical opinions on vaginal tears and WhatsApp exchanges between the defendants Jackson was found not guilty of rape and not guilty of assault his then teammate Stuart Olding was found not guilty of rape Their friend Blane McIlroy was found not guilty of exposure and another friend Rory Harrison was found not guilty of concealing evidence and attempting to pervert the course of justice 
MAY10	Would Margaret Thatcher have taken the US side against Huawei? Not necessarily	Lady Thatcher may be an icon to her most devoted fans but as far as I know none of them has ever worn a What would Maggie do wristband That s not to say that they don t find themselves asking or being asked the question now and then After all Thatcher together with her eponymous ism have become lodestone and touchstone to rightwingers the world over However imperfectly remembered or understood Thatcher and Thatcherism simultaneously exert a magnetic attraction and provide a litmus test They also conjure up the Conservative party s glory days a state of ideological grace global respect and seemingly endless electoral success all of which it could enjoy again if only it were to return to the path of free economy strong state righteousness  Nowhere perhaps was her pragmatism more on display than when it came to China
MAY10	Britain loves booze. But we need to talk honestly about the harm it causes	Let s grab a pint Let s put in for another bottle of red Let s try that new craft beer Much of British life is revolves around booze It can be challenging to maintain a social life without it and even at home it s common to uncork a bottle of wine after a tough day at work Yet despite our country s ongoing love affair with alcohol nobody likes to talk about the harm that dependency on the bottle can bring  So on the rare occasion the issue is addressed we should take note A new survey has found that one in five people in England have been harmed by others drinking alcohol over the past year The survey which spoke to over s reported a range of less serious complaints from being kept awake to feeling anxious about a person s behaviour at a social occasion But nearly one in people reported experiencing aggression being physically threatened or hurt or being pressured into something sexual 
MAY10	It’s time for Labour to experiment with new drug policies	Well done Denver voting to decriminalise magic mushrooms is an act of common sense even if this brave step was somewhat sullied by simultaneously voting down a pro homeless initiative It doesn t mean the local Walmart is going to start flogging shrooms on two for one offers it just means that the police must deprioritise to the greatest extent possible any criminal penalties for Denver residents possessing or using the hippie drug of choice It could be a life changing move for some growing research suggests it can help treat mental distress such as depression and anxiety  Denver s move is just the latest outbreak of common sense on drugs how depressing then that Britain remains so backward on the issue That is mostly the fault I m sorry to say of the Labour party You d expect the Tories to take a punitive snub the evidence approach even though before assuming the Tory leadership David Cameron accepted that drugs policy was a failure But where is the leadership from Labour The so called war on drugs is a catastrophic failure and it hurts many vulnerable people Labour was founded to represent Drugs should be treated as a public health issue not a part of the criminal system 
MAY10	I’m fasting in protest outside Royal Windsor Horse Show to save my father in Bahrain	This week the British royal family is rolling out the red carpet to greet hundreds of guests from around the world at the annual Royal Windsor Horse Show which began on Wednesday and continues until Sunday It is a major part of the royal calendar with the Queen in attendance Among the most enthusiastic of the show s regular guests is King Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa of Bahrain who is invited every year to enjoy the opulent equestrian festivities and his sons  Hamad enjoys friendly relations with the Queen In he gifted her two prized Arabian horses from his royal stables In the Queen returned the gesture presenting him with a horse from her own stables Hamad even has an event at the show Saturday s King s Cup named after him 
MAY10	By all means keep the Queen, but can we have our land back?	A new royal baby like any other piece of news about the royals brings up the old republicanism v monarchism argument This is as it should be because having a royal family in is deeply weird and whenever they rise to the front of the public consciousness it s always worth asking what on earth we are doing keeping this embarrassing feudal anachronism around Even monarchists tend to have the good sense not to rely on medieval notions that aristocrats are somehow meaningfully superior so their arguments tend to cycle through variations on but they bring in tourism or people like them  Ultimately though monarchism knows it doesn t really need a good argument As the latest round of breathless virtually content free gossip dominating the news cycle shows plenty of people in this country just want to be weird obsessives about other people s children and they don t want anyone to interfere with their hobby 
MAY11	I learned in class, but playtime taught me a lot more	Will nobody think of the swots The news that schools in the tortuous attempts to fill children s heads with enough learning to cope with a barrage of tests have been steadily helping themselves to precious minutes of playtime has been greeted with dismay  Little ones apparently have minutes less running about time a week than they did odd years ago at secondary school it s more than an hour What iron faced killjoy madness is this Let the children lose it Let the children use it Let all the children boogie as a great man once wrote 
MAY11	Welcome to Planet Rumpole, where rank misogyny still holds sway	Following in the footsteps of Bertrand Russell Grayson Perry and Stephen Hawking this year s BBC Reith lecturer will be Jonathan Sumption QC retired supreme court judge historian chateau dweller and author with the eminent Thatcherite Keith Joseph of Equality a polemic against egalitarianism To date the choice seems to have been entirely uncontroversial   Who better asks the controller of BBC s Radio than Jonathan Sumption to take a clear hard look at the law and how it serves modern society 
MAY11	Farage, Rees-Mogg, Claire Fox... Britain is seduced by politicians who are ‘characters’	If you want to deceive the French public you pose as an intellectual In England you pose as a character Like a criminal on a witness protection programme the ham actor who plays upper class roles avoids the accountability that prevents democratic life degenerating into the feast of fools we see around us  Brexit has as much been a failure of British journalism as British politics The basic questions have not been asked You promised the electorate a trade deal with the EU should be the easiest in history You said the German car industry would force Merkel to capitulate Are you a fool or a liar or both 
MAY11	Lena Waithe: standard bearer for Met Gala’s camp celebration	New York s annual Met Gala theme Camp Notes on Fashion gave the good sport of celebrity watching the earnest air of a third year dissertation last week as people dusted off their critical theory textbooks for decorative purposes right there on the shelf pristine next to a well thumbed Shades and wondered how many paragraphs of Susan Sontag s Notes on Camp Spider Man star Zendaya had managed to commit to memory  I love the spectacle of the Metropolitan Museum of Art fundraiser at the best of times if only because giving a massive party for famous people a theme also provides spectators who are less versed in fashion s regulations a kind of rulebook by which to judge it This one was even more fun than s Punk Chaos to Couture which revealed that punk s lasting legacy had in fact been a handful of studs and a heavier eyeliner than usual If there s one topic I enjoy more than toast dogs or pretentious TV dramas that will never get close to an audience size that would justify the budget it s camp so the fallout has been a feast of riches 
MAY11	The missing ingredient in today’s debates? Generosity	In the early s a white student who had seen Malcolm X speak at her college went to the Nation of Islam restaurant in New York to challenge him on his philosophy Don t you believe there are any good white people he recalled her asking in his autobiography I didn t want to hurt her feelings he wrote I told her People s deeds I believe in Miss not their words   What can I do she exclaimed Nothing Malcolm X said and she burst out crying and ran out and up Lenox Avenue and caught a taxi He would later say of that encounter I regret that I told her she could do nothing I wish now that I knew her name or where I could telephone her

MAY12	Brexiteers want us to glory in isolation. Their vision is introverted and selfish	International development aid is the latest casualty in the Brexit war of words Rightwing zealots are now arguing not just for our bn aid budget to be redirected to spending at home but also for the abolition of the Department for International Development and the redefining of aid as we see fit with what s left no longer there primarily to help the world s poor but to project their own view of British nationalism on to the world stage  As if comparing overseas aid to the work of a modern Mrs Jellyby whose eyes according to Charles Dickens in Bleak House were fixed on nothing nearer than Africa while she neglected her own children at home the right now caricatures aid not only as inefficient wasteful and a way of the poor in rich countries subsidising the rich in poor countries but also as money diverted to dubious causes abroad from good causes at home the insinuation being that sending British money abroad to people who are not British is in some way unpatriotic 
MAY12	Seeing Ben Shapiro flounder might be fun, but far-right celebrities are no joke	There are broadly three ways to react to the shifting of the Overton window the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse The first and most common is to move along with it accepting new parameters and adapting to them The second is to stay put but look through the window acknowledging that things have changed while attempting to grapple with that The third is to resist the movement altogether to refuse to engage with any previously beyond the pale ideas and reject any arguments to do so  I tend to fall into the third camp an Overton window refusenik This is not fashionable and it s not easy by the very nature of the problem people who agree with you become more desensitised with each passing day There comes a point when seeing Nigel Farage on TV becomes no longer appalling but almost comforting It s old Nigel again with his familiar voice and manner and bluster and cackle an offence of white noise 
MAY12	Both Labour and the Tories have gone awol on Brexit	In her book Wilful Blindness Margaret Heffernan writes that we mostly admit the information that makes us feel great about ourselves while conveniently filtering whatever unsettles our fragile egos and most vital beliefs  In everyday life this is often an impediment to sound decision making At the apex of politics it is a psychological phenomenon that can inflict serious damage upon a nation And in the case of the Brexit crisis both main parties are now firmly in its toxic grip 
MAY12	If Labour is so committed on climate, it should recognise how the EU can help	The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has pledged to use every lever of government possible to tackle climate change And his latest idea is to go after the big players on the London Stock Exchange warning that UK companies failing to act to reduce carbon emissions will be delisted  As a green economist radical steps to address the economic drivers of our various environmental crises have been my bread and butter for years So I welcome Labour s newfound commitment to get serious on climate change though its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by can hardly be seen as treating the problem as an emergency Greens believe we must reach net zero carbon by and that such a target is achievable 
MAY12	Am I clutching at straws for wanting to have fun?	Did you see the pictures from the Met Gala in New York I mean bloody hell They were enough to discredit the whole concept of fun The theme this year was Camp Notes of Fashion which most of the photographed celebrities seem to have interpreted as meaning Daft To be fair I have no idea what my own sartorial take on Camp would have been I d probably have put on a cravat but worried it was a bit much  It wouldn t have been a bit much People turned up in the craziest togs imaginable I think what many of the celebrities were doing was trying to show they have a sense of humour which in general I welcome But the lengths they went to to show it betrayed such seriousness in the endeavour such focused and directed effort that the joke collapsed under its own weight even if the intricately engineered dresses just about managed not to 
MAY12	Ecstasy, despair and how the great game reminded us of the ties that bind	Eleven minutes into the second half as Gini Wijnaldum s header fizzed into the top corner and Liverpool took a lead in their Champions League semi final last week I just stood there motionless staring at my mate Mick Potter with bulging eyes He looked back shaking his head His dumbfounded expression said We ve seen a lot you and me but nothing like this  I ve known Mick since We have seen a lot together Heysel Hillsborough dark dark days as well as glorious times following our team As with all friendships your work your family your fate can draw you away but there s always that sinew that connects you Our team our history The things we ve done together as supporters 
MAY12	Lib Dems and Change UK must stop bickering and unite for the Euro vote	Love Nigel Farage or loathe him I rather doubt there are many Observer readers who fall into the first category the man knows how to run a campaign Only a few months into its existence his Brexit party is heading for first place and the largest vote share at the Euro elections The substantial just get on with it chunk of the electorate is massing behind him One thing this demonstrates is the potency of the simple political tune when it is played by a brassy demagogue It is a pointless expenditure of oxygen to mock the Brexit party for its lack of a manifesto To harvest a large haul of votes its frontman really need do nothing else than repeatedly cry the word betrayal from here until polling day  This presents a formidable challenge to his competitors and it is a challenge that both the Tories and Labour will fail A riven Conservative party cannot deal with resurgent Farageism because a cabal of its MPs a lot of its voters and a majority of its members are in sympathy with him It may not be entirely a joke to suggest that there will even be Tory candidates at these elections who will in the secrecy of the ballot booth put their mark against the Brexit party 
MAY12	We ignore poverty and visit ruin on the planet. But I have a plan…	Perhaps there s a reason why still too few of us pay heed to warnings about how we are killing the planet by cruel and unusual methods How can you persuade people to stop endangering other species and start protecting the environment when they don t seem concerned about torturing themselves  According to Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland almost one in four of Scotland s children are officially recognised as living in poverty one of the highest rates in Europe And unless there is a significant policy shift north and south of the border the Institute for Fiscal Studies is forecasting that more than a third of UK children will be in poverty by The charity s definition of child poverty is a reasonable one It means growing up in families without the resources to obtain the type of diet participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are the norm in st century Scotland 
MAY12	We thrive on provocation. But are we too quick to punish those who stray?	There was something shocking and absurd about Danny Baker s tweet of a photograph of a posh couple with a costumed monkey in response to the arrival of the royal baby You didn t have to be an expert in the history of racist images to recognise its implications Just last year the US comedian Roseanne Barr was sacked and her newly resurrected show pulled for a tweet in which she likened a former black adviser to Barack Obama to a child of the Muslim brotherhood planet of the apes  There was something equally absurd about Baker s defence of his tweet Never occurred to me that it was racist he tweeted because well mind not diseased I can t see racism in front of my eyes because I m not a racist is not exactly a coherent answer Nor is the implication that only a diseased mind would have recognised the racism particularly clever 
MAY12	The zeitgeist has shifted. Now the left is fizzing with ideas for a smarter economy	Our landscape is changing and this spring the pace is accelerating It s there in the mounting public recognition that the challenges society confronts are common to us all from climate change to the growth of food banks and so must require a common response marshalling common resources  It feels as if we re at an inflection point whether in the degree of support for Extinction Rebellion the cross party concern to promote social mobility or the growing acceptance that gender should be non binary 
MAY13	Jeremy Corbyn has to get off the fence for Labour to see off the Faragists	Labour remainers are in a dilemma Wherever I go I find lifelong Labour voters indeed whisper it even some elected Labour councillors and probably an occasional MP agonising over their European election vote in days time In the privacy of the polling booth no one will ever know with both Momentum leaners and non Momentumites united in the same quandary  This election is all about Europe and our place in the world nothing else not a dry run for a general election Results will have only one meaning how many voted remain and how many voted leave This will tell if all the opinion polls are right Not one has shown a leave lead for more than two years with remain solidly ahead Will that be replicated on May The number of seats won by any party will barely matter compared with the crucial total of in out votes This is our second referendum by proxy 
MAY13	Game of Thrones' 'sicansíos': not the first word to be lost in translation	Game of Thrones is known for its linguistic inventiveness The TV adaptation of George RR Martin s fantasy cycle has gone way further than the original novels ever did with linguist David J Peterson fleshing out the languages of Essos and Westeros Dothraki and Valyrian from one or two phrases into grammatically coherent conlangs or constructed languages  The latest piece of vocabulary to come out of the show has nothing to do with him however In fact it wasn t purposely designed by anyone I m tempted because of the genre we re dealing with to call it an epic fail But it s probably not as bad as leaving a Starbucks cup in shot And it s actually pretty fascinating 
MAY13	Why is Nigel Farage all over the airwaves while my party barely gets a look-in?	This morning I woke up wondering if lightning ever struck twice and hoping that it did In April as my Icelandair flight made its final descent into Heathrow a fireball engulfed the plane By the time I reached arrivals news organisations were on the phone asking for eyewitness testimonies I had little to say about my split second inside a giant firework but the platform gave me an opportunity to speak about something else What did you think when the lightning hit asked one interviewer after another My responses were the same I thought I can t die I have to vote for the Women s Equality party WE next week  The party I had co founded months earlier was in the closing stages of its first election campaigns Our biggest task as a new party was to let people know we existed WE went on to pick up more than votes Now I am fighting another campaign this time as WE s lead candidate in London for the European elections If you weren t aware of my candidacy or that we ve just published the most bold and radical manifesto of this electoral contest or that we ve just won our first seat in the local elections in Congleton don t be surprised Ofcom guidelines intended to ensure fair elections by allocating TV and radio airtime to parties according to measures such as their past performance are often misinterpreted as instructions to silence newer parties It takes a stroke of luck good or bad to get us public attention 
MAY13	It's time we stopped persecuting Britain's real strugglers: the privately educated	The plight of the privately educated in Britain is now apparently akin to the plight of Jews under Adolf Hitler s genocidal regime Stare in bafflement all you like but this was the claim splashed on the front page of the Times on Saturday of the head of Stowe School a mediocre Buckinghamshire private school who argued that questioning the disproportionate numbers of privately educated people in positions of power was akin to the conspiratorial language of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the language of Hitler and his henchmen Do you have concerns about the privileged buying their children places at the top table That those from less privileged backgrounds are drastically underrepresented in key British institutions And think widening educational access is fundamentally a good thing I m sorry to report that you are a Nazi  It is a story that future historians may regard as a fascinating insight into Britain s crumbling social order When those with wealth and power fear that their privilege is even mildly challenged they invariably clothe themselves in the garbs of victimhood The crux of the Times splash was the fear that Oxbridge was discriminating against the privately educated in favour of state school pupils constituting social engineering Let s leave aside the fact that private education is the most striking example of social engineering in our society The line of argument here is one I m long familiar with when I was at Oxford I vividly recall a private school student claiming that state school alumni such as myself only got accepted because of preferential quotas 
MAY13	Sexual abuse charities need money – but not from Tommy Robinson	On Friday women s organisations published an open letter voicing our disgust at Tommy Robinson s pledge to donate his MEP salary to victims of sexual abuse if he is elected in the north west of England We are calling on voters throughout the region to reject him  We thought long and hard about potentially giving Robinson whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon further publicity and initiating a fight that he and his thuggish friends probably want to have But we can no longer stay silent as he makes lies about the sexual abuse of girls his main campaigning and recruitment message 
MAY13	Is India the frontline in big tech’s assault on democracy?	In days time two political dramas will reach their denouement thanks to the votes of a combined total of about billion people At the heart of both will be a mess of questions about democracy in the online age and how or even if we can act to preserve it  Elections to the European parliament will begin on May and offer an illuminating test of the rightwing populism that has swept across the continent In the UK they will mark the decisive arrival of Nigel Farage s Brexit party whose packed rallies are serving notice of a politics brimming with bile and rage masterminded by people with plenty of campaigning nous The same day will see the result of the Indian election a watershed moment for the ruling Hindu nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata party or BJP Whatever the outcomes both contests will highlight something inescapable that the politics of polarisation anger and what political cliche calls fake news is going to be around for a long time to come 
MAY13	Brexiteers want us to glory in isolation. Their vision is introverted and selfish	International development aid is the latest casualty in the Brexit war of words Rightwing zealots are now arguing not just for our bn aid budget to be redirected to spending at home but also for the abolition of the Department for International Development and the redefining of aid as we see fit with what s left no longer there primarily to help the world s poor but to project their own view of British nationalism on to the world stage  As if comparing overseas aid to the work of a modern Mrs Jellyby whose eyes according to Charles Dickens in Bleak House were fixed on nothing nearer than Africa while she neglected her own children at home the right now caricatures aid not only as inefficient wasteful and a way of the poor in rich countries subsidising the rich in poor countries but also as money diverted to dubious causes abroad from good causes at home the insinuation being that sending British money abroad to people who are not British is in some way unpatriotic 
MAY13	Seeing Ben Shapiro flounder might be fun, but far-right celebrities are no joke	There are broadly three ways to react to the shifting of the Overton window the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse The first and most common is to move along with it accepting new parameters and adapting to them The second is to stay put but look through the window acknowledging that things have changed while attempting to grapple with that The third is to resist the movement altogether to refuse to engage with any previously beyond the pale ideas and reject any arguments to do so  I tend to fall into the third camp an Overton window refusenik This is not fashionable and it s not easy by the very nature of the problem people who agree with you become more desensitised with each passing day There comes a point when seeing Nigel Farage on TV becomes no longer appalling but almost comforting It s old Nigel again with his familiar voice and manner and bluster and cackle an offence of white noise 
MAY13	From Years and Years to Bird Box: why we turn to dystopian dramas in a crisis	In Years and Years the six part BBC drama series from the writer Russell T Davies that starts this week Daniel Russell Tovey cradles his newborn nephew and says I don t think I could have a kid in a world like this Because if it s this bad now what s it going to be like for him in years time years five years  It would be tempting to write Daniel off as a catastrophist except that as the series shifts forward in time he and his family are forced to navigate an increasingly divided country in which technology is wreaking havoc the economy is collapsing and war in Europe is bringing record numbers of refugees to British shores If you think we ve got problems now Davies seems to warn us you ain t seen nothing yet 
MAY13	If Labour is so committed on climate, it should recognise how the EU can help	The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has pledged to use every lever of government possible to tackle climate change And his latest idea is to go after the big players on the London Stock Exchange warning that UK companies failing to act to reduce carbon emissions will be delisted  As a green economist radical steps to address the economic drivers of our various environmental crises have been my bread and butter for years So I welcome Labour s newfound commitment to get serious on climate change though its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by can hardly be seen as treating the problem as an emergency Greens believe we must reach net zero carbon by and that such a target is achievable 
MAY14	Coming soon: the great universal credit deception	How to sell the unsellable How to pretend utter chaos is a plan coming together How to persuade the public who just refuse to buy it to at least keep on paying for it I believe I have found the answer  It comes in the form of an internal memo from the Department for Work and Pensions that somehow floated past my desk Published on the staff intranet just a few days ago on May it is signed by three of the department s most senior officials including the DWP s director of communications and Neil Couling its head of universal credit And it is that toxically controversial benefit which is its subject 
MAY14	Tackling inequality means addressing divisions that go way beyond income	Why are people so convinced inequality is rising in Britain even though the figures say it isn t  This is one of the great political paradoxes of our times the point where what most people would describe as common sense parts company rather confusingly with statistics The divide between haves and the have nots certainly feels as if it s got wider through the austerity years as rising numbers queue for food banks while at the other end of the spectrum FTSE chief executive pay has risen to times that of its average employee The Brexit referendum exposed deep divisions between people still relatively content with their lot and those who for whatever reason felt left behind Who really feels deep down as if society has got fairer over the last decade 
MAY14	Doris Day’s public image was the one role she could never shake off	Hollywood has always prided itself on being the place where illusion is sold as reality But no film director was ever as skilled at mining the gap between fantasy and fact as the studios PR chiefs in Hollywood s golden era imposing images on their stars that had about as much to do with the truth as pornography does with genuine sexuality Marilyn Monroe was sold as an all knowing sexual vamp when in truth she was a deeply damaged woman who was sexually abused and exploited throughout her life Kirk Douglas was styled as an all American alpha male when his name is actually Issur Danielovitch and he grew up speaking Yiddish in unimaginable poverty  Doris Day who died this week was in many ways the most interesting example of this dissonance between the public persona and often not entirely private reality Her image of the perky girl next door was both the making and eventual undoing of her career and it has proved extraordinarily tenacious in the minds of the public and critics Movie fans long ago grasped that say Judy Garland s image as the innocent sweet songbird didn t really match up with the miserable pill addled figure she already was by her mid s But it was the rare obituary of Day this week that didn t describe her somewhere as the girl next door 
MAY14	Teaming up with Nigel Farage would trash the Conservative brand	Remember Cleggmania When the Liberal Democrats look back on the election campaign of when their poll ratings hit the mark it must seem like a heady dream Their final vote share wasn t as high as some had hoped but it was enough to bring Nick Clegg s party into a coalition government and into power for the first time Look on my works ye mighty and despair  We all know what happened next and why The Lib Dems experienced electoral wipeout in as a result of allying themselves with a political party that their core voters found toxic 
MAY14	I don’t watch Game of Thrones – which makes me a lot more interesting than you	Hell is other people talking about Game of Thrones And hell I have discovered to my mounting horror is impossible to escape Thrones fever has gripped the world and people won t stop going on about the bloody show and how they can t believe that their favourite elf just got beheaded after an incestuous tryst with a one armed witch or how some dragon queen or other has suddenly shown her nasty side The fanaticism is bewildering  Admittedly this may have something to do with the fact that I have never watched the show People are constantly telling me to give it a go there are only hours of densely plotted goblin porn to catch up on but I just can t bring myself to do so The fact that I ve never seen Game of Thrones which is now on its eighth season has become an integral part of my personality Whenever I meet new people I make sure they know this very important detail about me I announce it to strangers on the internet I have it proudly listed on my LinkedIn And I drop the fact that I don t watch the overrated dragon show into conversation at every conceivable opportunity You see Game of Thrones is not just a television programme it is an Extremely Popular Thing and there is no better way to prove that you are a very interesting very intelligent person than by expressing your disdain for Extremely Popular Things Whenever too many people like something it s obvious there s something wrong with it 
MAY14	The Swedish dream was always too good to be true. And now the far right is back	Trying to define a nation s self image is always an interesting exercise especially if one tries to boil it down to a single word What would that be for Britain Independence perhaps For Sweden there can only be one word goodness We aren t looking quite as good as we would like to right now though Neo Nazis march through the streets not many but highly visible trying to influence the political scene through threats and violence  We Swedes like to believe that our politics are good for the rest of the world
MAY14	I thought I knew about my mental illness. But the truth shocked me	It s been nearly two years since I tweeted that when I was in my early s I had a breakdown and was sectioned I didn t know it at the time but that early morning post would have a profound effect on me and challenge me to re evaluate just about every area and aspect of my life I expanded on the tweet in a piece I wrote for the Guardian about my experiences and was actually pleased that I d finally told the story publicly as I d wanted to do for a long time  Psychosis affects roughly one in people every year and each case is different
MAY14	Jeremy Corbyn has to get off the fence for Labour to see off the Faragists	Labour remainers are in a dilemma Wherever I go I find lifelong Labour voters indeed whisper it even some elected Labour councillors and probably an occasional MP agonising over their European election vote in days time In the privacy of the polling booth no one will ever know with both Momentum leaners and non Momentumites united in the same quandary  This election is all about Europe and our place in the world nothing else not a dry run for a general election Results will have only one meaning how many voted remain and how many voted leave This will tell if all the opinion polls are right Not one has shown a leave lead for more than two years with remain solidly ahead Will that be replicated on May The number of seats won by any party will barely matter compared with the crucial total of in out votes This is our second referendum by proxy 
MAY14	A sex strike is not enough: women need to down tools completely	Sex is the very least of our concerns the last thing that has to be crossed off the to do list Or so I have heard from harassed women in the school playground Yet sex is the very meaning of life the cement that glues together every relationship half our culture also tells us while the remainder portrays women as a series of orifices to be penetrated  Perhaps sex is all and none of these things When people write to experts asking for help their problems inevitably boil down to I want more or less sex or of a different kind or with a different person from the one I am currently having sex with 
MAY14	Game of Thrones' 'sicansíos': not the first word to be lost in translation	Game of Thrones is known for its linguistic inventiveness The TV adaptation of George RR Martin s fantasy cycle has gone way further than the original novels ever did with linguist David J Peterson fleshing out the languages of Essos and Westeros Dothraki and Valyrian from one or two phrases into grammatically coherent conlangs or constructed languages  The latest piece of vocabulary to come out of the show has nothing to do with him however In fact it wasn t purposely designed by anyone I m tempted because of the genre we re dealing with to call it an epic fail But it s probably not as bad as leaving a Starbucks cup in shot And it s actually pretty fascinating 
MAY15	Inequality is the scourge of modern Britain. Is it finally about to be addressed?	Reports by the great and the good are ten a penny All too often they are an excuse for kicking a tricky political issue deep into the long grass Only rarely do they count for much Maybe just perhaps the review into inequality launched by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and headed by the Nobel prize winning economist Sir Angus Deaton will be one that makes a difference It has the potential to be a very big deal indeed as important in shaping the Britain of the st century as the Beveridge report was in the mid th century  Why Because Deaton is asking the same fundamental questions that William Beveridge posed almost eight decades ago in his November report Is inequality killing capitalism and if so what can be done about it 
MAY15	I’ve worked on shows like Jeremy Kyle – the real cruelty happens off screen	I ended up working on Trisha by accident The talkshow s producers contacted my university looking for graduates and I was offered an interview It was an amazing opportunity to break into television I couldn t believe my luck My wide eyed enthusiasm clouded my vision from the awful reality of what was to come I worked on the show after it switched from ITV to Channel from to  Alarm bells should have rung during training week when I was paired up with a colleague for some role play I had to imagine she was st and persuade her to wear a bikini on the show A few months later I put this training to practical use when I succeeded in convincing a real life plus sized woman to do this She walked on stage to ridicule I was told I was great at my job 
MAY15	With Bolton whispering in Trump’s ear, war with Iran is no longer unthinkable	It was a deception that would lead to millions of civilian deaths and the deaths of nearly US soldiers In August President Lyndon B Johnson solemnly declared that after two apparent North Vietnamese attacks on US navy destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin military action would take place  Four years later Senator Albert Gore father of Bill Clinton s future vice president warned in a closed Foreign Relations Committee session that If this country has been misled the consequences are very great His suspicions were correct The second Gulf of Tonkin attack might never have happened and perhaps neither did Communications to make it look like the attack occurred had been falsified But US policy was already set on a dramatic escalation of the Vietnam war and here was the perfect pretext 
MAY15	How do you retaliate against a WhatsApp attack?	We don t yet know for sure who used Israeli company NSO s software to hack WhatsApp users the messaging service s parent company Facebook has said only that the culprit is an advanced cyber actor but all signs point to it being a government According to one analysis NSO has governments as clients including amazingly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates even though officially these states don t recognise Israel  Whoever the culprit the WhatsApp attack will surely be added to a long list of state backed attacks that includes Russia s takedown of Ukraine s power grid China s persistent intellectual property thefts and North Korea s attack on Sony Pictures over the film The Interview And yes the west does it too the United States used a cyber weapon to take down Iran s nuclear programme in the so called Stuxnet attack 
MAY15	Yes, Islamophobia is a type of racism. Here’s why	On March a gunman walked into the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch New Zealand and opened fire During the course of his killing spree there and at the Linwood Islamic Centre people were slaughtered in their place of worship for no other reason than their killer had decided that their faith meant that they deserved to die  Hatred against Muslims does not begin with the sound of gunfire breaking through the peaceful calm of a place of prayer It begins with simple prejudice in our schools our workplaces and our communities More than years since the Runnymede Trust published its seminal report Islamophobia a challenge for us all it is on the rise 
MAY15	Mordaunt’s muddled amnesty won’t work – and sends a dangerous message	There will be plenty of British military veterans relieved by word that the new defence secretary Penny Mordaunt plans to introduce an amnesty on so called historical prosecutions for actions committed more than years ago which should cover offences committed during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan At first glance it looks like a welcome response to the pain described by many ex service personnel as they face multiple investigations into past events often triggering a recurrence of post traumatic stress disorder as they are forced to relive horrific experiences from long ago  Others will be pleased by what Mordaunt s move means for the soldiers of the future In this view the armed forces can t possibly do their job if in the heat of battle they are half thinking of a future day in court The argument is simple that it s wrong to ask those in uniform to risk everything for their country only to throw the book at them for it afterwards 
MAY15	If London needs a separate Trans Pride, what does that say about LGBT solidarity?	Pride in London is the one day of the year that the city feels like it belongs to LGBTQ people which was why I was so confused embarrassed and alarmed when a small group of lesbians disrupted last year s event with a protest against the inclusion of trans people Their banners read transactivism erases lesbians Pride in London quickly condemned the protests but as a lesbian and a feminist I worried that people would think these protesters represented me More than that I worried about how it all left trans people feeling  Perhaps a year later we have a clear answer Plans for the first London Trans Pride have been announced Due to take place on September the event will celebrate and centre trans and gender nonconforming people There will be daytime family friendly events such as panel discussions and zine making as well as stalls from trans charities and businesses followed later by an afterparty with trans musicians performers and DJs The idea was sparked by last year s anti trans protests say its organisers performer and promoter Finn Love and artist and activist Lucia Blake 
MAY15	The inequality review’s panel experts are all white. How equal is that?	Some years back when I was working at the New Economics Foundation as a researcher a trustee of the organisation called me I had met him briefly the day before but was still surprised to hear his voice on the line He told me he organised art events and eventually got to the point of his call by saying that a panel he had organised was a bit too stale and having met me he thought I could bring some edge to the conversation I laughed saying I didn t know anything about art and in any case wasn t available I put the phone down bemused  I am assuming by edge he meant that he needed me a brown woman from a working class background to counter his panel which was presumably all white and no doubt too male and too posh I suppose I should have been happy to be invited and while this was textbook tokenism if I d known something about the topic I might have accepted After all at the very least I was asked 
MAY15	If Theresa May resigns, we can still deliver the Brexit people voted for	Whatever side of the Brexit fence you sit on we can all agree that the last few months have been some of the most depressing and unproductive in our recent political history  The Brexit referendum was supposed to be a unique opportunity to restore faith in our democracy but instead we ve almost destroyed it As a country we ve collectively lost sight of the magnificent opportunities that Brexit could bring 
MAY15	Has the politics of climate change finally reached a tipping point?	Last week a small campaign group in the staunchly conservative town of Shrewsbury called a public meeting about climate change The organisers were delighted when people turned up Even they were surprised though when people unanimously said they were prepared to give up flying change their boilers and cars eat less meat and even overthrow capitalism to get a grip on climate change  But this was just a straw in the political wind whipping through middle England Shrewsbury joins more than other councils across the country in declaring a climate emergency and has pledged that it will be carbon neutral within years with more following every week 
MAY16	At last, Tories can begin to talk about Theresa May in the past tense	There is a small but significant distinction in politics between what is known and what is declared In recent weeks it has become ever harder to imagine how Theresa May might continue in her job if another attempt to steer Brexit through parliament fails But imagination is no longer required Resignation terms have been negotiated with the backbench Committee and made public  After a second reading of the EU withdrawal bill scheduled for the first week of June May and Sir Graham Brady will draw up a timetable for the election of a new Tory leader 
MAY16	Why is Labour just letting the Brexit party win the European elections?	The European elections are of historic importance Dangerous rightwing parties are likely to gain support led by the Brexit party We need to defeat the far right and confront the spread of racism and the threat of authoritarianism and violence We also need a serious commitment to tackling climate change and inequality  The Party of European Socialists has released a radical manifesto much influenced by Labour s general election manifesto It is calling for an end to austerity for a green transition for a feminist Europe and a Europe for the many If Labour were to take these elections seriously this could help shift the political balance in the European parliament with a transformative effect on the EU and Britain 
MAY16	Aras Amiri is Iran’s latest state-sponsored hostage. Britain must act	This week Aras Amiri from north London was convicted and sentenced in Iran to years in prison for organising Iranian cultural events in the UK for the British Council  It brought back memories of the sentencing of my wife Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe on similar charges in and the tearful weeks failing to make sense of it all Aras s case has many similarities to Nazanin s both arrested when on holiday visiting family both targeted for their links to the UK both had their jobs in London turned into cynical espionage claims 
MAY16	At last, the Labour party is being led from the bottom up	Right from the beginning the promise of Corbynism was that it would empower the grassroots In his acceptance speech on becoming Labour leader in September the MP for Islington North spoke of enabling members to better influence party policy of his desire to hear passionate debate and to make our party more inclusive more democratic and the membership better listened to in the future Let the tail wag the dog  On that basis we shouldn t be surprised by today s announcement that Momentum the youthful strong membership organisation established as an outrider for Corbyn s leadership will be campaigning for a radical and transformational new policy agenda It is nonetheless a desperately needed and inspirational injection of energy Over the summer the group will seek to organise Labour s mass membership to get motions passed in local constituency party meetings backing a green new deal including achieving zero carbon emissions by the introduction of a four day week and the abolition of all migrant detention centres 
MAY16	Alabama’s abortion ban is about keeping poor women down	A lot of good points were made about the inconsistencies and hypocrisies of Alabama s white male lawmakers who passed the anti abortion bill in the state senate this week It was pointed out that Republicans in favour of banning abortion are by and large against banning guns because by their own logic banning things doesn t work  It was observed that the life of a six week old bunch of cells is precious to these men but the life of a child born to a mother of no means in a state that voted to repeal Obamacare that notional kid not so much And while the point was made that no one who has watched a woman struggle through labour could in good conscience criminalise her disinclination to do so these arguments seemed to me bizarre premised on the notion that the men in Alabama were acting in good faith that they had the health of anyone but themselves in mind 
MAY16	Trump’s twinship with Orbán shows ‘illiberal democracy’ has a home in the US	How suited President Donald Trump and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orb n seemed as they sat together in the White House this week their heavy bodies and craggy faces projecting a brutalist power Their expensive dark suits and the elegant surroundings did nothing to hide their streetfighter natures and their air of self satisfaction at their accomplishments  No wonder Trump told Orb n in parting it s like we re twins bringing out the emotional politicking that s served him so well to build a fanatically loyal base of supporters in America 
MAY16	UK prisons are a disgrace. No wonder a Dutch court has refused to extradite	The prisons are inhumane and degrading in the words of a court in Amsterdam as it refused an extradition request The judges were referring not to a Russian penal colony but to HMP Liverpool halting the extradition of a fugitive wanted in the UK on drug smuggling charges The cause of this damning judgment is the appalling conditions in prisons such as Walton Liverpool Bedford and Birmingham  The Daily Mail may have been outraged by the judgment but it didn t surprise me I have been arguing similar extradition cases regarding prison conditions in other countries and often winning in the UK courts for years It was only a matter of time before European countries looked at our Dickensian prison system and asked the same difficult questions 
MAY16	The political landscapes of Brexit Britain and Weimar Germany are scarily similar	Enter the disturbing special exhibition that has recently opened in Berlin s German Historical Museum and you are immediately confronted with a series of bleak statements Liberal democracy cannot be taken for granted any longer Authoritarian parties are even gaining strength in countries with a long democratic tradition The public s trust in liberal democracy seems to be waning in Germany as well  The task of this outstanding museum is to tell the story of the nation s past But its new exhibition about the post first world war Weimar republic which runs until September is explicitly about both the past and the present And its scope is deliberately not confined to Germany but extended to countries such as Britain 
MAY16	Yes, Jeremy Kyle was exploitative. But it made working-class people visible	When news broke that The Jeremy Kyle show had been indefinitely suspended following the death of a guest I would have loved to have felt righteous joy Indeed the overwhelming response I saw went along the lines of good it was only ever a means for normal people to laugh at poor people While the announcement of the cancellation of ITV s daytime staple no doubt marks the end of an unsavoury year chapter in British television history I feel somewhat conflicted  I understand why the show was bad That s difficult to dispute But it was one of the few times I saw people like those I grew up with people whom you never see on television speaking with their own voices It didn t confirm my prejudices because I didn t have those prejudices to begin with I saw real human sadness need pain and people who had really got their lives in a mess 
MAY16	Tories should bear the shame that child poverty in Britain is the new normal	Child poverty is the new normal in parts of Britain That s according to findings released today by the End Child Poverty coalition a group of more than leading charities and organisations who have tracked the huge rise in child poverty since More than half of children are now living in poverty in some constituencies in the country with the fastest rises hitting the poorest areas The London borough of Tower Hamlets for example even has the majority of its infants in hardship  This is as shameful as it gets Children scavenging in bins to eat discarded apple cores for breakfast Headteachers finding their primary school pupils sleeping rough on a mattress with their parents after being evicted Forget a few extreme cases in many areas growing up in poverty is not the exception it s the rule 
MAY17	Is there a single blue-rinse Tory who doesn’t fancy a knee-trembler with Boris Johnson?	I wouldn t kiss you if you were the last man on Earth It s one of the great cliches of romance novels that any woman saying this will in due course be doing just that Maybe it ll be a hate kiss in the hayloft above the stables maybe it ll be a momentary lapse just after he s rescued her from a predatory ranch hand But you can absolutely bet on it she s going to be sharing herself with this man within pages The Tory parliamentary party s relationship with Boris Johnson is the hardcore porn version of this  For so long you couldn t move for Conservative MPs saying they d leave the party if Johnson ever became leader that they wouldn t vote for him in a million years that he didn t have a chance of getting anywhere near their special place One hundred pages deeper into the shitshow where are we on these holdouts 
MAY17	As rightwing populism spreads, bigotry against the LGBT community is growing	I spent last week in Cuba a time which overlapped with what should have been the country s th annual Conga Against Homophobia and Transphobia The march however organised by the government and the brainchild of Mariela Castro daughter of Raul was cancelled owing to new tensions in the international and regional context  This essentially translates into a fear that people taking to the streets at a time of heightened tension in the region might turn into general unrest But there is also the unmentioned fact that religious communities in Cuba are increasingly pushing back against the otherwise repressive state s attempts to improve LGBT rights Earlier in the year proposed changes to the constitution to allow same sex marriages were scrapped after pressure from evangelical churches and sections of the population A spontaneous civilian organised march to replace the cancelled conga resulted in multiple arrests 
MAY17	Remain voters are left with no choice but to ignore Labour next week	Shall we take a nostalgic trip back to the distant past of two weeks ago You ll remember there were local elections in England in which the pro Brexit parties took a pasting while the anti Brexit parties surged You might also recall how the main parties interpreted those results they hailed them as a heartfelt plea from the voters to get on with Brexit  Here then is a warning to remain minded voters ahead of Thursday s European elections If you want to send a message about Brexit you ll need to send it as clearly and as unambiguously as possible Up against a spin machine capable of hearing a repudiation as an endorsement voters will need to be louder and clearer this time closing down the scope for wilful misinterpretation 
MAY17	Trump's 'deal of the century' hasn't a hope of bringing peace	Here in Jerusalem we await publication of Donald Trump s deal of the century which is expected to be released in the coming weeks The US president has promised it will bring an end to a century long conflict between Israelis and our Palestinian neighbours  But the Trump administration s vision for peace looks doomed only to further entrench the occupation as a recent remark from Jason Greenblatt Trump s Middle East peace envoy demonstrated 
MAY17	Talks between Labour and the Tories on Brexit have broken down. So what next?	The news that the Brexit talks between the government and opposition have broken up without agreement comes as little surprise In the age of Brexit politics appears to have found a new form arriving at an obvious conclusion as slowly as possible thereby extending the misery for everyone Labour memorably described the process as akin to negotiating with a company going into administration given the prime minister s stated intention to leave office before the future relationship with the EU is agreed With Theresa May s departure confirmed for June the talks were plainly pointless  Taking the blame for a disastrous result in the European elections is the only thing holding May in place as prime minister
MAY17	In Northern Ireland, our hearts break for Alabama: we know about abortion bans	It feels like a lifetime ago since May In many ways it was because that day when the Republic of Ireland voted to repeal the eighth amendment of its constitution which outlawed abortion in virtually every circumstance was a unique step forward for abortion rights in a world where they are rapidly being dismantled  While the legislation brought in after the Irish referendum is imperfect the overall success of the repeal movement against so many obstacles gave campaigners across the world an incredible sense of hope But one year on global abortion rights are under increasing threat and that moment in May feels like an exception instead of a promise of what was to come 
MAY17	Change UK was always doomed to failure, and Joan Ryan just showed why	Fawlty Towers Alan Partridge The Office finally the great British tradition of it s so awkward you want to look away but you can t comedy has a new addition and it s called Change UK The critics may argue that this iteration lays the cringe factor on a little too thick however When Change UK s Joan Ryan asked her audience in Bath to look at your hands please followed by that s it it s there that s the answer to this it s in your hands in what can only be described as panicked primary school teacher meets David Brent s infamous motivational speech the horror was compounded by the fact she d clearly done this before and that the audience clapped Is this a political party or is it performance art  The tragicomedy of Change UK is principally one of hubris You can see to be fair why they thought success might beckon There is a rich seam of sympathy for their brand of politics within the British media and there s no doubt that many remain voters feel disillusioned angry even about Labour s Brexit triangulation But the principal flaw in their plan was this former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie believe that being a Blairite means automatically inheriting a political elixir from s Tony Blair of electoral success and generally being very good at politics 
MAY17	‘Historians’ like Jacob Rees-Mogg only have one character in mind: themselves	 History will be kind to me for I intend to write it Winston Churchill is widely and wrongly believed to have said He said something similar though and it s a notion that has been enthusiastically taken up by the politicians of today  For the most part they do so in their well indexed mostly unread and soon remaindered memoirs all of which bear the invisible subtitle I Told You I Was Right We can confidently expect David Cameron s For the Record whose publication has been announced for September to be such a one But the craftier among them those for whom naked self justification would look a bit well naked turn instead to writing proper books You know substantial works of history that show off their hinterland their intellectual range their bottom and which also invite the reader to draw flattering parallels with the career of the author These are the fancy book length equivalents you could say of Mark Francois yapping interventions on what we can learn about Brexit from the second world war 
MAY17	If you didn’t desert Labour over the Iraq war, why give up on it over Brexit?	In I accompanied Tony Benn for a short while on his lecture tour around Britain watching him speak to packed auditoriums and outselling the magician Paul Daniels in Cornwall by three to one It was a peculiar time that in many ways presaged the moment in which we find ourselves now  A year earlier Labour had just been returned with a huge majority and the steepest slump in postwar voter turnout to date A BBC survey Beyond The Soundbite prompted by concern about that decline in participation found that while voters were neither de politicised nor uninterested they were disillusioned and disconnected When asked to finish the statement I would get more involved if more than a third of respondents ticked either I thought my contributions made a difference or I thought anyone would listen And that was before the Iraq war 
MAY17	Cruel and chaotic? No, in the DWP’s fantasy land, universal credit is a huge success	Come with me on an eerie visit where we step through the looking glass into an alternative universe where everything is as good as can be You will like it here Everyone smiles they only want to help their clients fulfil themselves nothing bad ever happens here They love their work This little utopia is the Middlesbrough jobcentre As everywhere they are rolling out universal credit to new claimants or existing clients with any change of circumstance Here they prompt unemployed or underemployed people into work or more work telling them how many jobs to apply for what appointments and courses to take and whisper it with what penalties if they fail But that s very very rare  It has taken me all of seven months applying to the Department for Work and Pensions to get here my requests ignored forgotten or parked despite regular prodding Pre I often sat in with jobcentre staff but since then in department after department visiting any frontline is tortuous With HMRC eight years of requests to visit minimum wage inspectors has yielded nothing though they have never been outright refused 
MAY18	When the far right crack rape jokes, it’s part of a systemic bid to demean	When a clever woman threatens a man who demands submissiveness he can suggest that she s only interested in screwing him If that doesn t work he can silence her by threatening to rape her or by sneering that she s not worth raping anyway And when the woman protests he can smirk and say Can t you take a joke love  I m only trying to normalise comedy explained Ukip s Carl Benjamin after he told Labour s Jess Phillips I wouldn t even rape you and added I suppose with enough pressure I might cave but let s be honest nobody s got that much beer The famous British sense of humour which intrigues so many foreigners will doubtless have left tears of mirth streaming down your cheeks 
MAY18	From Alabama to Armagh, women are on the front line waging the ‘war on abortion’	Intensifying campaigns to criminalise all abortion in the US have been summarised accurately as a war on women one that calls on women to as the presidential contender Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has put it fight like hell  In terms of knowing the enemy much of it in the US will certainly resemble the Alabama misogynists the white male no longer young Republicans who have just stripped half their state s population of reproductive rights Photographs have been generously distributed But as the men would probably be the first to admit they couldn t have ushered in a generation or more of unwanted children without assistance from at least two women combatants Terri Collins and the state governor Kay Ivey 
MAY18	Is the idea of ‘real women’ just another way of selling stuff?	 Mirror mirror on the wall I don t see anyone like me at all is the message on the cover of the current edition of Stylist the women s free weekly magazine much garlanded with awards  Editor in chief Lisa Smosarski is a feminist who smartly uses the magazine to find imaginative ways to proselytise that while readers may face private and individual challenges many more of their difficulties are rooted in the public and systemic low pay discrimination and last week what she calls the mental health crisis triggered by a ubiquitous and fetishised very white very thin very doctored vision of female beauty 
MAY18	Barry Manilow: glad to be gay, without trying to sell something	It can feel like a glitch in the fabric of the universe to be reminded that Barry Manilow only publicly came out as gay in  Manilow was when he did the big reveal with People magazine My untold story and had been with his long term partner and recent husband for years Coming out is different for every single person who has to do it and every person finds their own path when Manilow came out it was greeted largely as a bit funny that anyone might have not known that already 
MAY18	The selfish case for saving bees: it’s how to save ourselves	When I see a bee buzzing around my garden or in the park in early spring I get a real thrill from being able to identify her If she is black and darting among small white tubular flowers with her long tongue protruding and her legs tucked under her furry round body I know she is a hairy footed flower bee  A few years ago I wouldn t have noticed her because like most people I thought all bees were striped I also assumed they made honey stung and lived in a hive with a queen bee and her workers But only honeybees fit this description and they account for just a handful or so of the astonishing bee species worldwide Bumblebees the plump stripy garden visitors that have been voted the UK s favourite insect make up about The vast majority like the hairy footed flower bee come in many different colours don t make honey and live alone These solitary bees are often named according to how they construct their nests from plasterer bees which line their nest with a waterproof substance to mining bees which excavate elaborate underground burrows and leafcutter bees which plug the entrance with small discs of leaves cut from rose bushes 
MAY18	It shouldn’t be left to women to fight alone for abortion rights	No woman can be free who does not control her own body That s been the pro choice mantra down the ages no less true now than it ever was and from it flows the equally fierce conviction that men should keep their noses out of reproductive rights If it isn t your womb your life on the line here then what right do you have to interfere in a grown adult s decision No wonder that powerful image of the male politicians who collectively approved Alabama s cruel new ban on terminations beyond six weeks struck such a chord The sight of old men desperately clawing back their lost power over women s lives still triggers a deep visceral fear Six weeks That s barely a missed period a time when many women won t even have realised they re pregnant  True America s pro life movement has plenty of prominent women in it and in the UK it s a female leader of the pro life Democratic Unionist party who thanks to her sensitive role propping up the British government s parliamentary majority represents one of the biggest stumbling blocks to rolling out abortion rights in Northern Ireland But such nuances get forgotten in the face of men doggedly arguing on Twitter that forcing victims of incest to continue their pregnancies would at least preserve the criminal evidence or refusing to let their cluelessness about female biology get in the way of a terrible opinion 
MAY18	Is there a single blue-rinse Tory who doesn’t fancy a knee-trembler with Boris Johnson?	I wouldn t kiss you if you were the last man on Earth It s one of the great cliches of romance novels that any woman saying this will in due course be doing just that Maybe it ll be a hate kiss in the hayloft above the stables maybe it ll be a momentary lapse just after he s rescued her from a predatory ranch hand But you can absolutely bet on it she s going to be sharing herself with this man within pages The Tory parliamentary party s relationship with Boris Johnson is the hardcore porn version of this  For so long you couldn t move for Conservative MPs saying they d leave the party if Johnson ever became leader that they wouldn t vote for him in a million years that he didn t have a chance of getting anywhere near their special place One hundred pages deeper into the shitshow where are we on these holdouts 
MAY18	As rightwing populism spreads, bigotry against the LGBT community is growing	I spent last week in Cuba a time which overlapped with what should have been the country s th annual Conga Against Homophobia and Transphobia The march however organised by the government and the brainchild of Mariela Castro daughter of Raul was cancelled owing to new tensions in the international and regional context  This essentially translates into a fear that people taking to the streets at a time of heightened tension in the region might turn into general unrest But there is also the unmentioned fact that religious communities in Cuba are increasingly pushing back against the otherwise repressive state s attempts to improve LGBT rights Earlier in the year proposed changes to the constitution to allow same sex marriages were scrapped after pressure from evangelical churches and sections of the population A spontaneous civilian organised march to replace the cancelled conga resulted in multiple arrests 
MAY18	Remain voters are left with no choice but to ignore Labour next week	Shall we take a nostalgic trip back to the distant past of two weeks ago You ll remember there were local elections in England in which the pro Brexit parties took a pasting while the anti Brexit parties surged You might also recall how the main parties interpreted those results they hailed them as a heartfelt plea from the voters to get on with Brexit  Here then is a warning to remain minded voters ahead of Thursday s European elections If you want to send a message about Brexit you ll need to send it as clearly and as unambiguously as possible Up against a spin machine capable of hearing a repudiation as an endorsement voters will need to be louder and clearer this time closing down the scope for wilful misinterpretation 
MAY18	I’ve seen how lawyers’ sexism corrupts justice. This is how to change the industry	Surprise surprise bullying and sexual harassment is rife in the legal profession Yet another report this time from the International Bar Association shows that of female lawyers have been bullied in the UK which is higher than the international average and of women have suffered sexual harassment  The findings accord with the Bar Standards Board BSB report in which found that two in five respondents suffered sexual harassment and discrimination and only one in five reported it 
MAY19	If I were Jeremy Corbyn I’d be praying for a Boris Johnson victory	 This isn t a TV reality contest So declared defence minister Tobias Ellwood when asked by Sky News Sophy Ridge about the forthcoming Conservative leadership race To which there is only one honest response that s precisely what it is Even as the new Brexit deadline draws closer the Labour Tory talks collapse the Commons prepares to reject Theresa May s withdrawal agreement for the fourth time and the Conservatives face disaster in Thursday s European elections senior contenders for the top job merrily parade themselves their spouses and their kitchens in a grotesque bid for support in a contest that has not yet officially begun  They can t run the country pass the legislation it needs or arrange its departure from the European Union But they ll do a mean photoshoot for you at the drop of a hat To govern is indeed to choose 
MAY19	It’s not difficult to define Islamophobia. So why does Britain struggle with it so much?	Last week it became clear that according to senior police the Tories and some non Muslim public figures with some Muslim friends the term Islamophobia is undefinable in any meaningful actionable way The working definition put forward by the all party parliamentary group on British Muslims is not legally binding yet Martin Hewitt chair of the National Police Chiefs Council said it was too broad as currently drafted could cause confusion for officers enforcing it and could be used to challenge legitimate free speech on the historical or theological actions of Islamic states This is either ignorant or consciously misleading There is no legal implication in the definition whatsoever  Last week the government also rejected the definition which in full reads Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness The communities secretary James Brokenshire said that accepting the definition had potential consequences for freedom of speech and that the combination of race and religion would cause legal and practical issues Already adopted by Labour and the Liberal Democrats the definition was turned down because it needed further consideration So just how much more information will it take for ministers to consider such a short single sentence 
MAY19	Why the senators’ race matters in reporting the Alabama abortion ban	Why demanded several readers does this headline refer to race These Republicans all white men just voted to ban abortion in Alabama It was part of the Guardian s coverage of the southern US state s new measure The sole exception to the ban is serious risk to the health of the woman pregnancies resulting from incest or rape are not excepted Of the Republican men in Alabama s seat senate voted for the law  Distilled the readers view was that although it was understandable that the headline would emphasise male dominance it was wrong to highlight race too Wrote one It detracts and distracts from the real outrage which is that they re all male and they re all Republican rather than their skin colour Another reader thought that the reference to race implied that the votes were motivated by racism Another wanted the emphasis to stay on the personal moral beliefs of the legislators whichever way they voted 
MAY19	There should be nothing wrong in waving Palestinian flags at Eurovision	There were loud boos in the Tel Aviv Expo Centre on Saturday night and not just when it was announced that voters in Greece and Cyprus had once again awarded each other the full Eurovision song contest points in their annual display of allegiance When Hatari the Icelandic entrants waved Palestinian scarves solemnly to the cameras as their results rolled in my fellow audience members in the Israeli city made their dissatisfaction clear It was the first time those assembled in the room were confronted with the controversy that had surrounded Israel hosting the event and many just didn t like it  The European Broadcasting Union EBU which organises the contest sent out the statement This directly contradicts the rules the consequences of this action will be discussed 
MAY19	Why is Brussels so white? The EU’s race problem that no one talks about	With days to go until the polls open for the European parliament elections most political parties are finding it a struggle to convey the relevance of the EU to voters in voter turnout was just Eurosceptics from Nigel Farage to Matteo Salvini Marine Le Pen to Alternative f r Deutschland s Alexander Gauland have been united in their criticism of the Brussels elite  They focus on the unelected bureaucrats running the EU institutions Yet there s an elite they don t notice and of which they are members The EU s institutions and its parliamentary seats are all but closed to people who aren t white 
MAY19	When working-class lives can be so rich, why does reality TV choose to belittle them?	The trouble with having very little is the perception that you can be easily bought Many participants on The Jeremy Kyle Show on being asked why they went on said that they had never stayed in a hotel before The seductive triad of an all expenses paid trip free booze and minutes of fame is a far cry from an everyday life that is scarcely examined  Over the past week my inbox has been packed with horror stories about the machinations of The Jeremy Kyle Show with claims that members of the production team infiltrated step programmes transgender support groups and other havens for various fragments of vulnerability The emerging pattern from these stories is this one member joins the group to identify potential guests and gains their trust Time passes usually a few weeks and they offer a solution to their conflicts internal or external The show was rarely mentioned until a few days before filming the accounts suggest If true in any other level of society we would see this for what it is grooming and manipulation All in the name of the am entertainment slot 
MAY19	The middle ground no longer exists over Brexit. It’s all or nothing now	The collapse of the Tory Labour Brexit talks surprised Westminster as much as did the news that bears conduct their ablutions in forested areas and Boris Johnson is interested in becoming prime minister A question worth investigating because it illuminates where we are now how we got here and where we are heading is whether that failure was inevitable Was this bizarre and ultimately fruitless chapter of the Brexit saga never anything but a protracted charade Was the inability to broker a compromise always written in the stars Or could different actors have found a way to release Britain from its long national nightmare  Many believe that these talks the last resort of an enfeebled prime minister were fated to fail One senior figure involved in the six weeks of negotiations speaks as if describing a doomed relationship It was always going to end this way 
MAY19	What is Nigel Farage’s secret? That would be telling	 It was one of those things they keep in a jar in the tent of a sideshow on the outskirts of a little drowsy town One of those pale things drifting in alcohol plasma forever dreaming and circling with its peeled dead eyes staring out at you and never seeing you Ray Bradbury The Jar Weird Tales November  Last Friday morning in a packed working men s club in the Leave voting North Yorkshire moorland town of Blackleg Wang I heard the chants of Ni gel Ni gel Ni gel die away as Nigel Farage took the stage at his latest Brexit party rally I was shocked It was a long time since I had seen a politician who was actually popular with anyone 
MAY19	China wants us to forget the horrors of Tiananmen as it rewrites its history	Remembering the deaths of June is no neutral task It is a civic duty a burden and an act of resistance in countering a state level lie that risks spreading far beyond China s borders  On that day the Communist party sent tanks to clear protesters from Tiananmen Square in the centre of Beijing killing hundreds of people maybe more than a thousand In the intervening years China has systematically erased the evidence and memory of this violent suppression using its increasingly hi tech apparatus of censorship and control 
MAY19	The Brexit party reflects our hollowed-out, tired politics	Will British politics be upended in the European elections on Thursday Certainly the traditional faultlines may be recast at least for this election  The Brexit party will no doubt emerge triumphant the Tories crushed Labour humiliated and the Greens and the Lib Dems will make sufficient gains to claim a modicum of success Whatever the results they will leave untouched the fundamental problems that have created the chasm between large sections of the electorate and mainstream parties 
MAY20	Boris Johnson in No 10 will be a fitting finale to this dark decade	Armageddon awaits Boris Johnson is heading for No and there is nothing dishonest disreputable or even scandalous enough that he can do to stop his party choosing him now They know of his lies laziness and narcissism but they don t care After a crushing humiliation at the polls in Thursday s EU election where the Tory vote may fall to single figures this drowning party will clutch for the straw headed showman to save them from triumphant Faragists Well Prime Minister Johnson would provide a fitting finale to this ever darkening decade  A measure of the demented state of the Conservatives is the number of hats in the ring for this most poisonously impossible job Who would want to lead a paralysed government with no majority and a party that is a nest of vipers Anyone applying should be disqualified on grounds of diminished responsibility 
MAY20	Why I’m sitting in a box blocking the entrance to BP’s headquarters	The container I m currently inhabiting has everything I need to keep going for quite a while so I don t want to sound too self pitying but it is nevertheless a box It s got a chemical toilet an internet connection and heavy bolts to fasten it to the pavement and it s blocking the entrance to BP s London headquarters As a consequence BP s HQ is empty  As I sit here some of BP s executives are at home enjoying an unexpected break Some are at BP s AGM which has been moved to Aberdeen this year in the hope that it would make a climate protest more difficult 
MAY20	Trump Baby is back – and this time it’s more than just a balloon	 The greatest insult to a sitting US president ever It s not often that I turn to the words of Nigel Farage to seek confirmation I might be involved in doing something right but last July was different  It was a few days before Donald Trump was due to touch down for his first visit to British shores since his election to office And things weren t quite going to plan Britain was in thrall to the story of whether a ft high bright orange helium balloon would be given permission to soar above Parliament Square in central London Trump Baby had arrived 
MAY20	Google’s Huawei ban is good news: tech giants shouldn’t always get their way	The post digital revolution starts here Thank you Donald Trump The US president s decision to blacklist Huawei which has led to Google ending collaborating with the company may have the worst of motives It could have the best of consequences  So far global government has proved impotent in forcing the grand monopolies of the digital age to adhere to any regulation They have gone where they like gobbled up competitors as they choose and paid taxes or none as the whim takes them The only rivalry has been in physical products such as smartphones but they are just shells for conveying monopoly power round the world 
MAY20	Safer air for the kids? Grow more houseplants	When was it maybe two weeks ago I was just about clinging on to sanity s rigging amid the daily tempest of trauma that has become my family s morning routine My year old was fuming loudly because I hadn t bought her any croissants what have we become the dog was expressing his fear anxiety about the postman my husband was losing his shit at the toast he had just burned my year old was punting a rugby ball through the kitchen air the tinny hi hats of the latest indistinguishable mumble rap track playing on his portable speakers and John Humphrys had the hump about something  On this occasion it was the air quality in inner city classrooms which to be fair is a legitimate thing to grump on about even if it was with that tone of pantomime incredulity he employs NB what follows is a very vague estimation of a memory that is most likely wrong in the first place Surely there s something we can do to improve the air our children are breathing harrumphs Humph Plants I suggest to the radio Well yes there are things we can do says the air quality expert Plants I say again I m certain she s going to say plants We can fit classrooms with air purifiers that mechanically remove more than of air contaminants And plants surely Very interesting says Humph content no further investigation is required And that s that 
MAY20	Brexit has torn Britain in half. Only Labour can bridge that divide	The European elections have polarised the Brexit debate into two camps those who want to remain and discard the verdict of the referendum and those who want a clean or no deal Brexit Labour is urged to pick a side in this ongoing tug of war That is a dead end for the party and for a very divided country  The pollster Peter Kellner argues that Labour must come out unambiguously for remain His reasoning is that two thirds of Labour voters backed remain in that a greater proportion of Tory leave voters are now backing Nigel Farage s Brexit party and that there is a migration of Labour remain voters to the Liberal Democrats 
MAY20	London is still the UK’s golden goose – and that needs to change	London could be justified in feeling a little unappreciated right now Britons outside the capital think of its residents as arrogant and insular an investigation by the Centre for London has found London itself is seen as expensive and crowded Pride in the capital decreases with distance from it and appears to be declining over time And while over three quarters of Brits agree that London contributes to the national economy just feel it contributes to the economy where they live  There is a long held and persistent sense that London is too dominant in national life Some also perceive its success as coming at the expense of the rest of the country an idea that has re emerged periodically throughout history most famously in the s when parliamentarian William Cobbett described the capital as a Great Wen a gigantic cyst draining the life out of the rest of the nation 
MAY20	The Tories have forgotten their pro-EU voters. And they’ll pay for it	In a seemingly endless season of Tory nightmares this week looks set to mark the most dreadful phase so far The Conservatives are about to endure a set of elections that they never thought they would face Only four years ago the party won a general election now there is talk of them finishing fifth or even sixth With every Tory moan of pain Nigel Farage s nicotine grin grows ever larger And out in the country there is an overlooked Conservative crisis one bound up not with the part of the population that voted for Brexit but with the liberal pro remain swathe of the country without whom the future of Conservatism looks bleak indeed  I come from somewhere still understood as one of the most Tory places there is Wilmslow in Cheshire has a population of and is a dormitory town on the southern edge of the sprawl around Manchester Part of the Tatton constituency it was once represented by George Osborne and these days is the adopted home of the zealous Brexiteer Esther McVey Though slightly more mixed class wise than its reputation might suggest it remains a byword for suburban affluence and McVey sits on a majority of But in the referendum of Wilmslow was part of a wider Tory supporting area that voted for remain 
MAY20	If I were Jeremy Corbyn I’d be praying for a Boris Johnson victory	 This isn t a TV reality contest So declared defence minister Tobias Ellwood when asked by Sky News Sophy Ridge about the forthcoming Conservative leadership race To which there is only one honest response that s precisely what it is Even as the new Brexit deadline draws closer the Labour Tory talks collapse the Commons prepares to reject Theresa May s withdrawal agreement for the fourth time and the Conservatives face disaster in Thursday s European elections senior contenders for the top job merrily parade themselves their spouses and their kitchens in a grotesque bid for support in a contest that has not yet officially begun  They can t run the country pass the legislation it needs or arrange its departure from the European Union But they ll do a mean photoshoot for you at the drop of a hat To govern is indeed to choose 
MAY20	Why the Led by Donkeys billboards won’t change anyone’s mind on Brexit	When Ann Widdecombe was unveiled as the Brexit party s surprise European election candidate the tactical aim was clear show Conservative voters that switching their vote to Nigel Farage s new outfit made so much sense that even former ministers were happy to do so Widdecombe s name recognition is still high even in semi retirement and the move is embarrassing for a Conservative party struggling to fight an election it never wanted  The anti Brexit campaign group Led By Donkeys responded by posting billboards featuring Widdecombe s face the quote homosexual acts are wrongful in giant letters and was headlined Target gay people The aim was to warn voters of Widdecombe s hardline beliefs and by extension the views of the new party s potential MEPs And there was a small disclaimer at the bottom attempting to contextualise the comments 
MAY21	May's offer was neither 'new' nor bold. It will be her final failure	In a last ditch attempt to get her deal through parliament Theresa May has presented a supposedly fresh point plan to break the deadlock On closer examination the changes are at best slight and at worst set to lose her more support than they gain May once attempted a similar manoeuvre over supposedly legally binding changes to the backstop This afternoon was a last hurrah that is set to fail precisely because what she has offered is substantially no different to her three previous attempts to get a withdrawal bill passed Nothing has changed  The most eye catching announcement was that MPs would be offered a parliamentary vote on a second referendum if they supported the bill at its second reading But most pro referendum MPs have concluded that the best chance of getting a majority for a second national vote would be in October in the face of a fresh Tory leader genuinely willing to crash out of the EU with no deal They know that without brinkmanship the numbers simply aren t there So May s offer won t wash 
MAY21	This Milkshake Spring isn’t political violence – it’s political theatre	What a lot of crying over a spilt milkshake Since broadcaster and sometime politician Nigel Farage got covered in sticky banana and salted caramel in Newcastle on Monday the air has been thick with condemnation   Normal campaigning is becoming impossible tweeted the far right leader before pleading for civilised democracy a new tune from a man who warned that unless he gets his precise flavour of Brexit he would don khaki pick up a rifle and head for the frontlines The dousing was horrible and ridiculous said Tony Blair famed for his excellent judgment on weapon threats And so the professionally outraged have taken to social media and TV studio sofas bemoaning the debasement of our politics and whatever else they can squeeze into their allotted two and a half minutes 
MAY21	Want to stop Johnson? More Tories should follow Heseltine and join the resistance	Michael Heseltine knows how to make a grand exit The man who famously got himself suspended from parliament for swinging the mace before going on to storm out of Margaret Thatcher s cabinet over the Westland helicopter scandal has now lost the Tory whip for threatening to vote Liberal Democrat in this week s European parliament elections The door has been left wide open for a return but while he may not want to leave Hezza evidently doesn t intend to take his party s descent into madness lying down Which is more than can be said for some of his colleagues  Boris Johnson we have been earnestly assured for years would struggle to become leader because plenty of Tory MPs would lie down in front of a bulldozer rather than let him through to a ballot of the membership Those who had seen his shortcomings up close would not risk him dazzling those who haven t They have had more than enough time to think about how that would work in practice yet when the One Nation group of Conservative MPs the natural home of the moderate if not exclusively the pro remain met to discuss the leadership contest it was at pains to stress it wasn t plotting to stop Boris The group may come out against Dominic Raab Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom the hard Brexiters who aren t as likely to win but not Johnson with some of its members already falling in behind him 
MAY21	‘Clean Brexit’ sounds so simple, doesn’t it? Trouble is, it doesn’t exist	No deal is back in vogue to the extent that it ever fell out of fashion As Theresa May nears the end the chancellor Philip Hammond is warning of the risk of a new prime minister abandoning the search for a deal and shifting towards a damaging no deal exit as a matter of policy  Richard Tice chairman of the Brexit party was banging the no deal drum on the Today programme earlier this week arguing that a clean Brexit sounds appealing doesn t it would work out just fine because of the provisions of the World Trade Organization WTO treaty 
MAY21	Facial recognition tech is creeping into our lives – I’m going to court to stop it	A few days before Christmas I stepped out of my office on to Cardiff high street to grab some lunch Among the crowd of flustered last minute shoppers I was captured  Without my consent or knowledge the police had scanned my facial features creating a biometric map of my face as unique to me as my fingerprint or DNA 
MAY21	Wales is doing it. So why won’t Westminster support the UK steel industry?	British Steel created by Greybull Capital only three years ago is in serious financial difficulty It may collapse if the government does not provide a m rescue package to support continued operations  Unfortunately I wasn t surprised by this development The confusion and economic dislocation of Brexit a global steel glut and the US China trade war have combined to make the economic climate for UK steelmaking more challenging than ever before not to mention energy prices that are higher than in Germany and higher than in France and business rates five to ten times higher than on the continent 
MAY21	Oxford University must become more diverse. But we’re already on the right path	Varaidzo Kativhu is a second year Oxford University undergraduate with a personal YouTube following of about subscribers An early episode of her weekly bulletins describing her time at university dealt with the issue of whether Oxford is diverse   No no flat out no she said as emphatically as she could But she also told her viewers It is your job to make Oxford diverse In other words Do what I did apply to study here and be part of the change 
MAY21	Why is everyone suddenly using the C-word?	A journalist from Canada recently shared a video on Twitter in which she asked people in Manchester their opinion of Tommy Robinson real name Stephen Yaxley Lennon Two young people one male one female replied immediately with the word cunt The journalist was taken aback and the video quickly racked up retweets and comments So what s going on here Is the status of this notorious word changing  Swearing is power language a parallel vocabulary packed with emotion and social force But its effects depend heavily on context one person s everyday expletive is another s strict taboo These differences also vary greatly across time and place The strong religious swears in English in the Middle Ages are now mild in most places though minced versions remain popular jeepers cripes gosh 
MAY21	These elections could define Europe. It must urgently rediscover its founding spirit	Sometimes when it comes to Europe things are clearer from afar Take Viktor Orb n s encounter with Donald Trump last week a love fest perfectly timed to signal that this US president is out to disembowel the European Union if not break it entirely Ahead of the European elections here was Hungary s self proclaimed illiberal prime minister a man teaming up with Italy s far right strongman Matteo Salvini receiving his long awaited anointment from a white nationalist US president who has called the EU a foe  Meanwhile in Syria barrel bombs and Russian military ordnance continued to rain down on Idlib s hospitals and schools as the noose tightened on million civilians trapped in the last rebel held area that the president Bashar al Assad wants to reconquer Historians will perhaps one day tell us whether Vladimir Putin timed that particular offensive to coincide with other items on his EU destroying agenda already well on display with disinformation campaigns aimed at helping extremist political forces across the continent 
MAY21	Five more years of Narendra Modi will take India to a dark place	Indian elections are a marvel to behold The rules stipulate that no citizen should have to travel more than km to vote So the state goes to the voters Carrying oxygen tanks election officials scaled the Himalayas to erect a voting booth in a village in Ladakh metres above sea level In western India a polling station was set up for the lone human inhabitant of a wildlife sanctuary In eastern India officials trekked for an entire day to reach the sole registered voter an elderly woman in a remote village By the time voting closed on Sunday some million people had cast their ballots million of them for the first time  The refrain from Hindu voters has been identical Modi has failed us yes but he s at least put Muslims in their place
MAY22	Brexit has become a subplot to the battle for the post-May Tory party	Until quite recently it was still accurate to say that the central problem in British party politics was Brexit This week that has imperceptibly but now decisively changed Now and probably for much of the coming summer the central problem in British party politics is no longer Brexit itself but the character of the post Theresa May Tory party  May s decline from the now hard to recall autumn of when she enjoyed the confidence of of Tory voters and of the whole electorate has been long and slow The mishandling of the needless election of resulted in enormous self inflicted damage But even as the diminished May continued to battle on into the early part of this year to get her withdrawal agreement adopted British politics was still essentially about Brexit rather than her 
MAY22	Andrea Leadsom's defection reflects how toxic May has become	A minister resigning from Theresa May s government rarely makes the front pages these days since the election the prime minister had lost government ministers  However there was a sense of surprise in government circles that it was one of May s more loyal cabinet colleagues Andrea Leadsom who became the nd and it is unlikely she will be the last 
MAY22	How to vote in the European elections? Our panel’s verdicts	This may be as close as we ever get to a second referendum You never know obviously even though there s barely enough time to organise one before October and not enough support for it in parliament miracles can happen But if they don t then this Thursday could be our last chance for a crystal clear verdict on three years of stumbling towards disaster Do you want Brexit at any price a no deal Brexit if necessary now Theresa May s deal is dying or not  For however much Labour tries to pretend it s really about renationalising things or kicking out the Tories this isn t a domestic election and there s only one real question here The lesson of the local elections when Jeremy Corbyn seemingly interpreted a Liberal Democrat resurrection as a mandate to carry on regardless is there s no room for ambiguity If you want to remain revoke vote again or do anything but be swept inexorably over the waterfall then go Liberal Democrats Greens Change UK in England and SNP or Plaid Cymru in Scotland or Wales If tactical voting advice seems baffling then vote with your heart Reward the Lib Dems courage in resisting Brexit when nobody else was or the Greens for doing the same on the climate emergency or Change UK for at least trying to shake their old parties out of it whatever moves you 
MAY22	Why is Nigel Farage immune to scandals that would destroy his rivals?	Let s say the pollsters have got it wrong After all their record is hardly perfect So let s say they ve called it wrong and the Tories are not down to which would be the worst electoral performance in their history that Labour are not on a meagre trailing six points behind the Lib Dems and a single point ahead of the Green party Let s say those numbers from YouGov s last poll for the Times ahead of tomorrow s European elections prove to be off once the votes are counted Even if that happens there s one finding that is unlikely to be upended If it were the pollsters would have to be more wrong than they have ever been and to an outlandishly large degree That finding shared by all the polling organisations is the imminent victory of Nigel Farage and his Brexit party  YouGov has Farage ahead of his closest rivals the Lib Dems by a staggering points Even if that hugely overestimates his support he s still in front Pollsters have a margin of error but even if you tripled it Farage is still the likely winner of this contest 
MAY22	The Brexit party's toxic rhetoric doesn't represent most leave voters	Throwing milkshakes at people you politically disagree with is something we just shouldn t do I d love it if UK politics could be one great big food fight as we d probably get a lot more done than parliament has since the referendum But the problem is it won t stop there It took less than a second for Tommy Robinson real name Stephen Yaxley Lennon to escalate to punching the person who threw milkshake on him Jo Cox s widower Brendan Cox responded to the Nigel Farage milkshake incident by condemning the act despite his strong political opposition to Farage because it normalises violence and intimidation If you want to hurt Nigel Farage expose him for what he is  I was at the Brexit party rally in London last night with a couple of upturned buckets for chairs and a folding table with a banner reading A no deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK Change my mind I was inviting people to speak to me the most basic expression of liberal democracy 
MAY22	I tried to sexually harass Siri, but all she did was give me a polite brush-off	 Hey Siri show me your tits is not something I ever thought I d say especially not while sitting in an empty kitchen while wearing fluffy slippers I have many hobbies but sexually harassing disembodied digital entities is not one of them even in the interests of journalistic research  But having read that a UN report that claimed virtual assistants coded female by default i e most of them were reinforcing gender stereotypes that portray women as subservient for example by responding to sexual harassment in a tolerant even coquettish manner I thought I had better conduct an experiment Hey Siri wanna fuck I was trying to do my best frat boy impression but ended up sounding sad and apologetic a bit like how I wish men would in real life Hey Siri I said lugubriously you re a slut 
MAY22	White teachers like me should not be policing black pupils’ hair	Last year a year old student was forced to take legal action after he was threatened with suspension by his London school for wearing his hair in dreadlocks More recently a six year old was sent home from school for having a skin fade a common black hairstyle because his primary school claimed it would detract from learning Now new research released by De Montfort University Leiceister has revealed that one in six children with afro textured hair in the UK are having a bad experience with school hair policies  Having recently taught in a school with a large African Caribbean student population this research confirms what I witnessed there I saw boys with cornrows and afros being told by senior school leaders that they won t be taken seriously if they didn t adopt a more professional hairstyle I consoled young black girls placed in internal exclusion rooms for wearing a black protective cloth over their recently styled braids Black students being sent home for adding blond or red streaks to their hair while white students who did the same went unreprimanded shows how racialised school uniform policies can be 
MAY22	This Milkshake Spring isn’t political violence – it’s political theatre	What a lot of crying over a spilt milkshake Since broadcaster and sometime politician Nigel Farage got covered in sticky banana and salted caramel in Newcastle on Monday the air has been thick with condemnation   Normal campaigning is becoming impossible tweeted the far right leader before pleading for civilised democracy a new tune from a man who warned that unless he gets his precise flavour of Brexit he would don khaki pick up a rifle and head for the frontlines The dousing was horrible and ridiculous said Tony Blair famed for his excellent judgment on weapon threats And so the professionally outraged have taken to social media and TV studio sofas bemoaning the debasement of our politics and whatever else they can squeeze into their allotted two and a half minutes 
MAY22	My art was used to sell cars – but I’m fighting back	In October I was astonished when Michael Thouber the director of Copenhagen s Kunsthal Charlottenborg informed me that my artwork Soleil Levant had been used in an advertisement for the new Volkswagen Polo Soleil Levant is an installation comprising lifejackets worn by refugees undertaking perilous sea journeys to reach safety in Europe Many refugees survived due to these lifejackets some perished Some lifejackets were fake and those wearing them could have drowned  I travelled to countries and visited dozens of refugee camps It was an extremely intense even painful experience
MAY22	The UN has condemned Tory welfare policies. Labour must end this shame	How did Britain in one of the wealthiest societies that has ever existed end up being damned by a United Nations report for condemning the poor to lives that are solitary poor nasty brutish and short These are the words of the th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes another British literary great conjured up by Prof Philip Alston the UN s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and a bete noir of our crumbling government is Charles Dickens and his vivid description of the th century workhouse now being brought back in a digital and sanitised version  The government he contended was guilty of the systematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population and that much of the glue that has held British society together since the second world war has been deliberately removed and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos 
MAY23	How to vote in the European elections? Our panel’s verdicts	This may be as close as we ever get to a second referendum You never know obviously even though there s barely enough time to organise one before October and not enough support for it in parliament miracles can happen But if they don t then this Thursday could be our last chance for a crystal clear verdict on three years of stumbling towards disaster Do you want Brexit at any price a no deal Brexit if necessary now Theresa May s deal is dying or not  For however much Labour tries to pretend it s really about renationalising things or kicking out the Tories this isn t a domestic election and there s only one real question here The lesson of the local elections when Jeremy Corbyn seemingly interpreted a Liberal Democrat resurrection as a mandate to carry on regardless is there s no room for ambiguity If you want to remain revoke vote again or do anything but be swept inexorably over the waterfall then go Liberal Democrats Greens Change UK in England and SNP or Plaid Cymru in Scotland or Wales If tactical voting advice seems baffling then vote with your heart Reward the Lib Dems courage in resisting Brexit when nobody else was or the Greens for doing the same on the climate emergency or Change UK for at least trying to shake their old parties out of it whatever moves you 
MAY23	Without true friends or allies, Theresa May’s downfall was inevitable	All political careers end in failure Not all end in a punishment beating The apparently imminent departure of Theresa May as Tory leader has seen a brutality rare even for the British Conservative party  She was crowned with acclaim in and set the task of honouring the result of the Brexit referendum In the election she won almost as high a share of the popular vote as Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair ever did a fact converted into failure by Britain s first past the post electoral system 
MAY23	Young people have led the climate strikes. Now we need adults to join us too	Tomorrow schoolchildren and students will be out on the streets again in huge numbers in countries at over events demanding that governments immediately provide a safe pathway to stay within C of global heating We spent weeks and months preparing for this day We spent uncountable hours organising and mobilising when we could have just hung out with our friends or studied for school  We don t feel like we have a choice it s been years of talking countless negotiations empty deals on climate change and fossil fuel companies being given free rides to drill beneath our soils and burn away our futures for their profit Politicians have known about climate change for decades They have willingly handed over their responsibility for our future to profiteers whose search for quick cash threatens our very existence 
MAY23	Menopausal? Yes. But at 50 I’m hotter than I was in my 20s	I m new to being and I m waiting for it to happen to me the moment when I vanish without trace My st year started with the B list French celebrity Yann Moix making global headlines after saying that women over were invisible Fun fact he had to put out a request to stop fiftysomething women spamming him with pictures of their perky body parts in the aftermath Poor him  It turns out that he prefers the extraordinary body of a year old The thing is at I know I am objectively more attractive than I was in my s when I was unhappy insecure overweight and all round not conventionally hot I am more attractive than I was in my s raising young kids and juggling a big day job with splitting up with their dad or in my early to mid s perimenopause hitting hard and somewhat losing my shit or at least my way for a few years 
MAY23	It’s hard to imagine. But could this really be the end for the Tories?	Welcome to an extraordinarily bizarre election day Pause on the way to the polling station to wonder at the astounding mayhem within our ruling party soliciting votes even while wrenching its leader from Downing Street We may be so used to the Tory party in meltdown that we forget to be amazed at what is unfolding before our eyes on election day  Even allowing for all Andrea Leadsom s fantastical ambitious absurdities ponder how astonishing it is to see the leader of the house no less resigning on election eve just to steal a march on all her improbable leadership competitors Jeremy Hunt is marching in to see the prime minister in publicly threatening mode on election day Forget any sense of decorum towards their party or their country or the electoral process 
MAY23	The Victorians were no prudes, but women had to play by men’s rules	Much has been done to redress the popular vision of Queen Victoria as a dull censorious woman swathed in black ITV s Victoria drama series new documentaries and books suggest a less buttoned up life But the image prevails as does is the idea of Victorian society as prudish covering table legs in case they offended and refusing to countenance any reference to sex  However a new exhibition of Victoria and her husband Albert s gifts to each other including art with plenty of nudity offers a rejoinder The display marking the th anniversary of Victoria s birth is at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight which was the couple s sanctuary away from public gaze and they adorned it with quite a few nudes Florinda by the German painter Franz Xaver Winterhalter was hung in front of their writing desk Victoria described it as a group of beautiful women about to bathe 
MAY23	Manga belongs in the British Museum as much as the Elgin marbles	What is manga doing in the British Museum  It s a question the Guardian s reviewer asked about the new summer exhibition that opens today devoted to the comics medium which originated in Japan 
MAY23	No wonder Jamie’s went bust: Brits have lost their appetite for samey chains	In September Jamie Oliver received the kind of phone call that causes the bottom to fall out of your world if not in a moment of vertiginous panic the world to fall out of your bottom While filming for Channel s Friday Night Feast with the actor Liv Tyler he was told that his debt ridden Jamie s Italian chain was about to collapse I had two hours to put money in and save it or the whole thing would go to shit It was as dramatic as that Oliver told the Financial Times  This week the worst finally happened Despite a raft of closures and the loss of staff despite Oliver ploughing in m and a m loan from HSBC almost all of Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group which comprised Jamie s Italian venues and London s Fifteen and Barbecoa went into administration In October the group was reportedly paying off its final creditors as part of a voluntary arrangement meant to stave off this catastrophe In its company filings CEO Jon Knight was optimistic The quality of Jamie s Italian offer its food and healthy ethos sets it apart from the competition he reported 
MAY23	The suffering caused by austerity helped fuel Brexit – and will only get worse	Unless austerity ends the UK s poorest people face lives that are solitary poor nasty brutish and short That was the finding on Wednesday from Philip Alston the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty who warned worse could be yet to come for the most vulnerable who face a major adverse impact if Brexit proceeds  Days earlier down the line at BBC Live the Brexit party candidate Lucy Harris declared that the average leave voter wants Brexit at any cost Pressed further by presenter Nicky Campbell Harris admitted this could mean volunteering for years of economic downturn 
MAY23	Raqqa is in ruins like a modern Dresden. This is not 'precision bombing'	From Kosovo to Iraq and Syria the US and its military allies have for years told a tale of precision bombing and surgical strikes It was a lie then and it s a lie now When huge numbers of bombs and missiles are unleashed on densely populated cities like Mosul or Raqqa civilians are killed in their hundreds possibly thousands But still the myth of precision and meticulous processes persists Not least because militaries like our own refuse to even go back to the cities they ve bombed and refuse to acknowledge deaths unless presented with irrefutable evidence from the likes of Amnesty  Last week I did what UK US and French military officials refuse to do I went to Raqqa to see for myself what has happened to this city as a result of mass bombardments by the US led coalition between June and October 
MAY24	Now it’s a fight to the finish between a no-deal Brexit and remain	It s now all or nothing Theresa May has gone most likely taking with her the possibility of a negotiated exit from the European Union It means that the choice that will soon face the country is starker than before a no deal Brexit or no Brexit at all  In her parting address outside Downing Street May made a better case for compromise between those two positions than she ever had before Life depends on compromise she said quoting the Kindertransport rescuer and hero Nicholas Winton It sounded hollow coming from her given that her brittle personal style incapable of emollience and her inept grasp of political tactics had together made her a byword for inflexibility right until the moment which came often when she would cave entirely Her epitaph will be the inadvertent slogan of her calamitous election campaign Nothing has changed 
MAY24	Exit Theresa May. Stand by for a summer of Tory fratricide and country-shafting	Eyes down ye players of apocalypse bingo as we move beyond a European elections campaign where we learned that milkshakes are political violence and rape threats are satire Theresa May s premiership has literally ended in tears following an audaciously self parodic speech about compromise The Tories have signed on for several weeks of leadership contest a sort of summer camp for excluded adults where activities include aggravated fratricide country shafting and horrifying unforced errors in truth or dare  Like her cricketing hero Geoff Boycott and also Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now May has spent weeks refusing to be given out Multiple final gambits included a speech this week in which she served up her same withdrawal agreement for consideration yet again Unsurprisingly even her supporters declined this shit sandwich which they believe is distinguished by being the sort of shit sandwich where the bread is also made of shit 
MAY24	Theresa May saved her tears for herself. If only she’d shown this humanity before	She cried the wrong tears So shredded is Theresa May s credibility that as she started to crack to show some actual feelings during her resignation speech many people immediately said they were the wrong feelings If anything has changed during her time as prime minister it is the waning of empathy The millisecond in which one might feel for another person even if they are different from you is now just political weakness What a world The land of tears is a secret place as Antoine de Saint Exup ry said and May s tears may only have been for herself simple registers of the shattering of her delusion but there they were  Make no mistake she has been an absolutely dreadful prime minister impervious to reality deeply unsympathetic utterly tone deaf Missing any chance to actually compromise Anyone who has met her will tell you that she doesn t really do human I remember a miserable lunch with her years back and being mystified ever since that anyone ever thought that she could negotiate any kind of deal A walk in freezer has more warmth Interesting necklaces do not make a personality More importantly she doesn t do dialogue she simply repeats her lines and her mantras until people are so bored they possibly agree with her Or she pretended they did 
MAY24	Feel no pity for Theresa May. She has been the worst prime minister in modern times	Spare me the inevitable pity for Theresa May after her tearful farewell address this morning Oh wasn t she given such a terrible hand people might cry or is it her fault that her backbenchers are such a bunch of Neanderthal extremists and it s not her fault Brexit is such an undeliverable mess is it We must see through this May is the worst prime minister on their own terms since Lord North s reign in the late th century when the US colonies declared their independence  May did indeed inherit a terrible hand She then proceeded to douse it liberally with petrol and set it alight 
MAY24	Who should be the next Tory leader? Our panel responds	Choosing from this gallery of rogues fanatics and non entities is like playing the children s game would you rather be burned at the stake hanged drawn and quartered or squashed by a steamroller  In the weird world of the Tory leadership stakes Boris Johnson has almost certainly won the race already The victor will be essentially illegitimate our prime minister chosen by eccentric elderly and extreme Brexiteer Tory party members usurping the right of million electors The same rotten borough vote took Gordon Brown to No failing to fight for it did him no good 
MAY24	Yes, these EU elections weren’t good enough. This is why	The European parliament election that was never going to happen is now behind us and we await the results which will emerge from Sunday evening once polls have closed across all member states It is an anomaly for our politics to have to wait that long for the results but it is not the only thing that is unusual about this election They are delivered on a different regional structure only used in Great Britain for this purpose the voting and counting system used reflects this and there are different processes that have to be completed to ensure people are properly registered and able to vote  These are some of the reasons why we and the wider electoral community raised concerns with the government with rising urgency in the first months of this year While a general election follows a well trodden path and can be delivered relatively comfortably albeit not without considerable effort within eight weeks the same is not true of the European parliament elections The ongoing delays to confirming the poll continued to escalate the risks 
MAY24	Could Theresa May’s replacement force through a no-deal Brexit?	So Theresa May has reached the end of the road as prime minister A number of candidates who have thrown their hat in the ring have made it clear that they would rather leave the EU without a deal than the one negotiated by May  Brexit votes earlier this year have shown that there is a majority in the Commons opposed to a no deal Brexit but the procedural options open to them to avoid this outcome are severely limited unless the Speaker John Bercow decides on a more flexible interpretation of parliamentary convention which is possible 
MAY24	Moby's treatment of Natalie Portman is a masterclass in nice-guy misogyny	If someone had said the word Moby a week ago chances are the first thing you d have thought is Dick That probably hasn t changed but now you d likely be referring to the s musician rather than the th century whale Over the past few days Moby has been stress testing the adage that all publicity is good publicity by repeatedly insisting that he and Natalie Portman used to be an item even if she says they weren t  In his new memoir When It Fell Apart Moby claims that he dated Portman when he was and she was after they met backstage at one of his concerts A memoir is traditionally considered a work of non fiction however it would seem that the year old s book strays into fantasy Portman has denied the pair ever had a romantic relationship 
MAY24	The British Steel scandal is a corporate disaster entirely made in the UK	The collapse of British Steel Limited with the potential loss of at least jobs has once again exposed deep fault lines in the government s laissez faire economic ideology and in Britain s shareholder centric model of corporate governance  The government clings to its do nothing approach justifying its rejection of financial support a bailout or public ownership of British Steel because these options would be illegal under the EU state aid laws 
MAY24	Shocked by the rise of the right? Then you weren’t paying attention	The morning after both Donald Trump s victory and the Brexit referendum when a mood of paralysing shock and grief overcame progressives and liberals on both sides of the Atlantic the two most common refrains I heard were I don t recognise my country any more and I feel like I ve woken up in a different country This period of collective disorientation was promptly joined by oppositional activity if not activism People who had never marched before took to the streets those who had not donated before gave people who had not been paying attention became engaged Many continue  Almost three years later the Brexit party led by Nigel Farage is predicted to top the poll in European parliament elections in which the far right will make significant advances across the continent Theresa May s imminent downfall could hand the premiership to Boris Johnson Trump s re election in is a distinct possibility with Democratic strategists this week predicting only a narrow electoral college victory against him Democrats do not walk into the election with the same enthusiasm advantage they had in the election said Guy Cecil the chairman of Priorities USA the largest Democratic political action committee 
MAY25	The Tories have abandoned thought in favour of believing their own lies	 The Dog returns to his Vomit wrote Rudyard Kipling in as he denounced the delusions of liberals and socialists And the Sow returns to her Mire and the burnt Fool s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire  Only conservatives understood the eternal verities The Gods of the Copybook Headings as Kipling titled the most splenetic of Tory poems Only conservatives knew that progressive talk of the March of Mankind hid the truth that fallible humanity always ended with its fingers in the flames 
MAY25	You can keep your theme parks, I’m off to Ambridge	National mythology is hard for the British to package and sell And we appear to like it that way A perennial squeamishness about any effort to label our shared nature or inherent characteristics is almost a matter of pride in itself  From quaint Cath Kidston designs to the noisy Victorian jingoism of Last Night of the Proms the reaction is often suspicious It is a reflex partly born of a natural superiority complex but which surely also stems from the truth that Britain is actually four nations with varied cultural traditions and a pretty unpleasant imperial past Let the tourists buy the mugs and tea towels We don t want them 
MAY25	Judith Kerr was not scared to confront death in her stories. But she helped us savour the joy of life	If you ve got a life that so many people don t have said Judith Kerr then you don t waste it She was talking about the fact that her parents managed to escape from Germany before the Nazis took over That thought what a stroke of luck it is to be alive became her great theme  A few years ago when she must have been in her late s I watched her perform to a packed house in Edinburgh On stage in her pink dress she giggled away like she couldn t believe she was still alive as she fielded questions about the nature of that tiger 
MAY25	Richard Ashcroft’s sweet victory as Stones bow out graciously	Richard Ashcroft received an outstanding contribution to British music accolade at the Ivor Novello awards last week and took the opportunity to confirm that the rights to the Verve s Bitter Sweet Symphony had been transferred back to him after a year dispute with the Rolling Stones  Famously the soaring strings that propel the song are a sample of an orchestral version of the Stones The Last Time and the Verve had been granted permission to use part of it in return for of the track However the Stones late manager Allen Klein eventually sued claiming a larger portion than agreed had been used and royalties and joint songwriting credits were passed to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards 
MAY25	The energy behind Farage and his Brexit party leaves his rivals in the shadows	Last Sunday I went to a Brexit party rally in Frimley Surrey The venue was the Lakeside Hotel and Country Club complex well known as the setting for international darts contests Inside or so people had gathered to hear Nigel Farage and most of the party s other would be MEPs for the south east region The atmosphere was roughly as I had expected highly charged defiant often strangely celebratory But what was most striking was the slickness of the presentation brisk elegantly structured speeches and warm up videos and the clear sense that everyone had been told to lay off subjects that usually buzz around Farage immigration chiefly Instead they doubled down on the twin themes of Brexit being denied and delayed and what that says about the people and institutions in charge of the country  The first speaker was one Robert Rowland a candidate with the face haircut and stiff demeanour of a freshly bought Action Man If Brexit fails we cease even to be a democracy he said The duplicitous professional political class will have prevailed The last three years have seen Britain s establishment the civil servants the majority of MPs from both parties academia the judiciary and of course let s not forget the BBC at this point there were loud boos do their damnedest to delay diffuse and dilute Brexit Parliament has abolished the referendum and declared war on the British people There might not be tanks on the streets but make no mistake this is a coup against democracy 
MAY25	Judith Kerr’s life is something to celebrate in dark times	Are you sitting comfortably Then let us begin  Or rather let us press a button and leave the room One in four parents have now delegated bedtime story reading to a digital assistant like Alexa according to a depressing little survey published this week while two thirds admit letting their children have screen time instead For the genuinely burned out parent maybe it makes sense But I do wonder what Judith Kerr the much loved author of The Tiger Who Came to Tea the Mog series and other books no child should be without would have made of it 
MAY25	Like many women before her, Theresa May was set up to fail	You can have sympathy for the person even while you are reading out a lengthy charge sheet This is not a plea in mitigation for the departing prime minister Theresa May was handed a difficult task and she botched it By her own admission she failed But then there is no such thing as a good Brexit and no one can achieve one  In a pattern familiar from senior appointments made in business and elsewhere the step up to the top job proved a stretch too far The qualities which seemed to have served May pretty well in her career to that point proved a weakness and a vulnerability in the highest office Sadly she or her advisers believed her own hype May appeared to relish being labelled a bloody difficult woman and saw obstinacy as a virtue fatal at a time when flexibility and imagination were required 
MAY25	How can we say we love our pets when we treat them so badly?	Every year more countries ban wild animals from being used in circuses The fact that elephants camels and zebras were kept in chains and driven around countries to perform tricks for the delight of roaring audiences already seems anachronistic People wonder how past generations could have been so blind to the obvious cruelty and exploitation involved Might humans one day feel the same about pets Could it one day seem as cruel that people locked dogs up in houses kept fish in tiny bowls or forced birds to live their whole lives in small cages  The morality of pet ownership is in the news after it was revealed that the dying wishes of a dog owner in the US were to have her perfectly healthy pet put down and cremated to be buried alongside her Despite the efforts of animal shelter workers to save the shih tzu mix called Emma she was killed and cremated Her ashes were handed to the representative of the dead woman s estate for burial The woman probably thought she loved Emma but to most people her demand will seem barbaric and selfish It s easy to point the finger in this case but selfishness among pet owners is commonplace 
MAY25	Now it’s a fight to the finish between a no-deal Brexit and remain	It s now all or nothing Theresa May has gone most likely taking with her the possibility of a negotiated exit from the European Union It means that the choice that will soon face the country is starker than before a no deal Brexit or no Brexit at all  In her parting address outside Downing Street May made a better case for compromise between those two positions than she ever had before Life depends on compromise she said quoting the Kindertransport rescuer and hero Nicholas Winton It sounded hollow coming from her given that her brittle personal style incapable of emollience and her inept grasp of political tactics had together made her a byword for inflexibility right until the moment which came often when she would cave entirely Her epitaph will be the inadvertent slogan of her calamitous election campaign Nothing has changed 
MAY25	Exit Theresa May. Stand by for a summer of Tory fratricide and country-shafting	Eyes down ye players of apocalypse bingo as we move beyond a European elections campaign where we learned that milkshakes are political violence and rape threats are satire Theresa May s premiership has literally ended in tears following an audaciously self parodic speech about compromise The Tories have signed on for several weeks of leadership contest a sort of summer camp for excluded adults where activities include aggravated fratricide country shafting and horrifying unforced errors in truth or dare  Like her cricketing hero Geoff Boycott and also Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now May has spent weeks refusing to be given out Multiple final gambits included a speech this week in which she served up her same withdrawal agreement for consideration yet again Unsurprisingly even her supporters declined this shit sandwich which they believe is distinguished by being the sort of shit sandwich where the bread is also made of shit 
MAY26	The winner of this Tory leadership race will be the spirit of Thatcherism	Along with making tortured comparisons with Game of Thrones the laziest thing to say about the Tory leadership contest is that it is going to be all about Brexit That much is obvious given Theresa May s abject failure on Europe The bewildering number of candidates will of course have to spend the next few weeks explaining how they ll make a success of Brexit in her place   A purity contest is well under way as candidates try to demonstrate they are the most Brexity of them all If you voted for May s Brexit deal or failed to resign after the Chequers agreement then you ve got a lot of explaining to do 
MAY26	Life on Mars? Sorry Brian Cox, that’s still science fiction	Who said this I ve been having to say everywhere I go that there is no planet B there is no escape hatch there is no second Earth this is the only planet we have If you re a science fiction fan the answer might surprise you it was the writer Kim Stanley Robinson whose Mars trilogy is an ultimately utopian series of tales that describe the terraforming of Mars planetary engineering to give it an Earth like environment over the course of several centuries after the Earth perishes from overpopulation and ecosystem collapse  Robinson s pessimism about planetary settlement seems out of step with the spirit of the times Unveiling his Blue Moon project two weeks ago a robotic lunar lander to deliver the infrastructure for a crewed moon base Amazon s chief executive Jeff Bezos portrayed it as the bold first step towards human colonisation of the solar system 
MAY26	Want to save the UK steel industry? Brexit isn’t the answer	The difficulties facing British Steel have quickly become part of the Brexit debate with commentators variously pointing to our membership of the EU or our decision to leave as an underlying cause Business is naturally cautious about entering into political debates but it should not remain silent when it features so prominently in the public discourse Industry has a responsibility to ensure its views are accurately represented and to establish the facts as they relate to our sector  There can be no doubt that the ongoing Brexit uncertainty has contributed significantly to British Steel s problems Unable to decipher what the UK EU trading relationship will be in just five months time planning has become fiendishly complicated for both UK exporters and their EU customers The timing is particularly bad with the EU having recently imposed safeguard measures to prevent a surge in steel imports resulting from protectionist action elsewhere Post Brexit UK steel exports to Europe will be restricted by these measures with a disorderly no deal Brexit affecting them particularly badly 
MAY26	My aunt has died – and with her goes a treasure trove of family memories	The loss of an aunt isn t one of the big deaths I told myself that last week My cousin had emailed with news that her mother my aunt had died unexpectedly in the week She was my mother s younger sister and lived far away in suburban Johannesburg I hadn t spoken to her since November when I d called on my birthday Nothing structural in my life had changed  And yet it seemed like the most outrageous repositioning of the universe 
MAY26	The lack of coverage of the Ballymurphy inquest is a scandal	It is highly doubtful if many people living in England Scotland and Wales know about the startling and disturbing testimony delivered at Belfast s high court two weeks ago  For the inquest into the deaths of people shot by British paratroopers in later known as the Ballymurphy massacre has been under reported by London based mainstream media since it began more than five months ago 
MAY26	What makes the Tories think that anyone must be better than Mrs May?	I don t know about you but I am surprised that Chris Grayling has not yet announced that he is a candidate for the Tory leadership You might object that his cabinet career has been distinguished by the opposite of success but the lack of any demonstrable qualification to be prime minister isn t holding back many others Even his most adoring admirers wouldn t claim that Boris Johnson added lustre to his own reputation or Britain s global standing during his embarrassment encrusted interlude as foreign secretary but the contest begins with him as the pollsters and bookies favourite  More than a dozen other Tories think they have what it takes to lead the country during one of the most dangerous periods for Britain and their party since The quantity of the candidates is not an indication of the quality of the leadership pool It is a symptom of rampant factionalism and unrestrained narcissism 
MAY26	US efforts to jail Assange for espionage are a grave threat to a free media	Do you remember the Collateral Murder video the one that showed US air crew in Apache helicopters killing people as though playing computer games laughing at the dead after slaughtering a dozen people including two Iraqis working for the Reuters news agency Do you remember how the US military had lied about what happened in that incident in July first claiming that all the dead were insurgents and then that the helicopters were responding to an active firefight Neither claim was true Do you recall that Reuters had spent three years unsuccessfully trying to obtain the video  Was it in the public interest that the world should have eventually seen the raw footage of what happened You bet Was it acutely embarrassing for the US military and government Of course Was the act of revelation espionage or journalism You know the answer 
MAY26	How warmly can Charles greet Donald Trump, the man who leered at both Kate and Diana?	The latest on Donald Trump s state visit now reportedly reinvented as one of those new G multigenerational vacations and featuring an all inclusive togethering trip to the world s oldest theme park mentions presidential hopes for a meeting between his daughter Ivanka the former model and William and Kate  As nightmarish as it sounds Ivanka s outreach could be the Trumpian idea of diplomacy not least because Ivanka recently returned from Africa now has her own adventures in white saviourship to share Any protracted Donald Kate encounter has looked unlikely since when he commented on illicitly taken photographs of the duchess sunbathing topless The royal couple who later won in damages said The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana Princess of Wales 
MAY26	The Tories have abandoned thought in favour of believing their own lies	 The Dog returns to his Vomit wrote Rudyard Kipling in as he denounced the delusions of liberals and socialists And the Sow returns to her Mire and the burnt Fool s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire  Only conservatives understood the eternal verities The Gods of the Copybook Headings as Kipling titled the most splenetic of Tory poems Only conservatives knew that progressive talk of the March of Mankind hid the truth that fallible humanity always ended with its fingers in the flames 
MAY26	Mix private equity, Brexit mania, state incompetence and what do you get? Scunthorpe	Across the Midlands and north of England and in pockets of the south there are once proud single industry towns laid low with no determined effort to make good what once was It could be Chatham and Rochester in Kent or Birkenhead Wigan or Mansfield further north  They survive as economies in which the main business is providing the foundational goods and services necessary to get by supermarkets petrol stations hospitals care homes But there are few thriving private sector companies in st century industries a paucity of opportunity and wages are below the national average 
MAY27	A second referendum is a bad option for Labour. But it may be the only one left	To be a Brexit pragmatist has become an increasingly dispiriting and lonely experience The middle ground on Brexit has been systematically torched from both ends To desire a compromise was in the aftermath of the referendum a position shared by a large majority During the horrorshow that was the referendum campaign the likes of Nigel Farage hyped up Norway which is a member of the single market as a shining example of how Britain could thrive outside the EU Two years ago polling suggested that a very narrow majority of remain voters believed that now the British people have voted to leave the government has a duty to carry out their wishes and leave There is a historical revisionism fashionable among some which claims that Labour s surge was down to remainers lending their votes rather than the party s radical prospectus but as polling found after the election just of Labour voters named Brexit as the most important issue behind their vote  In large part because of the Tories calamitous handling of Brexit both leavers and remainers have polarised No deal which was never offered as a serious proposition in the referendum campaign is increasingly held to be the only true Brexit by leave voters Stop Brexit or bust has become the default position among growing numbers of remain voters A soft Brexit is no longer regarded as real Brexit by most leave voters but is regarded as full blown Brexit by most remain voters 
MAY27	Nigel Farage’s victory gives him the whip hand over British politics	By any yardstick the European election results were remarkable for the Brexit party Launched just six weeks ago it secured of the vote Taking to the stage having just been re elected at the South East England count Nigel Farage proclaimed that if Britain did not leave on October then his new party would face down the Conservatives and Labour at the next general election  Those who point out that the parties committed to a no deal Brexit only achieved around a third of the vote and were outvoted by unambiguously pro remain parties are missing the point Farage s project has always been to reshape the right of politics His has never been a majoritarian project but it never had to be Ten years after taking over as Ukip leader in Farage had successfully manoeuvred the European Union to the centre of British politics leading to the vote to leave 
MAY27	How were the EU elections for Italy, France and Germany? Our panel responds	These elections reinforced Italy s reputation as the big testing ground for nationalism and populism in Europe The outright winner was Matteo Salvini s League less a political party than a vast coalition of different sections of the electorate from businesspeople who want to cut taxes to voters hostile to migrants to fierce opponents of gay marriage This coalition is held together by the identity politics of white Catholic ethnic nationalism One sign of that was the crucifix Salvini clutched as his victory was declared The elections produced a League Five Star governing coalition combining the anti establishment politics of Beppe Grillo s followers and the League s hostility to migrants After this election we know that nationalism is this coalition s driving force And now Salvini is set to pursue his party s alliance with Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage in the European parliament to change Europe from the inside  The poll also demonstrated the sheer volatility of voters The huge rise in votes for the League and the unexpected overtaking of the Five Star movement by the centre left Democratic party all confirmed that in Italy political affiliations are highly fluid 
MAY27	So begins the mad scramble to take control of the Brexit narrative	The European elections unfolded according to predictions the Brexit party won big Labour and the Conservatives both got a kicking the Lib Dems and the Greens swept up But predictability aside these elections were bizarre they were never meant to have happened and as such were conducted on the hoof The most passionate voices on one side at least were fighting for seats that they intended to occupy for only the shortest possible amount of time But the really distinctive thing was that no party said anything  The Conservative campaign launched to a near empty room with nothing to deliver but an abject apology The Labour campaign described in a withering email sent to supporters before the results by their MEP John Howarth was implausible rot defined by a single minded determination to fight a European election without mentioning Europe The party s leadership took a ballot that was animated entirely by Brexit and preached a pious and incredible creed of forgetting our Brexit divisions and uniting in Labour ishness That much was predictable from the moment the elections became a certainty 
MAY27	The winner of this Tory leadership race will be the spirit of Thatcherism	Along with making tortured comparisons with Game of Thrones the laziest thing to say about the Tory leadership contest is that it is going to be all about Brexit That much is obvious given Theresa May s abject failure on Europe The bewildering number of candidates will of course have to spend the next few weeks explaining how they ll make a success of Brexit in her place   A purity contest is well under way as candidates try to demonstrate they are the most Brexity of them all If you voted for May s Brexit deal or failed to resign after the Chequers agreement then you ve got a lot of explaining to do 
MAY27	Wanted: a modern Thomas Cromwell to mend Brexit Britain	 But his greatest ambition for England is this the prince and his commonwealth should be in accord a household where everybody knows what they have to do and feels safe doing it The hopes of Thomas Cromwell as imagined by novelist Hilary Mantel in Bring Up the Bodies the second in her Tudor trilogy were high even then now they seem laughably improbable For who in the present emergency knows what they have to do Not our elected leaders nor us it seems when it came to these European elections rarely has a poll provoked as much bewildered debate about how best to ensure accurate representation of one s political wishes  Where is the man or woman who can discreetly manoeuvre the politicians 
MAY27	I regret not learning my mum’s first language. Britain needs those ties	When I was a child we had a ritual at the end of every meal Tack f r maten we would each intone as we licked our cutlery and placed it on our plates Vars god my mother would say as she slammed down the fruit bowl My mother hated cooking so she couldn t actually claim that it had been a pleasure or that we were very welcome as the phrase implies The important thing was that we had thanked her for the food as instructed and in the language instructed Her children might be irritating but at least they were reasonably polite  I thought of this after watching the usual doom unfold on the nightly news last Wednesday when a clip popped up of toddlers not politicians actual toddlers listening to nursery rhymes as they wriggled in their parents laps As they listened their parents were singing along in Yoruba Children born to Nigerians in this country and who had only ever spoken English were happily singing in Yoruba As I watched I felt like joining in 
MAY27	For the sake of our health, we need to kick the indoor habit	As a species we need to get out more Humans now spend so much time indoors that many of us are cultivating a variety of serious health complaints and for some they could be fatal It is not so much that outdoor time is inherently good more that our bodies are built to anticipate it and the way we live now is confusing to our systems Nearly two decades ago a study published in Nature magazine concluded that the average American spent of their time indoors And that was before tablets and smartphones  In trying to cope with the shaded sedentary world we have made our bodies wage war on what should be harmless antigens they fail to make bones strong enough to support our weight even our eyes struggle to focus without the help of lenses This incremental creep across the threshold to the great indoors began tens of thousands of years ago when the first settled communities emerged 
MAY27	Labour members should vote now on our support for a second Brexit referendum	Labour s problem in the EU election was simple but fundamental It had overwhelmingly remain members but a Brexit message It was a remain party whose leader played both sides so unconvincingly that as Lloyd George said of Sir John Simon the architect of appeasement He has sat on the fence so long the iron has entered his soul  For the sake of the country and the party we now have to be clear about our opposition to Brexit For me personally the election was excruciating Resistance to Brexit is the logic of everything Labour stands for Yet instead of an unambiguous statement of support for a referendum with an option to stay in the EU we fought on a formula akin to the design manual for a submarine and one never intended to come to the surface Labour party members as well as supporters were angry and bemused 
MAY27	Ken Loach has competition: meet the new heroes of socially conscious cinema	 This year s Cannes film festival staged a clash that might have passed viewers by namely a fight between good old fashioned social realism and a new politically conscious cinema one also concerned with probing sociopolitical injustice but in a looser more refracted way 
MAY28	Labour voters want to come home, but the party must prove it will resist Brexit	Nothing has changed to coin a phrase  Once again Labour has lost an election and once again we ve spent the weekend trapped in the same old Groundhog Day routine Jeremy Corbyn trots out the same Brexit line but with more emphasis on a second referendum and less on all the caveats to make it look as if something radical has changed simultaneously others talk down the idea that it has 
MAY28	Tory leadership contender Rory Stewart makes me cringe, but at least he listens	On bank holiday Monday Conservative MP Rory Stewart left his constituency of Penrith and The Border and went walkabout Calling on voters to approach him for a chat or a challenge he then posted short videos and pictures with captions on social media In one video he is chatting in rusty Dari to a Barking resident originally from Kabul in another photo he is sitting in Costa Coffee on his laptop inviting people to come find him like a Tinder hopeful still in denial that their date has not turned up It was a sight both novel and cringemaking as he seemed unable to find the right register or physical mien  Stewart is a Tory MP straight out of central casting Eton PPE at Oxford the Foreign Office OBE FRSL FRSGS ETC
MAY28	As a newly elected Green MEP and a refugee, I’ve got a message for the far right	I am honoured to have been elected as a Green party MEP I can t wait to get to work on behalf of all those who put their faith in me and in our movement s vision of hope We are truly building a common world rooted in the aspirations of the young and set to deliver lasting change for all  Millions of citizens from Sheffield to Stuttgart have grown weary of the same old politics of tribal allegiances
MAY28	Are ‘weed tampons’ the answer to period pain?	I have spent the past minutes sprawled in an undignified position on the floor experimenting with cannabis suppositories This isn t a typical Monday night for me I ll have you know I am doing it in the name of science Specifically I am doing it to see whether weed tampons can get rid of period pain  There is a distinct possibility that I just lost of my male readers The squeamishness surrounding menstruation is part of the reason that little effort has been made to find effective treatments for premenstrual syndrome PMS and period pain Want to hear some rage inducing stats There have been five times as many studies into erectile dysfunction as there have been into PMS That is despite the fact that of women have experienced PMS while only of men have been affected by ED Period pain can be debilitating but women are still expected to suffer through it with just ibuprofen or a hot water bottle 
MAY28	Tommy Robinson was humiliated in the EU elections. Here’s how we helped do it	One of the highlights of Sunday night was a clearly stunned Tommy Robinson real name Stephen Yaxley Lennon fleeing the count in Manchester after realising that his hope of becoming an MEP was shattered He polled just taking only votes in the north west and lost his deposit  When he first announced his candidacy it seemed inconceivable that the man who had founded the English Defence League could become an MEP Yet we also knew that he was the best known far right activist since the second world war and better known than most of our politicians 
MAY28	A great EU election result for the Lib Dems. Now the hard work starts	Way back in I went to the launch in Oxford Town Hall of my friend Martin Stott s book Spilling the Beans subtitled A style guide to the new age where he coined the phrase the Muesli Belt He meant the places where ex hippies and other inner directed types were downshifting to  A few years later in the Green party leapt to third place in the European elections with of the vote its best ever national election result 
MAY28	Farage’s victory means the Tories will be led by a Brexiteer, not a compromiser	The Conservatives didn t drop to a vote share in the European election without losing a chunk of voters to remain parties there was a major swing to the Lib Dems but they will hear only one message they are under threat from Nigel Farage  That message is probably correct The Brexit party which Farage formed only four months ago has just won a national election and it has done it on Tory territory The Conservatives are also a Brexit party but one at a considerable disadvantage they are the dopes tasked with delivering the thing As such they have been entirely unable to capture its spirit which is something naturally allergic to the practicalities of leaving Europe purist anti institution and scornful of compromise All this was rammed home to Tory MPs by the results with the added reminder that the leave remain split is not going away any time soon 
MAY28	The far right didn’t sweep the EU elections. Europe’s centre is holding	It turns out that the widespread predictions of a far right takeover of the European parliament were as Mark Twain famously said about reports of his death greatly exaggerated Citizens across Europe flocked to the ballot box in numbers unseen since the s The young in particular turned out And they did not deliver a rightwing populist surge  A political shift is undoubtedly under way and rightwing populism is still very much around But the real story was the evidence of a new pluralism emerging in EU politics including a Green and liberal surge None of this imperils the EU s survival quite the contrary Nor will it lead to a paralysis of its institutions although coalition building will be trickier than before Given the doomsday scenarios doing the rounds this is good news 
MAY28	Reality TV and Victorian freak shows have an uncomfortable amount in common	Following the suicide of year old Stephen Dymond a week after appearing on The Jeremy Kyle Show reality TV has come under attack ITV has been condemned The Jeremy Kyle Show has been cancelled and the digital culture media and sports committee has launched an investigation into production companies duty of care to participants on their shows  Yet popular culture has always thrived on the exposure of troubled and vulnerable individuals Back in the so called Greatest Showman PT Barnum found fame by displaying an elderly and paralysed slave named Joice Heth She was probably suffering from dementia She was billed as the year old nurse of George Washington and lugged across the US as punters poked and prodded her ailing body which Barnum exhibited in taverns and pleasure gardens He once claimed to have starved her and forcibly removed her teeth to make her appear more credible When she died aged about her body was publicly dissected in front of a paying crowd and Barnum was on his way to stardom 
MAY28	Access to menstrual health and hygiene is a right. Period.	That time of the month shark week Aunt Flow on your rags the flowers period  There are more than different terms that we use globally to describe menstruation other than the word itself We have so many code words and euphemisms because in sadly many of us are still uncomfortable talking openly about periods Don t you think it s time we got over it 
MAY29	Forget Boris Johnson. The Tory leader could come from the centre	Something important and wholly without precedent is happening in plain sight in British politics but not enough attention is being paid to it The something is that never before has a new British prime minister been chosen by the grassroots members of the ruling political party Such a thing might have happened in when Tony Blair resigned but Gordon Brown was chosen unopposed It nearly happened in after David Cameron stepped down but in the end the other candidates stood aside in favour of Theresa May  Now it s the third time it could happen and this one is almost certain to be different There are already candidates in the field to succeed May Five more are said to be weighing whether to join Many will fall at the first and subsequent hurdles in June when Tory MPs begin a series of elimination votes in Westminster But it would be a surprise if this contest does not go all the way to a two person runoff among the party members in July If it does that will be a historic first a national leader chosen by a party membership not by parliamentarians or the wider public 
MAY29	Women, being married needn’t make you unhappy – if you choose the right man	Tchuh women Never bloody happy are they Except it turns out they are just not in the way they were told to be and thought they should be According to a new book by Paul Dolan a professor of behavioural science at the London School of Economics marriage and children do not despite several millennia of literature claiming otherwise give women the sought after happy ending In fact they put them at higher risk of physical and mental conditions than their single counterparts Dolan does not specify whether those mental conditions include insanity from watching the same Peppa Pig episode times  Now I m going to take some things for granted the first of which is that Dolan is referring to heterosexual married couples as is implied by how he has discussed his findings so far The second is that the people Dolan interviewed are answering honestly or at least do so eventually By some measure my favourite part of these findings is that while married people express greater happiness than other groups they do so only when their spouse is in the room When the spouse is not present fucking miserable Dolan said at the Hay festival last weekend And yet while married men reap some benefits from their misery longer life better earnings married women can only look forward to dying sooner than their single happier counterparts 
MAY29	How a radical new form of anti-racism can save Labour	An announcement by the Equality and Human Rights Commission EHRC that it is launching a formal investigation into antisemitism in the Labour party is one more sign that the controversy cannot be addressed by internal procedures alone Was it ever solvable through the party s own efforts There was a time when I thought it might be  Even before Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader of the Labour party in September there was deep disquiet in sections of the British Jewish community about what was perceived as his tolerance for Islamist terrorist groups Following his election repeated instances of antisemitic comments in the burgeoning Corbynite grassroots further stoked alarm The attempted coup against Corbyn s leadership in June deepened the problem with non Corbynite Jewish party members and those within the Jewish Labour Movement in particular becoming the focus of anger from some who supported Corbyn s transformation of the party 
MAY29	Instead of kicking out Alastair Campbell, Labour should listen to him	As a dead cat Alastair Campbell has proved most effective You ll recall the advice of the rightwing election guru Lynton Crosby who recommended that a politician about to face a scandal or crushing revelation throw a dead cat on the table onlookers might be appalled even disgusted but at least you d have changed the subject  On Tuesday confirmation came that the Equality and Human Rights Commission is to investigate the Labour party over anti Jewish racism That is a very big deal Only one political party has come under EHRC scrutiny before and that was the BNP It should be a day of shame that an organisation that likes to boast that combating prejudice is in its DNA is now under investigation for that very offence And make no mistake the EHRC does not make such a move lightly It only rarely undertakes a full scale investigation the last comparable inquiry was into the Metropolitan police several years ago Human rights lawyers who work closely with the EHRC say the commission would not launch a full investigation into Labour unless they had seen evidence of institutional racism that was credible and serious 
MAY29	The BBC ripped off my Slay in Your Lane slogan – now I’m being attacked	In my best friend Elizabeth Uviebinen sent me a picture of Solange Knowles at Paris fashion week basking in the pre release glow of a seminal album and coming into her own after years under the moniker Beyonc s little sister She captioned it Slay in Your Lane I rang Elizabeth to say it would be the name of the book we were going to write a guide to life aimed at black British women featuring advice from trailblazing interviewees  We hadn t come across the phrase elsewhere and thought it was clever so in we trademarked it The BBC thought it was clever too last week our readers began to notify us of billboards they had seen emblazoned with the slogan Most who contacted us assumed since it used a bold font like the one on the cover of our book and was fronted by Dina Asher Smith a successful black British sprinter that there was some affiliation or that we were at least aware of the BBC s use of the slogan for its campaign We weren t and immediately made contact with the BBC We received no response for four days 
MAY29	Corbyn could come out fighting with a rebellious remain and reform agenda	Against the backdrop of the Tories historic European elections clusterflop Labour s results were merely bad The natural party of government saw its vote share eroded by the Brexit party so badly that it was forced to endure its worst performance at a national election since Tory leadership hopefuls looking to placate the infuriated Conservative grassroots are already butching up talk of a no deal Brexit an outcome that parliament simply will not tolerate  The Tory party would split if it pursued a soft Brexit deal with Labour votes it would split if a new leader ran on taking Britain out of the EU to trade on World Trade Organization rules Brexit represents a fundamental crisis for the governing party It s important to make this distinction not to excuse the poor showing of Jeremy Corbyn s party but to emphasise that Labour unlike the Conservatives has a way out of its Brexit bind 
MAY29	Most of us feel sleepy in the afternoon. Why can’t work fit round that?	In the early afternoon I often catch myself listlessly staring into the computer screen I have things to do but I can t concentrate I try writing the same sentence five times and delete it six During one of these afternoon torpors I came upon a word acedia It seemed to perfectly define my mid afternoon weariness I discovered this originally Greek word was widely used by medieval Christian monks to describe a sense of indolence a mood of lethargy a feeling of being completely unconcerned about their duties and purpose in the world Christian mystics who lived in the Egyptian deserts during the rd century AD often complained about being haunted by the noon day demon  One monk of the time described how the noon day demon would make the sun appear sluggish and immobile and cause monks to continually look at the window and forces him to gaze at the sun This cruel demon sends him hatred against the place against life itself and against the work of his hands and makes him think he has lost the love among his brethren and there is none to comfort him 
MAY29	Labour shouldn’t be the party of leave or remain, but a force to unite the country	While hot takes on the European election results come in all flavours there should be at least two things we all agree on First it was a bad night for Labour and second that the country is as bitterly divided as ever  As the Labour party wrestles with whether or not it backs a public vote the clock ticks down to Halloween and our latest exit date With a surging Brexit party and a Conservative leadership contest under way the prospects for a more extreme version of departure grow by the day As Conservative candidates seek to win back voters from the anti EU populists ruling out no deal is for most no longer an option 
MAY29	Look at the queue to be Tory leader. No-deal Brexit is more likely than ever	When it comes to Brexit all I can think about now are the lyrics to The Windmills of Your Mind Like a circle in a spiral Like a wheel within a wheel Never ending or beginning  The forthcoming Tory leadership contest is just the latest spiral Every candidate whether Kit Malthouse or Boris Johnson will be outlining their cunning Baldrick like plans to force the European Union to renegotiate the UK s withdrawal on October In practical terms that will be nigh on impossible in view of both the UK parliament s timetable and the new European commission not being in place until November What is also being ignored is that the article agreement that Theresa May signed up to with the October extension clearly states in clause This extension excludes any re opening of the withdrawal agreement 
MAY29	A tax on red meat? That won’t save the planet – or do much to improve our health	The devil is a shape shifter not least when he takes the form of demonic foods In response the armies of the righteous have already waged war on sugar and now red meat is in their sights This time their cause seems doubly just Red meat we are told is not only bad for our health but the belching and farting ruminants that we farm are ruinous for the planet  Emboldened by the apparent success of the sugary drinks tax the weapon of choice to slay this monster is a similar levy on meat Oxford University s professor of population health Mike Rayner has even done the maths and concludes that we need to tax red meat by and processed meat by at least to offset their costs to human health 
MAY30	Mueller stopped short of calling Trump a criminal, but did we need him to?	Did Donald Trump repeatedly break the law by trying to block multiple investigations into his mysteriously intimate relationship with Russia  The answer is rather similar to questions about the pope s Catholicism and the propensity of bears to poop in the woods 
MAY30	John Cleese isn’t alone in equating ‘English’ with white. Sadly, that view is mainstream	 Some years ago I opined that London was not really an English city any more is how John Cleese began a tweet on Wednesday Since then virtually all my friends from abroad have confirmed my observation When eight long years ago he made a similar claim he gave us the unabridged version I m not sure what s going on in Britain he said while appearing on an Australian TV programme Let me say this I don t know what s going on in London because London is no longer an English city and that s how they got the Olympics They said We re the most cosmopolitan city on Earth but it doesn t feel English  He bemoans immigrants in London but because of race and class he s called an expat in the Caribbean
MAY30	My friend Walter Wolfgang’s life was a portrait in moral courage	Donald Trump flies into the UK next week and we will be treated to the surreal spectacle of a widely reviled president meeting a defeated prime minister amid scenes of pomp ceremony and protest  For all the high level meetings he will attend the president would gain far more by staying home and learning about the life of my friend Walter Wolfgang who died this week at the age of A lifelong peace activist he was preoccupied in his final days by Trump and his growing belligerence towards Iran 
MAY30	Young climate strikers could achieve even more by joining a union	Union membership in recent decades has been in stark decline The picture has been particularly bleak over the past years when it comes to young people  Fewer than one in workers under the age of are now in a union according to figures from the Office for National Statistics released on Thursday The proportion of unionised to year old workers has halved since from to with a similar pattern among to year olds 
MAY30	There’s a new battle for Britain: resistance to Nigel Farage	All political parties were too self absorbed to see it coming but Nigel Farage s European election vote created a new dividing line in British politics taking us well beyond the leave remain split that has defined Britain since the referendum and threatens to dominate its politics for the foreseeable future  In the three years since when we should have been debating the bigger issue that the referendum raised what kind of Britain we want to become our rulers have been obsessed with one very narrow question not even our future relationship with Europe but merely the terms of our departure from it 
MAY30	I know antidepressant withdrawal symptoms are real. Why didn’t doctors?	It s something of a relief to see before you written down in black and white what you have known to be true for a long time in this case that antidepressant withdrawal symptoms aren t well all in your head In a significant shift in position the Royal College of Psychiatrists now accepts that it has not paid enough attention to patients suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms when coming off antidepressants  Patients are to be warned by doctors when they are prescribed the drugs just how hard it can be to come off them Some will have been on them for years They will have tried to wean themselves off and been so alarmed by withdrawal symptoms mistaking them for a return of symptoms of their mental health condition that they have given up the struggle They will now be advised to use a gradual tapering off process 
MAY30	John Bercow staying on as Speaker makes a no-deal Brexit less likely	The Tories don t agree on much these days Some even want a general election now as a way to deliver what they view as a true Brexit However they can all get behind some good old fashioned John Bercow bashing Ministers report that the only good cabinet meetings these days are those where they can go around slagging off the House of Commons Speaker over his latest aggravating decision on Brexit  So Bercow s announcement that he has no plans to step down this summer or in the foreseeable will be generally ill received in the Tory party When it comes to the challenges any Conservative leader faces delivering Brexit the Speaker ranks in the top three alongside a hung parliament and Brussels reluctance to renegotiate 
MAY30	Mueller’s inaction over Trump has let the US down. Why is he holding back?	Robert Mueller has a reputation as a straight shooting play it by the book sort of guy That changed this week The special counsel s stated justifications for not accusing Donald Trump of obstruction of justice appear convoluted and legally dubious Mueller was a man hired to solve a mystery His odd decision to take refuge in questionable precedents and thereby effectively duck the issue has only compounded it  His two year investigation was admirable in many ways Unlike similar exercises in the past such as Kenneth Starr s s inquiry into Bill Clinton he kept his counsel did not leak to the media and completed the business within a reasonable timeframe His finding that there were multiple systematic Russian efforts to interfere in the presidential election is clear and unambiguous 
MAY30	Labour needs a reboot – and it could start with bringing back Ed Miliband	Labour needs a drastic reboot The Tories may be in existential crisis desperately flapping around in a rising tide of rightwing populism but Labour s hopes of securing the sizeable majority it needs to enact a transformative agenda are uncertain The Brexit mire has robbed the Corbyn project of its core identity a sense of insurgency stripped away its optimistic idealistic gloss and suppressed the enthusiasm of Labour s members and the voters most inspired by its manifesto Its desperate indeed honourable desire for a Brexit compromise in a painfully fractured nation to be the party that skilfully transcended the divisions bequeathed by a referendum result three years ago was remorselessly kicked to death in polling stations last week If the party s position was intended to be a Rorschach inkblot in which remainers or leavers could see what they wanted to see in the end all either saw was a splattered mess  It s clear that Labour is now pivoting to a pro referendum stance in backing a public vote on any deal parliament agrees Corbyn privately knows it must be done While there is some internal resistance within both his machine and the parliamentary party and it s easy to empathise with those who fear another referendum the shadow chancellor John McDonnell is among those pushing for a decisive shift in political strategy That will surely succeed the game is up here even if there remains no majority in parliament for a referendum but a political reorientation must be spelt out in primary colours or the party might as well not bother The mixed messages from leading figures must cease When Corbyn eventually makes his big speech committing Labour to a new stance it should be done with gusto and it should be unequivocal It should mourn the passing of the party s heartfelt attempt to bridge a divide made impossible by the Tories calamitous mishandling of the process it should be clear that left with a choice of no deal or another referendum no alternative remains and it should directly appeal to those leavers who have suffered most from Britain s broken social order with a bold compelling economic vision 
MAY30	Robert Mueller made clear: he couldn't have indicted Trump even if he wanted to	For those who hoped that Robert Mueller s first public comments since his report was released would do what it failed to free us from a demagogue who has taken American democracy hostage Wednesday must have come as a disappointment If Mueller s parting words as special counsel had a familiar ring it is because they echoed often verbatim statements that appear in his lengthy report  And yet in his characteristically restrained manner Mueller did I believe seek to set the record straight on his report s most contested conclusion 
MAY31	Opium-pipers, bluffers and no-dealers impress in this Tory battle of nonentities	The official tagline for the Tory leadership contest is EXPERIENCE MAGIC THIS SUMMER Its key value divide is between candidates who would smoke opium at an Iranian wedding and candidates who would order a drone strike on one We haven t even begun to hear from frontrunner Boris Johnson that flytipped sofa who will probably be endorsed next week by visiting indignitary Donald Trump  Still plenty to be getting on with Esther McVey would order you a drone strike no problem The only issue is whether she d be able to get all the gays in one place This week Esther waded into the grimly regressive row about LGBT teaching suggesting that parents should have the right to deny their children educational access to reality I m paraphrasing As she put it I believe parents know best for their children Yes babe That s why measles is back That s why you personally defend the refusal to pay a mother benefits for her third child unless she can prove she was raped 
MAY31	Politics may be broken. But it’s only politics that can save us	No one would cast Robert Mueller as the lead in a romcom And yet watching him deliver a statement on Wednesday regarding his inquiry into Donald Trump Russia and obstruction of justice was to experience a sensation familiar to all romcom devotees  It comes when the hero needs to reveal his true feelings but instead becomes tongue tied Hugh Grant built a career on that moment You the audience are willing him to ditch the sub clauses and double negatives and just spit it out You formulate the sentence in your head it s simple and straightforward But he just can t get the words out 
MAY31	Want to be Tory leader and say you’re a feminist? Show us how, exactly	Actions speak louder than words And certainly T shirts Do you remember a few years back when various celebs and politicians from Benedict Cumberbatch to Nick Clegg posed in This Is What A Feminist Looks Like T shirts It s always dodgy when men do this stuff Most women just think Why don t you get on with being a good ally Walk alongside us not in front of us  Yet this particular identity debate has now surfaced in the Tory leadership contest which is suddenly chock a block with some unlikely specimens claiming to be feminists Of course the leadership contest in which or so rank and file members of the Tory party choose the next prime minister would do well to drape itself in T shirts carrying This Is Not What Democracy Looks Like slogans for it is indeed an affront to the very notion 
MAY31	What the new Lib Dem leader needs to do to make the party’s comeback last	When Vince Cable set a date for stepping aside as Lib Dem leader back in March it seemed clear that the contest to replace him would be about saving the party from oblivion It was lagging far behind in the polls still suffering from its poor performance in the general election and everyone was talking about the terrible threat it faced from a brand new centre party Change UK The task of the next leader was big but it was also fairly simple to be a fresh face and to persuade Change UK and the Greens to make pacts with them  They have spent nine years recovering from the last time they gained some traction with voters
MAY31	It’s time Corbyn reflected his own party, and opposed Brexit	There is a problem at the heart of the Labour party when the leader whips his MPs to support a motion calling for a confirmatory ballot on the prime minister s Brexit deal and the chair of the party abstains For a backbench MP to break the whip is bad enough but for a member of the shadow cabinet to break collective responsibility is rare especially when it goes without sanction  The dilemma helped shape Labour s EU election catastrophe The party sat on the fence with the leader looking both ways sometimes towards a confirmatory ballot sometimes towards Brexit From Ian Lavery s recent Guardian article it is obvious he was off the fence walking the fields where Brexit roams Labour has paid the price 
MAY31	The Tories must do the unthinkable when selecting their leader, and forget Brexit	Dominic Raab wants us to know that he s the man to negotiate with Brussels Or at least his friends do Writing in the Daily Telegraph yesterday the former Tory MP Nick de Bois recalled his time as Raab s chief of staff at the Brexit department It s a paean that reaches a climax with a description of Michel Barnier ripping out his earpiece and includes the line I have seen Dominic Raab look Michel Barnier in the eye and it wasn t Dominic who blinked first Which is joyous news if you use ocular moisture levels as your marker of greatness  Not everyone agrees that Raab played a blinder in Brussels In the recent BBC documentary Brexit Behind Closed Doors we do indeed see Barnier tell a meeting that Raab made threats Theresa May never dared to say but he also claims that Raab immediately backed down when challenged He immediately took his words back he is not always into nuances Dominic Raab So much for the Art of the Deal 
MAY31	This broken House of Lords doesn’t need reform. It needs scrapping	Imagine this for a gig You get paid for doing no discernible work occasionally get to wear some funky looking scarlet and ermine robes prance around one of the world s most iconic buildings and even have subsidised meals thrown into the bargain This is lifestyle that David Brookman a Labour peer in the House of Lords might recognise according to a Guardian investigation You as a taxpayer forked out the equivalent of two nurses salary last year in attendance and travel expenses for Baron Brookman of Ebbw Vale who in a month period didn t participate in a single debate or submit any written questions Still who needs nurses  One in nine peers in a full year between and did not participate in any House of Lords business defined as speaking in a debate holding a government post or participating in a committee and didn t even vote yet one of these still claimed a cool Lord Brookman did at least vote regularly 
MAY31	Racial abuse in the playground? That’s just England in 2019	To celebrate my youngest sister s birthday I take her out for lunch With five children between us conversation is snatched at any given time someone is asking for a crayon or spilling their drink or moaning It s a prosaic enough half term scene until my sister is suddenly reminded of something she wants to tell me Last week she recounts she d been walking down her local high street in a suburb of Bradford and heard a man shout out fucking dirty wog She thought he had been speaking to her but then realised he had been referring to her nine month old daughter  This is England in I write this because the impulse might be to claim it as only a singular moment and anachronistic Yet yesterday the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children NSPCC reported that racial abuse and bullying of children has risen by a fifth since 
MAY31	You can’t teach schoolchildren ‘resilience’ when they’re micromanaged every day	Don t tell the Conservative leadership candidates but the education secretary Damian Hinds is holding a brainstorming session He wants ideas on how we can toughen up British schoolchildren Clearly he knows something we don t about the future   To truly prepare for adult life we need to make sure our young people build character and resilience he announced last week as he launched a new C R initiative as it will doubtless be shortened to in education circles Yes GCSEs and A levels are important Hinds said but in years time exam results will be a distant memory Presumably Sats and Pisa rankings too the whole quasi mathematical surveillance matrix that Hinds and his predecessors have painstakingly constructed for our children these past few decades
