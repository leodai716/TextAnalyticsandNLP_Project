JUL3	Tennis prodigy Cori Gauff shows why role models still matter	One of the most embarrassing things that ever happened to me played out in Wimbledon. Venus and Serena Williams were renting a house on the road where I grew up. Like me, they were barely out of their teens – Venus had just turned 20 – but while I had just finished my A-levels, they were busy tearing up 120 years of tennis history. That was the first year Venus won Wimbledon, which prompted my mum to insist on baking a cake, frogmarching our whole family up the road, and handing it over to the bemused Williams sisters, declaring that as the mother of two black girls, she knew exactly how they felt. I was mortified, but in hindsight I rate my mum for this. She looked at the Williamses and saw role models for her own daughters. And she was right. The arrival of Venus and Serena had a profound impact on me and my sense of self. Their skill was so exceptional, even in an environment that proved repeatedly hostile – becoming the best athlete of her generation didn’t stop the press trolling Serena. They literally changed the game.	0
AUG29	Boris Johnson’s intention is clear: he wants a ‘people v parliament’ election	Boris Johnson’s plan to prorogue parliament ahead of a Queen’s speech on 14 October is intended to provoke parliamentarians into blocking a no-deal Brexit, or triggering a general election through a vote of no confidence. Both are feasible in the time available. The last time parliament stepped in to block no deal earlier in the year, the necessary legislation was passed in just three days. Johnson has deliberately left enough time for parliament to seize control again. That’s because Johnson’s real objective is to use Brexit to win a general election, rather than use a general election to secure Brexit. By forcing the hands of his opponents, he has defined the terrain for a “people versus parliament” election. Expect him to run on “Back Boris, Take Back Britain”. He will say that the only way to definitely leave on 31 October is to give him a parliamentary majority to do so. The man of Eton, Oxford and the Telegraph will position himself as the leader of the people against the hated establishment and “remainer elite”.	1
OCT5	Harry and Meghan are celebrities, but that doesn’t mean they owe us everything	The royal family does not much go in for the vulgarity of emotion. Princess Diana was expected to tolerate her husband’s infidelity in dignified silence, not go crying to Panorama. Her children would, in turn, be expected to walk dry-eyed behind her coffin. The family still mostly takes its lead from the Queen’s constitutional obligation to conceal her feelings, recognising that her rockiest moments have come when asked to reveal more than is comfortable – during Scotland’s independence referendum, or when the unexpected national wave of grief over Diana’s death left the family looking dangerously stiff. The younger royals have pushed the boundaries by discussing their mental health, but raw, unfiltered emotion is still regarded as suspiciously bad for business. Imagine the concern, then, at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s insistence on showing some.	0
JUL25	This is a Vote Leave government now. There will be no one else to blame	The Queen’s first prime minister was Winston Churchill. Her 14th is a Winston Churchill tribute act. So perhaps it’s no surprise that Boris Johnson’s debut performance as prime minister included a sub-Churchillian riff, extolling Britain’s readiness not to fight the Nazi menace but to cope with a no-deal exit from the European Union. “The ports will be ready and the banks will be ready and the factories will be ready and business will be ready and the hospitals will be ready,” he said, until one half-expected him to declare that we shall be ready on the beaches, we shall be ready on the landing grounds, we shall be ready in the fields and in the streets and in the hills. But if Johnson has always wanted to be Churchill, the address he delivered on the steps of Downing Street and his first exercise of raw prime ministerial power suggest he wants to be two other people too. Throughout his six-week campaign for the Conservative leadership, friends and enemies alike wondered which Johnson would prevail: would it be the twice-elected mayor of London, who won over a Labour-voting, progressive city, or would it be the leader of the Vote Leave campaign, whose lies and insults have led the US president himself to hail him as the British Trump? The complexion of his first cabinet suggests victory for the latter. But there are also signs that he wants to be both, that – not for the first time – he wants to have his cake and eat it.	0
JUN6	The NHS cannot become a bargaining chip in our desperate deal-making with the US	Even when it’s in the process of being deliberately run down by the Conservatives so it can finally be privatised, our National Health Service makes America’s arrangements look monstrous by comparison. So those of us who have long suspected that privatisation is the ideological end-goal for many Conservative rightwingers were left unsurprised when the US ambassador, Woody Johnson, essentially said that our entire economy was up for grabs in a post-Brexit trade deal. Trump echoed this sentiment and then backtracked when interviewed by Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain (a cocktail of entities so loathsome that it can only add credence to the notion that we are hurtling along a dark alternative timeline following the rupturing of the universe caused by David Bowie’s death). Trump’s state visit may have seen the last few days of British diplomacy descend into a Boschian hellscape populated by sour-faced old colonialists, disturbingly shiny simulacra offspring, and a man in a wig and tailcoat who wouldn’t pass muster as an am-dram waiter. But more disturbing still was having to witness the to-ing and fro-ing over the bartering of our health service. Trump’s blustering over whether or not he wants to get his tiny mitts on our NHS is ultimately irrelevant: who truly believes that the man understands anything about the issues at hand? But when the time comes to discuss the parcelling off of NHS services in a desperate trade deal, the discussion will be dominated by US business interests.	0
JUL22	Boris Johnson, the prime minister? I’m sorry to say that I’m partly to blame	How can this be happening?” I have lost count of the number of times I have been asked this question in the past few weeks. What people want to know – and I mean people from across the political spectrum – is how Boris Johnson, barring a serious upset, is about to become prime minister, first lord of the Treasury, and generally in charge of everything. How?	1
MAY13	Ecstasy, despair and how the great game reminded us of the ties that bind	Eleven minutes into the second half, as Gini Wijnaldum’s header fizzed into the top corner and Liverpool took a 3-0 lead in their Champions League semi-final last week, I just stood there, motionless, staring at my mate Mick Potter with bulging eyes. He looked back, shaking his head. His dumbfounded expression said: “We’ve seen a lot, you and me – but nothing like this.” I’ve known Mick since 1982. We have seen a lot together – Heysel, Hillsborough, dark, dark days as well as glorious times following our team. As with all friendships – your work, your family – your fate can draw you away, but there’s always that sinew that connects you. Our team; our history. The things we’ve done together, as supporters.	0
AUG17	Packing Christmas cards knocked the pseudo-intellectual snob out of me	I finished my A-levels in July of 1999, the summer of the eclipse, the Matrix and, legally, the start of my adult life. The one thing these things had in common was that none of them was visible from the Leicestershire village of Earl Shilton. It’s a place you might describe as “picturesque” or “rural”, as long as you were standing on the outskirts and facing the surrounding countryside. At the time I was more likely to use words like “bleak”, “small” and “decaying, isolated shithole”, but that’s because I was a teenage Manic Street Preachers fan, and we said that sort of thing a lot. Going to university was something of an unknown quantity in my family, but my parents – unbelievably proud of my offer to study sociology at Loughborough – knew one thing for sure and hammered it home: you got a job in the holidays. It’s just what you did. And I was going to need the money. For the first time since 1962, there was to be no mandatory grant for students (thanks, New Labour!), and though I qualified for support to cover my tuition fees, and a student loan would just about cover the rent for my self-catered, shared room in halls, if I didn’t save any cash I wasn’t going to have any. I knew the student union did pound-a-pint nights, but I’d probably have to eat too.	0
SEP1	A ‘Brexit bonanza’ for UK fishing? That’s a fishy tale with an unhappy ending	One man’s fish is another man’s poisson. Not for much longer, it seems. French fishermen are growing alarmed. They fear a no-deal Brexit will exclude them from “British” waters where they have fished for centuries. The same applies to fishers from Ireland, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany.	1
AUG26	How can children thrive when they are squeezed into cramped homes?	Personal space is a political issue. Analysing data from the English Housing Survey, supplemented by a Comres poll of families in overcrowded housing, the National Housing Federation (NHF) reports that 130,000 families are living in one-bedroom homes. An estimated 1.3 million children live in overcrowded homes, defined as children sleeping in the same room as two or more siblings, their parents or a teenager of the opposite sex. Just 6,000 homes were built in 2018 for social rent, despite at least 145,000 being needed. Some children are sleeping three to a bed, with adults sleeping in kitchens, halls and bathrooms to free up space. There are 96,000 more children living like this than a decade ago. An estimated 92,000 children are thought to be sofa-surfing with their families and not even registering in the figures.	0
JUL8	Iran didn’t ask for this crisis, but it won’t stand for Trump’s bullying	In May 2018, the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was designed to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and had been agreed on after 12 years of exhaustive negotiations. The US began to impose new economic and political sanctions, targeting not just various sectors of the Iranian economy, but the state’s most influential entities and actors. The imposition of these sanctions has virtually killed off the possibility of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and will have political consequences for not just Iran and the US, but the whole region. The current situation is extremely fraught, with Iran responding to aggressive actions by increasing its level of uranium enrichment.	0
MAY18	Remain voters are left with no choice but to ignore Labour next week	Shall we take a nostalgic trip back to the distant past of two weeks ago? You’ll remember there were local elections in England, in which the pro-Brexit parties took a pasting, while the anti-Brexit parties surged. You might also recall how the main parties interpreted those results: they hailed them as a heartfelt plea from the voters to get on with Brexit. Here, then, is a warning to remain-minded voters ahead of Thursday’s European elections. If you want to send a message about Brexit, you’ll need to send it as clearly and as unambiguously as possible. Up against a spin machine capable of hearing a repudiation as an endorsement, voters will need to be louder and clearer this time, closing down the scope for wilful misinterpretation.	1
MAY1	Clinton-era politics refuses to die. Joe Biden is its zombie that staggers on	You cannot understand politics in America until you understand that in the Democratic party, which ostensibly represents the left side of our nation’s political spectrum, there are a significant number of people who genuinely believe that Joe Biden is the best possible presidential nominee. Their belief is not cynical, or at least not wholly cynical. His constituency is real. It is not illuminating to think of them just as centrists, arguing for the gentlest sprinkling of sugar over the top of America’s poison. It’s better to think of them as zombies: the product of three decades of self-serving, triangulating brainwashing. They are the Democrats who had their eyelids propped open and were forced to watch the Clinton era, year after year after year. It is not so much that they do not, deep down, harbor a vague wish for a better world; it is that, like stray dogs dining exclusively on garbage, life has taught them that this is the best that they will ever get.	0
JUN6	I know what drives young people to self-harm – I did it for years	I remember clearly the first time I self-harmed. I was an awkward 13-year-old girl, beset by problems with my body image. I had a budding eating disorder and was bullied mercilessly by my peers for being bisexual. The sensation of crushing hopelessness and self-hatred threatened to overwhelm me, so I addressed the pain in a way I believed wouldn’t hurt anyone else but myself. I turned all the tumult and sadness inwards, and the relief, although short-lived, was immediate. This began a pattern that would last well into my adult life. Trauma, in the form of losing jobs, sexual assault and family breakdown, prompted more self-harm episodes, resulting in countless stitches and permanent scarring.	0
SEP6	Javid’s giveaways don’t come close to reversing austerity’s bitter legacy	The end of austerity is here, Sajid Javid tells us. The “page is turned”. If only it really were that easy to erase the damage done during a decade of public services stripped bare. No department will suffer further cuts and all their budgets will keep pace with inflation. It’s good news that “the biggest increase in spending for a decade” means no new punishment will be inflicted on the public realm. An election is on the way and voters won’t take it any more. They need no focus groups to tell them people put the NHS, schools and police top of their priorities. The deep school cuts led to the firing of teachers and teaching assistants; stopped music, drama, art and school trips; closed breakfast clubs for hungry children; and left headteachers begging parents for pencils and glue. The damage emerged into the light of day to Theresa May’s political discomfort in the 2017 election. Now the annual funding is restored, but 10 years of spending are lost for ever.	0
AUG23	Britain and Italy are now the terrible twins of Europe	For most of the time since 1945, the politics and government of Britain and Italy have seemed like polar opposites. True, both were important European powers. True too, each had a place among the world’s major economies. Even now, Britain and Italy will be among the select group of economically powerful nations whose leaders will gather in the Second Empire splendour of Biarritz’s Hotel du Palais this weekend for the latest G7 summit. In the past, that was where the similarities began to ebb away. In politics, Britain was famously stable while Italy was infamously not. British governments were domestically strong, while Italian governments were weak and short-lived. In Britain, leftwing politics was rooted in industrial unionism, while Italy possessed the largest, most modern-minded and most alluring communist party in the west. When Britain looked in the mirror it saw the embodiment of probity and practicality, while Italy was all too often synonymous with crime and corruption. While Britain maintained its autonomy by refusing to join the eurozone, Italy enthusiastically embraced its upper mid-table place in the EU and its membership of the single currency was shamelessly engineered.	0
FEB17	The trip from London to Lincolnshire showed me the Brexit divide’s depth	What was it the Queen said? “As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture.” She spoke those words last month at the centenary of the Sandringham Women’s Institute (humble occasions are no enemies of wisdom), and they are understood to refer to the social and political division caused by the Brexit vote. I remembered the gist of them last weekend as our train trundled towards Boston in Lincolnshire, a town on the other side of the Wash from the monarch’s Norfolk estate. The division between migrants and natives long predated Brexit, and the vote was a consequence rather than a cause of it	1
JAN27	Britons don’t grasp the EU’s essential motivation – a quest for the quiet life	What does the EU want? This simple question has foxed Brits throughout the Brexit talks. It is alleged that Brussels is desperate to retain Britain; that it yearns to get rid of it; that German car-makers and friendly states such as the Netherlands will force Angela Merkel to let Britain cherrypick the best of membership; that Europeans want to ruin Britain, sending it on its way with a punishment beating pour encourager les autres. None of this contradictory speculation has turned out to be right, and Britain’s negotiating efforts have been the poorer for it. European mainlanders can be hard to read. The Friday before last, prominent Germans including Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s heir presumptive, wrote a saccharine letter to the Times urging Britain to stay. On Monday the Polish foreign minister broke EU ranks to suggest that the Irish backstop be limited, to get Theresa May’s deal over the line. Yet on Wednesday Merkel seemingly contradicted her own colleagues, opining fatalistically that Britain, an island, had always had “patchy” relations with the EU and suggesting that its exit is inevitable. The day after, an exasperated Emmanuel Macron told a crowd near Lyon that Brexit has “torn British society apart” and “cannot be delivered”, his tone so critical that it moved a Spectator writer to ask why the French president “hates Britain so much”. The motivations and instincts of our continental partners sometimes baffle us Brits.	1
SEP11	Media bias is OK – if it's honest	Most people distrust the media, and most people are right. It’s healthy to question what you’re being told – that’s the mark of an intelligent and independent populace. And the media in the United States are, in fact, “biased” in many ways. Not always toward the left or right, but frequently toward reaffirming the worldview of an insular establishment, as Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky pointed out years ago in Manufacturing Consent. It should be obvious that there can’t be such a thing as a neutral journalist. We all have moral instincts and points of view. Those points of view will color our interpretations of the facts. The best course of action is to acknowledge where we’re coming from. If we show an awareness of our own political leanings, it actually makes us more trustworthy than if we’re in denial about them.	0
AUG30	My children are teaching me to love the housing estate I fled	Don’t let anyone ever tell you that you have to come from a place to belong there. Just because the place you grew up in lives inside you, it doesn’t mean you have to like it, or defend it, or define every other place against it. Birmingham, where I come from, inhabits my accent and underlies my compulsive self-deprecation, but apart from that, my Brummie-ness feels like an accident. (Even so, I’m obsessed with it.) The centripetal Midlands happens to be where the Welsh, Irish and English strands of my family combined, having moved, as humans do, where there are prospects for a better life. The centre drew them in, then cast them to the periphery as Birmingham built outwards in concentric circles following the first world war. I grew up in Chelmsley Wood, on a vast estate built on green belt land outside the city boundaries where, a Birmingham Post reporter predicted in 1971, “the city will feel a million life-miles away” to the children who would come to be raised there.	0
JUN29	Of all the hills to die on, why on earth has Labour chosen Chris Williamson?	Shortly after this article was published, Chris Williamson’s suspension was reinstated, pending a meeting of Labour’s disputes committee. Purely in terms of story, I am confused by the stakes in the Labour leadership’s vision for the nation. If you tell me this is a transformative programme to uplift the many, then I expect the movie trailer voiceover to growl something like: “HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO DEFEND HUMANITY?” Instead, the tagline seems to be “HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO DEFEND CHRIS WILLIAMSON?”	0
JUN28	At 68, my climate activism made me a criminal. But I refuse to give up	I am now 68 years of age but when I was 21, in my final year at university, I became aware of major problems then facing the world – war, poverty, acid rain, ozone depletion, desertification, deforestation, species loss, civil and military uses and abuses of nuclear power, pollution, population growth, consumerism and the climate crisis. I was determined to devote my life to helping solve these problems. After spending three years in Cameroon, learning about deforestation for timber and cash crops such as palm oil, and the exploitation of the rich resources of Africa to the detriment of locals and enrichment of corporations and western societies, I returned home to the nuclear weapons crisis of the cold war. I joined the Greenham Common protests, founded the Snowball civil disobedience campaign and then later the anti-nuclear weapons group Trident Ploughshares. I also became involved in work on the climate crisis. I learned that everything is connected and that it all has an impact on the climate, on biodiversity and on the sustainability of life on Earth. I discovered more about how our reliance on fossil fuels was causing the greenhouse effect and soon joined with climate scientists and local environmentalists to start a group in Norwich that tried to educate the public.	0
MAY6	Why are so many afraid to confront Britain’s historical links with the slave trade?	Seldom have so many people taken to print and the airwaves to make the case for academic incuriosity. Rarely has the search for new knowledge, undertaken by a university of world renown, been so vocally condemned. That is what happened when Cambridge University announced a new academic research project to determine the extent to which the university (although not its wealthy colleges) “contributed to, benefited from or challenged” slavery and the slave trade. Cambridge and its colleges are rich. Staggeringly rich. And – spoiler alert – some of the gifts and bequests buried deep within that mountain of wealth will have come from benefactors who were slave traders and slave owners. This is true of other universities, here and abroad. Yet the same commentators who endlessly accuse students of being closed to new ideas and unwilling to face uncomfortable facts have rushed to condemn the university’s investigation into its own past. Their argument, in essence, is that we’re better off not knowing.	0
JAN31	If Corbyn gets his hands dirty he can avert a hard Brexit	In spite of the upbeat signals that came from Jeremy Corbyn’s meeting with Theresa May on Wednesday, experience suggests that it will not prove a turning point on Brexit. Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator. These gifts are not part of their skill sets. Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign. Corbyn’s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo’s Inspector Javert look like a libertine. May’s default mode towards Corbyn, on show again at question time this week, is to give him her full Lady Disdain. What is more, even if the two leaders wanted to patch something together, their respective Brexit positions do not allow for much common ground anyway. May’s red lines on leaving the single market and the customs union, ending free movement and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court are mostly mirror images of Corbyn’s. He wants a close relationship with the EU market and on customs, and supports his own version of free movement. The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen, preferably under a Conservative government.	1
JUL26	Boris Johnson is mere bluster. It’s Labour that is offering real optimism for the UK	It was a typical Boris Johnson performance in the Commons today, all waving arms and blustering rhetoric. It’s nothing new – we’re used to him offering us dead cats, or even kippers. But it shouldn’t disguise the fact that he is committed to a dangerous, hard-right agenda.	0
SEP25	So parliament is returning. But what happens next?	In its ruling on Tuesday that the “prime minister’s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect”, the supreme court has decided that parliament was never actually suspended two weeks ago. The clock is turned back to 9 September, the last day MPs sat. So parliament will return but, as prorogation did not take place, it is not being recalled. There will be no Queen’s speech, no new legislative agenda, no state opening. Business will resume. But, since this has never happened before, this is not business as usual. A degree of improvisation and innovation – with the government working with the opposition parties and Commons Speaker John Bercow – will be required to map out the days and weeks ahead. The government is expected to table a motion to secure a short conference recess. If MPs reject this, then the Conservative party conference in Manchester would take place while parliament sits – an unusual and, from Boris Johnson’s point of view, logistically unhelpful clash.	0
JAN1	Advertising and academia are controlling our thoughts. Didn’t you know?	To what extent do we decide? We tell ourselves we choose our own life course, but is this ever true? If you or I had lived 500 years ago, our worldview, and the decisions we made as a result, would have been utterly different. Our minds are shaped by our social environment, in particular the belief systems projected by those in power: monarchs, aristocrats and theologians then; corporations, billionaires and the media today. Humans, the supremely social mammals, are ethical and intellectual sponges. We unconsciously absorb, for good or ill, the influences that surround us. Indeed, the very notion that we might form our own minds is a received idea that would have been quite alien to most people five centuries ago. This is not to suggest we have no capacity for independent thought. But to exercise it, we must – consciously and with great effort – swim against the social current that sweeps us along, mostly without our knowledge.	0
SEP25	The verdict is in: Boris Johnson is a liar. And he should pay the price	If Boris Johnson does nothing more, his name in history is already inscribed as the man who lied so hard he nearly broke the constitution. He certainly broke the law, as definitively interpreted by the supreme court today. Any leader with respect for the responsibilities that come with high office, and capable of shame, would immediately resign. Nothing in Johnson’s record suggests he is such a person. He clambered to Downing Street over the wreckage of his own former beliefs, ruined friendships and betrayed relationships. He has never recognised the imperative of truth, so takes no instruction from it now. The new pinnacle of Johnson’s career as a peddler of falsehood is his claim that parliament’s suspension earlier this month was procedural – a conventional legislative reboot ahead of a Queen’s speech to set out a new domestic agenda. No one believed him. His own ministers struggled to hold the line, blurting out the true motive, which was to limit MPs’ control over Brexit. By unanimous verdict, the country’s most senior judges ruled that prorogation did indeed have the effect of “preventing or frustrating” the legislature in pursuit of its constitutional duties – passing laws, holding ministers to account and, crucially, representing the public in Commons debates. The court noted that those functions were uniquely urgent, given the proximity of the Brexit deadline. The stymying deed had to be undone.	1
SEP16	There’s nothing normal about this beast of a government	How grimly symbolic of the times in which we live that it is necessary to correct the prime minister on his reference to comic book characters. Only a couple of years ago, Boris Johnson was urging the Tory party conference, in pseudo-Churchillian phrases, to “let the [British] lion roar”. Now, in an interview with the Mail on Sunday, he is invoking more primitive and aggressive imagery. If he fails to get a new Brexit deal with the EU, he will simply ignore the legislation requiring him to seek an article 50 extension: “The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.”	1
FEB17	Tormenting Meghan Markle has become a national sport that shames us	In the period when the acquisition of the former Meghan Markle was depicted as little short of a national triumph, much was written in the British press about her various accomplishments. These are, after all, roughly as common in royal spouses as successful independent careers. Meghan, the actress and blogger and charity worker, is also, it emerged, a skilled calligrapher. “I’ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well,” she once told an Esquire journalist, who’d described her writing as “incredible”. “What it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning.”	0
MAY4	William Barr is acting like Trump's henchman	William Barr has shown himself to be a loyal foot soldier for the president who appointed him. From his 24 March summary of the “principal conclusions” of the Mueller report to his press conference on the day he released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress, to his testimony on Wednesday before the Senate judiciary committee, Barr’s recent performances have demonstrated the extreme loyalty Donald Trump found wanting in his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions. And what is good for the president is bad for America.	0
AUG7	Toni Morrison’s genius was the inspiration of my youth	Toni Morrison was part of an extraordinary generation of African American women writers. But she was the most special. She was the queen. To understand the impact she had on me you have to appreciate that I came of age in an era when there were very few black female role models. Prominent black women tended to be entertainers: British popular music pianist Winifred Atwell, British jazz singer Cleo Laine, or the host of American jazz singers such as Ella Fitzgerald. So Toni Morrison was a complete revelation. Black male writers were rare enough. But a black female writer was for me a genuine sensation. She and her peer group – Alice Walker, Gloria Naylor and Ntozake Shange – burned into my consciousness. Toni Morrison did so much to shape my understanding of life and politics, and my world as a black woman.	0
JUN15	Grenfell Tower, two years on: community members discuss what’s changed	I was in the cemetery just last week. I was showing my friend each grave, telling him about the person whose name is etched into the gravestone. He gasped as he realised that some gravestones had more than one name attached to them. It’s not a usual scenario, but then, is any part of what happened at Grenfell usual? We span two areas of the cemetery, visiting those we’ve lost, ending our visit by making prayers for peace, patience and blessings for each person who is no longer with us. A few days later, just last Sunday, I received several calls from people alerting me to a fire that had broken out at flats in Barking. Thankfully, no lives were lost, but life for all those who used to live there had changed … their possessions were destroyed within minutes.	0
OCT1	The Tories have split the country. No spending splurge can repair it	Look at the people here in Manchester at the Tory party conference, stare into their eyes and they look much as they always did – ordinary home counties folk, small business people, plus a few sharp-suited would-be spads. Not noticeably odd, yet these party members are the tiny group who have done for their country. Over the past decade, their Brexit fever has packed the Commons with Europhobes. These respectable law and order-minded patriots chose a dishonest, disreputable, disgrace of a man for prime minister, who will trash their constitution, mislead their monarch, and disrespect their judges to use “any means necessary” to get anything he wants. These ordinary people have turned into wreckers of what they used to hold dearest.	0
JUN1	Politics may be broken. But it’s only politics that can save us	No one would cast Robert Mueller as the lead in a romcom. And yet watching him deliver a statement on Wednesday regarding his inquiry into Donald Trump, Russia and obstruction of justice was to experience a sensation familiar to all romcom devotees. It comes when the hero needs to reveal his true feelings but instead becomes tongue-tied. (Hugh Grant built a career on that moment.) You, the audience, are willing him to ditch the sub-clauses and double-negatives and just spit it out. You formulate the sentence in your head: it’s simple and straightforward. But he just can’t get the words out.	0
JAN23	Only empathy can break the cycle of violence in Israel-Palestine	Empathy is all about imagining other minds, appreciating that different people have different perspectives, and responding to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion. After a career studying autism and the nature of empathy, I see empathy as one of our most valuable natural resources. It has particular promise as an approach to conflict resolution, one that has advantages over viewing a problem through a chiefly military, economic or legal lens. We can see this if we look at the Israel-Palestine conflict, where both communities have different views of the same historic period, both claim the same piece of land and both have valid emotional reactions to the conflict that must be acknowledged. I am not an expert in that dispute nor so naive to believe that there is a single, simple solution to it. But I do believe empathy can help.	0
JUN23	Don’t stereotype young remainers. We fear for our futures, not our holidays	The current political crisis over Brexit has been a wake-up call for my generation: the doctrine that our parents and grandparents will leave behind a better world no longer holds. But, of course, not every young person feels this way. A significant minority – especially those in towns outside London and the south-east – do not necessarily share the enthusiasm of the 78% of young people who would back remain in a people’s vote on Brexit. And those that do will often have different reasons for their convictions too. We don’t want to leave them behind. This summer the campaign I’m part of, Our Future Our Choice, will join a tour of the whole country, calling on politicians to let us be heard. We will be gathering in Wolverhampton, Sunderland, Leeds, Glasgow, Derby, Belfast and many more towns and cities over the summer, leading up to one more huge rally in London on 12 October.	1
JAN16	The Guardian view on May’s Brexit deal: it’s over, but what’s next?	The overwhelming and decisive rejection by MPs of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement to leave the European Union is a shattering blow to the authority of the prime minister. She has spent two years negotiating a deal, which in substance was the opposite of what she said she wanted in public, only to see it repudiated by parliament. Her minority government has now been defeated on no fewer than 28 occasions. Britain is leaving the EU in weeks and Mrs May leads a cabinet that is hopelessly split, a party that is riven with disagreements and a country that is deeply divided. So emphatic is the Commons historic rebuff that Mrs May’s deal is finished. Mrs May lost by 230 votes – the greatest defeat of a government ever. The scale of the opposition means it is not credible Mrs May could bring the motion back to the Commons, modified with a few tweaks from Brussels, and hope for success a second time round. We do not have to settle for the Hobson’s choice of the May deal or no deal. The trouble is the Tory party is split between those who want a deal and those who do not. Mrs May has intensified the divisions within her party, rather than resolve them. She chose to start negotiations over Brexit not with the EU but with her own hardliners. The red lines Mrs May subsequently set made it impossible for her to get a deal that would bring her fractious party together, let alone reach out to her political opponents. Her agreement ended up shaped by Mrs May’s obsession with immigration and placating Brexit extremists. The result is a “blindfold Brexit” – where almost everything about the future relationship with Europe is up in the air for two more years. It required a leap of faith to place trust in a prime minister who, the Commons wisely decided, deserved very little.	1
FEB2	The polar vortex has turned New Yorkers into Brits for one week only	Once the basics are covered, and one’s face is set against the storm, there is nothing like a good weather event to excite bipartisan unity. For a British person in the US, the advent of the polar vortex this week has been an embarrassment of riches the like of which we haven’t seen since first encountering the term “thundersnow”. It was -18C with wind-chill in New York this week – and, in a household in which my children persistently refuse to put on their coats, the weather finally won: on the school run we all went the full Shackleton. I’m aware you have to squint slightly to make this experience a fully detribalised issue. The crashing temperatures, including a contender for the lowest ever on record in Chicago, are linked to Arctic air being pushed south by disruptions to the jet stream that experts say is caused by global warming. And enjoying both the frisson of cold air and repeated opportunity to use the word “vortex” relies on the luxury of minimal exposure.	0
MAR16	Brexit – the niche production that truly brought the house down	We focus so much on what divides parliament’s warring Brexit factions, when almost all of them are united by the guiding principle of brinkmanship: “Eventually someone will stop acting like a shit, but it certainly won’t be me.” The past few days have been like watching the Cuban missile crisis re-enacted by the Teletubbies. A recap, then. Hopes that Tinky Winky would grow into the role of Bobby Kennedy were dashed this week in a series of votes in the House of Commons. We are 14 days out from the date the UK will leave the European Union without a deal unless something else is agreed upon. With the threat of that something being a long extension, if granted by the EU, Theresa May is hoping MPs will look again at her withdrawal agreement next week in Meaningful Vote 3. Sure, they saw it lurching around the bar earlier and thought there was no way in a million years they were going home with it. But this close to tipping-out time, are they drunk enough to panic-buy? If the answer turns out to be yes, the prime minister’s various earlier losses this week will be hailed momentarily as tactically astute. Think of it as a sort of Crap Negotiations World Cup. Theresa May doesn’t want to finish top of the group or her Brexit will face the Treaty of Versailles in the semis.	1
MAY24	Menopausal? Yes. But at 50 I’m hotter than I was in my 20s	I’m new to being 50 and I’m waiting for it to happen to me: the moment when I vanish without trace. My 51st year started with the B-list French celebrity Yann Moix making global headlines after saying that women over 50 were invisible. (Fun fact: he had to put out a request to stop fiftysomething women spamming him with pictures of their perky body parts in the aftermath. Poor him. ) It turns out that he prefers the “extraordinary” body of a 25-year-old. The thing is, at 50 I know I am objectively more attractive than I was in my 20s, when I was unhappy, insecure, overweight and all round not conventionally hot. I am more attractive than I was in my 30s (raising young kids and juggling a big day job with splitting up with their dad) or in my early- to mid-40s (perimenopause hitting hard and somewhat losing my shit, or at least my way, for a few years).	0
MAY21	Google’s Huawei ban is good news: tech giants shouldn’t always get their way	The post-digital revolution starts here. Thank you, Donald Trump. The US president’s decision to blacklist Huawei, which has led to Google ending collaborating with the company, may have the worst of motives. It could have the best of consequences. So far, global government has proved impotent in forcing the grand monopolies of the digital age to adhere to any regulation. They have gone where they like, gobbled up competitors as they choose and paid taxes (or none) as the whim takes them. The only rivalry has been in physical products such as smartphones, but they are just shells for conveying monopoly power round the world.	0
FEB2	May’s bribe won’t stop Brexit inflicting more pain on Labour's heartlands	It took 35 years but now, perhaps, comes the final act of the miners’ strike that tore Britain apart for one long, bitter year in the mid-1980s. Decades later, the second woman prime minister is promising balm to heal the wounds inflicted by the first, as Theresa May offers bundles of cash to areas of the country punched hard by Margaret Thatcher’s war on the pits. Of course, that’s not how it’s being presented. It’s true, too, that not every Labour leave-voting area now being pledged “transformative” investment was once marked by pitheads. Even so, a map of the Labour heartlands that voted to leave the European Union in 2016 does match up remarkably closely with the old coalfields. It would be easy to cast May’s proposed multibillion fund as an act of atonement for the damage the Tories did by crushing the miners, closing the pits and leaving many of those towns and villages to rot.	1
SEP15	From India to Britain, every citizen is harmed by anti-migrant hostility	In the Indian state of Assam, the authorities are building detention camps for “illegal immigrants”, most of whom are Indian citizens. In South Africa, hundreds of Nigerian workers have been airlifted home as anti-migrant violence spirals out of control. Two different events in two different countries, but each a glimpse of the malevolent trends transforming politics globally. While neither event has received much attention in Britain, consumed as we are by all things Brexit, both throw light upon developments here, too.	0
MAY7	It is not up to the UK government to decide whether I’m Irish or not	The Good Friday agreement is widely revered as a model of peace and celebrated worldwide. Yet the Home Office has openly disregarded the agreement, and is actively seeking to undermine its very foundation. I should know: I have spent the past four years in legal proceedings battling the Home Office. The people of Northern Ireland are unique within the UK in that we have the birthright to identify and be accepted as Irish or British or both. However, contrary to the statutory duty on the Home Office to accept the birthright provisions of the Good Friday agreement, it is arguing through the British courts that the people of Northern Ireland are “automatically British” as we were “clearly born in the United Kingdom”. The department regularly and repeatedly forces British citizenship on Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland – citizens who are Irish by birth and by choice – a choice the people of this island voted for overwhelmingly in the Good Friday agreement referendum. With Brexit on the horizon, and EU citizens’ rights in the balance, the situation has become urgent.	1
MAY12	The missing ingredient in today’s debates? Generosity	In the early 1960s a white student who had seen Malcolm X speak at her college went to the Nation of Islam restaurant in New York to challenge him on his philosophy. “Don’t you believe there are any good white people,” he recalled her asking, in his autobiography. “I didn’t want to hurt her feelings,” he wrote. “I told her, ‘People’s deeds I believe in, Miss – not their words.’” “What can I do?” she exclaimed. “Nothing,” Malcolm X said, and “she burst out crying, and ran out and up Lenox Avenue and caught a taxi”. He would later say of that encounter: “I regret that I told her she could do ‘nothing’. I wish now that I knew her name, or where I could telephone her …”	0
JAN15	In a world of joyless self-denial, what do we really want? Drunken Blind Daters, getting it on	Joanne and Morgan, a barista and a children’s social worker, have quite literally added to the gaiety of the nation with their brilliant blind date. As they told the Guardian’s Weekend magazine, they got drunk, fell over, crashed a party, fancied each other rotten. Knickers were lost. Mouths were full. They didn’t care about table manners or the food. Or, indeed, what any of us thought. What most of us thought, anyway, was: “Excellent behaviour!” Here were two young people having a wild time. For a brief moment, all was well with the world. Who cares whether they live happily ever after? I have never understood what a date actually is, except some sort of weird, creepy transaction where whoever pays gets to demand stuff from the other person. Often, I sit next to people on such dates and eavesdrop, and as far as I can ascertain they are worse than job interviews. They might as well be asking each other: “What qualities make you suitable for this role?”, “Would you describe yourself as a self-starter”, “You state on your application that you are 6ft; would you mind standing up?”	0
SEP26	Johnson’s plan is to turn his supreme court humiliation into rocket fuel at the polls	An angry and disturbingly pumped-up Boris Johnson’s response to the court in the recalled House of Commons tonight was an act of total contempt – for the courts, for parliament and ultimately for public and political decency. For the time being, Johnson still retains much of the formal power of the prime minister. But the role’s inner power, its moral authority, the holder’s ability to govern and his meaningful capacity to represent the country are practically shot. There is nothing tragic about this for Johnson personally. There is everything tragic for the country that never asked for him to become its leader. He can’t blame the judges, because he does not dare. He likes to blame MPs, because they are an easy target. But the real blame lies with himself and the Tory hard leavers.	1
AUG16	The UK faces a nation-defining battle that will split the Tory party	Throughout his nine years in Conservative-led British cabinets, Philip Hammond was regularly compared to AA Milne’s Eeyore. But what the lugubrious former chancellor did today was almost Tiggerish. By warning that Boris Johnson’s government is set on driving through a no-deal Brexit that parliament will oppose he gave the UK’s indolent August politics a much-needed wake-up call. In the three weeks since a hard-Brexit Tory coup put Johnson into Downing Street, politics has drifted into La-La land. An accumulated combination of long parliamentary stalemate, public weariness, an ineffectual Labour opposition, a compliant press and the well-executed strategy of the new Tory leader has made the Johnson government’s Brexit policy seem more inevitable than it actually is. By breaking cover, Hammond has provided an overdue reminder that the facts are still the facts.	1
JUL24	Brexit highlights Ireland’s divisions. But sport shows how united we can be	Depressed about Brexit? There’s always golf. As Brexit threatens the economic – and actual – security of Ireland, north and south, maybe what we can lean into a little more on this island is the unifying power of sport. Sport in Ireland overlaps with identities in curious ways, but there are many moments when perceived divisions can fade into the green distance, like a man from Offaly being cheered on at a course in Northern Ireland, about to win the Open. Tricolours being waved at Royal Portrush, a chorus of “olés ?, videos of Shane Lowry grinning as the Fields of Athenry is sung. Meanwhile, Lowry’s grandmother Emily Scanlon offered the most Irish of all anecdotes regarding sports nutrition on the Irish station RTÉ. “I remember I minded him while the mother was working, ? she said. “I had a turf box in the corner beside the range, and when I’d go up to the clothesline I’d put him into it, and he’d have all the turf mould ate ... whether it worked his immune system or what, I don’t know. He got there anyway. Great gossoon [young boy] he was. ? Turf mould may not be the next carrageen moss, but the moments sport can offer up, on their day, are some tonic.	1
JUL21	Our next PM needs to become an Iran expert. And fast	An incoming prime minister could be forgiven for feeling that the fates have been a touch unkind. As well as no majority in parliament, an uncertain domestic agenda and the vortex of Brexit, now a fully formed international crisis sits in the in-tray marked “Iran”. It will be an early test of diplomatic dexterity. We should not be here. As always, it helps to see the world as others see it, without compromise or acceptance of another’s perceptions. Iran has long and complex relationships all round. A Shia state surrounded by Sunni states, it sees its history as one requiring constant vigilance to survive in a world that stood by when it was attacked by Iraq and lost perhaps up to a million people, and one where economic sanctions threaten its people and government stability.	0
FEB22	The EU must resist impatience with Britain – for its own sake	“I will celebrate,” said an emphatic German voice behind me, while some dignitary on stage mouthed the conventional polite platitudes of regret about Britain’s departure from the EU. “I will celebrate when it’s over at last.” A week spent talking to politicians, officials and opinion-makers on the continent tells me that this captures the prevailing mood among Britain’s frustrated and increasingly contemptuous European partners: just get the negotiated withdrawal agreement across the line and Britain out of the door – then we can go back to fighting the real battles for Europe, starting with the European elections. While I understand all the feelings and calculations behind this view, it is profoundly shortsighted. It abandons those of us still fighting for Europe in Britain and underestimates the EU’s role in deciding Britain’s future. A divided country in the midst of a collective nervous breakdown is painfully dependent on the reaction of its now much stronger EU negotiating partner. This explains why every tweet from Donald Tusk, every hint from Jean-Claude Juncker, every nuance from Michel Barnier, is pored over in the British media with almost Sovietological attention. The EU is a major actor in the British debate, not merely a reactor to it. The conclusion is clear: it’s not just Britain that faces a big choice over Brexit, it’s also Europe.	1
JUL8	Here’s how to make the media fit for modern Britain	The Britain of 2019 is very different from the Britain of 1964, the year I started my journalistic career. Among the most obvious changes are those of social class and ethnicity. A country in which the largest social group was both working class and white has been transformed. Naturally enough, these developments have affected the makeup of our media, but in different ways. Journalism has become an almost uniformly middle-class trade in which entrants are usually expected to have enjoyed a degree-level education. By contrast, running counter to the rise in the BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) population, media recruitment has not kept pace with that increase. It is assumed that the lack of working class and BAME media representation distorts output. I concede it may be unproven, or possibly unprovable, but I am convinced it is so. In their heyday, popular newspapers, which were overwhelmingly staffed by white working-class journalists, reflected the concerns and, yes, the prejudices, of the communities from which they sprang.	0
FEB18	Tormenting Meghan Markle has become a national sport that shames us	In the period when the acquisition of the former Meghan Markle was depicted as little short of a national triumph, much was written in the British press about her various accomplishments. These are, after all, roughly as common in royal spouses as successful independent careers. Meghan, the actress and blogger and charity worker, is also, it emerged, a skilled calligrapher. “I’ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well,” she once told an Esquire journalist, who’d described her writing as “incredible”. “What it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning.”	0
MAR30	This defeat is the end of the Brexit PM. Bring on the general election	Force-feed them back their words. Theresa May’s deal was “even worse” than staying in the EU, declared Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary who resigned to oppose a deal he helped negotiate. This is a man who once publicly confessed he didn’t understand Britain’s reliance on the Dover-Calais crossing. The deal would turn Britain into a “vassal state”, declared Boris Johnson, a man who had penned a column backing remain days before endorsing leave; it was “about as bad as it could possibly be”.	1
FEB25	Independents offer hope to those who despair of our broken politics	Winston Churchill, who left the Tories to become a Liberal and then went back to the Conservatives, wryly congratulated himself: “Anyone can rat, but it takes a certain ingenuity to re-rat.” He is the exception to the rule that switchers don’t succeed in British politics. It is an enormous decision when an MP chooses to break with a party to which the politician will very often have committed decades of his or her life. It means the ruination of friendships and the wrecking of family relationships. And it is much more often than not a choice that leads to doom. This is why so many Labour and Conservative MPs stay within their parties even when they are in the most profound despair with where they are going or how they are being led. They resign themselves to bitter self-imprisonment in the belief that splitters never prosper.	0
MAY9	Brexit has robbed Labour of its insurgency. It’s time to claw it back	The supposed iron law of British politics – back when an economy dominated by Big Finance seemed to be a never-ending fountain of growth and tax revenues – used to go like this: you had to present yourself as a steady pair of hands, pro-business, competent, exuding stability, not someone to rock the hull of HMS Britain. Tony Blair, speaking of Margaret Thatcher, once described his political formula: “I always thought my job was to build on some of the things she had done rather than reverse them.” But whether you’re a politician of left, right or so-called “centre”, insurgency has become the iron law of our time. Labour has been robbed of that sense of insurgency by Brexit: its political fortunes depend on reclaiming it.	0
MAR4	Kashmir is in a perilous state because of India’s pivot to nationalism	On Friday, the four-day-long military flare-up between Pakistan and India began winding down, with Islamabad handing back an Indian air force pilot taken captive by the Pakistan army two days earlier. He had been shot down in the first aerial fighter combat between the two South Asian enemies since a full-scale war in 1971. Yet, forgotten in the Indian euphoria is the fact that Kashmir, where the deaths of 40 security men in a suicide bomb attack last month triggered this latest crisis, continues to simmer. Even as the pilot walked free, four policemen died in an encounter with Kashmiri militants.	0
MAY29	Are ‘weed tampons’ the answer to period pain?	I have spent the past 15 minutes sprawled in an undignified position on the floor experimenting with cannabis suppositories. This isn’t a typical Monday night for me, I’ll have you know; I am doing it in the name of science. Specifically, I am doing it to see whether “weed tampons” can get rid of period pain. There is a distinct possibility that I just lost 90% of my male readers. The squeamishness surrounding menstruation is part of the reason that little effort has been made to find effective treatments for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and period pain. Want to hear some rage-inducing stats? There have been five times as many studies into erectile dysfunction as there have been into PMS. That is despite the fact that 90% of women have experienced PMS, while only 19% of men have been affected by ED. Period pain can be debilitating, but women are still expected to suffer through it with just ibuprofen or a hot water bottle.	0
AUG1	Should people without children be banned from Disney World?	If you’re not a fan of unbridled capitalism, please brace yourself: I am sorry to report that an EXTREMELY EMPHATIC Facebook post is going viral. The post in question is from an anonymous mother who is outraged people without kids have the temerity to holiday at Disney World. “It pisses me off TO NO END!!!!! When I see CHILDLESS COUPLES AT DISNEY WORLD,” she explains. “DW is a FAMILY amusement park!!!! Yet these IMMATURE millennials THROW AWAY THEIR MONEY ON USELESS CRAP!!!!!” The outburst appears to have been prompted by a woman “in some very SLUTTY shorts” buying a pretzel. This contributed to a very long pretzel queue, meaning our protagonist’s kid could not get their hands on a salty snack. “I fucking hate childless women with a BURNING PASSION!!!” the post ends. There are several angry emoji faces for emphasis. Just in case, you know, the exclamation marks didn’t do the trick.	0
