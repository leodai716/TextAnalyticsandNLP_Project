JAN1	Migrant crossings: This Dad’s Army approach won’t secure our coast	Retaking control of our borders was one of the key factors that led so many Britons to vote for Brexit. So it must be a source of profound concern for Brexit campaigners that, when faced with their first major migrant crisis since the referendum, the British authorities have been reduced to adopting an approach more suited to Dad’s Army. It is not as though the appearance of migrant boats in the Channel is some new phenomenon that has suddenly arisen while ministers were enjoying the festive break. For the better part of a decade, thousands of refugees from areas of the globe afflicted by poverty and conflict have been congregating on the northern coast of France in the hope of making a better life for themselves in Britain. Previous efforts to prevent this desperate tide of humanity from sweeping into Britain have concentrated on improving the security arrangements around key French ports such as Calais, where the primary focus of the occupants of the various migrant camps established around the town’s perimeter was to gain illegal entry to Britain by clambering on to the Eurostar or British-bound lorries.
JAN1	Reasons to be optimistic after a tough year for tech	To say the least, 2018 has been a rocky year for the technology industry. Not long ago, it was almost universally accepted that new innovations would improve society, create enormous economic opportunities and cut down barriers. Now, it seems harder to be optimistic about technology than at any time in recent history. The rise of fake news and the use of the internet as a tool to spread division, the threats of mass surveillance and privacy violations, and fears that artificial intelligence will take our jobs or worse mean more people are increasingly sceptical of technology-induced change. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley’s giants have suffered a market crash, simmering protest and the growing threat of regulation. The conversation around tech in 2018 has been concerned with how to rein it in, rather than support it. 
JAN1	Calorie counts on menus? There’s an easier way to shrink our waistlines	Public Health England, a quango to place fear in the heart of any innocent diner, wants to limit the calorie count of foods sold in supermarkets and restaurants. The draft proposals are floating joylessly around Whitehall, demanding a maximum of a very prescriptive 544 calories per “convenience meal” (that means sandwich or ready meal to us), and 1,040 calories per pizza. It places caps on onion bhajis and coleslaw; on dishes of vegetables; on pasta sauces; possibly on your own saliva. The proposals run to over 100 pages – now that is a mouthful – and amount to a manifesto for people who do not know how to eat. It is, essentially, a manifesto for dogs, in which you are the dog, and Public Health England is your careful owner.
JAN1	Jeremy Corbyn must trust his instincts and back a no-deal Brexit	Since 17.4 million people voted to Leave the European Union in 2016 the Government has wasted time indulging in feeble negotiations. These have eventually yielded a Withdrawal Agreement that wouldn’t actually withdraw us from very much. Now, though, a window of opportunity is opening up for the UK. Beyond the smokescreen of confusion within our majority Remain Parliament, a straightforward path to economic development, political stability and true national sovereignty has emerged. If the Government won’t take it, then it is a golden opportunity for the Labour Party. Jeremy Corbyn should take the lead by calling for the UK to leave the entanglements of the Brussels bureaucracy by discarding Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement and opting instead for what is sometimes referred to as a “no deal Brexit”, in other words life within the simpler and more accommodating framework of the World Trade Organisation.
JAN1	Let 2019 be the year Brexiteers help Britain turn the tide of history and rediscover true democracy	Brexit will take place on March 29 of this year. Assuming there is no delay, everything will change. We’ll go from endlessly debating whether or not we should leave the EU to discussing what kind of country we’ll be outside of it – and, accepting all the mammoth administrative challenges, my deepest hope is that we don’t waste this golden opportunity. Here is a once-in-a-century chance to revive our national democracy. Brexit has highlighted two very different approaches to liberty. Many Remainers see freedom in universal terms, existing outside national borders. It’s just as wrong to call them anti-liberty as it is to call them anti-patriotic: for them, the EU extends the freedom to move and to trade, while the rights of the individual are protected by treaties and courts. There’s a bit of “ends justify the means” about this philosophy, in so far as Remainers aren’t too bothered who runs the show as long as the outcome is enlightened and liberal. How often have we heard that the EU, for all its faults, keeps our waters clean and protects workers’ rights? Or how often have we been told that British voters can’t be trusted – particularly the older or less educated ones – or that, by voting for Brexit, these people threatened the rights of others?
JAN1	From fishing to migrants, the integrity of our borders requires proper maritime patrols	Throughout the debate on Britain’s future after Brexit, the fate of one industry has acquired almost totemic status: fishing. The sense that the communities which once sustained healthy fleets were sold out by the operation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) down the years fuelled anti-EU sentiment in many coastal towns. Some on the Remain side have questioned the exaggerated importance given to fishing since fewer than 12,000 people are employed on the boats themselves and the industry contributes about £420 million to GDP, less than half a per cent of the UK total. But this is a circular argument since the CFP is one reason why it is so tiny. It is impossible to say how big the industry would be had the UK been in control of its own waters this past 45 years but it would surely be far more robust than it is today. Moreover, for a maritime nation fishing has a broader social, cultural and historic importance. Whole communities that once relied on fishing have been wrecked by the predations of the CFP. The overly centralised, top-down management so beloved of Brussels has been a disaster for many of them. One policy in particular came to exemplify the madness: the requirement to throw away undersized fish or fish greater than a vessel’s quota. This has been replaced from today with a new catch-all approach whereby trawlers have an obligation to land all fish in an attempt to eradicate waste and encourage more targeted fishing.
JAN1	The withdrawal of America from global politics will change the world. We must be ready	One hundred years ago, the first New Year’s Eve following the end of the Great War provided a moment of hope after a period of unremitting misery for much of the world. The conflict had claimed millions of lives, as did the Spanish flu accompanying its conclusion. The dawn of 1919 saw a concerted international effort to learn the lessons of the disaster and ensure it did not happen again. The US president Woodrow Wilson was in Europe to attend the peace conference in Paris at which he hoped to sign up the combatants to his 14 points for a democratic future. The peace settlements, however, would sow the seeds of an even worse conflict just 30 years later. Many of the decisions taken then would reverberate through Europe until the turn of this century in the Balkans, and continue to do so to this day in the Middle East. In her history of the conference, Peacemakers, Margaret Macmillan writes that the participants “felt they had done their best but they had no illusions that they had solved the world’s problems”. She added; “They grappled with huge and difficult questions. How can the irrational passions of nationalism or religion be contained before they do more damage? How can we outlaw war? We are still asking those questions”.
JAN1	The Government must take a new direction in 2019	A lot happened in 2018, but little was resolved: as 2019 dawns, time is running out when it comes to Brexit. Theresa May originally intended the House of Commons to vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement in December. After reading the mood of MPs, she delayed their verdict and went back to the Eurocrats for concessions. They did not budge an inch. Now the Commons is scheduled to vote in the week of January 14 and nothing has changed; the backstop, the most malignant part of the agreement, is still in place. So why would MPs vote for something they rejected in 2018 that will be exactly the same in 2019? This Government, far from being proactive or visionary, has often relied on others to panic and fold. It has encouraged the idea that a no‑deal Brexit would be the end of the world (it certainly would be traumatic and every avenue should be explored to avoid it) and hopes that the threat of Britain running out of time and falling off the cliff edge will force either the Commons or Brussels to blink. In fact, preparations to mitigate the no-deal impact are under way, just without any fanfare. An article published in yesterday’s Telegraph by an anonymous civil servant revealed that there are “hundreds” of plans “waiting for the green light from ministers to be made public”, as well as “bilateral ‘managed WTO’ agreements on the horizon”. It’s time the Government rolled out a well-publicised Project Ready, not only to coordinate this operation but to bolster public confidence.
JAN1	Letters: The EU’s agricultural policy has driven environmental destruction	SIR – The RSPB and others (Letters, December 31) claim that a “green Brexit” depends on continued cooperation with the EU. The opposite could be argued, probably with greater evidence. Most biodiversity loss in Europe is from the way we farm. Most EU spending is on the Common Agricultural Policy, which has contributed to unsustainable farming. The Common Agricultural Policy is “among the most powerful drivers of environmental destruction in the northern hemisphere”, as George Monbiot put it in October. The RSPB and its fellow pressure-groups think it easier to continue with the status quo, which has failed to deliver their objectives in the past.
JAN1	Letters: A dental crisis that could have been prevented	SIR – The number-one medical reason for young children to be hospitalised remains rotten teeth. Increasing numbers have every single tooth extracted, leaving only gums. Dentists are frustrated that NHS dental contracts continue to be target-based. They should be based on people and on prevention of dental disease. Pilot contract trials have been run in the past year as before. But even where these have failed, discredited targets are retained.
JAN2	By preparing for no deal properly, we will get the good Brexit democracy demands of us	We are told that another decisive moment looms, in the form of the forthcoming Commons vote on the proposed Withdrawal Agreement. Of course, we have been here before. We have seen many supposedly decisive moments since the 2016 referendum: triggering Article 50, passing the EU Withdrawal Act, the December meaningful vote that never was, to name but a few. Before we whip ourselves into another frenzy, perhaps it is time to take stock? I have always said that the EU would push and push until finally we reach a resolution at the eleventh hour. Recent events only reinforce my analysis. Indeed, anybody who really understands how negotiations work understands that time is our friend.
JAN2	The Conservatives should be challenging the liberal consensus, not perpetuating it	This year, we will reach the midpoint of this parliament. We will know the terms on which Britain will leave the EU, if the plot to stop Brexit fails. And we might, despite Theresa May appearing to have more lives than a cat, have a new prime minister. We don’t yet know whether the Tories can unite around a domestic policy programme, and present a vision of how they will make Britain a better, fairer and more prosperous country. While getting the right Brexit deal is vital to this bigger picture, the Conservatives need to rediscover their domestic purpose. As they do so, they must ignore siren calls. Over Christmas, George Osborne warned that the party is heading for opposition unless it embraces “socially liberal, pro-business, internationalist” policies. By this, he means high immigration, deregulation, and associate membership of the European Union.
JAN2	Your alternative resolutions for a guilt-free 2019	Yes we are three days into January, otherwise known as Dry January, Back To The Gym Jan, Giving Up Bad Stuff and Taking Up Good Stuff Janvier. This was always the month of self improving resolutions, and now it’s basically compulsory. So, if you happen to be a resolution denier - if you don’t see why you should be forced into living like Mark Wahlberg just because it’s the start of a new year - your best bet is to go with some ‘alternative’ resolutions, less New Year New You more whatever amuses you. Here are some I prepared earlier: ...or do anything, throughout the year, that qualifies as ‘Lemming ’. (Lemming is the modern habit of adopting something simply because everyone else is). This year Lemming things we deliberately will not be doing, include: banging on about how good Olivia Colman is in The Favourite. Banging on about Ottolenghi Simple (but never actually opening Ottolenghi Simple). Banging on about how much we are looking forward to the new Big Little Lies/Fleabag (generally behaving like the person who has read and memorised the year’s cultural round up). This is not an anti-egg policy, this is an attempt to reverse some wasteful habits, one of which is buying eggs as a back up, so we can always have scrambled eggs, and then never getting around to having scrambled eggs. Other habits in this vein include: stockpiling bubblewrap, just in case, and falling for the 3 for 2 litre bottles of conditioner offer. 
JAN2	The Government is treating forced marriage victims like drunk holidaymakers	Imagine that you are 18-years-old, you go to a normal school, hang out with your mates, watch Youtube eyeliner tutorials, before Whatsapping images of your failed attempts to your girlfriends accompanied by the face palm emoji. Now imagine being told that you must travel abroad with a member of your family. When you arrive you are going to marry a man you have never met, then stay in a country you do not know, while your family return home. You must now live there permanently, or wait until your husband can qualify to return to the UK with you - maybe by the time you are pregnant, or have your first child. Your new husband’s family have taken your passport away, until they know you’re trapped.
JAN2	Who's running Britain - our woolly-headed government or the pudding tax-pushing quangos?	Politicians need to take back control of their own policies  A familiar pattern is emerging. We wake up to find Public Health England (PHE) announcing a new plan to meddle with the food supply and, within minutes, Conservative MPs have taken to Twitter to condemn it. Last week, The Telegraph got a sneak preview of the calorie caps that PHE expects chefs and food companies to abide by in a few months time. Not in my name, said a dozen MPs and at least one minister on social media. Nigel Adams MP, for example, tweeted: "Dear @PHE_uk if I wanted to live under an authoritarian regime, I’d move to Bahrain, Saudi, Venezuela or vote for @jeremycorbyn." Today, it was the prospect of a "pudding tax", which PHE’s chief nutritionist, Alison Tedstone, believes to be "the obvious place to start" if the food industry doesn’t do enough to cut the sugar content of cakes, biscuits and sweet snacks. To which Liz Truss, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, responded on Twitter: "I don't support measures that put up the cost of living for people, especially on low incomes." Conor Burns MP added his tuppence, writing: "Sadly too many in authority are in thrall to Jamie Oliver and seem star struck."
JAN2	Nanny taxes on unhealthy food don't work, the Government must steer clear	The new year is traditionally a time for an outbreak of abstemiousness that is rarely sustained save by the most self-disciplined. Diets abound and a dry January is encouraged, even though scientists say it is of little or no benefit to moderate drinkers. This month, many are proposing to go vegan, which is a lifestyle they are entitled to adopt, provided they do not seek to impose it on the rest of us. But these are matters of individual choice and always have been, until now. The Government thinks it has a direct role to play in forcing us to make the “correct” culinary choices. Public Health England (PHE) has a five-year target to cut sugar by 20 per cent in a range of products, from cakes and confectionery to yogurts and cereals. Last week, The Daily Telegraph revealed new calorie caps drawn up by PHE, which would control the content in thousands of meals sold by restaurants and supermarkets.
JAN2	Railways need more competition, not less	Millions of commuters will end their Christmas break and return to work today to face yet another increase in ticket prices. Regulated fares, which cover 45  per cent of the total and are based on last July’s inflation figures, have risen by 3.1 per cent, while some set outside the scheme, such as off-peak leisure tickets, will go up by even even more. Over the past 10 years, because wages failed to keep pace with price rises, rail fares became an added burden on hard-pressed travellers, and commuters in particular, since they have little option other than to use the railways.  But there are straws in the wind. After a long period of growth in passenger numbers, these declined in 2017 as more people worked at home, put off travelling by high fares. Season ticket sales among commuters fell steeply, casting fresh doubt on the viability of some struggling franchises. It is not yet clear whether this trend has continued, but previous assumptions that higher costs would not deter passenger growth need to be revisited.

JAN3	Our children understand that they have to be world-beaters - but do we?	My eldest son turned 11 last week and this morning he will receive a present: being taken by his father to sit an 11+ exam. It’s a lousy way to celebrate. Growing up in Scotland, I had heard tales about these exams inflicted by the English upon their offspring. How children are taken off to be branded, pass or fail, at this tender age. A kind of educational barbarism that a more enlightened society (Scotland, for example) would not inflict on its young. Yet here I am, going native, dragging my son to an exam hall to answer questions that I’d struggle to answer myself. The strange thing is that he doesn’t seem to mind. His classmates, at our local state primary, have been preparing for similar exams and he’d be put out if he wasn’t joining them. I might be getting stressed about all this, but he seems quite relaxed. His position is logical: we are looking at a range of good schools, including an excellent local comprehensive. But I’m terrified at the tests posed by the selective schools, state and private. For example: write a formula to deduce what time it is when Big Ben’s two hands are 180 degrees apart, after 10pm. Where to start? And why should an 11-year-old be expected to do this? Alex sees it differently: others in his class will be tackling this question, so he’d like to as well.
JAN3	Why are Iranians willing to risk their lives fleeing France for Britain?	Given the reaction in some quarters, over the past few weeks it’s at times felt as if no democracy has faced such a Persian threat since ancient Athens fought the battle of Marathon. Obviously the situation on the Channel is serious and we shouldn’t be complacent about border security. But the number of illegal migrants, purportedly Iranians, attempting to sail across to the UK has been small – and far lower than the huge numbers of legal migrants that arrive from the EU each year over which we have no control. There has been another reaction, however: incredulity. To a certain type of Remainer, it is unimaginable that anyone would seek to cross the Channel to make their way to Britain. And yet here they are, hundreds of people trying to escape from France. Migration was such a big issue in the referendum because our society’s flexibility and our economy’s strength have made us a magnet. Macron talks about getting France “on the move”, but its brutal level of youth unemployment is a reflection of the bureaucratic blocks to enterprise and job creation that have long hindered growth. 
JAN3	Don't fear Divorce Day - I've discovered the secret to a happy marriage	Thank Rudolph that’s over. The eating, the drinking, the slightly manic socialising have finally drawn to a close now that January is in full swing. Hurrah! And as your diary echoes empty as a politician’s promise and tumbleweeds drift across the barren tundra of your weekends – what a relief – comes the forensic analysis of why your marriage is so rubbish compared to your friends’. There they were at every gathering, touching each other on the arm, solicitously enquiring about drinks and exchanging stupid secret smiles. They looked irritatingly loved-up.
JAN3	January is a time of promise - so what's with the national self-flagellation?	Yes, it's cold, but self-imposed sadness gets us nowhere We are but four days into the first month of the year, and the country is already struck down with despair. Even the arrival of Greggs’s vegan sausage roll has prompted a national row. January presents its challenges, of that there is no doubt: returning to work with belt buckles and bank balances strained from December’s largesse, the temperature dropping at a rate of knots. But I find it curious that this month is so often viewed as 31 days of collective gloom – as if the festive goodwill of the week prior is only permitted if we spend three times as long wringing our hands over the ones that follow.
JAN3	Sorry Mr Gove, but Theresa May's Brexit deal traps Britain in the EU's failing museum of farming	Consumed by an overarching desire for bureaucratic uniformity, the Common Agricultural Policy is consigning the EU to become the Museum of World Farming. Its hostility to new technology, driven by powerful but misguided campaign groups, is causing European research to stagnate and agricultural yields to suffer. France, for example, is missing out on over 4.5 tonnes per hectare in its maize yield compared to the US, amounting to a total loss of over 6 million tonnes. That crop could be worth an extra £600 million, or France could free up half a million hectares for wildlife, recreation, or forestry. Brexit should, therefore, represent a wonderful opportunity to boost productivity outside this failing model. We should embrace the opportunities of innovation, offering farmers the greatest freedom to grow their businesses and consumers the greatest choice of products, while improving the natural environment. We should balance the precautionary principle – currently interpreted in the most severely prescriptive manner by the EU – with a requirement to uphold the innovation principle. 
JAN3	There's nothing wrong with ambition provided ministers are putting the country first	The Christmas holidays are traditionally a quiet time politically, and they have been once again even on the verge of an imminent climacteric in the great Brexit drama. With less than 90 days remaining to the date of the UK’s departure from the EU, uncertainty continues over the method by which it will be done, or even whether it will be done at all. Until MPs return to the Commons next week to begin the final countdown to the meaningful vote on Theresa May’s deal with the EU, no-one will know for sure if the Prime Minister has managed to extract concessions from Brussels that will secure her an unlikely victory. She pulled the vote before Christmas anticipating a sizeable defeat; nothing has happened since to suggest a different outcome. But the festive interregnum has afforded potential successors to Mrs May an opportunity to strut their stuff. In particular, Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, has been to the fore trying to develop a coherent response to the arrival of illegal immigrants by boat in Kent.

JAN3	Letters: Passengers are bottom priority on Britain’s overpriced railways	SIR – You report that over the past eight years average train fares have risen nearly three times faster than wages. It’s worth comparing that with train drivers’ wages, which have more than quadrupled in the 20 years since taxpayer-subsidised privatisation. They (and their families) also get free or discounted rail travel. Then there are the huge salaries and bonuses at the top – mainly awarded, it would seem, for failure. Taxpayers are being taken for one hell of a train ride.
JAN3	Letters: The EU’s agricultural policy has driven environmental destruction	SIR – The RSPB and others (Letters, December 31) claim that a “green Brexit” depends on continued cooperation with the EU. The opposite could be argued, probably with greater evidence. Most biodiversity loss in Europe is from the way we farm.

JAN4	Remainers are wrong to think the world hates Britain for seeking independence	Neil MacGregor, OM, is not only a great museum director, but also – in as much as British culture tolerates such a thing – a great public intellectual. When he ran the National Gallery, he showed us on television how Christian art saw salvation. When he directed the British Museum, he explained the world in 100 objects. Early this century, for this newspaper, I got him to write a beautiful part-work about the greatest paintings in British public collections. In all his expositions, he has a genius for using the particular to explain the general. Nowadays, MacGregor lives in Berlin. From that vantage point, he looks back at his own country. Hence his series, which ran every day on BBC Radio 4 this week, called As Others See Us. On each day, MacGregor visited a single country – starting with Germany, continuing through Egypt, Nigeria and Canada, and ending up yesterday with India. In each, he chose three thinkers, writers, political or business leaders, and asked them to tell him how they regard Britain today. I found most of what they had to say fascinating – full of nuance, combining, as MacGregor himself put it, “affection and exasperation”. The positive British characteristics which came through most strongly were parliamentary democracy, our monarchy, language and literature, eccentricity, and the notion that London, because of its openness, is, in some sense, the capital of the world – “the place where all things were possible”.
JAN4	As time goes on, more people are waking up to the benefits of a 'mitigated no deal'	On Wednesday next week, with just 79 days before Brexit is due, MPs will commence the debate on whether to accept Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement.The crucial vote will come the following week. As we go through the division lobbies, MPs will have in mind how their own constituents voted in the referendum. Almost 60 per cent of mine supported Brexit . But Tory MPs, particularly those with an eye on the leadership, will reflect on another poll, too. This week, YouGov found that 57 per cent of Conservative Party members would prefer no deal, and only 23 per cent Mrs May’s deal. Assuming that the Prime Minister does not secure major concessions from the EU, it seems unlikely therefore that my colleagues will have had a sudden change of heart in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement by the time of the vote. If anything, opinion could be shifting the other way. A no-deal exit is beginning to look a lot more attractive.
JAN4	Stonehenge's ancient history raises very modern questions about our identity	Around Stonehenge, there are barrows, holes and trenches. For 10,000 years before the huge stone circle went up, visitors seem to have been burning offerings and burying their dead nearby. As the sign at the site entrance surmises: “It is possible that this area retained some significance for our ancestors over many thousands of years.” Unfortunately, this modest conclusion about “our” ancestors is actually incorrect. According to a genetic paper published in 2017, within two centuries of completing their crowning achievement on Salisbury Plain, 90 per cent of Britain’s megalith-builders were replaced by an invading population. Stonehenge was not “our ancestors’” great triumph, but another people’s last hurrah. When I took an American visitor to admire the monument over the New Year, however, the official narrative gave a rather garbled picture. The English Heritage guidebook referred to new arrivals from Europe coming to visit the “truly international monument” and bringing with them a culture that was “eagerly taken up by the local population”. In fact, the genetics suggest that the spread of this new culture, far from being eagerly taken up by the existing population, coincided with its dramatic decline.
JAN4	It's time to see social media for what it is - an addiction as dangerous as tobacco	By the time we are half way through the roaring twenties, I predict that we will look back on the dying days of the current millennium’s teenage years with something approaching horror and disbelief. We will barely be able to comprehend how we existed during a period of such unregulated danger; we will view the last decade as a sort of modern day Wild West, complete with 21st century cowboys, gunslingers and outlaws.  Not sure what I am talking about? Then cast your mind back to last week, to the period between Christmas and New Year, when you had to wrestle young family members off their smart phones so that you could force them to engage in proper conversations with the living, breathing human beings next to them. Think about the first thing you did this morning. Did you go to the loo, say good morning to your other half, make yourself a cup of tea? Or did you check your phone for messages, and your Twitter feed for the latest news on Brexit? Social media and technology – and the software and devices we access them on – have become a part of life we feel we can no longer live without. There is no longer any point in talking about the rise of the machines: the machines have already risen, and they dominate our lives. If I sound like a fear-mongering survivalist, prepping for the end of days, I don’t mean to – because I am just as hopelessly addicted to my phone as anyone else, my mood easily crushed or elevated by the amount of likes I get when I post a photo on Instagram.
JAN4	Hit-and-run day-trippers are killing Venice – and a €10 tourist tax won’t save it	By noon on the third day of 2019 – a sunny but finger-freezing day in the lowest of the low season – Venice’s inhabitants were outnumbered by visitors, though not (by Venetian standards) by much. Around 54,000 under-pressure locals shared their city with just over 62,000 incomers, according to estimates from the Venice Dashboard tourist movements monitor. And that, for La Serenissima, is a ‘quiet’ day. By nightfall, the scenario had changed radically. The day-tripping hordes had left, and fewer than 17,000 visitors stayed on to bed down in the city. They may have sipped a spritz or two in a bacaro, eaten locally caught fish in a cosy restaurant and experienced the glory of crisp, empty, endlessly atmospheric winter Venice.  They will also have paid between €2 and €5 per night (on top of their room rate) for the honour of staying in this gem of the Adriatic: an obligatory tourist tax collected by hotels and rental property owners that has been pushing up the cost of a Venice stay for years. 
JAN4	Why our universities are challenged	It is hard to justify a university vice-chancellor being paid more than the Prime Minister – is the job really harder that negotiating Brexit? – and yet Sir Steve Smith of Exeter University will enjoy a final pay and bonus package of up to £830,000. It’s a huge sum, even in a sector that is very generous to those at the top. Sir David Eastwood (Birmingham University) made £444,000 last year; Sir Christopher Snowden (University of Southampton), £436,000; and Professor Alice Gast (Imperial College, London), £433,000. The universities are beginning to resemble the banks shortly before the credit crunch. They may have agreed to a voluntary code on top salaries, but are still throwing absurd sums at executives just as some institutions (many of which are acting increasingly like big business) become dangerously over-leveraged. Universities’ debts have risen over the past year to £10.8 billion, with some of the leaps found where vice-chancellors are paid the most (Southampton and Imperial more than doubled borrowing in the last year). Administrators would doubtless argue that they have to spend to compete in the global market, to attract the very best in students and research. Nevertheless, the time may come when some universities go bust like the banks or the coal industry before them, their worst practices having been encouraged by governments that offered protection regardless of quality. Exeter actually fell out of the UK top 10 in 2014, and while it remains a very fine institution, the “too big to fail” philosophy is being seriously tested at some universities. If any place of learning does finally collapse, it will be students and low-paid academics who suffer the most.
JAN4	Describing obesity as a "disease" will make it harder to tackle	Yes, obesity is a serious problem, but is it accurate to call it a disease? Professor Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), insists that it is not “a lifestyle choice” shaped by greed but “a disease caused by health inequalities, genetic influences and social factors”.  All those things undoubtedly make a difference, but isn’t an individual’s refusal to go for the odd walk or cut out biscuits also a matter of individual will? Using the word “disease” implies that willpower is some nasty Right-wing illusion, in which case one can hardly expect the afflicted to exercise it – or, indeed, to exercise at all. Victim cultures generate victims. It might be well-meaning to tell someone they shouldn’t be ashamed of obesity because it’s not their fault, but if this affirms helplessness then the patient is unlikely to do what’s needed to turn things around and, in the long-run, lots of people will only get sicker.
JAN4	Not everyone is opposed to a no-deal Brexit. A lot of Tories are for it	We are constantly told that a no-deal Brexit is a doomsday scenario so obviously bad for Britain that only an ideological fringe wants it and everyone else is opposed to it. This is just not true. According to a new poll, 76 per cent of Tory members believe the risks of a no-deal Brexit are exaggerated and 57 per cent think it would be better than Theresa May’s plan. The 57 per cent would likely argue that, while a no-deal outcome carries profound risks and could be traumatic in the short-term, this would be mitigated by better, bolder planning and real economic reform. No-deal preparations are under way, but if there is an air of panic then it is because they have come so late and are motivated by the goal of scaring MPs into backing Mrs May’s deal. The 57 per cent would probably argue that this is ironic given that Mrs May’s deal also contains risks: Britain could find itself locked into the backstop, the country divided down the Irish Sea and hampered in its ability to make new trade deals. Their numbers do not make the 57 per cent necessarily right, but the size of the preference for no deal does at least indicate that there is intelligent opinion for it – a constituency that believes the Brexit vote was about taking a risk to secure proper independence, and that there are future rewards to reap if the UK withdraws properly. The question is why the constituency for a no-deal outcome isn’t better represented in Parliament. This leads us back to the old problem that Brexit changed politics without really changing the politicians, leaving in place an enormous bias within Parliament either for Remain or a Leave that is as close to Remain as possible.
JAN4	Letters: The urgent Brexit danger is not a lack of ferries but of customs agents	SIR – The Government wishes to increase the vessels operating from continental Europe to the UK to alleviate the queues of trucks at UK and continental roll-on roll-off ports. Our view is very much that there are adequate ferry and train services for the cargo transiting these ports. The principal problem, given a no-deal Brexit , will be the lack of customs clearance facilities and agents. At present, all cargo moved in either direction requires transit documentation authorised by the relevant customs authority.
JAN4	Letters: Javid is right to distinguish between economic migrants and refugees	SIR – I agree with Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, and suspect that few of the migrants currently crossing the English Channel to reach Dover are genuinely seeking asylum. They will have passed through at least two safe countries. The French have little incentive to prevent these economic migrants leaving their shores to gain the more generous benefits offered by Britain. We must harden our stance. Anyone arriving from France, where they will have had the chance to claim asylum, must be returned there immediately. Clifford Baxter Wareham, Dorset
JAN5	Theresa May's monstrous Brexit deal would leave Britain at the mercy of its competitors	In the early Thirties, at a time of great historic change, Sir Winston Churchill demanded in the House of Commons: “Tell the truth to the British people. They are a tough people, a robust people.” Now, as then, it is time for straight talking. In the swirling kaleidoscope of Brexit, with its stream of Fake News, Project Fear and BBC bias, what is the bottom line? First, there is no going back. The opening words of the Withdrawal Act passed in June state in black and white that the European Communities Act 1972 is repealed on exit day, March 29 2019. Every EU law and treaty, including the customs union and the single market, then ceases to apply to the UK. The Withdrawal Act is the anchor of the referendum – those who imagine that this Act will be repealed are living in cloud-cuckoo land. The frothing Reversers know this, as do the Second Referendumites promoting a “People’s Vote”. How often do they have to be told that we had one in June 2016? It was enacted by six-to-one in the Commons by most of those now trying to unravel it and every Conservative stood by it in our manifesto.
JAN5	The Conservatives' mission must be to give control back to the people from the state	"Take Back Control” was the Brexit clarion call. Politicians must heed the demand. 2019 will see us return many powers from Brussels to Westminster. But this year we should honour that command domestically, too. People won’t want powers being handed back from bureaucrats in Brussels to be given to bureaucrats in Britain. Our aim should be to give the British people greater control of their lives in all regards. In practical terms, that requires a three-pronged agenda: combatting Jeremy Corbyn’s ideas for a state-on-steroids; delivering a growing economy; and finding more areas in which we can transfer powers from the government to the people. The stakes are high. Commentators, riffing off shadow chancellor John McDonnell, talk about the turn against free markets. In the abstract, capitalism is unpopular. But free markets are an expression of free will. As the Sunday Telegraph’s bold Campaign for Capitalism has highlighted, markets allow people to make their own choices, and to own their futures, rather than be told what to do by a distant authority.
JAN5	Ignoring the difference between legal and illegal immigration penalises migrants who play by the rules	I was 11 years old the first time our home in Bangladesh was bombed by Islamic fundamentalists. Policemen – who had escorted the fanatics shouting “death to kafirs (infidels)” as they marched up to our home – stood by and watched. It was evident that they had the government’s blessing and that the attack would be carried out not only with complete impunity but with the active encouragement of the very people whose job it was to protect law-abiding citizens like my parents. If the hurled fire bombs failed to burn down the bungalow along with its inhabitants, and the boulders showered at it failed to break down the doors, then that would be down to sheer luck. The administration in charge wasn’t going to do a thing to stop a family from being lynched or burned alive. But luck did favour us. We survived that day. It transpired that, in the aftermath of the bombing, some people had taken photographs of our visibly damaged home and presented the pictures as evidence of persecution against themselves in order to successfully gain asylum in the West. In pre-Google Earth days, it would’ve been fairly easy to get away with.
JAN5	I know how frightening it is to have a stalker	For pretty much my entire twenties, I refused to give out my mobile number to men. That sounds awful, doesn’t it? Arrogant. But the truth is that women are twice as likely to be stalked, and their stalkers are almost exclusively male. I wasn’t going to risk it again. Really, I was one of the lucky ones. My experience of being stalked, at university, never turned ugly. It began after I had given my number to a male acquaintance – a well-known figure around campus, good-looking and someone friendly with my then-boyfriend. A group of us were at the student bar and he asked for it. What was the harm?
JAN5	Everything and everyone must be sacrificed in Downing Street's selfish quest to keep Mrs May as PM	Here is the story so far in the Tory New Year leadership pantomime. First act: a small but significant movement of migrants across the Channel causes the Home Secretary (a strong contender to replace Theresa May) to be hauled back from his holiday abroad – almost certainly as a consequence of a deliberately embarrassing briefing by Downing Street on the luxurious nature of his foreign accommodation. On arrival at the scene in Kent, Sajid Javid makes a statement with which about 90 per cent of the population (and probably 100 per cent of Tory supporters) would agree: that said migrants are unlikely to be legitimate asylum seekers or they might have claimed sanctuary in France. He gets clobbered. Not just by Labour – who are largely irrelevant – but by Conservatives, almost certainly with the encouragement of Downing Street, who find fault with his suggestion that adding more patrol vessels to the Kent coast would be a mistake. He reverses that decision. Then he gets clobbered for doing a u-turn. Then the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, who, outlandishly enough, has leadership ambitions too, adds to the farrago by offering naval vessels to assist with the coastal patrols. So he gets clobbered.
JAN5	Let’s turn Project Fear into Project Ready	The Brexit dynamic has changed since the Prime Minister hunkered down for Christmas, but not in the way she might have wanted. The goal was presumably to let fear of a no deal exit do its work and win the critics over to her deal. If only the DUP would give up some of its objections to the backstop; if only the EU would put a time-limit on it. And surely even the hardest Brexiteer wouldn’t want Britain to crash out on March 29? This gamble was a miscalculation befitting a Prime Minister who has tended to see Brexit as a problem to be solved rather than an opportunity to be grasped. The DUP cannot compromise on the constitution; the Europeans feel they’ve gone far enough already; and the Leavers are more worried about the UK becoming a vassal of Brussels than they are of any queues at Dover. Some of them have been fighting the EU for more than 40 years and they won’t back down now. So, it’s difficult to see anyone returning from Christmas reconciled to Mrs May’s deal. On the contrary, it is the no-deal outcome that has become surprisingly normalised. The country is getting ready for it, with stockpiling, public awareness campaigns, new ferry routes, and more. The Government clearly wants us to be alarmed, and there is no denying that leaving without a Withdrawal Agreement might be painful. But the country has become cynical about fear-mongering (which proved hopelessly inaccurate during the referendum) and the more no-deal planning is talked about, the more it seems simply practical and right. In fact, it should have been part of the Government’s negotiating strategy from the very beginning.

JAN5	Letters: A no-deal Brexit would be truer to the vote than May’s disastrous plan	SIR – Liam Fox is 100 per cent correct that Parliament cannot now, with any honour, renege on the result of the EU referendum. However, he is 100 per cent wrong in saying that Brexit will only be certain if the House of Commons backs Theresa May’s deal in this month’s meaningful vote. As Mrs May has failed to achieve a satisfactory compromise with the EU, a full Brexit can only be achieved by our walking away without a deal. Michael Allisstone Chichester, West Sussex

JAN6	The British people won't be scared into backing a woeful Brexit deal nobody voted for	Time and again the Brexit debate turns into a tribute to the wisdom of the British people – and their instinctive ability to sort fact from nonsense. Over the last few weeks, they have been bombarded with warnings of what could happen to this country in the event of a “no-deal Brexit” – otherwise known as coming out on World Trade terms. Whether prompted by No 10 or not, establishment figures have taken to the airwaves to warn of the perils of rejecting Theresa May’s lamentable Withdrawal Agreement; and we now have a cumulative forecast that is downright apocalyptic. In no particular order, it seems that Britain will run out of Mars bars and drinking water and ornamental horticulturists. There will be a desperate shortage of cheese and electricity and vital medicines such as Viagra. Our restaurants will lack cleaning staff. And tea. And carrots. Our planes will be grounded – and if they do fly, our holidays will rocket in price. The public will be at greater risk from paedophiles and house prices will fall by 35 per cent, probably overnight. The threat to British chocolate supplies will endanger every Easter egg hunt in the land and – to judge by his tone – cause the Archbishop of Canterbury to cancel the festival of the Resurrection for the first time since Christianity was brought to these islands.
JAN6	A no-deal Brexit will strengthen the Special Relationship, the beating heart of the free world	America’s plain-spoken and highly effective ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, recently spelt out what US policymakers widely believe. He told the BBC that the prospects for a “quick, massive bilateral trade deal” between the US and the UK are bleak under Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement. He also said that the UK is “in need of leadership” over Brexit. He is absolutely right. Mr Johnson is a stalwart backer of Brexit, and his frequent statements in support of Britain’s exit from the EU reflect the overwhelmingly pro-Brexit optimism of US leaders. But the Trump presidency understands that Mrs May’s hugely flawed exit deal could tie Britain indefinitely to the EU customs union, making a future trade agreement between the world’s largest and fifth largest economies impossible. President Trump has mocked the May proposal as “a great deal for the EU”. In contrast, from the perspective of many in Washington, a “no-deal” Brexit would be a great opportunity for Britain. I have yet to meet a senior US government official who thinks such a course of action would be disastrous for the UK.
JAN6	A curious tale of what Neville Chamberlain knew about Hitler's evil intentions at Munich	One political story I was told over the festive season was so startling that I cannot resist passing it on, even though it dates back 80 years. Few moments in our history have been looked back on as more humiliating than when, in 1938, Neville Chamberlain flew back from Munich, having supposedly been duped by Hitler into thinking that he had secured “peace for our time”. As we know, a year later came war. Chamberlain was castigated for having been a craven appeaser and, after eight more unhappy months, was forced ignominiously to resign, to be succeeded by Winston Churchill. My friend Greg Lance-Watkins recalled how, in 1967, as a young officer cadet at Sandhurst, he boarded a packed train from London to Inverness, on which the only unoccupied seat was in the dining car. Seeing his uniform, the chap in the seat opposite invited him to sit down, and Greg recognised him as the former prime minister Alec Douglas-Home.
JAN6	Childhood obesity is not 'spiralling', and four other inconvenient facts for the anti-sugar zealots	We are now in the sixth year of the Great Sugar Panic and the joke is starting to wear thin. The sugar tax has ruined some of our favourite drinks, Public Health England is threatening us with calorie caps, and a pudding tax now seems to be on the cards. All this and more is being justified on the pretext that there is a spiralling epidemic of childhood obesity caused by spiralling levels of sugar consumption. It is nonsense, and it has to stop. Here are five inconvenient facts. All the evidence indicates that per capita consumption of sugar peaked in Britain in the Sixties at around 45 kilograms per year. We currently consume fewer than 35 kilograms per year. We are eating less sugar than we did in the late 19th century, let alone the late 20th century.
JAN6	Britain must rediscover its confidence, and lead the world it is responsible for creating	For centuries, Great Britain has guided the globe. Now, the world needs us to do so again. We must stop apologising for the past, and start advancing again as a free nation at home and abroad. The self-flagellation over Brexit and begging for European acceptance is unbecoming of this great country. Britishness is about values, ideas, history and an attitude, not skin colour. It is time to be proud of Britain again. Together. In recent months, I have visited the US, India, Singapore, Australia, Israel, Turkey, the Arabian Gulf, France and Spain. Without fail, people perceived me as representing Britain and asked me questions of this great nation. What I saw was a world crying out for clarity and leadership. In March, we will become an independent country, and to provide that leadership we must again project confidence rather than be needy of European technocrats. The English-speaking world, and the wider Commonwealth, almost three billion people, are our natural allies. Europeans are our trading partners, not our rulers. Aside from Brexit, two other factors impede the assertion of British confidence. First, an abiding sense of imperial guilt gnaws away at our national conscience. Yes, Britain built an empire, but so did Turkey. Turkey has no misgivings about a single act of imperial conquest of the entire Middle East and Balkans, and national pride is strong in that country. Why not Britain? We ended slavery and obliterated Nazism, and the children of our empire now serve at the highest levels of government, including the Home Secretary Sajid Javid.
JAN6	Government needs a no-deal Brexit plan to survive, manage and thrive	There are many who believe that if Theresa May fails to win the Commons vote on her Withdrawal Agreement, she will just keep putting it back to MPs until they give in. Let’s hope this does not turn out to be so. She should accept the result and move on – and expend her energy on taking no-deal preparations to a new level. Right now the Government is just into the first stage: planning for survival. These are the essential logistical concerns, such as ensuring adequate supply of food and medicine even if the EU were to seek deliberately to curtail trade. Britain has achieved far more on this front in recent weeks than many of us feared, and the EU has also started to put in place plans to minimise no-deal disruption. Much more needs to be done for the first stage, but the Government should also quickly look ahead to the next: planning to manage. There are a great many things that businesses need to be informed of. For instance, what tariffs will they have to pay to export or import to the EU? Will we declare unilateral free trade? Will the Government compensate – in a way that is compatible with World Trade Organisation membership – farmers or other groups? The Government desperately needs to detail its future trade, fiscal and regulatory policies.

JAN7	No deal might sound tempting, but MPs will never let it happen	To pass her Brexit deal through the House of Commons, Theresa May needs a balance of terror among those who favour rival outcomes. She needs hardline Brexiteers to worry that if they don’t vote with her, Brexit won’t happen at all, and some ardent Remainers to think that unless they support her, Britain will “crash out” of the EU without a deal. Her problem is that, far from such a balance of terror existing, the very opposite prevails – a kind of equilibrium of complacency. Each set of opponents is smugly confident that, once her deal is voted down, their own view will prevail. The new year has been marked by all of them claiming fresh support and optimism. Advocates of a second referendum have released a poll showing ever more people demanding one. Those who want the “Norway option” claim momentum behind them. And some who are relaxed about a no-deal outcome say the support for it is growing.
JAN7	No matter how many times the Prime Minister puts her deal to the Commons, the result will be the same	One of my children was given a very pretty miniature carousel for Christmas, with lights and fairground tunes. It happily goes round and round but nothing ever really changes – rather like the Withdrawal Agreement. Mrs May’s deal was not going to pass through the House of Commons in December, and it is difficult to see why it would in January. It seems as likely as a horse riding off from the carousel, which may have happened in Mary Poppins but otherwise is an unusual occurrence. The problems with the Agreement have not changed one iota. The potentially endless Customs Union, the separation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and the risk of paying £39 billion for nothing are all still there. Over Christmas, the view of the country and especially Conservative Members seems to have hardened against the proposal. Certainly, the hope that members of the public would tell MPs to back Mrs May has proved forlorn. Those who came up to me urged me to back Brexit and the Referendum result. Likewise, the fear of reverting to World Trade Organisation rules has dissipated as no deal preparations speed up. Against this background there appears to be no engagement from the European Union and no willingness to change the text of the Withdrawal Agreement.
JAN7	Brexit Bulletin: MPs call Theresa May's no deal bluff	Theresa May might regret her repeated insistence that “no deal is better than a bad deal”. Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson seem to believe it even more strongly than she does, as they continue to argue that her deal is much worse than leaving to trade on WTO terms. Brexitsceptics have applied their own pressure, with 200 MPs – including a dozen Tories – publicly urging her to rule out a departure without an agreement.  But the problem is that the Prime Minister cannot stop a "clean break" by simply ruling it out. As her Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay reminded MPs this afternoon, no deal is the default outcome unless the Commons approves a different option. Indeed the Government's recognition of this could be seen this morning, when it staged a traffic jam of hauliers to practice for no-deal congestion at Dover. This comes after Andrew Marr tried over the weekend to find out what her alternative would be if MPs reject her deal next week. That remains likely, unless scores of MPs have privately decided to not go through with their threats to stop it, however all Mrs May said was that her aim was to make Plan A work.
JAN7	People must take more responsibility for their obesity, but that doesn't mean treating them with contempt	They eat up resources. They drink us dry. They burn through our taxes, so we have to watch them float away in a haze of tobacco-tinged air. These are not the exact words that the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock has used in interviews in the past few days to launch his new strategy for the NHS, but they are not all that far off. Fat people, heavy drinkers and smokers are all facing a battery of measures to tackle the habits that are making them unhealthy and draining the NHS of its precious cash. They will not be locked in rooms without food, fags or booze. And it seems that, at least for the time being, they will not even face a sugar tax or minimum pricing for alcohol. But they will see a lot of big, wagging fingers. Patients in hospital with drink-related illnesses will, said Hancock, get a “stern talking to” by doctors and nurses lasting up to 40 minutes. Pregnant women will get emails telling them to stop smoking and drinking.
JAN7	The Army won't get very far with adverts that insult the very people it is trying to recruit	I spent yesterday applying for a new job. Luckily, I knew just what to say in my cover letter. “I like to think of myself as a me, me, me millennial,” I wrote. “Friends would describe me as the class clown and a selfie-addicted snowflake. Hobbies include sitting up all night playing video games.” Except I didn’t write any of that. Nobody would set out to insult themselves in a job application, and anyway, any employer who received such a letter would swiftly scrunch it into a ball and catapult it into the nearest bin. Or so you might think. Amazingly, if their new recruitment campaign is anything to go by, that’s exactly the sort of letter the British Army would be happy to receive.  “Me me me millennials, your army needs you and your self-belief,” one of their new, Kitchener-style posters reads. Others suggested the Army needs the “drive” it recognises in “binge gamers”, as well as snowflakes’ compassion, selfie-addicts’ confidence, the “focus” clearly exhibited by “phone zombies” and the “spirit” of class clowns.
JAN7	Give the British people back control	Take Back Control is the defining political message of our time, but what does it mean in practice? To the Left it translates as putting power in the hands of the Government to run our lives. For the Conservative Party, Take Back Control must mean lifting up the individual – and that’s why we launched our Campaign for Capitalism last year, to promote a smaller state, freer markets and economic liberty. Liz Truss, in an excellent article in these pages, makes it clear that she agrees with us, and the reader can infer some incisive criticisms of the status quo. There has been “mission creep” in government; “vested interests” shape policies to their own benefit. Ms Truss calls it “bad politics to think we could ever win a spending bidding war with Labour”, which is precisely what the Government has attempted to do with its pledge to splash £20 billion on the NHS. Labour has promised to match the figure and increase it. Moreover, when Ms Truss makes reference to “white elephants”, many readers could probably draw up their own list, from green energy projects to the foreign aid target, and not forgetting the hulking great mammoth that is HS2. High speed rail’s original price tag was £34  billion; it now stands at £56 billion and some fear it could cost over £100 billion. There will be benefits, of course, but they will be swamped by such mindbogglingly high costs. The Government has got to stop plugging away at this expensive scheme and have the courage to drop it. The money should either be used for tax cuts or for small, higher-value-added projects, such as road bypasses.

Right now the Government is just into the first stage: planning for survival. These are the essential logistical concerns, such as ensuring adequate supply of food and medicine even if the EU were to seek deliberately to curtail trade. Britain has achieved far more on this front in recent weeks than many of us feared, and the EU has also started to put in place plans to minimise no-deal disruption. Much more needs to be done for the first stage, but the Government should also quickly look ahead to the next: planning to manage. There are a great many things that businesses need to be informed of. For instance, what tariffs will they have to pay to export or import to the EU? Will we declare unilateral free trade? Will the Government compensate – in a way that is compatible with World Trade Organisation membership – farmers or other groups? The Government desperately needs to detail its future trade, fiscal and regulatory policies.
JAN7	Let’s turn Project Fear into Project Ready	The Brexit dynamic has changed since the Prime Minister hunkered down for Christmas, but not in the way she might have wanted. The goal was presumably to let fear of a no deal exit do its work and win the critics over to her deal. If only the DUP would give up some of its objections to the backstop; if only the EU would put a time-limit on it. And surely even the hardest Brexiteer wouldn’t want Britain to crash out on March 29? This gamble was a miscalculation befitting a Prime Minister who has tended to see Brexit as a problem to be solved rather than an opportunity to be grasped. The DUP cannot compromise on the constitution; the Europeans feel they’ve gone far enough already; and the Leavers are more worried about the UK becoming a vassal of Brussels than they are of any queues at Dover. Some of them have been fighting the EU for more than 40 years and they won’t back down now. So, it’s difficult to see anyone returning from Christmas reconciled to Mrs May’s deal. On the contrary, it is the no-deal outcome that has become surprisingly normalised. The country is getting ready for it, with stockpiling, public awareness campaigns, new ferry routes, and more. The Government clearly wants us to be alarmed, and there is no denying that leaving without a Withdrawal Agreement might be painful. But the country has become cynical about fear-mongering (which proved hopelessly inaccurate during the referendum) and the more no-deal planning is talked about, the more it seems simply practical and right. In fact, it should have been part of the Government’s negotiating strategy from the very beginning.
JAN7	Letters: Treating obesity as a disease discourages a sensible diet and exercise	SIR – The claim by Professor Andrew Goddard of the Royal College of Physicians (report, January 4) that obesity is a disease may come as a relief to the greedy or wilfully immobile.  While obesity inevitably disturbs the body’s metabolism and function, and therefore could meet the rather broad definition of a disease, to imply it is something on a par with, say, that cancer or tuberculosis seems wrong.  It may discourage action leading to weight loss, while unnecessary medication may proliferate.
JAN7	Letters: ‘Uncharted territory’ is precisely the destination that Brexit demands	SIR – Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said on television yesterday that      the United Kingdom faces “uncharted territory” if Parliament rejects her Brexit deal. Why does she think we are so frightened of uncharted territory? When you are in business, all your life is uncharted. Michael Stichbury Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire  
JAN8	Hate laws have left police in a quandary over what constitutes free speech	Do you remember Brian Haw? Anyone working in Westminster in the first decade of this century will never forget him, he was the bane of their lives. Haw, who died in 2011, was the peace campaigner who set up camp opposite the Palace of Westminster and bellowed slogans through a loudhailer all day. He became such a nuisance that the Labour government introduced provisions into the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 specifically to deal with him, making it an offence to demonstrate within one kilometre of the Palace of Westminster without permission from the Metropolitan Police. Ironically, due to faulty drafting, a court ruled that the one person the law did not apply to was Haw himself because his protest predated the legislation. That was overturned on appeal and one morning dozens of police officers arrived to break up the camp and arrest him. Haw was later acquitted on the grounds that the conditions he was accused of breaching were not sufficiently clear, and they should have been imposed by a police officer of higher rank.
JAN8	We French women of a certain age are depressingly used to smug insults from sexists like Yann Moix	Yann Moix, 50 (he looks 10 years older), is best known as a reasonably successful French novelist, but he has a sideline in being smugly dismissive on TV talk shows where, as part of a heavily contrived enfant terrible persona, he delivers calibrated outrage to trip up the evening’s guests. His speciality is delivering nasty quips to women. It was only to be expected, then, that having a new book to plug (called, quelle surprise, Breaking Up, out this week), he would find something suitably nasty to tell one magazine interviewer about women. “I am incapable of loving a woman of 50,” Moix said, as if on cue. “I find that too old. I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of. The body of a 25-year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of 50 is not extraordinary at all.”
JAN8	Far from stopping a no deal Brexit, Remainers have set it up to be much more chaotic	Despite voting in droves to start the Brexit clock by triggering Article 50, MPs have been increasingly flailing about in desperation to find a way to stop the default outcome it sets up the country for of a no deal Brexit. Labour's Yvette Cooper has expressed her delight tonight that the House of Commons voted for an amendment she had tabled to the government's finance bill, declaring on Twitter that it "shows the determination in Parliament to come together to prevent a chaotic & damaging #NoDeal that would hit manufacturing, policing & security". So what effect have MPs had today? They certainly have not stopped a no-deal Brexit. Instead, all they have done is limit the Chancellor's tax raising...
JAN8	Allowing the NHS access to our data could be the difference between life or death	There are lots of futuristic gadgets and eye-catching ideas in Simon Stevens’ new long-term plan for the NHS. “Smart scales” which send out automatic alerts if patients’ weight falls dangerously low after surgery. Wearables, health advice apps, video consultations – you name it, Stevens and his digitally-minded minister Matt Hancock want the NHS to embrace it. Good. The complex requirements of an ageing society mean the NHS’ current funding model is unsustainable if we continue to treat hospitals as hostels for the old and chronically unwell. Most people want to and should spent time being treated and getting better at home. Many more should be prevented from falling ill in the first place. Prevention before cure is the new NHS mantra and not a moment too soon. For one thing it is vastly cheaper. But only technology can help make it happen. Eric Topol, an American geneticist soon to report to Hancock on digital health, has told me he soon expects our vast, packed hospitals to become deserted, as all but the most serious cases are monitored or treated close to home.
JAN8	Of course politicians like Anna Soubry should be safe from violence, but we cannot stop free speech however nasty	Recent intimidating verbal attacks outside parliament – including those against Tory MP Anna Soubry yesterday - have hit the headlines. More than 60 MPs have now written to the Metropolitan Police demanding action be taken. Ms Soubry being called a “Nazi” seems to have been the catalyst for these calls to the police. Yet the strange thing about this outcry is that there is nothing new about protestors and political activists behaving in such an unacceptable way. Indeed, their general conduct has deteriorated markedly in the past few years. I should know this better than any other person alive as I have been subjected to enormous amounts of abuse year on year, day on day, week on week. In my case, it has come from those who support open borders and believe we are all global citizens now, as well as from those who back Britain’s continued membership of the European Union. The litany of attacks, assaults and threats against me are very difficult to describe, but one or two clear examples stand out. 
JAN8	Amazon appears to be taking over the world, but you can be sure regulators are keeping an eye on it	Within the space of 25 years, a company that began life selling niche second-hand books from a garage in Seattle has become the world’s most valuable business. Amazon was worth £634bn when the US stock market closed on Monday, surpassing Microsoft for the first time. Jeff Bezos, the founder, started off with the sale of a book entitled Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought, by Douglas Hofstadter. Today, his company dominates the online retail delivery market and has expanded into TV, online film and music distribution and cloud computing. It has made Mr Bezos the richest man on earth, owner of the Washington Post and a power in the land; and as is inevitable when someone reaches such heights the question arises: has he become too powerful? In the past 25 years huge corporations – Apple, Google and Facebook – have sprung almost out of nothing. But Amazon’s reach seems greater than any. There are echoes from history here. In the late 19th century, Standard Oil, founded by John D Rockefeller, rapidly became the world’s first and largest multinational corporation. In 1911, however, the US Supreme Court, in a landmark case, ruled it was an illegal monopoly that was ussing aggressive pricing to put competitors out of business. The court forced its break-up into 34 smaller companies.
JAN8	Theresa May needs a Brexit road map	Shutting down the machinery of government is a political device used periodically in the United States when Congress and the executive branch clash over policy. It is, indeed, causing ructions in Washington at the moment over President Trump’s plans to build a wall with Mexico. Anti-Brexiteers in Parliament are now planning to emulate that approach in a bid to reverse the vote to leave the EU, or at least to ensure the UK does not fall out of the bloc on March 29 without a deal. An amendment to the Finance Bill has been tabled to restrict the Government’s freedom to make tax changes without ruling out no deal. Number 10 says it is “relaxed” about this but with less than three months to the departure date, and Theresa May’s deal apparently doomed to defeat, these are the opening skirmishes in what promises to be a monumental battle pitching the legislature against the executive. Other measures due before the Commons will also be targeted for amendments designed either to prevent no deal or reverse aspects of Brexit. The Trade Bill in the Lords, for instance, could be amended to commit Britain to staying in a customs union with the EU. The Government faces weeks of legislative guerrilla warfare if Mrs May loses the vote next week and the only two alternative options are staying in the EU or leaving without a deal. There is a growing move in Parliament to stop the latter happening, even if it enhances the prospect of the former. The apparent stepping up of preparations for a no deal, including an exercise with lorries in Kent yesterday, is intended to encourage support for Mrs May but is having little effect. The Prime Minister’s decision not to attend the Commons yesterday to inform MPs what has happened since cancelling a vote on her deal a month ago will not make them any more likely to vote for her than before. In an interview with the BBC at the weekend she had nothing new to say.
JAN8	People don't want to worship the NHS, they want it to work for them	There is much in the 10-year NHS plan to commend it. The financial settlement until 2022-23 gives an element of stability, though even the extra £20bn annual spending by that date has already been deemed insufficient by health professionals. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said consensus had been achieved about what needs to change, though this agreement has been sought and found principally within the monolithic service itself. Although patient groups were involved, this plan has been drawn up by the management of the NHS which is arguably part of the problem, not the solution. Mr Stevens said there would be greater use of genetic testing for child cancers, more options to see GPs online, a reform of outpatient visits, and health inequalities are to be tackled through greater emphasis on prevention. All of these are perfectly reasonable developments, but they are hardly reforms; rather, things any modern health service should be doing.

JAN9	The Prime Minister won't willingly take us out of the EU without a deal	In a week when Brexit became a movie, events in Parliament have resembled a favourite Hollywood cliché: the Mexican stand-off. Theresa May’s metaphorical gun is aimed at the MPs who back a second referendum. Whose guns are pointed at the no‑dealers. Whose guns are trained on supporters of Norway-plus. Whose guns are aimed at Jeremy Corbyn. Whose gun is pointed at Theresa May. Like in the movies, nobody wants to drop their weapon, yet nobody is prepared to pull the trigger. Everybody says they’re ready to shoot. And everybody is starting to get twitchy. MPs will vote down the Prime Minister’s deal next week. While Downing Street expected support to grow with time – from Leavers fearing Brexit might not happen, and from Remainers fearing no deal – the opposite has happened. If anything, opinion has hardened against the deal. Everybody who opposes it believes their policy can win the day.
JAN9	The wrong man is in the Speaker's chair at this crucial stage	This was John Bercow’s great moment and he was enjoying it immensely. With the House of Commons in turmoil, the Speaker was demonstrating his power and authority. At issue was whether he should have accepted an amendment to a government motion that allowed MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit to inflict another defeat on Theresa May. “I am not setting myself up against the Government. I am championing the rights of the House of Commons,” he said portentously at the height of today’s furore. “My job is not to be a cheerleader for the executive branch.” There was an echo here of the greatest of Speakers, William Lenthall, who was in the chair when Charles I entered the chamber in January 1642 looking to arrest five MPs he considered to be traitors.
JAN9	If MPs stop Brexit, Middle England could stage its biggest revolt in modern history	Is Britain on the brink of nasty civil conflict? One doesn’t need a particularly keen nose to detect in the air the clenched scent of a storm coming. Parliament is working in contempt of the people by trying to wreck plans for a no-deal Brexit, grisly videos of activists ganging up on MPs are ricocheting on social media, and yellow-vest protests are flaring from Somerset to Central London. But the idea, entertained by an increasing number of Remainers – and threatened by irresponsible Leavers, too – that we knuckle-dragging Brexiteers will plunge the country into France-style riots is nonsense. No smashed windows please, we’re British. Far more likely that, faced with the theft of the Brexit they voted for, the spirited and inventive people of Middle England will find politer ways to make their feelings known. On Tuesday, I spoke with the Leave Means Leave campaigners who have pitched up to wave placards outside Parliament for the next two weeks. There was not a single fluorescent jacket or yob hollering “Nazi” in sight, just an upbeat crowd in brogues and bobble hats sipping overbrewed tea from their paisley-patterned flasks.
JAN9	I, for one, would welcome a freaky carer robot into my home	Machines that talk, smile and cuddle can tackle loneliness I knew at Christmas that we had a new family member. She is called Alexa and she sits on the table near the television: she has many of the characteristics missing from more wayward children (a child, yes, for she is surely in her infancy). She stays put, she doesn’t answer back, she does whatever you tell her, she doesn’t throw tantrums and she is compliant with the moods and requirements of the household. So far, so acceptable.  Alexa has lots of friends and they are poised to invade the homes of the elderly on a much wider scale. This is what artificial intelligence means for social care: robots will soon be around to look after our needs and respond to crises in the lives of those of us who live alone. And this week, at the annual CES consumer technology fair in Las Vegas, manufacturers are showing off their latest gadgetry.
JAN9	Tricksy Labour moderates find it easier to oppose no deal than to justify their true position	You might be forgiven for thinking that, following last night’s defeat of the government on Yvette Cooper’s amendment to the Finance Bill, Labour is at last getting its act together and presenting some form of real opposition to the Conservatives. Sadly, you would be wrong. Last night’s events risk now mean Labour is running the risk of alienating both Leavers and Remainers. Leave voters in Labour seats will be angry that Cooper, a former leadership contender and three times winner of the Parliamentary Labour Party's “If Only” trophy, succeeded in her attempts to make a no-deal Brexit even more unappealing than it already was. Meanwhile, the inactivity of her party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, continues to risk the ire of all those Remainers who backed the party at the 2017 general election in the belief that he would seek to prevent our departure from the EU. Cooper and her parliamentary followers are now making the running on Labour’s opposition to Brexit, as you can see from any cursory glance at the social media activities of a great swathe of moderate Labour MPs.

JAN9	Letters: As the Brexit drama nears a climax, Government finds itself hamstrung	SIR – The Amendment passed on Tuesday night in Parliament, limiting the Government’s tax-raising powers and adversely affecting the possibility of an exit from the EU under WTO rules, has perhaps further reaching effects than its supporters realise. If “no deal” is now impossible, the Government’s negotiating position with the EU has been emasculated at the very stage when it might have had most potent efficacy. As David Davis pointed out recently in an interview on the Today programme, all negotiations with the EU habitually go down to the deadline. Now it would seem that the Government is likely to be deprived of its most powerful bargaining stance at the crucial moment. Tony Harrison Child Okeford, Dorset
JAN9	Letters: Thuggish behaviour from both sides has tarnished the Brexit debate	SIR – I’ve been walking my dog past Parliament and College Green every afternoon for three months or so. The heckling from the pro-EU mob has been loud and annoying. The television crews (especially BBC) seem to encourage it – setting up their cameras so that behind the interviewee there’s a crowd baying and waving flags. I don’t condone what happened to Anna Soubry on Monday. Thugs like that should be arrested. Every MP should be escorted by the police from the Commons to the Green.
JAN10	Does SNP now stand for Sturgeon National Party, or Salmond National Party?	When the SNP MPs troop into the Commons "No" lobby on Tuesday night for the meaningful vote on Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal, they will claim that they are defending Scotland’s interests over the UK leaving the EU. However, given the truly remarkable events that have unfolded this week, MPs from every other party, indeed the country of Scotland itself, is now entitled to ask them, "Which SNP do you represent? The Sturgeon National Party or the Salmond National Party?". The question arises as Nicola Sturgeon faces what is the most severe test of her leadership with her party split from top to bottom and her own truthfulness called into serious question by Tory and Labour leaders, as well as by some of her own MSPs.
JAN10	Mrs May is tormenting Tory MPs with doses of Corbynism because she knows no deal is getting more likely	Brexit was a profound psychological shock for most MPs but for some reason, the grieving process seems to be happening in reverse. Normally, denial comes first – then anger, bargaining, depression and (finally) acceptance. This time, the referendum result met immediate acceptance from all sides, after which depression quickly followed. Then came bargaining with the European Union. This ended in anger, with Cabinet resignations and a botched attempt to depose the Prime Minister. The final stage is denial, which we have now entered. It looks as if it might last for some time. The denial – suffered by all parties – is over a simple fact. That two years ago, when MPs voted for Article 50, they also voted to leave the European Union without a deal on March 29. And unless a majority of MPs vote for an another plan, this is what will now happen. The noise and fuss from the Commons serves only to highlight the lack of a consensus behind any other idea. The Prime Minister is quite right to say it’s her deal, or no deal and the latter now looks more likely. A second referendum? There has always been a logical case for going back to the country once it was clear what Brexit would look like. But Mrs May’s deal is not Brexit. It is simply a plan to restart Brexit talks under different, less advantageous circumstances. It might lead to a decent Brexit; it might not. There is no means of knowing, so there is nothing to vote on. With public opinion still pretty evenly divided, the more thoughtful Remainers realise that Leave would probably win again – taking us back to where we are now.
JAN10	Our biased Speaker has set the stage for the neutering of Parliament by the executive	Few would describe this parliamentary session as dominated by an overly mighty executive getting its way. My role at No 10 was created because the numbers both in the Commons and the Lords put the Government at a significant disadvantage. You can see the scars on the legislation: the flagship Brexit bill, the EU Withdrawal Bill, increased in length by 63 per cent during its passage as a result of threatened rebellions and defeats. Any wrong move by Government saw rapid retaliation on the floor of the House. Humble Addresses, previously used only for securing routine papers, were combined with Opposition Days to facilitate a vote to compel the release of papers that would never normally see public scrutiny. Along with Parliament’s ability to hold ministers in contempt, it was a very effective strategy.
JAN10	What next for Theresa May's Brexit deal – what are plans A, B and C, and can the 'Malthouse Compromise' work?	Theresa May’s plan A for Brexit was heavily defeated two weeks ago in the Commons. There are now six competing Brexit plans which MPs will have to choose from in the coming weeks: the Prime Minister's, Labour's, Yvette Cooper's, Dominic Grieve's and a compromise plan C from no-deal Brexiteers and moderate Remainer Tories. Below is a breakdown of each: what it is, who supports it and if it could work. The Prime Minister is seeking to revive her deal with Brussels after it was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs last week in an historic defeat. Mrs May has declined to say exactly what she intends to do, but aides believe that an amendment offering a "sunset clause" on the backstop – a hard date by which it must end – could help win over support for her deal. She is expected to tell the Commons before the votes on Tuesday that she wants to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. The Government believes an amendment to the existing Brexit deal could help win over the DUP’s 10 MPs as well as a significant tranche of Tory Eurosceptics. Several Tories who failed to back her deal last week have said publicly that an assurance around the backstop would be sufficient to win them over. However, the Prime Minister remains under intense pressure to make sure any changes to the backstop are included in the Withdrawal Agreement itself – something the EU has ruled out.
JAN10	If anyone can save our high streets, it’s millennials	The High Street: what does the term mean to you? If it’s where you buy your fruit and veg, chit-chat with the butcher and run into friends and neighbours, then you are obviously either fortunate enough to live in the 1950s, or you’re an extra on Emmerdale. I exaggerate, sort of, but the latest slew of bleak news from retail giants about flatlining consumer confidence and slumping profits has, yet again, given rise to Cassandra predictions about the imminent death of the high street. Sales are sinking at Marks and Spencer and Halfords, beleaguered names such as Debenhams and Mothercare have continued their downward trajectory, and although John Lewis turned a tiny profit, drastic price-slashing means it may yet withhold staff bonuses for the first time in 65 years.
JAN10	Don't just blame Brexit for jobs going abroad	It’s become almost customary for companies to blame business troubles on Brexit. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is a case in point. The company has been vocal about Brexit for some time, and when it announced up to 5,000 layoffs in Britain it cited the resultant uncertainty. But there have been downturns in global car sales (JLR sales in China fell by nearly 50 per cent in recent months); diesel has become a controversial fuel in the wake of the VW emissions scandal; and JLR’s products are expensive, thus susceptible to market changes. Moreover, while cutting jobs in the UK, the company has created up to 3,000 new positions in Slovakia, a deal that has been sweetened with state aid worth £111 million in a country that is a net recipient of EU money. EU rules are generally opposed to state aid, but in this instance the payment was judged necessary to stop JLR investing in Mexico instead – and given that Slovakia is a relatively deprived area of Europe, the subsidy was deemed acceptable. Where does this leave Remainers who insist the EU works in Britain’s interests? The economic policy of Brussels varies according to local need, therefore Britain, an economically advanced country, will never be at the front of the queue. It would be preferable for the UK to have full control of its rules and regulations, along with a government following the kind of low tax policies that attract investment – as opposed to either a national government or the EU picking winners or losers. As for companies making decisions based on what they judge is good for their bottom line, that is their liberty: but trying to pin blame in part on Brexit is a bad mix of business and politics. Voters can see through it.
JAN10	Parts of our capital have become the fiefdoms of gangsters and murderers	Just a few miles from where yesterday’s parliamentary shenanigans were taking place, police were investigating the stabbing of a 14-year-old boy in what is thought to have been a targeted attack. Jayden Moody was knocked off his moped by a car in Waltham Forest, east London, and killed by three men who got out of the vehicle. While it is not yet clear what happened or why, it is likely that this was a drugs-related gang murder. The youth of the victim is heartbreaking. What is such a young boy doing riding a moped anyway? If he was a drugs courier for older gang members, did he stray into the “wrong” territory?
JAN10	If Parliament wants to take over Brexit, MPs need to decide what they want	Another day, another Government defeat.Not since the Labour government of James Callaghan in the 1970s has an administration lost so many votes in parliament as Theresa May’s. The last time the tax-raising powers in the Budget were amended, as happened on Tuesday night, was in 1978. It is no coincidence that such setbacks were inflicted on minority governments. Callaghan’s premiership ended when he lost a vote of confidence – the only time since the Second World War that a government has been brought down in this way. Might Mrs May now face the same fate? Hot on the heels of the Budget defeat came another when an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory MP for Beaconsfield, was passed by the House against the wishes of the Government and in breach of normal parliamentary procedure. John Bercow, the Speaker – and ardent anti-Brexiteer – infuriated ministers by accepting the amendment for a vote which they then lost.
JAN10	Letters: If Britain had an election now, what Brexit policy would the main parties choose to stand on?	SIR – Imagine if, on top of the chaos that Theresa May and Parliament are wreaking over Brexit, Britain were asked to vote in a general election to “settle” matters. Neither party would be able to present a manifesto pledge that all, or even a majority, of its candidates could support.  After the last election, at which both main parties said that they would enact the people’s wishes as indicated in the referendum, it has become clear that manifesto pledges are no longer worth the glossy paper they are written on. 
JAN10	Letters: As the Brexit drama nears a climax, Government finds itself hamstrung	SIR – The Amendment passed on Tuesday night in Parliament, limiting the Government’s tax-raising powers and adversely affecting the possibility of an exit from the EU under WTO rules, has perhaps further reaching effects than its supporters realise. If “no deal” is now impossible, the Government’s negotiating position with the EU has been emasculated at the very stage when it might have had most potent efficacy.

JAN11	From the Cabinet to cupcake decorations, why have we developed a bizarre obsession with unicorns?	I have a problem with unicorns. I keep seeing them everywhere. Like many current annoyances, it started with Brexit. It was around autumn 2017 and European officials were stepping up the ante on the Irish border. They began to brief that the UK’s demands, especially the suggestion that the border could be policed using unobtrusive technology, were akin to “magical thinking”. Britain’s ideas were “no more founded in reality than a unicorn”, an Irish official told The Telegraph. And so the “unicorn” entered Brussels lingo as a shorthand way to refer to any of Britain’s supposedly fanciful demands. Since then, this pithy piece of Brussels spin has worked its way into our own politicians’ language. In Cabinet last month, Justice Secretary David Gauke reportedly snapped that some Brexiteers’ desire to pull off a managed no deal was “a unicorn that needs to be slaughtered”.
JAN11	Incentives not taxes point the way to slimming Britain down	When it comes to getting things done, Whitehall has lost its way. Whether it be hiring a shipping operator without ships, or protecting airports against drones, you can be sure of two things in modern Britain: rousing words from ministers – followed by rip-roaring calamity in execution. No department of state seems immune from what was once known as the “British disease”, but the Department of Health and Social Care and its “arm’s-length” quango Public Health England (PHE) have become delirious. True, Chris Grayling’s Department for Transport would give it a good run for its money on a simple PUB (Piss Up in Brewery) test, but when it comes to measuring execution against purpose, there is no corner of Whitehall more tragically hapless than PHE. The quango exists “to protect and improve the nation’s health and reduce health inequalities”. Yet in the six years since it was established, growth in UK life expectancy, a positive trend for almost a century, has all but ground to a halt and is now falling in many of the poorest parts of the country. Of the big EU countries, we are now at the bottom of the life expectancy improvement league, trailing not just France and Germany but Italy, Spain and Poland.
JAN11	How to save our high streets? Shops could start by trying to help their customers	The British high street is taking a battering, having just suffered its worst Christmas for a decade. What has made shoppers turn Scrooge? Brexit, business rates and the rise of online shopping aside, there is another reason that once-cherished brands such as Mothercare and M&S are in trouble. At the risk of sounding like my mother, whatever happened to customer service? I can’t be the only one who went out in search of presents last month only to find myself searching in vain for a sales assistant who could help me – and eventually giving up, going home and opening my laptop. Shops that once prided themselves on fantastic customer service (I’m looking at you, John Lewis) now seem to be run by surly drones avoiding eye contact. Heaven forbid you should have a question, or need another size. It now seems a quaint idea to be able to walk into an electronics shop and speak to someone who knows a lot about computers, or a toy shop where an assistant can advise on age-appropriate games. The rise of online shopping has led to a lazy assumption that consumers would rather do their own research, when many would prefer to just talk to an expert.
JAN11	If the Brexit negotiations are a game of chess, Theresa May is dangerously close to checkmate	Two years ago, after Theresa May’s fateful decision that she wanted us not just to leave the EU but to shut ourselves off from “frictionless” access to the export market which provides one pound in every eight we earn as a nation, I wrote that we seemed to be embarking on a game of snakes and ladders where we were determined to avoid every ladder that might help us to climb the board towards the desired goal, and to seek out every snake which would slide us back down again to square one. Another sporting analogy since used by others has been that which chess players call zugzwang. This is where a player reaches a position where any subsequent move will be disastrous for him. Such is the position we have boxed ourselves into today, where MPs are this week faced with a choice between the devil and the raging sea. On one hand our MPs can vote for a deal imposed on us by the EU, which would leave us much worse off than we are now. On the other, we can drop out of the EU with “no deal” for what Mrs May only coyly calls “uncharted territory” although she must now realise this would be a far greater disaster than her own “bad deal”.
JAN11	Can Netflix series Sex Education explain why millennials aren't having sex?	It’s well-documented that millennials are having less sex than any previous generation, and research suggests Gen Z is going the exact same way. The question is: why? It is entirely possible the new Netflix series Sex Education might have the answers. Sex Education is the story of a Otis, who lives with his sex therapist mother. But while she is intensely relaxed about sex and talks freely about everything from masturbation to impotence, 15-year-old Otis is a virgin.
JAN11	Corbyn’s antics could tear Britain apart	Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit position is nonsense bred of cynicism. In a speech yesterday he repeated his official equation: the Government has messed up Brexit, a general election is needed, Labour will renegotiate. Vital details are missing: when will Labour trigger a no-confidence vote? Will it definitely delay Article 50? And what Remainers really want – a second referendum – isn’t yet on the table. What his position really boils down to is “Tories out”. But suppose there were a general election, what would Labour put in its manifesto? The party is every bit as divided as the Tories over Brexit, with some determined to reverse it and others keen to move on. The latter have done the electoral maths and can see that many of the seats Labour needs to win a parliamentary majority are in Leave constituencies – so any appearance of trying to overturn the referendum result would imperil their once-in-a-generation chance to put a socialist in power. In fact, it works to Mr Corbyn’s advantage to stoke chaos in Parliament. He can blame a bungled Brexit or a no-deal Brexit on the Tories; possibly even win an election off the back of it. Britain totally outside the EU would be a much easier place for Labour to implement a hard Left agenda (Europe’s rules and courts might be otherwise prove inconvenient). Certainly the last thing Mr Corbyn would want is to have to take over withdrawal negotiations himself: his demand for a new customs union is very unlikely to be accepted by the Europeans.
JAN11	Don't just blame Brexit for jobs going abroad	It’s become almost customary for companies to blame business troubles on Brexit. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is a case in point. The company has been vocal about Brexit for some time, and when it announced up to 5,000 layoffs in Britain it cited the resultant uncertainty. But there have been downturns in global car sales (JLR sales in China fell by nearly 50 per cent in recent months); diesel has become a controversial fuel in the wake of the VW emissions scandal; and JLR’s products are expensive, thus susceptible to market changes. Moreover, while cutting jobs in the UK, the company has created up to 3,000 new positions in Slovakia, a deal that has been sweetened with state aid worth £111 million in a country that is a net recipient of EU money. EU rules are generally opposed to state aid, but in this instance the payment was judged necessary to stop JLR investing in Mexico instead – and given that Slovakia is a relatively deprived area of Europe, the subsidy was deemed acceptable. Where does this leave Remainers who insist the EU works in Britain’s interests? The economic policy of Brussels varies according to local need, therefore Britain, an economically advanced country, will never be at the front of the queue. It would be preferable for the UK to have full control of its rules and regulations, along with a government following the kind of low tax policies that attract investment – as opposed to either a national government or the EU picking winners or losers. As for companies making decisions based on what they judge is good for their bottom line, that is their liberty: but trying to pin blame in part on Brexit is a bad mix of business and politics. Voters can see through it.
JAN11	Parts of our capital have become the fiefdoms of gangsters and murderers	Just a few miles from where yesterday’s parliamentary shenanigans were taking place, police were investigating the stabbing of a 14-year-old boy in what is thought to have been a targeted attack. Jayden Moody was knocked off his moped by a car in Waltham Forest, east London, and killed by three men who got out of the vehicle. While it is not yet clear what happened or why, it is likely that this was a drugs-related gang murder. The youth of the victim is heartbreaking. What is such a young boy doing riding a moped anyway? If he was a drugs courier for older gang members, did he stray into the “wrong” territory?
JAN11	Letters: If Britain had an election now, what Brexit policy would the main parties choose to stand on?	SIR – Imagine if, on top of the chaos that Theresa May and Parliament are wreaking over Brexit, Britain were asked to vote in a general election to “settle” matters. Neither party would be able to present a manifesto pledge that all, or even a majority, of its candidates could support.  After the last election, at which both main parties said that they would enact the people’s wishes as indicated in the referendum, it has become clear that manifesto pledges are no longer worth the glossy paper they are written on. 
JAN11	Letters: As the Brexit drama nears a climax, Government finds itself hamstrung	SIR – The Amendment passed on Tuesday night in Parliament, limiting the Government’s tax-raising powers and adversely affecting the possibility of an exit from the EU under WTO rules, has perhaps further reaching effects than its supporters realise. If “no deal” is now impossible, the Government’s negotiating position with the EU has been emasculated at the very stage when it might have had most potent efficacy. As David Davis pointed out recently in an interview on the Today programme, all negotiations with the EU habitually go down to the deadline. Now it would seem that the Government is likely to be deprived of its most powerful bargaining stance at the crucial moment. Tony Harrison Child Okeford, Dorset
JAN12	Iran is wreaking terror in Europe, yet for Brussels trade ties are more important	Following a wave of terror plots on European soil, the EU has finally woken up to the growing threat Iran poses to global security. Last week, it announced new measures against Tehran – yet when compared with the robust sanctions regime Washington has implemented in recent months, Brussels’ response is hardly likely to cause the ayatollahs any sleepless nights. The sanctions come in response to a series of Iranian-sponsored plots that have been uncovered in Europe since the signing of the controversial nuclear deal with Tehran in 2015. Apart from resolving the long‑standing controversy over Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the deal, brokered by Barack Obama, was supposed to encourage the regime to adopt a more constructive attitude towards international relations. Instead, it appears to have emboldened the ayatollahs to expand their terrorist operations from their usual domain in the Middle East to the heart of Europe. In 2015 – at the same time the nuclear deal was signed – 56-year-old Iranian opposition activist Ali Motamed was assassinated in the Dutch city of Almere. This was followed by the murder of Ahmad Molla Nissi, another critic of the Iranian regime, in The Hague in 2017. The Dutch intelligence service has publicly stated that it has “strong indications that Iran was involved in the assassinations of two Dutch nationals”.
JAN12	So what if Kate Bush isn't a Tory? Pop stars' political views are none of our business	It's tragic when fans expect their idols to share their worldview Social media has been hanging out a great deal of garish metaphorical bunting, as Kate Bush fans throughout the nation got high on their own virtue‑signalling relief that their reclusive goddess is not a Tory after all. Back in November, Bush told a Canadian magazine: “We have a female prime minister here in the UK. I actually really like her and think she’s wonderful. I think it’s the best thing that’s happened to us in a long time. She’s a very intelligent woman… it is great to have a woman in charge of the country.” This was too much for the sensitive flowers, who had had to suffer a previous snub when Bush refused to wet herself with indignation over Brexit like any good snowflake should, saying instead, with pleasing stoicism: “Change is such an important part of life. It’s such a different world from even five years ago.” So last week she caved in and issued a statement saying that the quote “could make it seem like I am a Tory supporter, which I want to make clear I am not… My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political, but rather was in the defence of women in power… I should have been clearer when I then said it was the best thing that had happened to us for a long time – because I greatly disliked the behaviour of the previous PM, who at that point I felt had abandoned us and everybody felt angry and let down.”
JAN12	In a final act of betrayal, a cross-party Remainer alliance has conspired to kill off Brexit	The prize is to extend Article 50 - perhaps forever I wouldn’t get too excited about the prospect of no-deal Brexit if I were you. It may be what you want. It may be what I want. It may have the most credible arguments in its defence of any of the current positions on offer. Indeed, it may seem to be becoming more plausible by the day. But the people who are now joining forces in their determination to stop it are very likely to be invincible. In fact, a lot of the talk about the imminence of no-deal is being orchestrated by them. Paradoxically, the more feasible the Unthinkable Outcome appears, the more acceptable the once Unthinkable Strategies of resistance become. How about an alliance between a Tory government and the most irresponsible, extremist Labour party in living memory? Number Ten and its Cabinet loyalists are working on it. Anybody up for abandoning Ulster and allowing it to be annexed by the EU (in effect, by the Irish Republic) in the interests of a cross party alliance to save Theresa May’s “deal”? You bet. Nicky Morgan appeared to suggest precisely that this week in the Telegraph Chopper’s Brexit podcast.
JAN12	Welcome to Fizz Free February, the latest diet gimmick we really don't need	If you went Sober for October, grew some face fuzz for Movember, barrelled into Veganuary and Dry January and, now approaching the month’s halfway point, are in search of a short-lived lifestyle change to adopt, evangelise about and then promptly abandon at the earliest possible opportunity, fear not, for Fizz Free February – that’s ditching sweetened drinks for 28 days – is at hand to solve your calendar-based gimmickry needs. There is a grain of purpose at the core of these clunkily renamed months, of course. But what happens when the branding falls away, the momentum grinds to a halt and your diary has moved onto a different wackily named craze? If in February, we swap our Diet Cokes for the steak and spirits we did away with the month prior, are we still playing by the fad food rules? If Veganuary et al engender good, long-term lifestyle choices among adherents, then they are entirely worthwhile. But I struggle to see them producing much in the way of sustainable change: the idea being that there is a finite time in which to regulate diet or behaviour, and that just as each month gives way to another, so too do the things we should deprive ourselves of.
JAN12	Brexit is in peril because we politicians have failed to grasp that it can be a springboard for total economic renewal	These are interesting times. Over the past two years, the Conservative Party has been trying to get Brexit out of the way and then move onto domestic policy, regarding the two as distinct and separate. This is both unrealistic in terms of timing, but is also a political error. The British people want, and deserve, hope and opportunity for the future after Brexit. The lack of connection between Brexit and domestic policy is, in my view, a core reason why we lost our majority in the 2017 election. We were asking for a mandate to deliver Brexit, but without offering a vision of what Brexit was for, and how it would make the lives of British people better. If Corbyn is the only change on offer at the next election, he will win. As a party, we need to show we can deliver national renewal into the 2020s. Imagine if, at the 2017 election, Brexit had been connected to a major reform programme for technical education and new investment programmes to regenerate northern cities and the most deprived areas. Many will say that we could have carried out those reforms anyway. We could have.
JAN12	MPs must vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal in large enough numbers to kill it forever	Not only should MPs vote against the Withdrawal Agreement on Tuesday, but they must vote against it in large enough numbers to kill it dead, otherwise Theresa May will just keep bringing it back to the Commons until she gets her way. Her supporters say that the only alternative to her deal is the reversal of Brexit – a desperate bid to scare pro-Leave MPs into voting it through. But this is just not true. There are other options – and, yes, that includes no deal, where progress on the preparations is finally being made, if belatedly – and besides, if a treaty is a bad treaty then MPs are duty-bound to vote it down. Be in no doubt: this is an appalling, misconceived deal that would leave us trapped in the EU’s orbit, unable to govern ourselves properly and still arguing about Brexit for years to come. The most glaring error in the deal is the so-called backstop protocol, which could kick in if the UK and EU fail to negotiate a new trade deal by December 2020 (highly likely, given the mess both sides have made of the withdrawal negotiations). The backstop would divide Northern Ireland from the mainland and compel both to follow EU rules over which they would have no say. There is no unilateral mechanism for Britain to leave; we would be even more stuck than we currently are as full EU members. The protocol is so good for the EU, and so ruinous for Britain, that there’s no reason why the EU would want to negotiate a trade deal on better terms. Here is Brussels’ chance to force us to apply European-dictated tariffs to imports from outside the EU, turning the UK into a captive market for its goods while making it nigh impossible to conclude meaningful trade deals with the rest of the world. Britain would be chained to continental rules on everything from employment to the environment, which is a shameless betrayal of the promise that Brexit will give us back control.
JAN12	The vote on Theresa May's deal will test our democracy	Parliament votes on Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement next week, and the conclusion looks foregone. There is currently no majority for its passage; the Commons cannot agree on how best to exit the EU. In fact, MPs cannot agree on whether to leave at all; a majority of them would probably prefer not to. That is what this whole debate boils down to. The details of how we leave are obviously vital and demand scrutiny, but what shouldn’t be up for discussion is Brexit itself. Parliament asked the public if it wanted to leave the EU, and the Government promised that it would implement the decision. In 2016, the country voted for Brexit. In the 2017 general election, both major parties pledged to fulfil that mandate. The Conservative manifesto reassured voters that “we continue to believe that no deal is better than a bad deal”. Now the Tory frontbench is singing a very different song. First, it says that any deal is better than no deal, and Mrs May is so committed to her own Agreement that it is conceivable she will put it to the Commons as many times as necessary before MPs give in. Second, the Government suggests that, thanks to John Bercow’s actions this week, the only alternative to Mrs May’s deal is no Brexit in any shape or form. The Speaker is accused of favouring rebel attempts to take control of withdrawal, to make a no-deal exit harder to effect.
JAN12	Respecting the differences between men and women	The fate of a women-only Oxford humanities fellowship has some interesting things to say about gender in modern Britain. The Joanna Randall-MacIver junior research fellowship was created in the Thirties, when very few women went to university at all. Today, slightly more women are admitted to undergraduate programmes at Oxford than men – and someone has apparently judged that Randall-MacIver’s time is up. In accordance with the Equality Act 2010, the university will make the position available to both genders. What is ironic is that a fellowship once introduced to protect and advance women has fallen foul of a piece of legislation designed to enshrine equality: Randall-MacIver has been labelled “discriminatory on the grounds of gender”. Some will say the fellowship had become not only unfair but unnecessary. After decades of pushing girls in education, they are, in many fields, now outperforming men, and wasn’t the goal of feminism to arrive at an end point – equality of opportunity – not to be stepping in perpetually to help women, as if they cannot help themselves? Nevertheless, the liberal-Left who shape legislation are starting to run ahead of themselves. It will only become harder in the future to define a feminine sphere, or to guard its boundaries, if gender is declared “fluid” and men can redefine themselves as women. With women-only positions now under pressure to open up to all, many must wonder if the campaign for equality is overlooking some common sense facts about the real differences between men and women – and failing to acknowledge and respect them.

JAN13	We must be brave and vote down a deal that represents the worst of both worlds	On Tuesday night, MPs must make a historic choice. They can either vote for the present Withdrawal Agreement, with all its appalling defects – or they can insist on something better. I cannot foresee what they will decide, or in what numbers. But I can see that this is precisely the same wretched text that was in the process of receiving such a spectacular raspberry before Christmas. It still means a chronic and deliberate threat to the Union with Northern Ireland. It still means that, unless we are prepared to do the unthinkable and abandon Northern Ireland, we will remain locked in the EU customs union and large parts of the single market.
JAN13	Eating together nourishes the soul as well as the body	My late neighbour, Joseph, was a Polish soldier who married a British girl and settled in London when the Second World War ended. His wife was long dead by the time I knew him. He lived alone, and was extremely self‑sufficient. One day, he was run over and sustained an injury from which he did not recover. As he could no longer shop or cook for himself, the delivery of frozen ready meals was arranged. He complained that they tasted funny. And, indeed, the unidentifiable dollops of this and that in their microwaveable plastic trays looked a cheerless way to sustain life. Some of us who lived nearby began taking round a plate of whatever we were making for our own evening meal. One day I took some soup – a very ordinary soup, made of leftover roast chicken. Joseph finished the bowl and said: “This is the best soup I have tasted since the soup my mother used to make.”
JAN13	Apple's planned Netflix killer looks like a hard sell	One of the key masterstrokes of Steve Jobs’ Apple came in 2003, when its chief executive made the then-astonishing decision to allow its iTunes music program and iPod music player to work with Microsoft’s Windows operating system. At that point, the iPod was seen as an intriguing new product, but one that was existentially limited: it worked only with Apple’s own Mac computers, which accounted for less than 3pc of worldwide computer sales. Jobs reportedly struggled with the decision to sell iPods to Windows users. While it would naturally mean Apple selling more music players, it also meant eliminating one of the the few clear advantages that Apple’s computers had over the Windows empire. The Mac had been Apple’s most important product for years and sharing iTunes with Microsoft seemed like a compromise. In hindsight, it proved to be a brilliant move. iPod sales soon eclipsed those of Macs, and laid the groundwork for the iPhone that succeeded it. There were echoes of the move last week, when several of the world’s largest TV makers announced deals with Apple that would allow more of the company’s video services to show on their screens. 
JAN13	Surprise, surprise - not all us young people are Remainers	I've seen how the room falls silent when you're outed as a Brexiter Earlier this week, Channel 4’s ‘Brexit Inbetweeners’ debate in Leeds provided a vital wake-up call for hardline Remainers claiming to represent the young. It is delicious viewing. Jon Snow, who fronts the debate like a hand-wringing curate in an inner city youth club, looks utterly bewildered to discover stronger-than-expected support for Brexit. “Clearly the Remainers don’t feel very strong-voiced tonight”, he concluded.
JAN13	A good CEO is worth the money. Let’s turn the spotlight on quangocrats instead	We are curiously selective in our outrage. The fact that top CEOs earn more than a hundred times the average salary rouses our indignation, but we’re not especially bothered by the fact that Premier League footballers earn a hundred times the average, or that the top 20 actors earn nearly a thousand times the average. Labour has declared war on corporate fat cats. It plans a special tax on “excessive pay” for directors – though not, as far as I can make out, for footballers or actors. Labour is not attempting to justify its tax as a way of raising revenue, which is just as well, since such levies are usually a net drain on the Exchequer. Plutocrats don’t sit around waiting to be taxed. They take steps to reduce their liabilities, such as working shorter hours, retiring earlier or moving their assets abroad, leaving the rest of us to pick up their share of the tab. Gordon Brown’s 50p top rate, for example, cost more than it raised. When David Cameron cut the rate to 45p, top-rate taxpayers paid a whopping extra £8 billion – though, sadly, his government was too timid to pursue the logic any further. For Labour, this isn’t about the money. A YouGov poll in 2015 showed that most Labour voters would back wealth taxes even if they reduced government income. It’s an honest position, I suppose: they’d rather we were all poorer, provided we were more equal.

JAN13	Letters: MPs who impede Britain’s departure from the EU will not be forgiven by their constituents	SIR – It is extraordinary that pro-Remain figures in the Conservative Party are threatening to resign if the Prime Minister pursues a no-deal Brexit. The Conservatives’ 2017 manifesto said: “We continue to believe that no deal is better than a bad deal for the UK.” This was repeated many times by the Prime Minister. If Parliament decides that Theresa May’s deal is indeed a bad deal and votes it down, then all Conservative MPs are bound by the manifesto to support a no-deal exit. MPs of any party who betray the referendum result will not be forgiven.
JAN13	Letters: Mrs May has ceded control over Brexit to those determined to thwart it	SIR – Liz Truss claims that Theresa May’s Brexit deal “gives people control over the destiny of our country” (Sunday Comment, January 6). In fact, it does nothing of the kind. As her fellow Conservative MP, Sir William Cash, writes of Mrs May’s deal (in an article in the newspaper on the same day), not only will we not regain control of our own sovereignty – for the first time in our history, we will be governed, perhaps indefinitely, by laws imposed upon us by the other 27 member states of the EU. We will have no say in the creation of those laws, or how they are administered. Worse still, the May deal would undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Could anything be more opposed to “giving people control over the destiny of our country”?
JAN14	MPs need to trust the voters and have confidence in Britain's ability to thrive after Brexit	As we approach the Meaningful Vote, there are two words which should guide us: trust and confidence. These two words cut to the heart of the Brexit process. In politics, trust is our most precious commodity. Once it is lost, it is almost impossible to get back and the bigger the betrayal, the bigger the challenge we face. In holding the Referendum, politicians decided to put their trust in the people. In response, people voted for change. They voted to get out of the EU as a means to a better, independent future. They voted to take back control of our money, our borders, our fishing, our laws and our trade policy. People who voted ‘out’ did so because they are paying the price of being ‘in’ and they know that if you keep doing the same, you keep getting the same.
JAN14	Why MPs should put aside their reservations and back the Prime Minister's deal	I left the House of Commons nearly four years ago, and there hasn’t been a single day when I’ve regretted that. Nevertheless, I sometimes think about what I would do if I were still there. If I were there, I would vote for Theresa May’s Brexit deal without any hesitation.  Partly, I admit, this would be out of gut instinct and loyalty. Here is a Conservative prime minister asking, begging and beseeching us to support her. She may have faults as a leader – as we all do in different ways – but she has shown persistence, integrity and grit, and she is giving us her honest view of what is best for the country.  Voting against her would mean slinking through the lobby with Jeremy Corbyn], whose position on Brexit will in future provide a new textbook definition of opportunist obfuscation. I just could not do that. It tells us a lot about the decline of party loyalty that so many Tories can do so, but we will rue the day our party breaks down so severely. A country cannot be governed effectively unless groups of sane and reasonable people are prepared to show mutual commitment to each other within functioning political parties. 
JAN14	I cannot vote for a deal that squanders Brexit and betrays the British people	Tomorrow, MPs face the most important vote of their lives. The ideals of trust, honesty and respect for democracy are all riding on Brexit - as well as belief in Britain’s potential. My parents emigrated to the UK from Kenya and Mauritius in the 1960s. They were born during the British Empire and admired the United Kingdom. The country that inspired them was confident in the world, pioneering in statecraft and fearless in the face of adversity. A Britain that led the way for others and contributed so much good to the world. That is the vision of Britain which I have inherited and in which I have profound faith. And that is ultimately why I am unable to support the Withdrawal Agreement - even after the exchange of letters and the sincere efforts of the PM to secure concessions.
JAN14	Dfid isn't broken – let's not inflict a damaging blow to one of Britain's prime assets	Ayesha was 14 months old when I met her at one of our emergency nutrition clinics in Hodeida, the port city at the centre of Yemen’s war.  Weighing just 8lbs, the average birthweight of a baby in the UK, and suffering from pneumonia and diarrhea, she wasn’t expected to survive. But with a lot of fight and a little aid from the UK, Ayesha recovered. Somehow I doubt Ayesha’s family is following our tortured national debate on the UK’s ‘soft power’, aid and the future of the Department for International Development (Dfid). But for a window on why that debate matters, there’s no better vantage point than Yemen. 
JAN14	Politicians used to resign as a matter of honour when they failed. It's a shame Mrs May is unlikely to	Tomorrow is bound to be an extraordinary day in politics. But one element is likely to go unreported. Theresa May will – very probably – not resign. Of course, she could surprise us all. But she has established such a strong record of not resigning that hardly anyone is talking about the possibility of her doing it now. This is a strange state of affairs when you consider that she has been prime minister for two and a half years and the most important focus of her leadership has been to effect Britain’s departure from the European Union. Finally, she is coming to the House of Commons where – according to all predictions – her deal will be roundly rejected. Surely that is a very strong reason for a prime minister to resign. Her leadership has failed. Other people in the past have resigned with less cause. Lord Carrington, when he was Foreign Secretary, resigned in 1982 for having failed properly to warn Margaret Thatcher of the risk that Argentina would attack the Falkland Islands. He was not directly responsible for this failure, of course, and nowadays you would expect a Foreign Secretary to fudge the issue. But for Lord Carrington, it was a matter of honour.
JAN14	Giving Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection is the least ministers can do	Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been in prison in Iran since April 2016, accused of trying to overthrow the regime, a preposterous charge to be levelled against the young British mother who was on holiday visiting relatives. She holds dual nationality which has made it more difficult for the UK government to exercise leverage against Tehran, for whom her continued incarceration has become almost a matter of national honour in the face of global condemnation. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family have had hopes of her release raised on several occasions only to see them cruelly dashed.
JAN14	Jeremy Corbyn does not have a clue what to do about Brexit	On the eve of the most important policy decision taken in peacetime for more than 40 years, the leader of the Opposition might have been expected to have a clear idea of where he and his party stand. But anyone looking to Jeremy Corbyn yesterday for a coherent exposition of Labour policy in the event of a defeat tomorrow for Theresa May’s Brexit deal looked in vain. It is the prerogative of opposition to let the Government make the mistakes and seek to replace it. But in order to do so it is the normal requirement of politics to have an alternative strategy. Mr Corbyn wants to exercise the former without having a single clue about the latter.
JAN14	MPs must vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal in large enough numbers to kill it forever	Not only should MPs vote against the Withdrawal Agreement on Tuesday, but they must vote against it in large enough numbers to kill it dead, otherwise Theresa May will just keep bringing it back to the Commons until she gets her way. Her supporters say that the only alternative to her deal is the reversal of Brexit – a desperate bid to scare pro-Leave MPs into voting it through. But this is just not true. There are other options – and, yes, that includes no deal, where progress on the preparations is finally being made, if belatedly – and besides, if a treaty is a bad treaty then MPs are duty-bound to vote it down. Be in no doubt: this is an appalling, misconceived deal that would leave us trapped in the EU’s orbit, unable to govern ourselves properly and still arguing about Brexit for years to come. The most glaring error in the deal is the so-called backstop protocol, which could kick in if the UK and EU fail to negotiate a new trade deal by December 2020 (highly likely, given the mess both sides have made of the withdrawal negotiations). The backstop would divide Northern Ireland from the mainland and compel both to follow EU rules over which they would have no say. There is no unilateral mechanism for Britain to leave; we would be even more stuck than we currently are as full EU members. The protocol is so good for the EU, and so ruinous for Britain, that there’s no reason why the EU would want to negotiate a trade deal on better terms. Here is Brussels’ chance to force us to apply European-dictated tariffs to imports from outside the EU, turning the UK into a captive market for its goods while making it nigh impossible to conclude meaningful trade deals with the rest of the world. Britain would be chained to continental rules on everything from employment to the environment, which is a shameless betrayal of the promise that Brexit will give us back control.
JAN14	Letters: Remainers talk of parliamentary sovereignty while seeking to give more power to Brussels	SIR – As they strut the Westminster corridors boasting of how they have “restored the sovereignty of Parliament”, I wonder how much thought MPs have given to their own future should they force Britain either to remain in the EU or succumb to the Prime Minister’s preposterous “deal”. Parliament’s new-found sovereignty will be transient indeed. Russell Hunt Fleet, Hampshire
JAN14	Letters: MPs who impede Britain’s departure from the EU will not be forgiven by their constituents	SIR – It is extraordinary that pro-Remain figures in the Conservative Party are threatening to resign if the Prime Minister pursues a no-deal Brexit. The Conservatives’ 2017 manifesto said: “We continue to believe that no deal is better than a bad deal for the UK.” This was repeated many times by the Prime Minister. If Parliament decides that Theresa May’s deal is indeed a bad deal and votes it down, then all Conservative MPs are bound by the manifesto to support a no-deal exit. MPs of any party who betray the referendum result will not be forgiven.
JAN15	Why the dastardly Remainer plot to steal Brexit from the people is doomed	As the dust settles on a catastrophic defeat, the worst mauling by the Commons of a sitting Prime Minister in nearly one hundred years, we can but conclude that it was all so terribly predictable, ever since the Chequers debacle was sprung on the Cabinet in July and our national humiliation was consolidated in November with the Cabinet's acceptance of Theresa May's now defunct Brexit deal - surely the biggest failure of British statecraft and of the capacity of our senior negotiators in modern times? Jeremy Corbyn has no option but to table a No Confidence motion which will serve to unify the Tory tribe and his pro forma challenge will be seen off but what then? What comes next? Stalemate? The Prime Minister was remiss in her post defeat statement in not declaring that she would be redoubling No Deal contingency plans or that she would explicitly push for the Northern Ireland backstop to be revisited and the Withdrawal Agreement amended. This is ominous and should worry Brexit supporting MPs.
JAN15	Theresa May is incapable of admitting error or defeat - even in the most humiliating circumstances	The inevitable words came in the peroration of her brief speech: “It is my duty (to deliver on the Referendum).” This is how Theresa May sees it. We must assume that this sentiment is sincere, however bizarrely, obsessively obtuse it may seem. To reinforce this image of personal courage, she positively invited the Leader of the Opposition to table a motion of no confidence in her government. Indeed, if he did not do so, she would welcome a similar motion from any of the other opposition parties. The rest of her plans? Assuming that the confidence vote is lost, she will then consult with the DUP and other interested persons to discuss their suggestions on how to proceed. A bit late for that, you might think. But this is her duty as she sees it. In the most charitable interpretation, she believes it would be irresponsible to walk away from this chaos she has wrought. The chaos, of course, arises from her own decision not to consult with anybody outside her tiny circle of advisers - not even the Cabinet ministers she had appointed officially to negotiate the proposal for a deal. But never mind, that’s all history now. What remains is the shocking new event and its consequences: the government has lost - on the most catastrophic scale - the critical Parliamentary vote on its hugely contentious Withdrawal Agreement.
JAN15	Theresa May's Brexit deal defeat shows the cost of taking Tory Brexiteers for granted	Parliament's rejection of Theresa May's Brexit deal tonight will not have surprised the Government. When Tory Brexiteers expressed concern about it to the chief whip, he told them bluntly: “If you don’t like it, you don’t have to vote for it". How dearly he must regret saying that now many of the European Research Group have taken up his offer. The breezy confidence showed by Julian Smith was shared by others across Government. One minister assured The Times before Christmas that persuading Jacob Rees-Mogg was a "work in progress". The ERG chairman did not take kindly to being publicly treated as if he would be a soft touch, mocking it as "wishful thinking". Far from softening the arch-critic's resolve to oppose the deal, the Government has only stiffened it. Ministers have spent the last few days trying to find something to persuade enough MPs to let the deal pass. Amendments from MPs like Hugo Swire and John Mann were leaped upon, with another from Andrew Murrison getting momentum. But then John Bercow dashed ministers' hopes by refusing to select any of the amendments they were keen on for official parliamentary consideration.
JAN15	Pylons, rabies, quicksand… did your childhood fears follow you into adulthood?	It began with the Scottish writer John Niven musing on Twitter: “Things you feared deeply in childhood that turned out not to be much of an issue in adult life: quicksand.” The thread rapidly took off with scores of people recalling the things they had been made to feel (irrationally) scared about when they were little. Himself and I had a lot of fun locating our own youthful phobias and adding them to Niven's list. Why on earth were we convinced that chewing gum, if swallowed, would wrap itself around our internal organs, leading to slow but certain death? (It took seven years to digest gum, you know.) Clearly, there were some neuroses which sprouted like atomic mushrooms in the shadow of the Bomb. Nuclear winter was a big worry in the Sixties, but so was rabies and drinking from the bathroom tap.
JAN15	Sorry Theresa May, but Labour cannot save you now	With Theresa May's Prime Ministership hanging by a thread following the dramatic defeat of her Withdrawal Agreement tonight in Parliament, there is rising speculation now that she will make a desperate attempt to cut a deal with Labour, should Jeremy Corbyn's no-confidence motion against her tomorrow fail. On the face of it, there are grounds for talks. A great deal of her agreement was palatable to many in the Labour leadership, including an end to freedom of movement, and our departure from the common fisheries and agriculture policies. Moreover the so-called backstop, keeping the whole of the UK inside some form of customs union until a technological solution can be found for the Northern Irish border, isn’t a stone’s throw away from Labour’s stated preference for a permanent customs union.
JAN15	The Prime Minister has suffered a humiliating defeat. She misread the EU, misread her party and misread Parliament	The one thing Theresa May cannot say is “nothing has changed”. Her Withdrawal Agreement was beaten on Tuesday night in the Commons by 432 votes to 202, the biggest defeat since at least the 1920s. Ruin for the Prime Minister’s plan has in fact been predictable since the summer of last year: the stream of resignations from the Government ought to have been a clue. But Mrs May has a record of misreading the situation. She misread the voters in the 2017 election; she misread the EU; she misread her Cabinet at the Chequers summit; and it’s obvious that she has dramatically misread Parliament. The DUP were never going to vote for the deal, because it would have divided the United Kingdom. Labour would never vote for it – even though it’s not a million miles from their own half-baked proposition – because when Mrs May loses, they always win. Pro-Remain Tory rebels wouldn’t go for it because they are convinced that membership of the EU is better than any deal the Government could cook up. Even the Speaker was accused of doing his own bit to aid defeat by refusing to select any of the amendments the Government thought might help the agreement to pass. Finally, pro-Leave Conservatives were never going to come round because they loathe the backstop and regard Mrs May’s compromise as Brexit-in-name-only. Their position was summed up eloquently by Julian Lewis MP: “Because Brexit should mean Brexit and no deal is better than this bad deal, I shall vote no, no and no.” At the Dispatch Box, the Prime Minister gave the honest impression that she believes this deal is the only way to do Brexit, and by investing everything in it – running down the clock and issuing wild warnings of the dangers of no deal or no Brexit – she staked her entire credibility, her ability to govern even, on the fate of the agreement. Defeat is therefore a personal humiliation, although it has been paid for by more than just No 10. The country has been trapped in limbo while waiting for the inevitable; the markets have faced uncertainty; businesses have not had a chance to plan for the future. Far from Mrs May’s One Nation approach bringing the country closer together, it has driven it further apart – as shown by the colourful protests outside Parliament. Elite Remainers have felt emboldened to push for a delay or even reversal of Brexit; Brexiteers have cried betrayal. What Mrs May has fundamentally failed to grasp is that fulfilling the referendum requires a rupture with Europe, which requires picking one side and fighting its corner. Her attempt to satisfy everyone – including Brussels – has finished by satisfying no one. The scale of her defeat proves it.
JAN15	MPs must reject this dreadful deal	Today, the House of Commons finally holds its “meaningful” vote on the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the Government and the EU. Ever since Theresa May peremptorily pulled the vote that was meant to take place before Christmas, political debate has been dominated by everything apart from the detail of the agreement itself. There have been attempts to scare MPs into thinking that a no-deal Brexit would be so terrible that Mrs May’s deal should be accepted, warts and all. But that backfired when it became clear that no-deal planning was more advanced, in the UK and EU, than many had been led to believe. In any case, as the Prime Minister once used to say, no deal is better than a bad deal, and this is a terrible one. More recently there have been warnings of Remain plots to cancel Brexit through parliamentary shenanigans, should Mrs May’s deal fail. That is indeed a risk, but does it make the agreement on offer more attractive? It does not. In part, this is because the Withdrawal Agreement is so flawed that it is unclear why it would be much better than staying in the EU. Most notoriously, the backstop would split the country in two, forcing Northern Ireland into a deeper customs union with the EU than the rest of the UK and requiring the province to follow EU rules in certain areas, unless and until a replacement free trade agreement can be negotiated.

JAN15	Letters: Brexit has exposed the gulf between MPs and the voters they represent	SIR – On November 28 we wrote to all seven Northamptonshire MPs (Michael Ellis, Andrew Lewer, Tom Pursglove, Chris Heaton-Harris, Philip Hollobone, Andrea Leadsom and Peter Bone) to protest in the strongest terms about the Withdrawal Agreement. Not a single one of these MPs, all Conservative, bothered to reply. It is obvious that our parliamentarians, from the Speaker downwards, have forgotten that their role is to represent the voters who pay their salaries. John Allen Chairman, Northampton Brexit Northampton

JAN16	The Hammond phone call shows Parliament could commit a great betrayal	An election may be the only way to break this impasse The Prime Minister opened her speech on the no-confidence motion by stating that a general election would not be in the national interest. It was, she said, an opportunistic attempt by Labour to capitalise on her catastrophic defeat the previous evening when her Brexit deal was rejected by a majority of 230. It is worth observing that in 2017 Theresa May thought that it was in the national interest to hold a snap election, itself arguably an opportunistic attempt to exploit Labour’s perceived weakness. That decision, and the failure to win a majority, is the reason why she is in her current predicament.
JAN16	Tory Remainers have a duty not to destroy their party and let in Corbyn	Will a radicalised faction of Tory Remainers choose to destroy their own party? Will they collude with their pro-EU comrades on the opposition benches to thwart Brexit, triggering an explosive showdown with their Eurosceptic colleagues and formally splitting their party? Are they willing to facilitate a rabidly anti-capitalist, anti-Western calamity of a Labour government, while defying centuries of democracy, humiliating 17.4 million voters and thumbing their noses at Tory supporters? Do they love their failing, hostile, technocratic EU so much that they are willing to sacrifice every other principle they supposedly stand for on its altar? Really? These are now the essential Brexit questions: how they are answered will determine whether or not we leave the EU. Forget the irrelevant no-confidence vote.
JAN16	Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement is dead, but so too is no-deal Brexit	The House of Commons has confidence in the Government, but no confidence in its most important policy. In that respect, nothing has changed. And yet everything has changed. Theresa May can no longer play for time. She cannot hold a second vote on her deal. And she cannot stop Parliament wresting control of Brexit. No-dealers continue to fight, but they increasingly resemble Teruo Nakamura, the Japanese soldier who went on fighting the Second World War until 1974. Any hope they have of bringing about a no-deal Brexit has gone. So, too, has any chance that Parliament can force Brussels back to the negotiating table. True, before Tuesday’s vote, there were some signs that Berlin might help to pass the deal at the second attempt. Downing Street probably over-interpreted Angela Merkel’s commitments to Theresa May on Sunday, but before the vote Heiko Maas, Germany’s foreign minister, suggested talks could be reopened.
JAN16	Why a general election may be the only way to save Brexit	If Theresa May had lost the vote of confidence in her Government last night, we might now have been heading for a general election. But the outcome could well be the same even though she won. Tuesday’s vote put an end to the draft Withdrawal Agreement. The biggest stumbling block was the Irish backstop – the very thing designed to prevent a disorderly Brexit has become its most likely trigger. Without the backstop the agreement could win enough support. However, the Government’s defeat has given confidence to Remainers that Brexit can be diluted further.
JAN16	Should the Brexit decision be left to algorithms?	Amid the rancour over Britain’s proposed split from the EU there might be something to be said for stripping human emotion from the debate altogether. A cold, hard calculation on the merits and terms of an exit served up by a supercomputer might be an attractive remedy for both sides – at least superficially. In reality, of course, any such solution would give rise to its own complications.

JAN17	Surely it's a sick joke that we're now too virtuous to laugh at gallows humour	I haven’t heard a truly sick joke for at least a decade. By sick, I mean deliberately, competitively offensive. The kind we used to tell at school in the Eighties, whenever there was something in the news ghastly enough to penetrate the force field of our adolescent self-absorption. Famines, chemical spills, terrorist atrocities, civil wars, abductions and murders: the worse the tragedy, the faster and harder the gags came. It was a badge of honour to get your joke in first, even – especially – if the subject was still unbearably raw. I remember tutting indulgently at a joke about starving Ethiopians, the morning after Michael Buerk’s famously harrowing BBC report. I had watched the news with my parents, scalp prickling with shock as the camera panned around a silent, dust-covered landscape that turned out to be the contours of dying humans. How could anyone make, or condone, a joke about that? "Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice; stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband." - David Cameron, 2015 pic.twitter.com/9paZtCEDCY
JAN17	The state school with a ‘secret formula’ for getting 41 pupils into Oxbridge	“Every lesson shapes a life.” That was the campaign launched by the Department of Education last October to recruit teachers. The short, affecting film documenting the educational “journey” of a girl from the ages of four to 18 was nicely done, there were no knives or drugs and, aside from a short detention, very little jeopardy. The teachers were played by actual teachers, and they were a supportive lot. The aim was to convey the emotional rewards of changing children’s lives.
JAN17	Leavers must accept that the Brexit betrayal is happening now	My new year resolution was to hope for the best but to prepare for the worst. It is the only one that I have kept in my entire adult life and I am sticking to it rigidly. This is why. Throughout the torturous EU negotiation process, I have warned repeatedly that Theresa May is engaged in the betrayal of Brexit. Many Brexiteers have tried to tell me I am wrong. But ever since September 2017, when Theresa May delivered her EU speech in Florence, I have been convinced of my position: Brexit has undergone a slow strangulation.
JAN17	Why I feel regret and shame over my divorce	The seven adults, one child and a dog gathered round a table in a London pub last Sunday probably looked like the perfect multi-generational family. We were celebrating the birthday of my youngest daughter with an uproarious champagne-fuelled brunch that was, for me, as bitter as it was sweet.  Because, despite the illusion of unity we gave off to the people seated at neighbouring tables, we are in fact a broken family. Divided some 15 years ago by divorce. The fact that we can all get together on special occasions and have fun is proof, I suppose, that we have achieved what some might call a ‘civilised’ or ‘amicable’ separation. But the truth is that divorce is rarely civilised and almost never amicable. The breaking up of a family is always going to be painful and the idea that there is ever a ‘good’ time to divorce is, I think, very misleading.
JAN17	The Brexit deal talks pose a big trap for either Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn to fall into	The Government saw off Labour's no confidence motion last night after several hours of parliamentary rough and tumble, culminating in Michael Gove making clear why Jeremy Corbyn should not be let anywhere near power. And now that is over, the Government is desperate for the Labour leader to help it gets its deal through Parliament.  That was inevitable, as I wrote yesterday. But anyone wondering why Theresa May did not sit down with opposition parties before to find a Brexit deal they could approve now has their answer: they're making absurd demands of her. The Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru are insistent they will offer nothing unless they get a second referendum. Mr Corbyn is refusing to even consider talks unless a no deal Brexit is taken "off the table".

More recently there have been warnings of Remain plots to cancel Brexit through parliamentary shenanigans, should Mrs May’s deal fail. That is indeed a risk, but does it make the agreement on offer more attractive? It does not. In part, this is because the Withdrawal Agreement is so flawed that it is unclear why it would be much better than staying in the EU. Most notoriously, the backstop would split the country in two, forcing Northern Ireland into a deeper customs union with the EU than the rest of the UK and requiring the province to follow EU rules in certain areas, unless and until a replacement free trade agreement can be negotiated.
JAN17	Giving Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection is the least ministers can do	Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been in prison in Iran since April 2016, accused of trying to overthrow the regime, a preposterous charge to be levelled against the young British mother who was on holiday visiting relatives. She holds dual nationality which has made it more difficult for the UK government to exercise leverage against Tehran, for whom her continued incarceration has become almost a matter of national honour in the face of global condemnation. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family have had hopes of her release raised on several occasions only to see them cruelly dashed.
JAN17	Letters: Brexit has exposed the gulf between MPs and the voters they represent	SIR – On November 28 we wrote to all seven Northamptonshire MPs (Michael Ellis, Andrew Lewer, Tom Pursglove, Chris Heaton-Harris, Philip Hollobone, Andrea Leadsom and Peter Bone) to protest in the strongest terms about the Withdrawal Agreement. Not a single one of these MPs, all Conservative, bothered to reply. It is obvious that our parliamentarians, from the Speaker downwards, have forgotten that their role is to represent the voters who pay their salaries. John Allen Chairman, Northampton Brexit Northampton
JAN17	Letters: Remainers talk of parliamentary sovereignty while seeking to give more power to Brussels	SIR – As they strut the Westminster corridors boasting of how they have “restored the sovereignty of Parliament”, I wonder how much thought MPs have given to their own future should they force Britain either to remain in the EU or succumb to the Prime Minister’s preposterous “deal”. Parliament’s new-found sovereignty will be transient indeed. Russell Hunt Fleet, Hampshire
JAN18	Nicola Sturgeon hopes Westminster chaos will help her break up Britain	Both the party and the electorate have had their orders from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. For the former there’s to be no more of the stunned silence with which they greeted the revelations last week about what she knew, and when, about the allegations of sexual harassment levelled against Alex Salmond. And for the voters there was simply a firm instruction that we’re to forget all about that nonsense and focus our minds on one thing only – the new referendum campaign that she’s to announce shortly and which could bring independence to Scotland. Got that?
JAN18	No deal is the people’s backstop against Remainer attempts to frustrate Brexit	Parliament is executing a mini-coup d’etat How foolish of ministers to talk about blocking John Bercow’s peerage when he retires as Speaker. They should fast-forward it. By Monday morning, Mr Bercow should be out of the Speaker’s chair before he can do any more damage to the constitution, comfortably relocated in “another place”, clad in ermine. My other candidate for instant ennoblement is Philip Hammond. As Lord Runnymede and Weybridge, he would, I am sure, make a notable contribution to their Lordships’ debates on the reform of accounting practices. As Chancellor, however, he is working flat out to frustrate Government policy, which remains, despite everything, Brexit.
JAN18	The National Trust should spare us its dad-dancing efforts to be hip	Yesterday, the annual membership pack from the National Trust thudded on to the doormat. Excitedly, I tore apart the fully compostable, starch-based transparent envelope to get at the literature inside – but oh, the disappointment, when I saw that the magazine had on its front a dreary picture of class warfare. A sepia image of 1932 showed the mass trespass on the Kinder Scout grouse moor, organised by the Young Communist League; trespass was not illegal but several people ended up in prison after fights with gamekeepers. It’s being commemorated by the Trust as part of a year celebrating popular protest. The dear old Trust has form. In 2016-17, it gave us Prejudice and Pride, lifting the bedclothes...
JAN18	Of course Oxford should serve its students octopus – not a snowflake diet of anti-aspirational mush	Attending my college freshers’ dinner when I started at Oxford some years back, I was served a small game bird called a quail. I had heard of it before but had never tasted it because, oddly enough, it was never on the menu for school dinners at my Leeds comprehensive. Losing my quail virginity wasn’t uncomplicated. I accidentally put a tiny bone in my mouth and, seated beside a distinguished professor of French literature, I felt it would be rude to remove it. So instead I tried to crunch my way through – something I would not recommend. Still, I’ve always liked culinary adventure, and it’s rare to meet a person, from whatever social background, who regrets having tried something new.
JAN18	Brexit Bulletin: The cost of too great a customs union compromise becomes clear	Theresa May has finished her opening round of talks with all opposition party leaders (except Jeremy Corbyn, who refused to meet), and has now turned her attention to her fellow Conservatives. She has been gradually meeting with Tory MPs and ministers, although her Brexiteer Cabinet colleagues are kicking up a fuss in public. Liam Fox has given an interview to the BBC warning that a Customs Union compromise so that Britain remained part of it “would not be in my view delivering Brexit”. The International Trade Secretary seems to have felt compelled to act given the idea of compromising on the customs union has been gaining momentum.  The Times reported this morning that the Democratic Unionist Party could be “open to a soft Brexit” that kept the whole of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland in a customs union, because it would tick their key box about the terms of exit being equal across the Union.
JAN18	Jeremy Corbyn: a man who will meet groups linked to the IRA but not the Prime Minister of Great Britain	In 2017, Jeremy Corbyn was asked why, in the past, he had met with groups linked to the IRA. He replied: “You have to talk to people with whom you don’t agree and I did.” So, he was willing to invite extremists to parliament and share platforms with terrorists, but has refused to meet with the Prime Minister of Great Britain to discuss Brexit. Mr Corbyn lives in Wonderland. He says he won’t meet the Prime Minister until she has taken a no-deal Brexit off the table, but, as Theresa May pointed out to him in a letter on Thursday, a no-deal Brexit is simply what happens if Britain does not have a deal
JAN18	The Prime Minister has suffered a humiliating defeat. She misread the EU, misread her party and misread Parliament	The one thing Theresa May cannot say is “nothing has changed”. Her Withdrawal Agreement was beaten on Tuesday night in the Commons by 432 votes to 202, the biggest defeat since at least the 1920s. Ruin for the Prime Minister’s plan has in fact been predictable since the summer of last year: the stream of resignations from the Government ought to have been a clue. But Mrs May has a record of misreading the situation. She misread the voters in the 2017 election; she misread the EU; she misread her Cabinet at the Chequers summit; and it’s obvious that she has dramatically misread Parliament. The DUP were never going to vote for the deal, because it would have divided the United Kingdom. Labour would never vote for it – even though it’s not a million miles from their own half-baked proposition – because when Mrs May loses, they always win. Pro-Remain Tory rebels wouldn’t go for it because they are convinced that membership of the EU is better than any deal the Government could cook up. Even the Speaker was accused of doing his own bit to aid defeat by refusing to select any of the amendments the Government thought might help the agreement to pass. Finally, pro-Leave Conservatives were never going to come round because they loathe the backstop and regard Mrs May’s compromise as Brexit-in-name-only. Their position was summed up eloquently by Julian Lewis MP: “Because Brexit should mean Brexit and no deal is better than this bad deal, I shall vote no, no and no.” At the Dispatch Box, the Prime Minister gave the honest impression that she believes this deal is the only way to do Brexit, and by investing everything in it – running down the clock and issuing wild warnings of the dangers of no deal or no Brexit – she staked her entire credibility, her ability to govern even, on the fate of the agreement. Defeat is therefore a personal humiliation, although it has been paid for by more than just No 10. The country has been trapped in limbo while waiting for the inevitable; the markets have faced uncertainty; businesses have not had a chance to plan for the future. Far from Mrs May’s One Nation approach bringing the country closer together, it has driven it further apart – as shown by the colourful protests outside Parliament. Elite Remainers have felt emboldened to push for a delay or even reversal of Brexit; Brexiteers have cried betrayal. What Mrs May has fundamentally failed to grasp is that fulfilling the referendum requires a rupture with Europe, which requires picking one side and fighting its corner. Her attempt to satisfy everyone – including Brussels – has finished by satisfying no one. The scale of her defeat proves it.
JAN18	MPs must reject this dreadful deal	Today, the House of Commons finally holds its “meaningful” vote on the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the Government and the EU. Ever since Theresa May peremptorily pulled the vote that was meant to take place before Christmas, political debate has been dominated by everything apart from the detail of the agreement itself. There have been attempts to scare MPs into thinking that a no-deal Brexit would be so terrible that Mrs May’s deal should be accepted, warts and all. But that backfired when it became clear that no-deal planning was more advanced, in the UK and EU, than many had been led to believe. In any case, as the Prime Minister once used to say, no deal is better than a bad deal, and this is a terrible one. More recently there have been warnings of Remain plots to cancel Brexit through parliamentary shenanigans, should Mrs May’s deal fail. That is indeed a risk, but does it make the agreement on offer more attractive? It does not. In part, this is because the Withdrawal Agreement is so flawed that it is unclear why it would be much better than staying in the EU. Most notoriously, the backstop would split the country in two, forcing Northern Ireland into a deeper customs union with the EU than the rest of the UK and requiring the province to follow EU rules in certain areas, unless and until a replacement free trade agreement can be negotiated.
JAN18	Letters: By ruling out a no-deal Brexit, Hammond throws away Britain’s most powerful bargaining tool	SIR – The actions of Philip Hammond, who has assured his big-business buddies that there won’t be a no‑deal Brexit (report, January 17), are proof positive that Theresa May’s Government is controlled by a cabal of Remainers who are blatantly ignoring the wishes of the British public. Their actions once again hand all the negotiating aces to the EU, which now has confirmation that it does not need to offer any new concessions over Brexit.  The incompetence of this Government is staggering. 
JAN18	Letters: MPs have allowed their own self-interest to take precedence over the wishes of the electorate	SIR – If ever there was an example of the naked self-interest of MPs, then Tuesday’s Brexit vote was surely it: a terrifying display of mediocrity, unfounded ambition and deceit. MPs showed no hint of responsibility, respect or even recognition of what the British people voted for in the 2016 referendum. Irrespective of where anyone stands in relation to Brexit, we urgently need a new political manifesto for wholesale reform of British politics, in order to build genuinely democratic machinery of government.
JAN19	Becoming an Ed Miliband tribute act won't help the Tories win young voters from Labour	Britons are yearning for an optimistic vision of the future. A vision that looks beyond Brexit and addresses their deepest fears about where the country is going and how we create a prosperous future for the next generation. Conservatives have always believed that capitalism, for all its failings, is the best system for the economy. Increasing the size of the cake so there is more to share is the way to create a society that works for the many and not the few. But capitalism is on trial. The financial crisis was more than a decade ago, but discontent with business still abounds. There’s a widespread feeling that the economy is not delivering for voters as it should do. No one in Britain has benefited from this angst more than the hard Left. They’ve taken over Labour and can regularly be found in the media calling for nationalisation, and Bennite schemes for worker control and higher taxes – policies that were tested to destruction in the Seventies. Their favourite trick is to pick cases of justifiable moral outrage, such as tech platforms not paying their fair share of tax, as the wedge to make their extreme policies palatable. And they’ve won celebrity endorsements, ranging from Stormzy to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to help shape the zeitgeist in their favour.
JAN19	Make the backstop temporary, and Mrs May's Brexit deal could still unite the Tories	They say the best way to keep a secret is to make a speech about it in the House of Commons: but I was still perplexed when some people were surprised that I voted against the EU Withdrawal Agreement in Parliament. Not only had I made it clear why I couldn’t support the agreement on the opening day of the EU debate in December, but I’d also said so several times on national TV and radio. As chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, I do try to spread peace and harmony among my colleagues but I’m also determined that our great country wins back the right of democratic self-government. Compromise will be needed as we unpick the tendrils of EU control that have grown into every corner of British life over the past 45 years, particularly as the Prime Minister works to pull this off with no overall majority in Parliament behind her; but one aspect of the Withdrawal Agreement is a compromise too far. The “Irish backstop” would treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a serious obstacle for Unionists – especially those in the DUP and the Scottish Conservatives. What’s more, it would hold the entire UK in the EU Customs Union, taking rules handed down from Brussels and barred from signing trade agreements with the world’s fastest growing markets.
JAN19	In a sense, a disruptive no-deal Brexit has already been taken off the table	Tabling an Early Day Motion calling on “the Government to rule out a no-deal withdrawal from the EU” is possibly the most Jeremy Corbyn thing the Leader of the Opposition could do. EDMs are tabled by MPs largely to draw attention to issues, but are not expected to achieve much. They are a “present but not involved” parliamentary tool, if you like, which makes them perfect for Mr Corbyn to deploy. The most electorally profitable thing for him continues to be allowing the Conservatives to destroy themselves over Brexit while he watches from the wings. For the Remain brigade, however, the demand to take no deal “off the table” is simply a cover for their attempt to stop Brexit itself, without the bother of toppling a seemingly untoppleable Theresa May. They must know that it is not in Mrs May’s gift to pursue Brexit while ruling out no deal. The only thing the UK can do unilaterally is revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit altogether – which is, of course, precisely what the Conservative and Labour Remainers want to do but are too cowardly to actually spell out as the Lib Dems have done, for fear of sharing their pitiful fate in the next general election.
JAN19	Corbyn should never be forgiven by his Marxist friends for siding with big business against no-deal	When I was a young Marxist all those years ago, we were taught that the great demonic enemy “corporate capitalism” would, if allowed to run rampant, take over the world. This eventual domination would be achieved by a global network of giant business interests linking arms in an international alliance that would become too powerful for any elected government to withstand. The demands of indigenous populations (known in the parlance as “the workers”) would be ignored as nation states scrambled to meet the needs of these gargantuan, indomitable wealth machines. Back then, I was not sure whether I believed this dystopian fairy tale. I do now. Reading that transcript in which a British Chancellor of the Exchequer, a Cabinet minister in charge of Brexit and a Business Secretary fall over each other to soothe and placate the leaders of over 300 multinationals, sounding like aspiring lobbyists competing for contracts as they assured the companies that they would do everything possible to prevent the no-deal outcome which their boards feared (even if it could not be, for tactical reasons, officially taken “off the table”), I could only think how ecstatic the Marxists of today must be.
JAN19	Argument for new referendum is like the one used to stop riff raff and women being given vote	Well, are you too a sufferer? And how bad is the condition? Let us share our experience, because that must help. Yes, I must tell you, I also suffer from false consciousness. There, I have said it, and it is a relief. And, of course, as fellow sufferers know – those of us who supported Brexit, in the belief that we knew exactly what we were voting for – there are all too many on the other side who will try to help us understand our plight and rush to diagnose a cure. With the clarity of self-endowed moral certainty and a vigour born of a conviction of superiority over the massed folly of the electorate, they believe we were misled by charlatans or were incapable of grasping the “complexity” of what we were doing. Now, they call for a second referendum for us to correct our mistakes.
JAN19	Brexit isn't about the imperial past. It's about our democratic future	The most ridiculous interpretation of Brexit is that it’s a public school conspiracy to revive the empire, and yet some Remainers honestly cling to this nonsense. A recent column in a US newspaper called Brexit “a fantasy of imperial-era strength and self-sufficiency”, imposed on the voters by a “British elite” of “bumbling chumocrats”. Where to begin? For a start, the empire is dead; no one wants it back. If any power is obsessed with the past, it isn’t Britain – it’s the EU, which exists to exorcise the ghosts of nationalism, in order to build a European empire shielded behind a protective trade barrier. Britain, being an island, has a different outlook. Yes, we are fiercely jealous of our independence, but necessity has also turned us into global traders. Thus the ambition of most Brexiteers is to repatriate power while simultaneously expanding exports to China, India and countries beyond. Britain has no desire to dominate anyone. As events in Parliament this week showed, we struggle just to govern ourselves. Moreover, Brexit is not an elite venture. Quite the opposite: it was forced on the elites by the voters. It is true that David Cameron made it possible by triggering a referendum, but what the “Empire 2.0” conspiracy theorists seem to forget is that Mr Cameron wanted Brexit to lose, and that he threw the entire weight of the establishment against it. He was joined by the Treasury, the Bank of England, the vast majority of MPs, big business, the trade unions, clerics and the president of the United States. Yes, some of the people who campaigned for Brexit were wealthy: but by putting themselves on the side of Leave, they jeopardised their careers, even their friendships.

JAN19	Letters: Taking a no-deal Brexit off the negotiating table would be an error of catastrophic proportions	SIR – It is generally agreed that Theresa May has not played her hand very well when it comes to negotiating Brexit, but at least she has retained a vital card: the ability to walk away with no deal. It would be a catastrophic error to throw away this card. It may not be strong enough to persuade the EU to drop the backstop, but it is the only card in town. That discarding it is Jeremy Corbyn’s first objective indicates what a hopeless negotiator he would be. Denis Protheroe Bromley, Kent

JAN20	Prince Philip's car crash is fast becoming a nightmare for the palace, but this mess can yet be salvaged	Anyone who has enjoyed the company of the Duke of Edinburgh will be familiar with his intense desire for independence. Indeed, it didn't surprise me to hear that the day after a car smash which would have floored anyone half his age, the Duke was back at the wheel, seatbelt off, with no protection officers, driving into the Sandringham Estate.  Normally that spirit of derring do in a brave World War II veteran is to be applauded. I even applaud his so-called gaffes, having once been at the end of one myself. 
JAN20	Elderly people should be free to do the things they love - but driving is different	When I wrote in this space recently that elderly drivers could be a bit of a menace, I little thought that I would soon be furnished with a royal example to confirm my point. The Duke of Edinburgh has spent many years as an excellent driver, fast but not furious; skilled by nature and practice in many forms of transport. There is only one thing wrong with him in relation to road-worthiness – he is 97 years old. When people have done something well for such a long time, they do not take kindly to being told that they should, perhaps, stop. Broadly speaking, it seems to me right that they should be left alone to get on with what they love doing, even if it has become more dangerous for them. Suppose, for example, that your idea of fun is diving into freezing water every day: you should not be prevented merely because the risk increases with age. You are harming no one but yourself (although, one must admit, you are also worrying those who love you), and you may not mind that.
JAN20	Whatever Britain decides about its new place in the world, New Zealand stands with you	We're ready to form an ambitious free trade agreement As a spectator from afar, there seems to be one constant theme in global politics right now. Change. That includes in the UK, a place I don’t just consider a longstanding partner to New Zealand, but my former home. In the mid-2000s I travelled to the UK, worked as a civil servant and lived in London, everywhere from Wood Green to Vauxhall and Brixton. I came home with many things - including a love of Branston Pickle, park picnics and a significant tea habit.
JAN20	The British state is a shambles. Are we even capable of governing ourselves post-Brexit?	There was no more symbolic measure of the ever more dismal unreality into which Brexit descended last week than those opposition leaders calling on Theresa May to ensure that we do not leave the EU without a “deal”. Although they have belatedly realised that doing so would inflict terrible damage on our economy, not one seemed to recognise that it was their own resounding rejection of the only deal on offer that appears to have made this catastrophe virtually inevitable. But the shambles we have made of Brexit is only the most conspicuous symptom of a far wider malaise, which in recent years has come to infect almost every area of our public life. Whenever I hear someone expressing unreserved gloom about the state of Britain, I reply that “there are still a great many good people in this country. The trouble is that none of them are running it”. Consider, for instance, what has happened to our police, as knife crime and drug addiction rage unabated, or the unruly state of our prisons, or our emasculated Armed Forces, or our chaotic railways, or our semi-bankrupt local government with senior officials paid more than the Prime Minister, or our rubbish collection, or our legal system (and in particular our horribly dehumanised system of “child protection”).
JAN20	Nostalgic? Me? No, it’s Remainers who cling to the past	Of all the sore-loser descriptions of Brexiteers that have been doing the weary rounds for the past two years among Remainers, it’s hard to know which one least applies to me. On balance, however, I think it would have to be “nostalgic”. I don’t have a nostalgic bone in my body. In fact, the main reason Brexit appeals so strongly to me is that it’s about shaking off a busted flush of a political mindset that may well have made sense in the shadow of the ruins of Germany, but in the shadow of the ruins of Greece has been well and truly revealed as little more than a freeloaders’ gravy-train heading nowhere fast. If anything, Remainers are the Nostalgics. We Leavers are the Futurists. Whether bosses attached to cheap labour or white supremacists attracted to the idea that Europeans should have more of a right to come here than talented people from other continents, the EU is a cesspit of outmoded ideas and ideals.
JAN20	This band of Remainer MPs pose a threat to Brexit and to democracy	The calamitous situation in Parliament is being exploited by a small band of MPs determined to use any mechanism, however constitutionally absurd and deleterious to the public’s faith in our democratic institutions, to stop Brexit. At the centre of the battle is the prospect of Britain leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement in 10 weeks’ timeon March 29. It is perfectly reasonable – self-evident, even – for MPs to say that they would prefer a good deal to a no-deal Brexit. It is equally fine to argue that there is still time to correct the mistakes in Theresa May’s agreement that led to its defeat last week. This would require the EU seeing sense, of course.  
JAN20	Brexit isn't about the imperial past. It's about our democratic future	The most ridiculous interpretation of Brexit is that it’s a public school conspiracy to revive the empire, and yet some Remainers honestly cling to this nonsense.

JAN20	Letters: Delaying Brexit would be a wholesale betrayal of the Conservatives’ manifesto promises	SIR – We are dedicated association chairmen and officers of the Conservative Party. Due to our beliefs in Conservative values and our loyalty to our party we have happily raised funds, organised campaigns, knocked on doors and delivered thousands upon thousands of leaflets. In 2017 Conservative MPs were elected on a manifesto promising that Britain would exit the single market, customs union and the overrule of the European Court of Justice. It promised that the result of the 2016 referendum would be honoured and Brexit delivered. If necessary, it stated, no deal was better than a bad deal. If we fail to honour that manifesto now, it will be a breach of trust with voters and party members. We are therefore greatly concerned by suggestions that Brexit may be delayed, and that a practical consequence of this would be the need for a European election campaign in Britain in May 2019. Following the historic defeat of her Withdrawal Agreement, the Prime Minister is discussing the way forward with leaders from other parties. The suggestion of remaining in a customs union is rumoured to still be on the table. This would take away the Brexit prize of striking trade deals around the world and would not deliver on the referendum result or our manifesto pledges. It would break our bond with voters and risk a Corbyn government.

JAN21	A second referendum would be a disaster for Britain, but it's where we are now heading	There was much jubilation last week among the crowds outside the Houses of Parliament when Theresa May’s deal went down to a record-breaking defeat. Yet we are likely to look back on that moment in future years as a calamitous one for British democracy. At a stroke, the majority of MPs joined together to paralyse the only good government available, make Brexit impossible to deliver on schedule or even at all, and produce in much of the population an utter disgust with their proceedings. Most important of all, wittingly or not, they started the countdown to another referendum. Yes, it is now quite likely that we will have to do it all again. Readers of this column will know that I say that with a heavy heart. For a second plebiscite on EU membership will be the most bitter and divisive event in our modern history, complete with unbridled anger, accusations of betrayal, harrowing doubt and distraction. 
JAN21	There’s no hope of progress if we can’t even call ourselves ‘women’	"You can’t write that ‘Marching is the new brunch’,” decreed a friend as I prepared to give the 2017 Women’s March in London both barrels in my column. “You just can’t!”  And because she was one of the millions across seven continents who had turned out to march in support of women – one with a propensity for wearing the kind of slogan-tastic T-shirts (“#nobraclub”) that fall somewhere between sassy and slutty – I deferred to her higher judgement.   But, two years on, up pops that same friend in my inbox: “Write it,” she urges. “Marching is the new brunch. And I wouldn’t mind, but this year I wasn’t bloomin’ invited.”
JAN21	If Remainers are happy to tear up the rule book, why shouldn't Mrs May?	When Theresa May rose to answer Prime Minister’s Questions the day after the unprecedented defeat of her deal last week, the atmosphere was flat. Even the later debate on the no confidence motion – normally a high voltage affair – was low key, bar the rumbustious summing up by Michael Gove. The only MPs with their tails in the air were the Remainers. Dominic Grieve, Nick Boles, and others were  already planning to table amendments designed to prevent Brexit happening as planned on March 29, while arguing, somewhat disingenuously, that they are only against no deal, even when they knew the Government’s deal would be defeated. Until recently, Brexiteers have taken comfort from standing orders and  Erskine May, the bible of parliamentary procedure. The rules as we know them state that only a government minister can move to enact legislation that requires money to be spent by the state. Yet with the Speaker recently tearing up hundreds of years of procedure, anything might be possible.
JAN21	Of course Justin Welby hears from God – he's the Archbishop of Canterbury	Driving my children (late, as usual) to a sports session at the weekend, I sent up a quick SOS prayer: "Dear God, please let me me find a parking space". Lo and behold, we arrived at the carpark and I slid neatly into one, offering up a speedy, and heartfelt, thanks. You’ve done it I’m sure: "Oh God, not him again"; "Please Lord, let me sleep tonight" – those daily incantations, offered up whether we believe in a higher power or not, usually only half hoping they might be answered, but not actually believing, if they are, that it’s anything other than coincidence. Not, however, if you’re Justin Welby. The Archbishop of Canterbury has let it be known that he speaks, and waits to hear, to and from God in a variety of ways, including via letters sent to him by people with a gift for divine prophecy and by praying in tongues – that is, speaking a spiritual language – every day.
JAN21	The worst thing about term-time holidays? They encourage families to lie	When you send your child to a state school, are you signing a contract, agreeing to follow all rules – however seemingly unfair? Or are you entering into a partnership that allows for give and take? To put it another way, by entrusting your child’s education to the Government’s schools, are you abdicating your chance to be, as George W Bush put it, The Decider? This is no war on terror; I’m thinking about that divisive issue the term-time holiday. Since September 2013, children can only be taken out of school during term time in “exceptional circumstances”, otherwise parents face a £60 fine. Fail to pay and they face prosecution, a £2,500 fine or three months in prison. But even this doesn’t appear to be working. Unauthorised absence in England has reached a record high (one in six children missed school for a family holiday last year), and one council has had enough. Lancashire county council is now considering fines of £1,000 per child, per parent for term-time holidays – meaning that a family with two parents and two children could face paying £4,000 extra for a holiday.
JAN21	This band of Remainer MPs pose a threat to Brexit and to democracy	The calamitous situation in Parliament is being exploited by a small band of MPs determined to use any mechanism, however constitutionally absurd and deleterious to the public’s faith in our democratic institutions, to stop Brexit. At the centre of the battle is the prospect of Britain leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement in 10 weeks’ timeon March 29. It is perfectly reasonable – self-evident, even – for MPs to say that they would prefer a good deal to a no-deal Brexit. It is equally fine to argue that there is still time to correct the mistakes in Theresa May’s agreement that led to its defeat last week. This would require the EU seeing sense, of course.  
JAN21	Brexit isn't about the imperial past. It's about our democratic future	The most ridiculous interpretation of Brexit is that it’s a public school conspiracy to revive the empire, and yet some Remainers honestly cling to this nonsense. A recent column in a US newspaper called Brexit “a fantasy of imperial-era strength and self-sufficiency”, imposed on the voters by a “British elite” of “bumbling chumocrats”. Where to begin? For a start, the empire is dead; no one wants it back. If any power is obsessed with the past, it isn’t Britain – it’s the EU, which exists to exorcise the ghosts of nationalism, in order to build a European empire shielded behind a protective trade barrier. Britain, being an island, has a different outlook. Yes, we are fiercely jealous of our independence, but necessity has also turned us into global traders. Thus the ambition of most Brexiteers is to repatriate power while simultaneously expanding exports to China, India and countries beyond. Britain has no desire to dominate anyone. As events in Parliament this week showed, we struggle just to govern ourselves. Moreover, Brexit is not an elite venture. Quite the opposite: it was forced on the elites by the voters. It is true that David Cameron made it possible by triggering a referendum, but what the “Empire 2.0” conspiracy theorists seem to forget is that Mr Cameron wanted Brexit to lose, and that he threw the entire weight of the establishment against it. He was joined by the Treasury, the Bank of England, the vast majority of MPs, big business, the trade unions, clerics and the president of the United States. Yes, some of the people who campaigned for Brexit were wealthy: but by putting themselves on the side of Leave, they jeopardised their careers, even their friendships.
JAN21	Jeremy Corbyn: a man who will meet groups linked to the IRA but not the Prime Minister of Great Britain	In 2017, Jeremy Corbyn was asked why, in the past, he had met with groups linked to the IRA. He replied: “You have to talk to people with whom you don’t agree and I did.” So, he was willing to invite extremists to parliament and share platforms with terrorists, but has refused to meet with the Prime Minister of Great Britain to discuss Brexit. Mr Corbyn lives in Wonderland. He says he won’t meet the Prime Minister until she has taken a no-deal Brexit off the table, but, as Theresa May pointed out to him in a letter on Thursday, a no-deal Brexit is simply what happens if Britain does not have a deal
JAN21	Letters: Theresa May’s tinkering isn’t enough to deliver a genuine Brexit	SIR – Theresa May’s Brexit plan was never going to work. The very fact that she pursued it indicates bad judgment.  Now she’s trying to fiddle with the same terrible deal after it was comprehensively trashed. Her anti-Brexit bias is showing. It’s time to make way for a Prime Minister who is able to deliver the people’s wishes. What’s wrong with a clean Brexit with negotiations afterwards?
JAN21	Letters: Failure to honour the Brexit vote will do lasting damage to the health of British democracy	SIR – For a number of years before the EU referendum, concern was expressed by many politicians that public interest in politics was at a low ebb, and that more must be done to engage the electorate and show that people’s votes do actually have some meaning. Now, after such huge numbers came out to vote in the EU referendum, is it not profoundly depressing to see so many of the selfsame politicians doing their utmost to derail the democratic outcome of that referendum? One can only assume that making the effort to participate in politics is, sadly, just a waste of time.
JAN22	Good luck to the Queen in hiding Prince Philip’s car keys (and I know the perfect place...)	It must have been a couple of years ago when it first occurred to me that I no longer felt safe driving on motorways at night. On one particular, ink-dark section of the M11, with no vehicles in front or behind, I would suddenly feel disorientated and grip the wheel tight, like a beginner in their first lesson, fighting down the panic. In other places, illuminated by the ruby necklace of a hundred tail-lights ahead and the glittering diamond tiara of cars advancing on the opposite carriageway, I was occasionally overwhelmed by the terrifying fragility of things as we sped along. Were we all mad, trusting to hydraulics and to the good sense (doubtful) of our fellow travellers? Once you have that consciousness of yourself as a fast-moving blip in some crazy video game, it’s hard to relax again. Had my vision deteriorated? I consulted an optician and he said my sight was only marginally worse. Deciding to overtake a huge lorry one torrential night, though, I lost my nerve halfway, convinced I couldn’t judge the space properly and would either hit the central reservation or the great churning spokes of the wheels.
JAN22	Sexual violence against men in war is largely hidden and ignored - urgent action is needed to stamp it out	Sexual violence against men and boys in conflict remains largely hidden and ignored, neglected in terms of recognition, resources and policy provision, despite being documented in nearly every armed conflict in which sexual violence is committed. This silence is a result of under-reporting, the prioritisation of women and girls, and international policy frameworks, stemming from the United Nations, that structurally discriminate against male survivors of sexual violence. Failure to address the suffering of male victims has profound consequences for the survivor, his family and his community – an outcome that makes sexual violence such a potent weapon in war.
JAN22	So the Scottish Stonehenge was a fake. Do we really care?	When my late mother-in-law sold her draughty manse in a remote Scottish village, she was surprised by the buyer’s interest in a stretch of derelict wall at the edge of the vegetable patch. “They seem to think it’s a medieval castle,” she said, “but it’s just an old farm building.” Whatever the truth of the matter, the new owner seemed ecstatic about her “ruins” and the supposed Ley Line underlying the house. Hey presto! Everyone was happy. The truth is, many a folly, cairn or stately edifice isn’t quite as venerable as it looks and one of the delights of travelling the British Isles is trying to solve the conundrum: ancient or modern?  Just look at Edwin Lutyens' Castle Drogo in Devon, built between 1911-31 with the express intention of fooling viewers into believing it had been there for centuries. Then there’s the Cerne Abbas Giant, which admirers have linked to both the Celts and Saxon deities - although the inconvenient truth is that there are no mentions of the figure at all before the 17th Century.
JAN22	At last, Parliament has granted MPs 'baby leave' - I was forced to hide my three pregnancies	Today in Parliament there was a brief - and rare - moment of cross party delight. Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom announced that, at last, MPs will have baby leave. Two weeks for men and six months for women when they can - if they choose - also vote by proxy.   Until now MPs’ babies have been invisible to Parliament’s procedures. The rules were originally set up for a Parliament full of men (it was 93 per cent male when I was first elected in 1982); their wives at home looking after their families, so they could decide the affairs of state. The handful of women that were in the House either had no children, or their children had grown up. So I shrouded my three pregnancies under tent-like maternity dresses and depended on the whips to grudgingly grant me permission to be off when I was in labour and in the weeks after.
JAN22	Too many women in Britain are having their money controlled by their partners - this is real abuse	When you think of domestic abuse, money is not the first thing that comes to mind. In fact, financial abuse can sound like it's not a 'real' thing at all. But when you have no money, you have fewer options. You can feel completely trapped. Even if you can get a refuge space, without money you don’t have any means of physically getting there. That's pretty real.  Economic abuse is rarely talked about, but it is how many abusers control their partners. It can include: controlling access to money, refusing to let a victim access a bank account, making her pay her wages into the abuser’s bank account, and insisting that she reports every penny spent.
JAN22	Fiona Bruce is just the latest target of Momentum's monstering	Fiona Bruce has been in the BBC Question Time chair for just one week in succession to David Dimbleby and is already a target for Labour Left-wingers. The source of this friction is the appearance on her programme last week of Diane Abbott, the Labour shadow home secretary. During one exchange among panellists, Ms Bruce backed claims that Labour was behind the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Ms Abbott said this was “clearly repeating Tory propaganda”. There were also claims that in a warm-up for the programme, comments were made to the audience that mocked Ms Abbott’s past relationship with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. These had allegedly “legitimised racist abuse”. It is true that Ms Abbott has been on the receiving end of misogynist and racist abuse online but this was clearly not intended in that way. Moreover, it is true that Labour is behind the Conservatives in two of the three latest opinion polls and level in a third. What is going on here is equally clear. The Labour party’s Momentum bullies, diverted from targeting moderate MPs and Jewish women, have decided to cow Ms Bruce into thinking twice before saying anything that the party considers unfair, whether true or not. We have seen this behaviour before. One woman Labour MP felt sufficiently concerned that she attended the party’s annual conference with a bodyguard. The BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg also needed a security detail to report on the Labour conference.
JAN22	Mrs May has a slim chance to save her deal	There was a certain logic to Mrs May’s assessment of the current state of Brexit as she delivered yet another statement to the Commons on how to resolve the current impasse in the process. After consulting opposition parties (though not the Labour leader) the Prime Minister said she was rejecting the two principal requests they had made. She would not rule out a no-deal Brexit, which remains the default position in the absence of an agreement, and she remained hostile to a second referendum. This first option would go against the referendum result while the second did not command a majority in the Commons. Ergo, she said all that was left was the deal that the Commons rejected last week by a record 230-vote majority, albeit with a few tweaks on the issue of the Irish border backstop and the procedure for talks on the UK’s future trade relationship with the EU. Jeremy Corbyn maintained that nothing had changed; but he was unable to say, as always, what it was that Labour would do instead beyond vague and undeliverable promises to renegotiate a deal that the EU says cannot be reopened. His continued refusal to sit down and talk to the Prime Minister about how Parliament can find a way to secure Brexit is an abdication of leadership.
JAN22	As MPs prepare to take control of Brexit, this will be a blue Monday for Theresa May	Today is Blue Monday, said to be the most miserable day of the year. For Theresa May it promises to be Black Monday, the day when it finally becomes apparent that she is no longer able to govern. Such is the nature of the crisis engendered by the calamitous failure of her Brexit plan that MPs are preparing to wrest control of its central domestic and foreign policy from the executive. This would be unprecedented, though hardly unexpected given the mess the Government is in. Yet there is no reason to believe this parliamentary putsch would resolve matters. Mrs May will return to the Commons today to outline her Plan B after the deal with the EU was defeated so comprehensively last week. Her presence in the House is itself testament to the growing power of MPs as normal party loyalties collapse. The Prime Minister is only appearing at the Despatch Box because she was instructed to do so by a vote of MPs which the Government considered to be out of order but which Speaker John Bercow allowed. We are witnessing the normal distribution of power under our constitution shifting before our eyes. Judging by the read-out from Mrs May’s meetings with Opposition MPs (though still not with Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader) she has not budged on the red lines that have so far prevented her making any concessions. Ministers and No 10 spent the weekend making it apparent that what they wanted was for the EU to compromise on the Irish backstop.

JAN23	Remainers have sabotaged Mrs May's hopes of a Brexit compromise	Almost 30 years ago, Geoffrey Howe resigned from Margaret Thatcher’s government and mortally wounded the prime minister with a devastating attack on her Euroscepticism. “It’s like sending our opening batsmen to the crease,” he said, “only for them to find that before the first ball is bowled, their bats have been broken by the team captain.” Today, the roles are reversed. The team captain, Theresa May, is heading for the middle with a bat that has been broken by her pro-European team‑mates. While her aim is to secure changes to the Irish backstop that will allow Conservative MPs to back her Withdrawal Agreement, the political classes, past and present, are working to ensure that she will fail. We are approaching the moment in negotiations when, conventionally, compromises are made and deals are done. In Brussels, they say nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and they only agree everything at one minute to midnight. Sure enough, with a little more than two months until Britain leaves the European Union, there are signs that compromises might be possible.
JAN23	We in Calais are ready for no deal, but is Britain?	We can spend our time bemoaning the uncertainty arising from Brexit. We can talk forever about missed opportunities. Or we can collectively decide, as Europeans and Britons, to pull ourselves together and act. And we need to act immediately. This is what we have been doing for several months in the Hauts-de-France region, with the French government’s local administration, to ensure the ports of Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk, as well as the Eurotunnel and airports, have 100 per cent fluidity on day one in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Yes, I would like to make it absolutely clear: our ports and the Eurotunnel will be ready, including in the event of a no deal. But we are in a bilateral relationship: Dover and the Eurotunnel in Folkestone also need to be ready, and British road infrastructure needs to adapt.
JAN23	Dyson's move shows that the Thatcherite dream of a free-market Brexit is dying	What was Sir James Dyson thinking? The decision by Britain’s most successful pro-Brexit entrepreneur to choose such an inopportune moment to relocate the HQ of his eponymous empire to Singapore is a gift to the Remainer establishment. Symbolism is what matters in politics: the fact that only two employees are moving, and that Dyson is continuing to invest vast amounts in the UK, will go unnoticed. His critics will only remember that he is engineering his very own Dysexit, and the Leavers now have one fewer entrepreneur at their disposal to make the bullish case for post-Brexit Britain.  Yet while the “optics” are bad – and Sir James maintains in our business pages that the move has nothing to do with Brexit – he is being ruthlessly consistent. The vision of Leave-supporting entrepreneurs like him came in two parts: a radical break with the EU, including single market regulations, and for the UK to rebuild its economy by encouraging wealth-creation.
JAN23	Forget talk of an EU army, the West needs NATO more than ever	Much has been made of Angela Merkel’s announcement yesterday that her and Emmanuel Macron’s signing of an update to the 1963 Elysee Treaty could “contribute to the creation of a European army”. But where the future of Europe’s security is concerned, a much more significant event happened in Washington, D.C. on the same day: the House of Representatives passed legislation that seeks to bar President Donald Trump from unilaterally withdrawing the United States from NATO.  While it is true that the bonds of the Transatlantic Alliance are loosening in the current political climate, it is also true that neither the US or Europe can do without the world’s largest and oldest defence organization — and the less said about a European army, the better.  The original Elysee Treaty set the seal on the post-war reconciliation between France and Germany. With the updated Treaty, France and Germany agreed to establish common positions and issue joint statements on major EU issues in order to bolster “Europe’s capacity to act autonomously”. More than this, however, they committed to a “common military culture”. Practically, this means not only developing Europe's military capabilities, but also exploring the possibility of joint military deployments and the establishing of a Franco-German defence and security council. 
JAN23	Is Jacob Rees-Mogg starting to panic that 'Europhile kamikaze MPs' could box him in?	One might have wondered if Tory Brexiteers were softening after Nadine Dorries suggested on Monday night that fellow Brexiteers could end up voting for Theresa May’s deal to save it from “these Europhile kamikaze MPs”. But Jacob Rees-Mogg sought to knock such an idea on the head today, declaring at a Eurosceptic gathering that while he hoped for “reformation of this deal to make it more acceptable”, he could not vote for it “as long as the backstop is there”. Given that Theresa May has repeatedly warned that “there’s no deal without the backstop”, its disappearance looks nigh-on impossible. And if he means exactly what he says, that suggests he and his like-minded Eurosceptics would not be satisfied even if the Prime Minister secures a big change to it like a time-limit. Although Europhiles argue a time-limit would no longer make it a backstop, so by that token it could be enough to convince them it has been effectively taken out.  In that spirit, Eurosceptics will get to consider a Brexit-friendly amendment from Tory MP Andrew Murrison, who wants ministers to secure a time-limit on the backstop. He suggested on Twitter yesterday that it would just be “short and sweet” and invite MPs to “insist on an expiry date to the backstop”. The order paper shows that he has since made clear there would be an expiry date of December 31 2021. That was what he suggested last week in an amendment for Mrs May’s deal, but it was not selected by John Bercow for consideration.

JAN23	Letters: The public has lost faith in the ability of MPs to carry out the essential surgery that is Brexit	SIR – In light of the Brexit chaos in the House of Commons, we should be glad that these MPs do not run the NHS.  Imagine that, after a prolonged discussion, a patient is told that an appendectomy is required. All the benefits and side-effects have been discussed, and the patient has elected and fixed a date for the procedure. However, some of the doctors don’t like that idea; they don’t believe in surgery. Some of them declare that the patient needs the kidney removed instead. Others vote that the surgeon is not up to performing the surgery and should be sacked. Others want to sack the management team for not treating the patient. The physicians then refuse to talk to the surgeon in a multidisciplinary meeting until the surgeon drops the idea of surgery.

JAN24	Donald Trump might be just the man to topple President Maduro and save Venezuela	The collapse of Venezuela is one of the greatest human tragedies of our time, all the worse because every part of it was avoidable. Gang violence is now such that, by some estimates, a child is killed there every eight hours. Add the adults, and it’s a violent death every 25 minutes. Mothers sit on rubbish heaps scavenging for food, prices double every month, thousands flee every day. Not so long ago, this was the wealthiest country in Latin America. Most Venezuelans now live on standards comparable to those of Bangladesh or Congo. The rest of the world can only look on in horror. Donald Trump may not be the most obvious solution to all this, but his actions on Venezuela this week have been decisive, subtle and effective. The problem is Nicolas Maduro, who has taken the radical socialist policies of his mentor, Hugo Chavez, to their destructive conclusion. The nationalisations (at the time hailed as a model by Jeremy Corbyn) led to economic chaos and hyperinflation. Maduro has now rigged elections and violated the constitution, but for the first time he now faces a united and energetic opposition led by Juan Guaidó, whom Trump has just recognised as the “interim” president of Venezuela. Within an hour of Trump’s announcement, Guaidó was also recognised by Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia, Guatemala, Paraguay and Peru. In Caracas, thousands of protesters gathered to cheer Guaidó on during a mock swearing-in ceremony. A democratic movement to displace Maduro is now underway, with backing across Latin America and Trump offering co-ordination and support. His strategy is to do what he can to bolster Juan Guaidó, the 35-year-old leader of the Venezuela National Assembly, and encourage change to come from within.
JAN24	I've finally woken up to how damaging Instagram can be	Instagram is a thing. A young people’s thing. The last time I looked, it was all Parisian pastel macaroons and gilded teenagers paddle boarding on Lake Tahoe. But, hand on heart, that was 2014, when my elder daughter was 12 and preoccupied with both of the above. In the intervening years, she’s moved on. So has Instagram. And now, belatedly, so have I. This week, the scales have fallen from my eyes, shattered into a million pixels. Far from being the online equivalent of a teenage magazine, a shared scrapbook of moments and thoughts with a smattering of aspirationally attractive role models, Instagram harbours sinister secrets and cynical fakery. Self-harm imagery. Bleak nihilism. The normalisation of self-hatred. The “inspirational” quotes giving voice to suicidal intent.
JAN24	Why are elites branding brutal dictatorships like Venezuela and Zimbabwe as victims of 'populism'?	I was under the impression that the problem with Zimbabwe was that for nearly 40 years it was run by a Marxist thug who brutally oppressed his people, and that when he was finally deposed it was taken over by one of his former associates who really isn’t much better. The human catastrophe of Venezuela, on the other hand, seemed to be a product of a socialist president who hadn’t the faintest idea of how economies worked and his malignant, hand-picked successor. But it seems I am at fault. What is wrong in both those countries is pretty much the same as is wrong in Brexit Britain, and it's all down to that catch-all of the moment: populism. According to a letter in the South African newspaper BusinessDay this week: “Zimbabwe is another example of the danger of populism, using fear, nationalism and race to manipulate gullible voters and keep your base motivated despite obvious flaws in your policies." Populism is a word which has been used liberally about Robert Mugabe and his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa, as well as opposition leader Nelson Chamisa.
JAN24	As a doctor, I fear the consequences of the rush to slash our use of antibiotics	Some are reluctant to take the drugs when they need them At this time of year, colds and flus drive many people in to their GP to ask whether they need an antibiotic for their sore throat, ears or cough - often creating dilemmas for  doctors. Antibiotic resistance is, of course, a big issue, with the health secretary Matt Hancock saying in a speech today that the problem is ‘as big a danger to humanity as climate change or warfare’. The government is launching a five year action plan to tackle the problem, incentivising drug companies to develop new medicines and ordering medics to cut use by 15 per cent.  The campaign has undoubtedly good intentions, but this problem is more complex than it first appears. Antibiotic prescribing is difficult. On one hand, no doctor wants to over prescribe - the vast majority of winter illnesses will come and go without any need for medication. But neither do we want to under prescribe. Conditions such as sepsis or meningitis often start in identical ways to a typical cold or flu. Trying to pick out the person who will go on to develop a life-threatening condition is enormously difficult. Being risk-adverse and over prescribing might seem safe - only to result in more antibiotic resistance, and bigger harms, later on. 
JAN24	The People's Vote campaign can almost taste victory – so why are they such a mess?	I was banging my head against my desk in a state of despair when the phone rang. I knew before I even answered who would be on the other line. It was the middle of the 2010 general election contest and I had just seen the news coverage of Gordon Brown’s now infamous encounter with Gillian Duffy, whose concerns about Eastern European immigration had caused the prime minister to dismiss her as “bigot”. Fortunately he did so in the privacy of his car – what could possibly go wrong? Up in Scotland, I knew that the first person who would call me to discuss events was David Cairns, who was fighting his own election campaign a few miles west of me in Inverclyde. David had been the first minister to resign from the government over his lack of confidence in Brown. “I told you this would happen!” he shouted down the phone. I attempted to respond with the reasonable observation that this calamity wasn’t precisely the event that David had been predicting for years. But I had to concede our leader had not handled things well.
JAN24	Delay tactics must not derail EU exit	In the shifting sands of Brexitthe latest battle is between those determined that the UK should leave on March 29 come what may and those equally intent on stopping that happening unless and until there is an agreed deal with the EU. Theresa May has pointed out many times that there already is a deal, one that she painstakingly put together over a period of more than two years.  She says there is a simple remedy for MPs wishing to avoid leaving without a deal and that is to vote for it. But when she asked for their endorsement she suffered the worst defeat in parliamentary history.  The Prime Minister’s Plan B is essentially to stick with the rejected deal in the hope that concessions from the EU over the Irish backstop will persuade enough opponents on her own side and the DUP to abandon their objections. 
JAN24	Fiona Bruce is just the latest target of Momentum's monstering	Fiona Bruce has been in the BBC Question Time chair for just one week in succession to David Dimbleby and is already a target for Labour Left-wingers. The source of this friction is the appearance on her programme last week of Diane Abbott, the Labour shadow home secretary. During one exchange among panellists, Ms Bruce backed claims that Labour was behind the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Ms Abbott said this was “clearly repeating Tory propaganda”. There were also claims that in a warm-up for the programme, comments were made to the audience that mocked Ms Abbott’s past relationship with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. These had allegedly “legitimised racist abuse”. It is true that Ms Abbott has been on the receiving end of misogynist and racist abuse online but this was clearly not intended in that way. Moreover, it is true that Labour is behind the Conservatives in two of the three latest opinion polls and level in a third. What is going on here is equally clear. The Labour party’s Momentum bullies, diverted from targeting moderate MPs and Jewish women, have decided to cow Ms Bruce into thinking twice before saying anything that the party considers unfair, whether true or not. We have seen this behaviour before. One woman Labour MP felt sufficiently concerned that she attended the party’s annual conference with a bodyguard. The BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg also needed a security detail to report on the Labour conference.
JAN24	Mrs May has a slim chance to save her deal	There was a certain logic to Mrs May’s assessment of the current state of Brexit as she delivered yet another statement to the Commons on how to resolve the current impasse in the process. After consulting opposition parties (though not the Labour leader) the Prime Minister said she was rejecting the two principal requests they had made. She would not rule out a no-deal Brexit, which remains the default position in the absence of an agreement, and she remained hostile to a second referendum. This first option would go against the referendum result while the second did not command a majority in the Commons. Ergo, she said all that was left was the deal that the Commons rejected last week by a record 230-vote majority, albeit with a few tweaks on the issue of the Irish border backstop and the procedure for talks on the UK’s future trade relationship with the EU. Jeremy Corbyn maintained that nothing had changed; but he was unable to say, as always, what it was that Labour would do instead beyond vague and undeliverable promises to renegotiate a deal that the EU says cannot be reopened. His continued refusal to sit down and talk to the Prime Minister about how Parliament can find a way to secure Brexit is an abdication of leadership.
JAN24	Letters: No wonder voters are angry at MPs’ betrayal of Brexit commitments	SIR – What an earth is going on? What are MPs playing around at? It really is quite simple. 1. The country voted to leave the EU.
JAN24	Letters: The people have already made their decision on Brexit, but Parliament won’t implement it	SIR – Two points might be added to Professor John Curtice’s excellent article (Comment, January 23) about a second referendum. First, why do people say: “Parliament can’t decide, so let’s put it back to the people”? The people have already decided. It’s Parliament that won’t implement their decision. Secondly, why should Parliament honour a second referendum when they ignored the first?
JAN25	China copied the West's debt addiction - and now the bubble is bursting	Forget Brexit - the next global crisis could be made in Beijing The figures make for scary reading. Of the 200 senior executives in manufacturing firms surveyed by the bank UBS, over a third said they had already moved some of their operations abroad in the past year. Another third said they plan to do so soon. But this isn’t backwards, broken, Brexit Britain. It’s Xi Jinping’s China. Almost unnoticed in Britain, the biggest tectonic plates of the global economy are shifting. Here, almost the only signs that we’ve noticed are the job cuts at Jaguar Land Rover and Ford. In Germany, there is talk of a recession. The Davos crowd, wrong-footed at every turn, has lurched from praising Mr Xi for championing globalisation in 2017 to applauding George Soros this week as he called the Chinese premier a “mortal threat” to open society.
JAN25	The Queen is right: we need common ground – and it is there, if we only try	The powerful are trying to pretend the world hasn't changed Davos has its WEF (World Economic Forum). Sandringham has its WI (Women’s Institute). More wisdom comes from the latter. In Davos this week, the Remain chorus made the snowy valleys echo with their plaintive yodelling. We heard from the Chancellor, Philip Hammond (more of him later); from his illustrious predecessor, George Osborne; from Roland Rudd, Labour PR man and brother of Remainer Cabinet minister, Amber; from the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, who wants “a European empire”; from the head of Goldman Sachs, and from Tom Enders, head of Airbus.
JAN25	Let's be honest – being fat is not just bad genes	What news! My whole identity has been shattered. My world view has been obliterated. It’s devastating stuff. Apparently, being thin is down to genes and not, as I have long insisted, due to physical and (above all) moral superiority. Luck, that’s all it is. Whether you disappear side-on, or have to be lifted out of your armchair with a crane, there is no virtue or blame attached either way. Such are the findings of a new DNA study which tracked more than 10,000 people – some skinny, some average and some obese. Apparently, I am stick thin not because I have a will of iron and can resist stuffing my cakehole but because, as lead researcher Sadaf Farooqi puts it, I have a “lower burden of genes that increase a person’s chances of being overweight”. She thinks I should ditch my sneering as a result. Fat chance!
JAN25	There's one way for England to achieve Brexit – and that's by achieving independence from the UK	Ever since the EU referendum, Scottish Nationalists have said their country should leave the UK to stay in the EU. Yet, even with Brexit at risk of being cancelled, it never occurs to the English to play a similar game: leave the UK to leave the EU. Is English independence from the UK so unthinkable? Only because nobody thinks about it. More than 53 per cent of people in England voted Leave, rising to more than 60 per cent in some regions. Why should the English, by far the largest proportion of people in the UK, be denied the Brexit they so clearly want? Yes, there are some who feel more British than English, for whom leaving the UK would be deeply hurtful. But they’re a dwindling minority.
JAN25	What if the WI were negotiating Brexit?	The government has overcooked the jam  “I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture.” The Queen has spoken at the 100th anniversary tea of the Sandringham Women’s Institute. As a WI member (Chinley & Buxworth, in the Derbyshire High Peak) my heart swelled with pride, as did the hearts of a quarter of a million women members in 6,000 branches throughout the country. She is The Boss, our national President.
JAN25	The public expects to see more officers on the beat in response to rising crime	Violent crime in England and Wales rose by 20 per cent in the year to September, according to the latest official figures, with the murder rate the highest for a decade. By any measure this is a significant and worrying trend; and yet the response from the Government borders on the complacent. Nick Hurd, the Police Minister, issued a statement to declare that “today’s statistics show that your chance of being a victim of crime remains low.” He added: “But we accept certain crimes, particularly violent crime, have increased and we are doing everything possible to reverse the trend.” What does that entail? “A Serious Violence Strategy emphasising early intervention; treating violence as a public health issue; and working to prevent young people from being drawn into a life of crime.” All these initiatives have merit, but where is the ministerial pressure for the police to put more officers on the streets? Operational decisions are matters for the police but the Home Office could at least make it clear that the public expects to see a greater deployment of beat officers. It is the absence from the streets of the forces of law and order that allows violent criminals to take over. The drugs rackets they control grow, the turf wars intensify and the violence worsens.
JAN25	Ministers should not be talking down the economy	Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, told business leaders in Davos that a no-deal withdrawal from the EU would be “a betrayal of Brexit”. This is an odd interpretation of what happened in June 2016. Voters were given the option of staying in the EU or leaving, and chose the former by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. The betrayal would be not to leave; yet the strategy being adopted by Mr Hammond and other Cabinet ministers threatening to resign unless no-deal is abandoned could well bring that about. We appreciate it is not the Government’s policy to leave without a deal. But the fact is, the agreement Theresa May reached with the EU was resoundingly defeated in the Commons; and while some opponents say they are changing their minds, it seems unlikely she will ever win this vote. All the efforts of those who supported Remain are now focused on avoiding no-deal. Arguably, if they were to respect the referendum result, they would be expended on avoiding staying in.

JAN25	Letters: The trouble with Philip Hammond’s denial of a no-deal Brexit option	SIR – What do Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, and his allies think they are doing in campaigning for “no deal” to be taken off the table? I can understand Jeremy Corbyn arguing for it, since his aim is to make things as awkward as he can for the Conservatives, but for a Government minister to do so is unforgiveable. Does he not realise he is acting as a stooge for Brussels, encouraging the EU in its obduracy and making it hard for Theresa May to get any meaningful change to the Withdrawal Agreement? The sooner Philip Hammond is consigned to the back benches by a new prime minister the better.

JAN26	Where are the lost voices of Brexit?	I was at one of my favourite restaurants in Soho the other night. The food was typically good, served with a warm smile, which, by London standards, is enough to rate the service outstanding. So far so politically neutral, until I walked into the trendy unisex lavatory. Adorning the hand dryer were several “BOLLOCKS TO BREXIT” stickers. “It’s not a done deal” said the tagline, in a slightly less angry script. I doubt the restaurant intended to be inhospitable to Brexiteers like me. The stickers might have been put there by a customer, and the management chose not to remove them, assuming there was little chance that some of their loyal patrons may have committed the cardinal sin in the book of cosmopolitan Londoners and voted Leave. And why should it? Since the referendum, it has suited everyone – from the media to politicians – to create lazy stereotypes of Leavers and Remainers, because that way one can pick a side and firmly pitch one’s tent. Are you representing middle-class, urban Remainers in Hampstead or the left-behind working class Leavers in Hartlepool?
JAN26	The public haven't changed their minds on Brexit – now it's time for MPs to give voters what they want	In Westminster there is no shortage of politicians willing to tell you that people did not know what they were voting for in the referendum. The public were duped, so these MPs say, by a dodgy campaign that promised them the moon on a stick. Some of those politicians will be honest enough to admit that they think Brexit should be cancelled and the people saved from themselves before any lasting damage is done. While I don’t agree with them, I grudgingly respect their conviction. Yet many more MPs are unwilling to be quite so clear on their suggested remedy. Hesitant to say they want to block Brexit, they talk of a People’s Vote or a People’s Assembly. Others want to tie the whole Brexit process in knots in the hope that it all becomes too difficult and goes away. They believe Brexit is a calamity; they want to see it done in, but they don’t want their fingerprints on, or anywhere near, the corpse. You’d think that if Brexit really was so disastrous and if the people really had been so completely misled, these MPs would be on TV openly championing its demise. But they’re not – and that’s because hundreds of them represent constituencies that voted to leave, and when they escape SW1 at the end of the week, they meet constituents who say they know exactly what they voted for. They’ve not changed their minds and they’re not scared that we’re teetering on the brink of disaster. They’re just angry that Parliament seems incapable of delivering what they voted for and still very much want. That anger is growing, too. The Brexit process is being meddled with, parliamentary procedure is being arbitrarily changed and people are starting to feel cheated.
JAN26	Don't listen to the scaremongers – Huawei is not a security threat to Britain	Recently, it seems it is all the rage for Western governments and media to call Chinese companies a “security threat”. This has caused needless anxiety and even led to a ban in some countries on companies such as the Chinese telecommunications business Huawei. However, such accusations are groundless and misleading. If left unchecked, they could disrupt market rules, undermine company confidence, poison business cooperation, and cause uncertainties and instabilities in the world economy. As China’s ambassador to the UK, I know that the best argument against the allegation of security threat is Huawei’s success in this country. It is, first of all, a classic case of win-win cooperation. Huawei UK has made an important contribution to the economic and social progress of its host country over the past five years by bringing £2 billion to Britain through investment and procurement and creating 7,500 jobs, making a name for itself as a provider of high-quality products and services. In the process of its cooperation with British partners, the company itself has expanded its global reach and adapted to international standards.
JAN26	Could the Covington stand-off spell the end for the medieval social media machine?	By now, the technique should be grimly familiar. Someone sees something they dislike and decides that it is offensive, preferably to a fashionable minority group. An edited version of the incident is put on social media, taken out of context in order to make the “culprit” – safest if it’s a member of an unfashionable “privileged” group – look as terrible as possible. A few people ask whether this is a fair reflection of reality, whether the vitriol is deserved. It hardly matters. The intimidation has begun, the individual has been named, his reputation is in tatters, and perhaps even the police have turned up to investigate whether a “non-crime hate incident” has taken place. Most victims of this unjust process give in and apologise: whatever the truth of the matter, better a quiet life than fight the many-headed monster of social justice web warriors, ultra-liberal academics and their allies in the media. The effect is censorship by fear. A bullying Left doesn’t need to change any minds, just make it too toxic for anyone to disagree with them. But last week, something changed. A group of boys from a Catholic high school in Covington, in the US, looked as if they would be subjected to a textbook example of the above process. A Native American activist, Nathan Phillips, was apparently harassed by the boys, who were wearing Make America Great Again hats at a rally in Washington. An image went viral on the internet of one boy smiling – or “smirking” – at Mr Phillips, in an “aggressive encounter”. Credulous pundits damned the boy as the typical, arrogant racist American male and he was named on social media. He was guilty not because they knew definitively what he had done, but because of what he apparently represented, an almost medieval form of punishment by group association.
JAN26	The government is guilty of ‘a gross dereliction of responsibility and a huge failure of leadership’	Although scarcely noticed, the most significant speech by a British public figure last week came from Sir Ivan Rogers, the man who in January 2017 resigned as our ambassador to the EU after warning of the “muddled and ill-informed thinking” behind the way the Government had chosen to approach Brexit. To a packed audience at University College London, he painted a devastating picture of why he sees our national debate over Brexit as having been all along “bedevilled by fantasies and delusions”. These, one might have hoped would by now have been “dissipated in the face of reality” – but they are “still being propagated on all sides”, he said. Demolishing one of those delusions after another, nothing better reflected the trenchancy of his verdict than the language with which it was peppered: “bizarre”, “fatuous”, “piffle”, “patently absurd”, “demagogic rhetoric”, “vacuous pomposity”. As we appear to be sliding towards the “cataclysm” of a no-deal exit, the performance of the Government and our entire political class, says Sir Ivan, has amounted to “a gross dereliction of responsibility and a huge failure of leadership”. The first fatal mistake, as he sees it, was the deliberate decision of the official Leave campaign in 2016 not to suggest any specific plan for how best to leave; this subsequently allowed all the different competing factions to claim that their own delusional strategy was what the country had voted for.
JAN26	The public expects to see more officers on the beat in response to rising crime	Violent crime in England and Wales rose by 20 per cent in the year to September, according to the latest official figures, with the murder rate the highest for a decade.

JAN28	Our European friends are taking a huge risk if they abandon Mrs May	Whatever happens in the Commons on Tuesday evening, Theresa May is likely to be going back to EU leaders with a request for some serious help. Either Sir Graham Brady will carry his amendment calling for the infamous “backstop” to be sorted out some other way, or Yvette Cooper will succeed in laying out a timetable that leads to the postponement of Brexit in the absence of a deal. Or perhaps nothing at all will be carried, but with less than 60 days to go to March 29, the Cabinet will finally fall apart when faced with a looming no-deal Brexit. One way or another, the Prime Minister can only avert a final meltdown if the EU decides to give her some meaningful assistance. To be useful, such assistance would have to have legal force, whereas the EU’s current position is that it can only change the aspirational “political declaration”, not the proposed treaty. It would have to place a time limit on the backstop, as helpfully suggested by the Polish foreign minister, or allow the UK to withdraw from it if it threatened to become permanent. That could be done in an addendum, a codicil, or a legal instrument – adding to the deal rather than amending it.
JAN28	Throwing cash at teachers is not the best way to stop them abandoning the classroom	The new government plan to offer some secondary teachers 'retention-based payments' for staying in their jobs for three - and five - years won't solve the teacher retention crisis. One of the main reasons teachers leave the profession is excessive workload. A cash bonus for a minority of teachers will be very welcome to those that are lucky enough to receive it, I'm sure, but it won't make doing the job any easier. Reducing teachers' workloads will. I taught for a brief period, and got out because I lacked the resilience and extraordinary discipline to cope with the amount of planning and paperwork that all teachers have to get through, week in, week out. I am full of admiration for those who've stuck at it. I do know why they do, though. They're passionate about one of the greatest jobs there is: educating children – and that has little to do with cash bonuses. No teacher I know has gone into the profession for the money, the many rewards of teaching are far less pecuniary.
JAN28	Making obesity the new climate change is the last thing we need	Look around any developed country and it is obvious that there are a lot of people who eat too much. But there is another affliction of modern societies which too often gets overlooked: the greed for attention. If members of the Lancet Commission on Obesity had a taste for food as great as their appetite for hyperbole, their bellies would prevent them getting near a dining table. In a paper published this week, they claim that obesity, along with undernutrition (in the developing world) and climate change, are all pandemics which make up a “Global Syndemic” – which, they helpfully explain, is a “synergy” of pandemics. It is difficult to know where to begin with this vast tureen of academic gobbledygook, but let’s start by examining the “pandemic” of under-nutrition. I don’t like to think of anyone going hungry in the world, but how can something be a pandemic when it has fallen markedly in recent decades? Hunger, according to the UN, has gone from afflicting 18.6 per cent of the world’s population in 1991 to 10.9 per cent in 2017. Using the word “pandemic” for obesity is also objectionable – it applies a term more commonly associated with infectious disease to what is largely a behavioural issue.
JAN28	Hate crime legislation could have been written by a child, we need to tear it up and start again	Over the last week, a chilling Orwellian tale has gripped the UK. Harry Miller, a docker from Humberside, was investigated by the county’s police force for liking a transphobic limerick on Twitter. The post was offensive, calling trans women “stupid” and commenting on “synthetic” hormones. Even so, it did not warrant the sinister response it received – more suitable for a country in which totalitarianism prevails. Clearly with very little else to do that day, Humberside Police recorded Miller’s behaviour as a “hate incident” and warned him to be more careful in the future. This debacle only became known to the world after Miller posted about it on Twitter. Humberside Police has since defended itself on the social media site, writing: “We take all reports of hate related incidents seriously.”
JAN28	The uselessness of our own MPs is the best argument I've yet seen for staying in the EU	It’s something that drives women insane, and you can see why. “Male incompetence” or perhaps more accurately, “deliberate male incompetence”, is probably the least attractive quality in a husband or boyfriend. “Sorry, I’m just useless at washing up.” Or “I’ve looked everywhere for it and it’s just not there!” In every case, the frustrated woman ends up doing the job originally attempted, half-heartedly, by the man, who is then free to concentrate on more important stuff, like watching telly, checking Twitter or categorising his CD collection alphabetically. As metaphors for our current Brexit impasse go, it’s not bad. We have a parliament whose job it is to sort out a sensible solution to leaving...
JAN28	Government must bear responsibility for Brexit running so close to the wire	It must have been a busy weekend for John Bercow.Ahead of tomorrow’s key votes in the House of Commons, it falls to the Speaker to decide which of more than a dozen amendments should be selected for the debate. His choice and the order in which they are taken could prove crucial to the whole Brexit process which remains in the balance with just two months to the departure day on March 29. In fact, as the timetable stands, Parliament has only 32 normal working days before Brexit is due. In that time a substantial amount of legislation remains to be put on to the Statute Book, whether or not Theresa May’s deal is eventually rescued by last minute concessions either from the EU or the Government. One of the amendments likely to be selected has been tabled by Yvette Cooper, the former Labour Cabinet minister, and would delay Brexit for up to nine months while the efforts continue to unblock the Parliamentary impasse.
JAN28	Without the wealthy, the Chancellor's balance sheet would have a sizeable hole	Rich people are routinely a target for Left-wing complaints about inequality and unfairness in society. But they also contribute mightily to mitigating the impact of income disparities through their taxes. The first comprehensive survey of the tax payments due from the country’s highest earners shows how Stephen Rubin, the majority owner of JD Sports, last year was liable to pay £182 million to the Exchequer. Of course his tax bill is a function of his considerable wealth; but without it there would a sizeable hole in the Chancellor’s calculations just from one individual alone.
JAN28	The establishment is trying to break Brexit	The establishment is waging war on Brexit on all fronts. In Parliament, it aims to overturn the referendum result with amendments to Theresa May’s withdrawal plan – itself a dreadful deal, but Remainers are consciously trying to make it worse. First, they want to take the no-deal default Brexit option off the table; second they want to delay leaving the EU by extending Article 50. This would be like tying Britain’s arm behind its back and then pushing it back into the negotiating chamber. Remainers are gambling either that Mrs May returns with a Brexit so soft that it would be pointless, or that the project is cancelled altogether. Outside Parliament, the establishment is trying to tinker with the very machinery of democracy. The sheer nerve of the Electoral Commission is remarkable. Its capacity to err is a matter of fact – such as when it misinterpreted the referendum spending rules – and the Telegraph has exposed the pro-Remain statements of some members of its board. We believe there is strong reason to scrap the commission and start all over again. And yet, astonishingly, it now wants the power to launch criminal proceedings against political parties and referendum campaign groups. Senior members of the commission even believe they can get this authority without parliamentary legislation – they would simply alter its enforcement policy, following a public consultation. The commission’s attempts to turn itself into a Tudor-style “star chamber” are part of a wider picture of elite bias. It should never be forgotten that the EU referendum was not held under fair circumstances: not only did the Remain side enjoy the endorsement of the British state, big business and foreign governments, but it also got a subsidy of £9 million in the form of a taxpayer-financed propaganda leaflet. Of course, when rules are broken by any side there needs to be investigation – but the commission cannot play prosecutor and judge, especially when the potentially partisan views of some of its members are a matter of record. Most voters don’t want to go on litigating the referendum result. They want the Government to get on with what they voted for – Brexit.
JAN28	Letters: Never mind the backstop, the whole deal’s a deceit on the British people	SIR – If no deal was – contrary to the Government’s stated position and the legislation enacted by Parliament – always considered worse than a bad deal, we’d know why the negotiations resulted in a terrible deal. The Government and a majority of MPs have wilfully perpetrated a deceit on the British people, who will no doubt take their revenge at the next election. Philip Duly Haslemere, Surrey
JAN28	Letters: Mothers, fathers and children handed down National Trust houses	SIR – It is bizarre that Rachael Lennon, a senior curator at the National Trust, should promote her politically correct agenda when we all know you cannot change history. She talks of prominence being given to a “hetero-normative” emphasis, which I assume to mean a normal family life (one mother, one father and perhaps children). Maybe so, but that is the way that so many National Trust properties survived for us to enjoy. Revisionists are presumably expressing their frustration that their politically correct agenda wasn’t recognised in times past. Now they have a field day.
JAN29	Time for Remainers and Leavers to unite to deliver the Brexit deal the people voted for	This endless Brexit dialogue has got to end and the rhetoric has got to stop. It’s time to deliver. Our fellow citizens want confidence, certainty and security, as well as an end to the political turmoil. We do have an opportunity to flourish outside the EU but for this to happen we must have a plan to deliver us through this pivotal moment in our history. Of course people want us to honour the referendum result – we entrusted this decision to the people in what turned out to be the biggest act of democracy in our nation’s history. But they also want us to come together and forge a mature compromise that enables us to leave on time and to plan for our post-Brexit future. They need us to get on with Brexit so that we can focus on the other issues that desperately require our attention, like the future of schools and hospitals. And they want us to guarantee the rights of our friends and neighbours who are EU citizens but who have made our country their home. Earlier this month, the Government was sent a clear message by Parliament: the terms of its Withdrawal Agreement were unacceptable. This now gives us a chance to outline terms that can command cross-party support as well as the public’s approval.
JAN29	Fiona Onasanya is going to prison for perverting the course of justice – so why won't she resign as an MP?	Fiona Onasanya has become the first sitting MP to be jailed in almost 30 years. The Labour member for Peterborough was sentenced to three months in prison for perverting the course of justice. A solicitor, she denied being behind the wheel of her car while speeding and her brother agreed to take the penalty points on her behalf. But the reason she is the first MP to be imprisoned for three decades is because she has refused to stand down. Other MPs accused of imprisonable offences resigned their seats upon being convicted. So, too, did Chris Huhne, the former Cabinet minister who was jailed for a similar offence in 2013 and stepped aside after pleading guilty. Miss Onasanya was convicted several weeks ago but sentenced only yesterday. She has been ejected from the Labour Party and has had plenty of time to resign her seat, but has declined to do so. She is not automatically required to step aside, since the jail term was less than 12 months; but this is to hide behind a procedural technicality.
JAN29	Brexiteers have given Theresa May two weeks to deliver her promised better deal	Theresa May has managed to persuade her Eurosceptic colleagues to give her a mandate from the House of Commons to take back to Brussels by backing Sir Graham Brady's amendment demanding "alternative arrangements" to the backstop.  This marks a rapprochement among Tory Brexiteers and their party leader, after they grew apart over her handling of the process. After she delighted them with her bold Brexit vision at Lancaster House, Mrs May increasingly disappointed them with the compromises she unveiled at Florence, Mansion House and then most infamously of all, Chequers.  Brexiteers were deflated by what they saw as the Prime Minister giving up the fight for what she set out as her goals, and farming out the negotiations to her top civil servant advisor Olly Robbins. Their growing disquiet culminated in an attempt to oust her as leader last month, and then their rejection en masse of her deal this month.
JAN29	Why social media does wicked things to impressionable young minds	After years of scrolling through stories about man’s inhumanity to man (and women and children), I thought I was pretty unshockable, desensitised even. Then I started researching the character of a teenage girl in my novel How Hard Can It Be? Emily is self-harming, but her parents haven’t noticed. That is partly because they are preoccupied with their own stressful lives. It’s also because their sixteen-year-old daughter is extremely good at hiding it and tells her mum and dad to “Back off” whenever they come too close. The main reason Emily and girls like her can keep their painful secret, though, is because the older generation simply hasn’t got a clue about self-harming and the DIY lessons in that cruel practice which their vulnerable children can access so easily on social media. To give you just one warped example I came across, when the One Direction star Zayn Malik quit the band in 2015, a hashtag started trending #Cut4Zayn. The idea seemed to be that girls could assuage their sorrow in some kind of communal blood-letting. If they searched for #Cut4Zayn or expressed upset or anxiety over his departure, a helpful algorithm would soon direct those tearful teenagers to pro-self-harm websites.
JAN29	We can win the war on superbugs but only with the right investment	Antibiotics are the precious pills that underpin our entire health system. They are the foundation of modern medicine and the bedrock of the treatments we take for granted – from chemotherapy to minor illnesses. Yet while we are often happy to accept that cutting-edge, life-saving treatments, like our most modern cancer therapies, will be expensive, the value our health systems attach to antibiotics is measly.
JAN29	If Mr Trump wants to topple Maduro, he needs a plan for what happens next	For an American president who set his face against interfering in other countries to bring about regime change, Donald Trump’s  actions in Venezuela mark a significant departure. He has withdrawn Washington’s recognition of  the government of Nicolás Maduro and thrown the weight of the US behind the opposition leader  Juan Guaidó.  The Left, who revered Mr Maduro’s mentor Hugo Chávez, have predictably denounced this as a US-backed coup. But Mr Trump is not acting in isolation. Other Latin American countries, bearing the brunt of the refugee crisis triggered by Maduro’s mishandling of the economy, want him out. So, too, do many EU countries, including Britain, who have joined Mr Trump in demanding fresh elections – this time, unlike last, free and fair. Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, has said if there are no new elections announced by next week, the UK will recognise Mr Guaidó as interim president “to take forward the political process towards democracy”.But while it is all well and good to denounce Mr Maduro for presiding over an economic and humanitarian catastrophe, the Americans and their allies need to be prepared for what might happen next.
JAN29	Government must bear responsibility for Brexit running so close to the wire	It must have been a busy weekend for John Bercow.Ahead of tomorrow’s key votes in the House of Commons, it falls to the Speaker to decide which of more than a dozen amendments should be selected for the debate. His choice and the order in which they are taken could prove crucial to the whole Brexit process which remains in the balance with just two months to the departure day on March 29. In fact, as the timetable stands, Parliament has only 32 normal working days before Brexit is due. In that time a substantial amount of legislation remains to be put on to the Statute Book, whether or not Theresa May’s deal is eventually rescued by last minute concessions either from the EU or the Government. One of the amendments likely to be selected has been tabled by Yvette Cooper, the former Labour Cabinet minister, and would delay Brexit for up to nine months while the efforts continue to unblock the Parliamentary impasse.
JAN29	Without the wealthy, the Chancellor's balance sheet would have a sizeable hole	Rich people are routinely a target for Left-wing complaints about inequality and unfairness in society. But they also contribute mightily to mitigating the impact of income disparities through their taxes. The first comprehensive survey of the tax payments due from the country’s highest earners shows how Stephen Rubin, the majority owner of JD Sports, last year was liable to pay £182 million to the Exchequer. Of course his tax bill is a function of his considerable wealth; but without it there would a sizeable hole in the Chancellor’s calculations just from one individual alone.
JAN29	Letters: Never mind the backstop, the whole deal’s a deceit on the British people	SIR – If no deal was – contrary to the Government’s stated position and the legislation enacted by Parliament – always considered worse than a bad deal, we’d know why the negotiations resulted in a terrible deal. The Government and a majority of MPs have wilfully perpetrated a deceit on the British people, who will no doubt take their revenge at the next election. Philip Duly Haslemere, Surrey
JAN29	Letters: Mothers, fathers and children handed down National Trust houses	SIR – It is bizarre that Rachael Lennon, a senior curator at the National Trust, should promote her politically correct agenda when we all know you cannot change history. She talks of prominence being given to a “hetero-normative” emphasis, which I assume to mean a normal family life (one mother, one father and perhaps children). Maybe so, but that is the way that so many National Trust properties survived for us to enjoy. Revisionists are presumably expressing their frustration that their politically correct agenda wasn’t recognised in times past. Now they have a field day.
JAN30	Our decadent new elite can't see that it is sowing the seeds of its own ruin	If you want to understand modern Britain, picture us as split into two warring tribes that transcend the old Left-Right divide that once dominated our politics. The first group are the New Conservatives, wedded to the status quo, who don’t really believe that there is much that is wrong with our society that a few tweaks cannot address. Until the Brexit referendum, such people generally thought we were moving in the right direction; today, they drift in a state of shock, stunned that progress, as they define it, isn’t inevitable, and that many want to upset the applecart. The other group are the New Radicals: a heterodox bunch who are often uncomfortable revolutionaries. They look on, aghast, at our elites’s fin-de-siecle delusions, at their breathtaking self-satisfaction, and dream of the day that they can put them back in their place. Many New Radicals used to trust our institutions and were once small-c conservatives themselves; today, they believe the “system” to be broken, controlled by a selfish, morally-corrupt establishment committed to lining its own pockets.  Such a Manichean divide is a little simplistic, of course. Some of us belong to both camps – I certainly do – just as many people are at once “somewheres” and “anywheres”, to use David Goodhart’s taxonomy. Such classifications are also merely the latest variation on a never-ending binary theme: today’s New Radicals are the new Roundheads, even though, unlike the original variety, they generally hold Parliament in contempt. The New Conservatives are the 21st century Cavaliers, but today’s bunch believe in the “divine right” of the supposedly meritocratic, virtual-signalling cultural elite – rather than that of the monarchy – to rule unchallenged. 
JAN30	History makes it unlikely, but there are good reasons for Ireland quitting the EU	Ireland leaving the EU gets very little consideration as an option, despite it representing a potentially very neat way of resolving the current impasse over the Northern Ireland backstop. This is for good reason. The shared history of our islands has often been a troubled one and today in Ireland opinion polls show very strong support for the EU, especially since the current London/Brussels dispute has morphed, in many Irish eyes, into an old-fashioned Anglo-Irish spat. In such circumstances, it behoves all self respecting Irishmen and women to “don the green jersey”. And yet, the arguments - in particular regarding the economy - for Ireland quitting the EU and instead working in some sort of partnership with the UK are actually rather strong. No other EU country has such cultural, ethnic and economic connections with the UK.  The Irish Government estimates that there are over 500,000 Irish-born living in Great Britain. Spain, with just under 18,000, has the second highest number of Irish and France has less than 10,000. There are more Irish-born people living in Sydney than in France and Germany combined. The UK is Ireland’s most important trading partner, especially for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and also our agricultural industry. It is estimated that between 40 and 50 per cent of exports from Ireland’s SME sector are destined for the UK market. These industries are often situated in rural areas, away from Ireland’s affluent east coast where alternative employment would be difficult to obtain.
JAN30	When children never interact with strangers, it's no wonder Clarks has to teach them how to speak	News that Clarks shop assistants are to be taught how to talk to their youngest customers – in an effort to tackle a concerning decline in the ability of some pre-school children to string a sentence together – is at once a source of cheer and dismay. Dismay because I assumed people skills would be par for the course in a shoe shop. Cheer, because in our hyperconnected age there’s a risk of an entire generation growing up fluent in Fortnite but unable to maintain eye contact or conduct a conversation about Velcro fastenings with someone IRL. Oh, didn’t you know? Among youngsters, it stands for In Real Life; because unless you differentiate, how will anyone under the age of 14 know what you’re on about? No wonder the Department of Education is so pleased that Clarks is upping the communication ante and seeking to increase pre-school vocabulary, one pair of patent leather t-bars at a time.
JAN30	Theresa May toys with Labour customs compromise as her Brexiteer pitch unravels	Theresa May threw out lots of red meat yesterday in order to persuade Tory Brexiteers to back the Sir Graham Brady amendment ordering her to find “alternative arrangements” to the backstop. She promised to go as far as demanding that the Withdrawal Agreement is reopened in order to change it sufficiently, lavished praise on the 'Malthouse Compromise', and even suggested that the influence of her civil service aide, Olly Robbins, would be diluted by the added involvement of her ministerial colleagues, and other advisers. All this delighted Brexiteers. Iain Duncan Smith spoke excitably on Sky News this morning about the “really interesting” people who would be getting a greater say, like the Government’s chief international trade negotiator Crawford Falconer and its representative to the United Nations and World Trade Organisation Julian Braithwaite. “There ought to be more people like him,” the former Tory leader said about the latter man. But Brexiteer's delight will have waned fast on hearing that Number 10 had insisted there would be “no change” to Mrs May’s negotiating team and that Mr Robbins was still in charge. Given our past reports about his doubts about how much the backstop could be changed, his continued influence will lead Brexiteers – who are already wary of their party leader – to feel they are set for further disappointment.
JAN30	Touching, grabbing and insults: It can be scary running alone as a woman - men just don't understand	There is a lot that can stop women from running: body image, fear of failure, worries about injury… and perhaps biggest of all, the prospect of exercising in public. Because among the risks of outdoor fitness - especially with solo running - are genuine safety concerns. It doesn’t matter why you are pulling on your trainers - a sudden notion about going ‘couch to 5k’; the first time you’ve tentatively addressed your fitness since childbirth; the weekly lap around the local park that helps you stay sane - the buzzing anxieties that so often accompany us are the same.  Will they be there - those jeering kids that sit on the bench at the end of the road? Is it warm enough for van drivers to roll down their windows, ready to pass comment as they overtake? Is he following me, or merely running behind me? 
JAN30	Theresa May now needs to win concrete concessions from the EU	There has been a succession of crunch days on Brexit. Yesterday was supposed to be another, one that would produce clarity amid the fog of confusion. Yet it shed little light other than to confirm that a majority of MPs do not want to leave the EU without a deal. In the Commons, Mrs May said the way of avoiding no deal was to agree to her deal which was heavily defeated earlier this month. To that end, she reversed her previous resistance to reopening talks with Brussels and set the scene for a full-blown confrontation with the 27 in a bid to wrest some concessions on the Northern Ireland backstop. The obstacle to Mrs May’s plan is that the EU is not prepared to rewrite the text. There are also contradictions in the Prime Minister’s latest position. She told MPs that she remained committed to the concept of no hard border on the island of Ireland, which is what the backstop is intended to guarantee should there be no long-term trade agreement in place by 2021.
JAN30	If Mr Trump wants to topple Maduro, he needs a plan for what happens next	For an American president who set his face against interfering in other countries to bring about regime change, Donald Trump’s  actions in Venezuela mark a significant departure.

JAN30	Letters: MPs’ handling of Brexit has damaged the public’s faith in democracy	SIR – Philip Duly (Letters, January 29) is correct that the British people will take their revenge for the deceitful handling of Brexit at the next election. But who will they vote for? The country is effectively tied to a two-party system, with a first-past-the-post voting system, meaning that nothing will change and the established parties will keep on getting away with it. As an A-level politics student in the late Seventies, I was taught – and believed – that first-past-the-post was superior to proportional representation in terms of returning strong, stable government. Brexit has certainly disabused me of that belief.

JAN31	If Theresa May is robust with Brussels now, she may finally be able to get Brexit right	For all its bureaucratic lethargy, the European Union can certainly move fast when it wants to. This week, for example, it took just six minutes to reject Parliament’s request to amend the Brexit deal. The agreement cannot be reopened, it said, there’s nothing to discuss. But now, reality is beginning to bite. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has been saying that he’s confused, that he does not know what the UK wants. The perfect basis, therefore, to reopen talks with Theresa May. Now, she can explain not only what she wants but what Parliament will accept. This has given her an unexpected second chance to conduct a Brexit negotiation – and, this time, get it right. She has been taking advice from serving and former Cabinet members, who have all been quite consistent. The tight deadline, they have told her, can work in her favour – as long as she does not repeat the mistakes that brought her to this point.
JAN31	If A&E doctors can’t spot a child with sepsis, could a chemist?	Trust. Goodwill. Restorative cups of tea and world-class medicine. The NHS occupies such a unique place in our lives – our hearts – that any Government announcing root-and-branch reform must tread softly. We have a deep loyalty to our National Health Service and everything it stands for, despite its myriad flaws. We stoically put up with the understaffing and the endless waiting, the frustrations of trying to get a GP appointment or a cervical smear at a time that doesn’t require half a day off work or madly juggling childcare. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock waxes lyrical about mustering a new army of physiotherapists and paramedics as a relief force to assist our besieged family doctors and the conscription of pharmacists to the frontline of healthcare.
JAN31	In praise of ‘borecore’, the fashionable art of doing nothing	It’s a weekend night and I have two dinner invites. But instead of going I’m staying in. I’ve got big plans. I’m thinking a home-cooked meal, maybe a good bottle of red, a film, or maybe a board game with my boyfriend. Certainly nothing that will involve leaving the house, engaging with strangers or shouting over loud music. This is now what I look forward to. I fact, staying in is my definition of luxury. I’m a proud, twenty-nine year old convert to boring; suddenly obsessed with staying in, with White Company interiors, antique shops, pub lunches and BBC dramas. Oh, and board games- have I mentioned I love a good board game?
JAN31	Sajid Javid is mistaken if he thinks that rehashed Asbos will stop surging knife crime	I have seen first-hand the devastating effect knife crime can have. The damage one small blade can do is infinite. A single incident – often lasting just seconds – can end one life and damage others irreparably. As a police officer, believe me there is nothing I want more than an end to this terrible epidemic sweeping up our youngsters and blighting our communities. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid's announcement this week granting the police new Asbo-style powers to seek curfews and social media bans for knife crime suspects aged over 12 worries me. Clearly, the Home Secretary is trying to make a difference – and I can’t fault his aims – but rehashed Asbos is not the way to meaningfully deal with the problem. I have serious concern about how these orders will work in practice. For them to be granted in the first place, files will need to be prepared and presented to court, heaping the burden of more paperwork on to the shoulders of detective teams already struggling to cope.
JAN31	Ireland is again in the grip of Anglophobia	One hundred years ago, a small group of newly elected MPs met at the Mansion House in Dublin to declare Irish independence. Curiously, the passion that existed in Ireland back then for the inalienable right of nations to self-determination finds no contemporary echo when it comes to understanding the impulses that led to Brexit. On the contrary, the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, may have used the recent centenary of that First Dail to laud the aspiration to a “free, independent and democratic state”, but he shamelessly did so while asserting that it now finds its fullest expression in, and is best achieved through, membership of the EU. It’s a telling indication of where the Irish public mood stands right now that he got away with such absurd revisionism. EU membership has allowed Ireland to feel for once like the bigger party in its relationship with Britain, and that’s been good for self-confidence; but it has also encouraged Dublin to overplay its hand in the current crisis. As time runs out towards March 29, it would be only natural for the Irish to wonder in hindsight if they had made the right call by throwing in their lot with Brussels, at the risk of good relations with their nearest neighbour. As it happens, there is no evidence of such second thoughts in Dublin at all, despite the decision to back the UK into a corner, which threatens to sour the rest of Varadkar’s premiership.
JAN31	Unconditional menace	Universities are another industry that, in decades to come, will have to change. The push to send as many students there as possible, allied with new finance structures, has turned many universities into enterprises, sucking up applicants and churning out degrees. But what is the effect upon quality? One ominous sign is the number of courses that make unconditional offers, where students need not achieve any particular set of A-level grades to gain entry. New data reveal that the bulk of the dramatic increase in unconditional offers has come from about 20 institutions. Notably, the University of Suffolk, York St John University and the University of Bolton made over 70 per cent of their offers unconditional last year. How are these places of learning performing?
JAN31	It's unacceptable for the EU to refuse to hear Theresa May's case for reforming the backstop	The EU’s initial reaction to Theresa May’s decision to seek to reopen the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement reached in November has been lukewarm to say the least. No sooner had the House of Commons voted on Tuesday evening to send the Prime Minister back to Brussels to get a legal change to the controversial Irish border backstop provision than European Commission officials and heads of government were pooh‑poohing the very idea. In an address to the European Parliament yesterday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission president, and Michel Barnier, the EU negotiator, said they were prepared to talk further about the future relationship under the political declaration that was issued alongside the agreement, because they wanted to avoid a disorderly Brexit. But they were adamant that they would not revisit the text of the deal itself. Since Mrs May has pledged to obtain “significant and legally binding” changes, this poses an obvious and possibly insurmountable obstacle. Moreover, even if Mrs May does get another hearing in Brussels, the EU is clearly not going to remove the entire Northern Ireland protocol – the demand of Boris Johnson and other Brexiteers if they are to support the deal.
JAN31	Minister's plans for reforming foreign aid don't go far enough	Penny Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary,has caused a stir by saying what most people think: that the aid budget is unsustainable. Predictably, she has been denounced by Labour for “cynically undermining” Britain’s commitment to alleviating global poverty. Campaign organisations have joined in the criticism. Even some Tories say it reflects a shift in the party to the Right, as if the aid budget is supposed to be some sort of political virtue signal. In fact, Ms Mordaunt is not proposing an especially radical reform to the system. She is being far too diffident. The proposal she put to the Cabinet this week was modest – a suggestion that more could be raised from private philanthropists, banks and individuals.
JAN31	Letters: The Irish border backstop has been weaponised but mutual benefit suggests a solution	SIR – To avoid checks at the border with Northern Ireland, when Britain opted out of the Schengen area, the EU granted an exemption to Ireland. A similarly inventive formula applied to a German town, along with an Italian town, surrounded by Switzerland. To facilitate this, Switzerland (a non-EU country) joined Schengen and a local customs union was formed. Other creative arrangements exist for Gibraltar and two Spanish enclaves in North Africa, where various opt-outs have been granted, along with variations to supposedly strict EU policy. Although not directly analogous to Northern Ireland, there is even an EU accommodation in Cyprus which meets local difficulties with the Turkish-held northern section.
JAN31	Letters: MPs’ handling of Brexit has damaged the public’s faith in democracy	SIR – Philip Duly (Letters, January 29) is correct that the British people will take their revenge for the deceitful handling of Brexit at the next election. But who will they vote for? The country is effectively tied to a two-party system, with a first-past-the-post voting system, meaning that nothing will change and the established parties will keep on getting away with it. As an A-level politics student in the late Seventies, I was taught – and believed – that first-past-the-post was superior to proportional representation in terms of returning strong, stable government. Brexit has certainly disabused me of that belief.
FEB1	BBC bias is still skewing the Brexit debate	There are many good reasons to avoid Question Time on a Thursday night - from the ranty audience members to the unfunny Corbynista comics and the SNP politicians who somehow manage to link every issue, however tangentially, back to Scottish independence. Not for nothing does the show leave many viewers shouting at the TV while slugging petrol-strength wine (that’s my reaction at least). Recently it has also become a prime example of the Brexit bias which pervades the BBC. Question Time panels are regularly stacked with Remainers. Last night’s line-up featured only one Leave supporter (Camilla Tominey of this parish) alongside two remain-voting MPs and a remain-backing CEO. The arch priestess of Remain herself, Gina Miller, made a last-minute substitution for the footballer John Barnes. A quick number-crunch reveals that remainers outnumbered eurosceptic panellists by 4/1 on five of the last eight panels. I have yet to find a single occasion since the referendum where the show has actually reflected the views of the British public, with Leavers outnumbering Remainers.
FEB1	Technology is the new tobacco, and parents are losing the battle to protect their children from it	Ten years ago, I set up a company called Lady Geek, after a man in a phone shop tried to sell me a pink sparkly phone because I was a woman. My aim was to advise tech companies on how to make their products more suitable for women, and encourage girls into the industry. Technology to me was a great leveller – a way to make society more equal and to open up opportunity. Now, though? Today I keep our family devices locked in a safe with a 12-digit access code. I’ve also started a campaign called The Truth About Tech, to raise awareness about addiction to technology and to hold Silicon Valley to account. Technology in and of itself may be neither good nor bad, but it’s not neutral, and it’s certainly not the mirror of society that sociologists and psychologists would have us believe. It amplifies and pushes us in directions we don’t know we’re going in. It has become about pressure, not pleasure. It’s damaging us, and it’s seriously damaging our children.
FEB1	Our economy continues to confound the doomsayers. That ought to be good news for everyone	For some people, the only thing worse than a crisis is the absence of one. Many Whitehall observers - including Chris Giles in the Financial Times - have bemoaned the lack of a severe economic downturn, or at least a run on the pound, which might bring politicians face-to-face with the “harsh realities” of Brexit. It barely needs to be said that this is a very strange position to take. Even if you agree that we should be seeking a softer Brexit or no Brexit at all – and I don’t – it is quite something to effectively wish your fellow citizens were that bit poorer. The other problem is that these commentators are looking at this the wrong way around. The welcome resilience of the UK economy and financial markets is actually telling us something positive about Brexit. It is true, of course, that sterling initially fell sharply after the vote to leave the EU in 2016. However, it has since been relatively stable, despite constantly shifting expectations for the terms of the UK’s departure, or even whether Brexit will happen at all. There are many possible explanations for the currency markets’ apparent indifference. I prefer the simplest – that sterling has already priced in a lot of bad news in the UK, and is starting to benefit from a renewed focus on the mounting economic and political problems in the euro-zone and the emerging slowdown in the US.
FEB1	Why is Warwick University protecting men who made violent rape threats - and ignoring the 'terrified' victims?	Have you heard the latest jokes coming out of Warwick University? Here are some of the punchlines: “Sometimes it's fun to just go wild and rape 100 girls”; “Rape her in the street while everybody watches”. Oh and: “Rape the whole flat to teach them all [a] lesson." Hilarious right? This so-called “banter” appeared on a Facebook group of young men at the university, which was made public last year. The messages included rape threats against specific female students, who were singled out by name, some extreme in their suggestions of sexual violence (and which I cannot reproduce here). After formal complaints were made, 11 male students were suspended for up to 10 years. Something that has been reported almost as an aside is that the chat also included racist and anti-Semitic comments.   So imagine how those young women felt, this week, when they discovered that some of the students - who they quite reasonably must have imagined they would never see again - are to be allowed back on campus, after winning appeals against their suspensions.
FEB1	This is nothing compared to the Big Freeze of 1963 – when did us Brits become such snowflakes about the cold?	Back in  December, 1962, I was peering out of my dad’s  car window, as we inched our way, through a pea-souper fog,  to visit my dying grandad, in hospital. It was the last great smog before the clean air legislation kicked in but winter was only just beginning. As 1963 arrived, so did the Big Freeze. It stayed for two months. The River Thames froze. A  man cycled along it, near Windsor and a car drove across the ice, at Oxford. I was desperate to skate on the Thames but my mum wouldn’t let me. The sea froze for a mile out from  Herne Bay, Kent and Dunkirk. BBC News wondered whether the Strait of Dover would freeze across. The Thames didn’t freeze in Central London, mainly due to the hot effluent from two power stations, Battersea and Bankside. But in  the  Little Ice Age - roughly between 1350-1850 –  the London River Thames froze at least 23 times and in five of those years, the ice was thick enough to hold a Frost Fair. The fairs began when the watermen and lightermen, who had no income, in the freeze, earned money by charging for access to the ice. So,  instead of staying indoors and moaning about the weather, Londoners skidded onto the frozen river and partied. There was dancing, a fairground, a market and pop-up pubs,  called "fuddling tents" for obvious reasons!
FEB1	Free speech on campus begins with the academics	The Government is absolutely right to introduce uniform guidance on free speech in universities, but it shouldn’t even be necessary. Why can’t academics, who are supposedly motivated by the spirit of free inquiry, define and defend liberty themselves? Instead, students have been allowed to set the rules and, through no-platforming, noisy protest and “safe space” policies, make it difficult to engage in dialogue.  One issue, which the Government is addressing, is complicated guidance that critics say is open to exploitation. But the problem extends to the culture of the academy itself. Since the Sixties, the Left has taken over, imposing a consensus so deadening that a group of thinkers recently launched a journal of “controversial ideas” that offered to publish essays, if so desired, under pseudonyms. Groupthink and timidity are matched by entitlement, reflected in the Cambridge don who railed against college porters because they failed to call her “doctor”. She inferred racism. MPs must see that what’s taking place on campus is a microcosm of the wider society that politicians have had a hand in building. The ever-expanding definition of “hate crime” has turned nobodies into witchfinders, while many Britons feel they cannot say things for fear of being shouted down. No one approves of speech that is denigrating, bigoted or incites violence. But there has to be freedom to contest ideas within the constraints of the law – and that contest not only should exist on campus but also ought to be actively encouraged by authoritative university officials. Heaven knows they are paid enough.
FEB1	Social media must be regulated	In years to come, people will wonder why on earth governments took so long to regulate social media companies. They operate in a bizarre, grey space of their own. If this newspaper, for example, printed a letter that was obscene, threatening or libellous, we would rightly be held to account for it as a publisher. But social media escapes that definition. If it didn’t, several companies would probably go under trying to manage the vast amount of dark content that passes through their platforms. This newspaper recently revealed that Google has promoted graphic suicide manuals high up on its search results and that YouTube has allowed advertising on videos showing suicide methods (both companies feature the Samaritans contact number and YouTube has since pulled advertising from the clips).
FEB1	Unconditional menace	Universities are another industry that, in decades to come, will have to change. The push to send as many students there as possible, allied with new finance structures, has turned many universities into enterprises, sucking up applicants and churning out degrees. But what is the effect upon quality? One ominous sign is the number of courses that make unconditional offers, where students need not achieve any particular set of A-level grades to gain entry. New data reveal that the bulk of the dramatic increase in unconditional offers has come from about 20 institutions. Notably, the University of Suffolk, York St John University and the University of Bolton made over 70 per cent of their offers unconditional last year. How are these places of learning performing?
FEB1	Letters: Britain must not tolerate any more obstructive tactics from Brussels	SIR – Isn’t it time we realised that the EU’s leaders are going to keep coming up with stumbling blocks in the Brexit negotiations? It’s the Irish backstop today, but it will be something else tomorrow. They do not want their empire to shrink, and they will do whatever it takes to prevent Brexit from happening. However, the people of Europe will all wise up to this in due course, and the gravy train will eventually come off the rails. I cannot wait to see it happen.
FEB1	Letters: The Irish border backstop has been weaponised but mutual benefit suggests a solution	SIR – To avoid checks at the border with Northern Ireland, when Britain opted out of the Schengen area, the EU granted an exemption to Ireland. A similarly inventive formula applied to a German town, along with an Italian town, surrounded by Switzerland. To facilitate this, Switzerland (a non-EU country) joined Schengen and a local customs union was formed. Other creative arrangements exist for Gibraltar and two Spanish enclaves in North Africa, where various opt-outs have been granted, along with variations to supposedly strict EU policy. Although not directly analogous to Northern Ireland, there is even an EU accommodation in Cyprus which meets local difficulties with the Turkish-held northern section.
FEB2	I will battle for Britain in Brussels	Last Sunday, Parliament prepared to hold a series of votes of huge importance to the Brexit process.The menu of choices before MPs was extensive and, in some cases, had far- reaching and long term implications for the way the UK is governed. MPs were invited to back an amendment which would have given Parliament unprecedented power to direct the Government to extend the Article 50 process – frustrating Brexit and deferring the difficult decisions which remain to be taken before we leave the EU. They voted not to do so. MPs could have opted to seize control of the Parliamentary timetable from the Government in order to hold debates on matters such as holding a second referendum. They voted not to do so.
FEB2	The EU is taking the hardest possible line in the hope of derailing Brexit	On Wednesday, MEPs held a Two Minutes Hate against Britain. It wasn’t called that, obviously. Its official title was “The UK’s Withdrawal from the EU (debate)”. But it resembled the “hideous ecstasy of vindictiveness” described by George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four far more than it resembled a parliamentary debate. Journalists focused on the relatively restrained assertions by Michel Barnier, Jean-Claude Juncker and the other bigwigs that the backstop was non-negotiable and Britain should do as it was told. But the rank-and-file MEPs who spoke afterwards felt less need to be diplomatic. Guy Verhofstadt, the Liberal leader, warned us, “you gonna pay the price!” So bellicose was his tone that even the arch-Europhile Edwina Currie was prompted to respond, “Honestly, Guy, we British don’t like being told what to do. And shouting at us makes it worse.” Elmar Brok, a German Christian Democrat who blows aggressively through his moustache when he talks, and who is currently embroiled in allegations about profiteering from EU-funded constituency visits, dispensed with any niceties:
FEB2	If we get a proper Brexit, it'll be by accident rather than design	For a moment last week I felt a glimmering of sympathy for the EU negotiating team. Now there’s a sentence I never expected to write. But there they were – on the face of it anyway – pole-axed by what could be described as a complete betrayal by the UK government of an agreement that had been officially signed and delivered. What had been done was now being undone. The word of the British prime minister, given in apparent solemn good faith, could be trusted only until she came under political pressure. Just for a millisecond, Barnier, Juncker and Co had the moral high ground: Brussels could quite legitimately say that she had spent two years negotiating the Withdrawal Agreement and then personally signed it off in defiance of her own Cabinet (which had been sidelined) and her own party (which had been ignored), only to renege on it and demand the undoing of one of its most critical tenets, the Irish border backstop, whose problematic nature she and her team had clearly failed to anticipate.
FEB2	Don't send disgraced Labour MP Fiona Onasanya to jail	This is probably going to be the most unpopular column I write in 2019, but here goes. No useful purpose is served by sending Fiona Onasanya to jail. I understand that, in our current mood, a lot of us would lock up MPs for no other offence than being MPs. When a politician actually commits a crime, he or she attracts a level of frenzied rage that has little to do with the gravity of the offence. The past four days have seen phone-ins and social media pulsing with that self-satisfied sadism that possesses people when they feel their anger is legitimately targeted. It is true that the Labour MP for Peterborough has not exactly helped herself. A silly lie about who was driving her car escalated into an attempt to pervert justice. When sentence was passed, she declared that she had no intention of standing down as an MP, since her parliamentary salary is her sole source of income.
FEB2	Who takes responsibility for the latest 'snowmageddon'?	In the United States, managing the consequences of bad weather is regarded as an essential public service, and it can make or break politicians. The 2012 election was swung, say some, by Barack Obama’s efficient handling of Hurricane Sandy. Why, then, in bleak winter, does Britain suffer through disrupted flights, blocked roads and closed schools, with little clarity about who takes responsibility? There’s a case for saying a country with generally mild weather has no reason to invest as much money as, say, Chicago in dealing with snow. But if the Met Office says that UK weather is becoming more extreme, then there has to be a reaction – and a proportionate reaction, too. In some parts of the country, things have obviously been chaotic: teachers and students trapped, while over 100 people were forced to seek refuge in a pub on Bodmin Moor. In other areas, residents protest at apparent overreaction; the school is closed, but all they can see out of the window is a light dusting on the lawn. That means taking a day off work to look after the children, which has a knock-on effect upon the economy in a country that already has productivity issues. Britain is not a nation of snowflakes: it ought to be able to handle bad weather, whether that means braving out a light flurry or responding swiftly to emergencies. So why do we keep getting caught by surprise, and who will take responsibility? British politicians – like their US counterparts – should be as visible as possible, and the voters need to hold them to account, to think more like consumers.  We pay good money to government on the understanding that it exists to help out in moments exactly like this.
FEB2	Russia, not Trump, is to blame for the failure of this nuclear treaty	Nato has said that it fully supports the decision of the United States to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. This is important. Critics of President Trump will jump on the decision as proof that he is a maverick intent on starting a new arms race – but this move was a long time coming and Russia is to blame.  American officials have previously suggested that Russia began testing the type of ground-launched ballistic or cruise missiles banned by the treaty as early as 2008; in 2014, President Obama accused Vladimir Putin of violating the INF. On December 4, 2018, Nato declared that Russia “developed and fielded a missile system, the 9M729, which... poses significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security.” Yesterday, in its communique supporting America’s latest action, Nato protested that Russia continues to deny what is widely acknowledged and refuses to take steps back to compliance. It concluded that unless Mr Putin acts accordingly, and within the six months it takes for the US to withdraw from the INF, “Russia will bear sole responsibility for the end of the treaty”. No one in their right mind will welcome these events, but at least now we know where things stand. That’s what Mr Trump often does: he champions honesty over the diplomatic etiquette that, especially under Mr Obama, has translated into inaction. It is time to admit that Nato partners don’t contribute enough towards defence; time to confront China over intellectual property theft; time to recognise the new reality in Syria. 
FEB2	Free speech on campus begins with the academics	The Government is absolutely right to introduce uniform guidance on free speech in universities, but it shouldn’t even be necessary. Why can’t academics, who are supposedly motivated by the spirit of free inquiry, define and defend liberty themselves? Instead, students have been allowed to set the rules and, through no-platforming, noisy protest and “safe space” policies, make it difficult to engage in dialogue.  One issue, which the Government is addressing, is complicated guidance that critics say is open to exploitation. But the problem extends to the culture of the academy itself. Since the Sixties, the Left has taken over, imposing a consensus so deadening that a group of thinkers recently launched a journal of “controversial ideas” that offered to publish essays, if so desired, under pseudonyms. Groupthink and timidity are matched by entitlement, reflected in the Cambridge don who railed against college porters because they failed to call her “doctor”. She inferred racism. MPs must see that what’s taking place on campus is a microcosm of the wider society that politicians have had a hand in building. The ever-expanding definition of “hate crime” has turned nobodies into witchfinders, while many Britons feel they cannot say things for fear of being shouted down. No one approves of speech that is denigrating, bigoted or incites violence. But there has to be freedom to contest ideas within the constraints of the law – and that contest not only should exist on campus but also ought to be actively encouraged by authoritative university officials. Heaven knows they are paid enough.
FEB2	Letters: Put the brakes on HS2 before this costly vanity project goes any further	SIR – You report that HS2 could become the world’s most expensive railway line. How many of us really want our taxes squandered on this project – which, at best, will only ever be of marginal benefit to a tiny proportion of the population? I judge it to be almost none. Cancel it now, please.
FEB2	Letters: Ten days to save Brexit – if a touch of robustness can be introduced	SIR – Fraser Nelson (“If Theresa May is robust with Brussels now, she can finally get Brexit right”, Comment, February 1) is correct. The word “robust” is one that the European Scrutiny Committee insisted on in its report in March 2018. The Government has been supplicating the EU from the beginning, as I have repeatedly said in the House of Commons. The root of the problem has been the failure to stand up to the EU on its guidelines, and the failure to get the withdrawal and the political relationship synchronised, together with leaving most negotiations to civil servants, who are instinctively Remainers. The Prime Minister has for far too long given in to the Remainers, both those in the Cabinet and their hard-core colleagues on the Conservative back benches. She now has a few days to get this right.
FEB3	Is this June election talk a ploy to scare MPs into backing Theresa May's appalling deal?	I don’t know if there really is some genius in Tory HQ who wants to call an election this year, but if there is I would like to reach out to that person and shake them warmly by the throat. I have never heard such a ridiculous idea – and let me be clear that I do not say that because I have the slightest terror of the Labour opposition. Look at Corbyn: he is deteriorating before our eyes. Last week in Parliament he gave an absolute masterclass in the factionalism and sexism that are the hallmarks of the old Labour Left – petulantly refusing to take an intervention from a nice and hardworking Labour MP, Angela Smith, and making it abundantly clear that his boycott applied exclusively to her, as though she were some box of Israeli oranges. He couldn’t answer basic questions about his weird plan for Britain to leave the EU but remain in the customs union. Would we still sign up to the common customs code? Would we be able to do free trade deals? Would we be represented round the table in Brussels, and if so, how?
FEB3	Where is Britain's museum to show the evils of Communism?	A museum displaying KGB spying equipment has opened in New York. It features cameras disguised as coat buttons and recording devices hidden in shoes. It even has a replica of the poison-tipped umbrella which the Bulgarian secret service, perhaps with KGB help, used to kill Georgi Markov on Waterloo Bridge in 1968. New Yorker writer Masha Gessen has condemned the museum as “blithely morally neutral”. Others might think it is too concerned with gadgets, as though the KGB were merely playing a technological game rather than being an instrument of terror and death. Whatever the objections though, the museum will have an important function in the Western world: educating hundreds of thousands of people about one aspect of Soviet rule. However morally neutral it might be, any museum focusing on the KGB cannot help but reveal its terrible record of torture and murder and its role as the instrument of Stalin’s Great Purge.
FEB3	Why do liberal luvvies hate Israel so much?	This week’s report by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research into the link between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism – concluding that those who focus their activism on attacking Israel are more likely than not to be anti-Semitic – was probably the least surprising piece of information I’ve processed since observing that I quite like the taste of wedding cake. This has been the decade in which The Hate That Dare Not Speak Its Name – Left-wing anti-Semitism – has had a right old rant as each week brings us a Corbynite councillor who’s somehow managed to equate being anti-racist with believing that The Jews Asked For It. I call it "Fresh’N’Funky Anti-Semitism", as it has none of the stuffy snideness of the Ring-wing golf-club kind. When most people are informed that being prejudiced is bad, they accept it; the working-class, though they’re told they’re ignorant Brexit chavs, seem to be by far the best at adapting, happily producing beautiful mixed-race children. For the Great And The Good, interestingly, this isn’t so easy. They don’t seem to intermarry much. And they seem to have a real problem with not having Someone To Hate. Remainers wish old Brexiteers dead. Trans activists recommend punching radical feminist TERFS. It was remarkable that, when comedians stopped telling racist jokes, they amped up the sexist ones – Jimmy Carr and Frankie Boyle come hideously to mind. It’s the “taste-thrill” of hate, and liberals, who’ve been raised to believe that hate is the ultimate taboo, get far more of a parasexual kick from it these days than the Right do. Jewish women, frequently gaslighted and told they’re overreacting, have become the battered women of politics, the place where all the kinky hate comes out. The situation has now outgrown Twitter and is starting to look a likely subject for art. That photograph of Luciana Berger – her beautiful face distorted in disbelief as she walked into her own party conference with hired security to protect her – could have been painted by Daumier. And there is something of the 19th century novel about Rachel Riley: sunny young woman of humble origins and great beauty becomes nation’s sweetheart-next-door only to be revealed as fearless crusader against anti-Semitism when pushed too far.
FEB3	The consistent refusal of the Government to listen rather puts one in mind of Cassandra	Thirty years ago, when the then- young cartoonist Matt joined The Telegraph, one of his first jobs was to produce little cartoons to illustrate the paper’s satirical Way of the World column, to which I was then contributing. One cartoon I asked him to draw showed the prophetess Cassandra standing amid the smoking ruins of Troy, holding a placard reading “Remember folks, you read it here first”. The point about Cassandra, of course, was that she could foresee the future, but only on condition that no one believed her. Over the past two years, ever since Theresa May announced her decision to leave the EU’s tightly integrated internal market, one or two of us have sympathised with Cassandra. We immediately began explaining the more obvious problems that this fateful decision would result in, since it would severely endanger much of that “frictionless” export trade to the EU that earns one pound in eight of our national income. Our manufacturing of cars, medicines and chemicals would all be seriously at risk, as would our Dover/Channel Tunnel link with the Continent, much of our agricultural export trade and even the participation of Irish horses in Cheltenham and the Grand National. We also warned, meanwhile, that on no rock was May’s plan more likely to founder than the inevitability of a “hard Irish border”.
FEB3	The Church should call us to debate moral purpose, not act as an echo chamber of the Left	The Christian church has a long and honourable history of engagement in the public sphere – Wilberforce’s work against slavery and Lord Shaftesbury’s campaigns on behalf of children in the 19th century both spring to mind. So why is it that so many of us feel uncomfortable with the Church’s political and economic utterances? When Archbishop Welby said that the EU has been “the greatest dream realised for human beings since the fall of the Western Roman Empire” the incredulity extended well beyond whether one voted Leave or Remain. The Church cannot, and should not, make its voice heard by reinforcing such a perception of elitism, or by identifying the Gospel with the state, and its provision. Perhaps it has grown so close to the establishment that it cannot conceive of any responses to social or economic questions which do not involve an expansion of the state, rather than a genuine debate around moral ideas and principles. The real problem is the Church simply does not know how to engage in social, economic and political debate. Rather like the Conservative Party, it has lost any vision for enterprise and entrepreneurship, for wealth creation before distribution, for the morality of a low-tax economy. Yet Christ worked in a profitable family construction company. He will have understood customer service, innovation, creativity, planning, accounting and profit, alongside the complexities of labour, wages and capital. He worked because if you did not, then you did not eat, a point also made by St Paul. Jesus Christ not only exemplified the dignity of labour, but also the dignity of enterprise. Why do we rarely hear the Church making this point?
FEB3	Labour rebels appear motivated by Brexit derangement syndrome, not high principle	It is rumoured, yet again, that several Labour MPs are thinking of quitting their whip to form a new centrist grouping. Why has it taken so long? They could have resigned when Jeremy Corbyn became leader. Or when activists started deselection procedures, when MPs were harrassed and abused, or when the shadow of anti-Semitism fell across the party. They could have stepped down over Mr Corbyn’s past association with terrorists, his undue caution towards Russia or his sympathy for the communists in Venezuela, where people are starving. So, why wait until now? Because the real motivation is stopping Brexit. There are anti-Corbynite rebels who take a nuanced view on Europe. Frank Field, an independent thinker, quit the whip last August, and this newspaper urged other moderates to follow him. They did not. But now the arch-Remainers see a chance to frustrate, even reverse, Brexit and are furious that Mr Corbyn isn’t playing ball, that there is no clear line on a second referendum and that some shadow ministers even voted down the effort to delay Article 50. This isn’t good enough for Labour MPs who believe Brexit is the end of the world and want to use Parliament arithmetic to stop it. Because of this transparent motivation, if they do resign and set up their own party, it will likely not be a vehicle for a new opposition committed to social democratic principles. It will be a Europhile party that, assuming Britain does leave the EU in order and on time, could be irrelevant within months. These are the consequences of cynicism and cowardice: when politicians leave it too long to speak out, they forfeit their credibility.
FEB3	Venezuela is Labour's blueprint for Britain	The crisis in Venezuela shows the dangers of radical socialism: the economy has contracted by about half, and three million have migrated. The last few defenders of the regime of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro claim that starvation in a country that was once the richest in Latin America is due to US sanctions. This is a lie. The crisis began in 2010-12; the first real sanctions were only imposed in 2017. In reality, “Chavismo” is theft dressed up as social justice, which is the entire history of Marxism in practice. Socialism consumes capital; it devours the goose that lays the golden egg. Chávez went to war with the oil sector and expropriated its wealth. There was no rainy-day fund and no reinvestment in the industry, which is why the claim that falling oil prices are the other chief cause of disaster is also false: production is down dramatically. The poor are poorer; the middle class is almost eliminated. To pull off this socialist economic transformation requires huge executive power, and to handle the fallout from failure requires brutal suppression. All of this has a particularly chilling meaning for the British because so many Labour politicians were, for years, supporters of the Venezuelan experiment. In 2013, Jeremy Corbyn thanked the late Chávez “for showing that the poor matter and wealth can be shared”. In 2014, he rang Maduro live on television to congratulate him on an election victory. And now Labourites advocate a degree of perspective and caution when it comes to dealing with Venezuela that some of their MPs have never shown towards, say, the perfectly democratic regime of Israel.

FEB4	The tragedy of Venezuela shows us how dangerous Jeremy Corbyn and his acolytes really are	In 2014, John McDonnell, now Labour’s shadow chancellor, said that the socialist regime in Venezuela showed “the contrast between capitalism in crisis and socialism in action”. In a way he never intended, he has turned out to be right. For the people of that country are now enduring a situation worse than any crisis of capitalism, anywhere in the world, at any time in the last 100 years. Their economy has shrunk by at least half – far worse than the Great Depression or the recent economic woes of Greece. Three million people have fled the country. Inflation, having reached 1.7 million per cent, has made money worthless. Basic commodities are scarce and hardship widespread. More than half the population are now living in extreme poverty.
FEB4	A compulsory register to monitor home-educated children like my daughter threatens parents' freedom	Our daughter Lilian has been home-educated all her life. Two years ago, aged 11, she landed the role of Matilda with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and performed a six-month West End run. She did this without prior theatrical training, yet I would not call her especially talented. Lilian’s abilities grew as a result of her being very free: as educators, her father and I avoided imposing subjects or timetables. Instead, we let her pick and choose activities – from reading to rock-climbing. Had we imposed a curriculum, we would likely have put her off, whereas she has always liked using her mind: “It’s an incredibly enjoyable thing to do. I don’t separate out work and play.” Lilian is not unusual: plenty of her home-educated peers are talented. And studies show that background doesn’t matter: home-educated children have consistently high literacy, numeracy and social skills. We cost the UK nothing and yet yield some of the country’s best results.
FEB4	Can Nissan's U-turn really be blamed on Brexit?	The usual suspects have been quick to blame Brexit for Nissan’s decision to make the next-generation X-Trail in Japan, rather than the UK. But while the ongoing uncertainty can’t have helped, the real issues lie elsewhere. For a start, the X-Trail is a special case. As even non-petrolheads now know, it is a large sport utility vehicle (SUV), predominantly run on diesel, which has been struggling to comply with new EU emissions targets. European sales have already fallen by around 30% over the last year. Given the deteriorating outlook for European demand, there is simply no longer a strong enough business case for producing this model here, or indeed in Europe full stop. It is surely significant that Nissan is not just moving elsewhere in the EU (despite its strategic partnership with Renault). Instead, the company has decided it makes more sense to consolidate production of this model in Japan, closer to Asian markets where the emission rules are less stringent, as sales to Europe struggle.
FEB4	A Labour split has been inevitable from the moment Corbyn took charge	Every now and then it requires a calm, sober, reflective voice to make you take notice of a fact that you may otherwise have missed. Such a moment arrived for me a few weeks ago when listening to one of our greatest political pundits, James Naughtie, giving his thoughts on the current political situation on Radio 4. Out of necessity I am paraphrasing, but essentially he predicted that the existing political party structure cannot survive the current and near-future upheavals connected with Brexit – at least, not in its current form. It was a light bulb moment: it was such an obvious observation yet one that is often crowded out by other, more immediate and more dramatic developments. While all the attention has been focused on what shape Brexit might take, or if it will happen at all, and how this or that wing of the Conservative or Labour Party might respond, profound changes are being considered out of sight of the Brexit-obsessed media.
FEB4	Opening the vault of unpublished JD Salinger would revive a prophetic social commentator	Over the weekend, JD Salinger’s son confirmed for the first time that the late author wrote a significant amount of material that has never been seen. Matt Salinger and his father’s widow and co-executor Colleen O'Neill are reportedly “going as fast as we freaking can” to prepare it for publication. I certainly hope audiences won’t have to wait too long. Although last month marked Salinger’s centenary, his work continues to resonate with modern audiences. The Catcher in the Rye, Salinger’s “anthem for doomed youth”  remains ever present on adolescent reading lists more than 60 years after its publication, and anticipates numerous 21st century concerns.   Reading Catcher as an ambitious teenager, I loathed Salinger’s protagonist Holden Caulfield, viewing him as lazy, pretentious and self-indulgent. But on a recent re-read, I suddenly realised that my harsh teenage interpretation had landed well off the mark.
FEB4	With just 53 days to go, Britain still needs to know what Brexit will look like	There are now 53 days left till Brexit and, as of this moment, Britain is heading out of the door without a deal. The Government hopes to tweak its existing Withdrawal Agreement and return to Parliament within the next fortnight with a revision, but most of the noise from Europe suggests this won’t happen. Some British MPs talk of a deal being struck “at the last minute”, but brinkmanship is far from ideal. What the country needs is clarity. In last Tuesday’s votes, Parliament set the terms for an improved deal with the EU, which would see the backstop replaced with “alternative arrangements”. But beyond this, the direction of Brexit remains worryingly vague. Sajid Javid insists that the Irish border can be solved with a bit of “goodwill” from the EU; existing technology could render a hard border unnecessary and the backstop moot. Theresa May wrote in this newspaper yesterday that another answer might be a “time limit or unilateral exit mechanism”. This is all very well, but what happens if Brussels won’t bend? Some members of the Cabinet appear to be preparing the public for a delay, even though the Prime Minister says she is determined to leave “on time”. Key Leavers don’t trust the PM and believe the backstop isn’t the only problem with the Agreement, which makes European diplomats suspect the Commons would reject the deal even if renegotiated. There is equal confusion about the Government’s attitude to no deal. Some ministers insist that no matter how difficult a no-deal outcome might be, Britain will flourish in the long run (Mr Javid, the Home Secretary, says we will still be safe and secure). But others have briefed against a no deal or even threatened to resign if No 10 dares to proceed on that basis. The advice that, in the event of riots, the Queen would be spirited out of London only adds a further layer of farce to the chaos. Remainers constantly express amazement at the public’s refusal to swallow the warnings of experts, but this is precisely why: Remainers have over-egged the pudding.

There was no rainy-day fund and no reinvestment in the industry, which is why the claim that falling oil prices are the other chief cause of disaster is also false: production is down dramatically. The poor are poorer; the middle class is almost eliminated. To pull off this socialist economic transformation requires huge executive power, and to handle the fallout from failure requires brutal suppression. All of this has a particularly chilling meaning for the British because so many Labour politicians were, for years, supporters of the Venezuelan experiment. In 2013, Jeremy Corbyn thanked the late Chávez “for showing that the poor matter and wealth can be shared”. In 2014, he rang Maduro live on television to congratulate him on an election victory. And now Labourites advocate a degree of perspective and caution when it comes to dealing with Venezuela that some of their MPs have never shown towards, say, the perfectly democratic regime of Israel. 
FEB4	Letters: Even if Mrs May wins concessions, her deal will still be a bad one	SIR – Theresa May’s deal is not a good deal for Britain, even if the problems with the backstop are resolved. It may prevent the possible short-term disruption of a “no-deal” Brexit, but it would also bring: uncertainty; the continuing jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice; no chance to benefit from international trade deals; higher prices in the shops due to EU protectionism; continuing annual payments to the EU; disputes over security; and the cost of EU regulations. And it costs £39 billion. A clean Brexit, under World Trade Organisation terms and leading to a free-trade agreement, would avoid these pitfalls. There is plenty of evidence that the disruption would be minimal. The £39 billion saving would help to address short-term problems and smooth the transition of industries to a WTO tariff regime.
FEB4	Letters: Put the brakes on HS2 before this costly vanity project goes any further	SIR – You report that HS2 could become the world’s most expensive railway line. How many of us really want our taxes squandered on this project – which, at best, will only ever be of marginal benefit to a tiny proportion of the population? I judge it to be almost none. Cancel it now, please.
FEB5	We must hold our nerve with the EU to get the deal we really want	For some time, EU negotiators have demanded to know what the UK wants. An EU Commission spokesman even quoted the Spice Girls, saying: “We expect the United Kingdom to tell us what they want, what they really, really want.” Well, last week Parliament sent a very clear message: by passing the Brady amendment, it showed there is a majority for a deal which removes the Northern Ireland backstop. A working party of MPs is now looking into how the supposed border conundrum can be solved.  There are many concrete proposals to consider.
FEB5	What matters most to the police - respecting diversity or ensuring public safety?	Race and crime are a toxic mix, as Liam Neeson, the actor, is discovering. His startling admission that he once patrolled the streets and bars of an unidentified city armed with a cosh intent on killing a “black b------” after a close friend was raped may mark the end of his career. This is not because he admitted behaving like a crazed vigilante. After all, his entire cinematic output of recent years has involved an ostensibly decent family man, albeit one with “special skills” perfected while serving with the CIA or Delta Force (unlikely given his Northern Irish accent), going on a killing rampage when his daughter/wife/son are kidnapped or otherwise abused. The body count in each film is usually greater than at the end of a small war. It won’t be Neeson’s offence against good taste that will get him canned by Hollywood, but because he stands accused of racial stereotyping. The fact that the supposed rapist was black is neither here nor there. Would Neeson have gone looking for a “white b------” to beat up; or an Irish one for that matter? And even though he was talking about a new film and denouncing the pernicious desire for revenge, context won’t save him either, because he is guilty of implying something many black people have long claimed – that they are traduced as having a greater propensity to commit crimes and are unfairly targeted as a result.
FEB5	Oxbridge needs fewer poshos, and more of us peasants	Cambridge has become the recipient of the largest ever British donation to an educational institution: a heady £100million, thanks to hedge-fund tycoon David Harding. This generous gift to his alma mater will be used to fund postgraduates, provide “debt-free” degrees for underprivileged students and encourage more applicants from black and low-income families. The upshot will be that the university is better able to attract the brightest and the best, not merely the posh and the poised. Meanwhile Joe Seddon, a 21-year-old Oxford graduate, turned down a job in the City to set up Access Oxbridge, an online mentoring service to help state school pupils secure Oxbridge places.
FEB5	Why Hollywood won’t give Liam Neeson a second act	There’s a tiny intake of breath before Liam Neeson says the words that may just end his career. Anyone who listens to the audiotape will recognise it as the weighing-up moment that comes before a confession. As a journalist, that’s the moment you start hyper-salivating. As an A-list movie star who has lived and worked in a country polarised by race for over thirty years and commands $20 million a movie, that’s the moment you think to yourself: “Maybe I won’t launch into a racist anecdote after all.” But actors so often confuse make-believe and reality, and no doubt thinking the hero of his new film, Cold Pursuit, is heroic because of his determination to avenge a loved one, the 66-year-old decided to go semi back into character to tell a deeply personal and twisted story, in the low, muttered – and yes, apologetic – stream of consciousness tones of a patient lying on his therapist’s couch.
FEB5	Corbyn fans have received another reminder of what everyone else knew - he has opposed the EU all his life	Jeremy Corbyn’s demise has been predicted many times since he took over the Labour Party three and a half years ago, including by me. That he is still in post says much about the relevance of previously sacrosanct political rules which Corbyn, to his credit, has successfully consigned to the rubbish bin. So it would be foolhardy to suggest that Brexit, or the continuing machinations by Labour MPs, or the potential disillusionment of his previously enthusiastic mass membership, spells the end for him. Nevertheless, we are entering possibly the most dangerous period of Corbyn’s leadership, at least since the last one. There have been many catalysts for the latest peril, and inevitably Brexit is the main one.
FEB5	Parliament has no right to approve military action	Ever since Tony Blair sought parliamentary approval for his military adventure in Iraq in 2003, some have contended that a constitutional convention has existed whereby MPs have the right to vote whenever a government desires to deploy our Armed Forces on combat operations. Indeed, it was an insistence that the government could not act without securing parliamentary consent that resulted in the humiliating situation in 2013, when the Commons blocked David Cameron from launching military action against the Assad regime in Syria over its use of chemical weapons. While this arrangement might help to provide ministers with political cover before embarking on risky interventions, from a military perspective it is viewed as deeply flawed, as it imposes dangerous restrictions on the nation’s ability to respond quickly and effectively in times of crisis.
FEB5	Businesses are entitled to clarity on future trading arrangements	Not long after the vote to leave the EU in June 2016, the Government confounded the doom-mongers who were predicting a flight of investors from the UK by securing a deal with Nissan to continue production. This was seen as a vote of confidence in Brexit Britain. It was never entirely clear what assurances had been given to the Japanese car makers to offset their concerns, but Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, denied that it involved a “sweetheart deal” unavailable to other manufacturers or other parts of industry. We now know with the publication of a letter from the Government to Nissan that it promised funding for training and regional regeneration. In addition, the Government wanted a Brexit deal that ensured the continuation of tariff-free trade, minimising any disruption to companies like Nissan. There was also a direct promise of around  £80 million in R&D funding contingent upon Nissan agreeing to produce its Qashqai and diesel X-Trail models at its Sunderland plant.But at the weekend, Nissan said it would not be making the X-Trail in the North East after all and has been told to reapply for some £60 million of funding already pledged. Remainers have blamed Brexit for this; but the Nissan decision has much more to do with the slump in the market for diesel vehicles in Europe.
FEB5	With just 53 days to go, Britain still needs to know what Brexit will look like	There are now 53 days left till Brexit and, as of this moment, Britain is heading out of the door without a deal. The Government hopes to tweak its existing Withdrawal Agreement and return to Parliament within the next fortnight with a revision, but most of the noise from Europe suggests this won’t happen. Some British MPs talk of a deal being struck “at the last minute”, but brinkmanship is far from ideal. What the country needs is clarity. In last Tuesday’s votes, Parliament set the terms for an improved deal with the EU, which would see the backstop replaced with “alternative arrangements”. But beyond this, the direction of Brexit remains worryingly vague. Sajid Javid insists that the Irish border can be solved with a bit of “goodwill” from the EU; existing technology could render a hard border unnecessary and the backstop moot. Theresa May wrote in this newspaper yesterday that another answer might be a “time limit or unilateral exit mechanism”. This is all very well, but what happens if Brussels won’t bend? Some members of the Cabinet appear to be preparing the public for a delay, even though the Prime Minister says she is determined to leave “on time”. Key Leavers don’t trust the PM and believe the backstop isn’t the only problem with the Agreement, which makes European diplomats suspect the Commons would reject the deal even if renegotiated. There is equal confusion about the Government’s attitude to no deal. Some ministers insist that no matter how difficult a no-deal outcome might be, Britain will flourish in the long run (Mr Javid, the Home Secretary, says we will still be safe and secure). But others have briefed against a no deal or even threatened to resign if No 10 dares to proceed on that basis. The advice that, in the event of riots, the Queen would be spirited out of London only adds a further layer of farce to the chaos. Remainers constantly express amazement at the public’s refusal to swallow the warnings of experts, but this is precisely why: Remainers have over-egged the pudding.
FEB5	Letters: First decide upon the nation’s strategic tasks and then fund them	SIR – During my first tour on the equipment staff in the Ministry of Defence, Tony Blair became prime minister, and I noted with approval that his government first conducted a foreign policy review which would inform a subsequent defence review. So far so good: define what you want to be achieved at a strategic level – which becomes the Military Tasks – and then understand what is required in order to achieve it. However the final part of the equation was left out – funding the defined Military Tasks was fudged and inadequate. The Military Tasks are not the fantasies of military officers about what they would like to do. They represent formal direction by government of what they must do.
FEB5	Letters: Even if Mrs May wins concessions, her deal will still be a bad one	SIR – Theresa May’s deal is not a good deal for Britain, even if the problems with the backstop are resolved. It may prevent the possible short-term disruption of a “no-deal” Brexit, but it would also bring: uncertainty; the continuing jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice; no chance to benefit from international trade deals; higher prices in the shops due to EU protectionism; continuing annual payments to the EU; disputes over security; and the cost of EU regulations. And it costs £39 billion. A clean Brexit, under World Trade Organisation terms and leading to a free-trade agreement, would avoid these pitfalls. There is plenty of evidence that the disruption would be minimal. The £39 billion saving would help to address short-term problems and smooth the transition of industries to a WTO tariff regime.
FEB6	Middle classes beware: a new war on wealth is sweeping across the Atlantic	Why are some Conservatives so deluded? Theresa May is kicking nitroglycerine-laden cans down the Brexit road, we are just weeks away from her party’s potential implosion, and yet one senior Tory has just assured me that the real story is that Jeremy Corbyn is finished. It is a preposterous claim, cooked up in the overheating Tory bunker, based on a few superficial observations that change nothing. But it’s also a bizarrely widespread view and explains why some Tories want an election – a prospect that should terrify anybody who believes in capitalism, low taxes and private property. The Government has lost touch with reality, and is blind to the increasing appeal of destructive Left‑wing economic ideas across the West. Yes, Labour’s membership is down 10 per cent since Corbynmania’s peak (to 512,000, still four times that of the Tories); Corbyn’s popularity has slumped across key demographics; and some voters have noticed the disgusting anti-Semitism of so many hard-Left activists. Corbyn is being exposed as two-faced: he is a hard-core Brexiteer, but his electorate is divided between a majority of urban, middle-class Remainers and a minority of blue-collar Leavers. So he is triangulating, a strategy at the end of its natural life.
FEB6	So, did John Humphrys jump, or was he pushed?	John Humphrys might have hoped for a better tribute from his boss. Sarah Sands, editor of the Today programme, popped up on air yesterday after confirming that the veteran broadcaster was bowing out and described him as the show’s very own “Gandalf”. Yes, the JJR Tolkien character is known for his wisdom. But he also happens to be more than 2,000 years old. As Humphrys said later when told about the remark: “Gandalf? Is that a compliment or an insult?” At Today, it can be difficult to tell. Radio 4’s current affairs flagship has always been a place of intrigue – imagine dealing with not one presenter’s ego, but five, all jostling for airtime – and the question of whether Humphrys jumped or was pushed looms large. The answer lies somewhere in between.
FEB6	I voted Remain, but Tusk's devilish condemnation of Brexiteers won't help us reach a compromise	As someone who voted Remain in 2016, I find European Council President Donald Tusk’s comments today that Brexiteers deserve a “special place in Hell” unworthy and unhelpful. What we need from President Tusk and the whole of the Brussels machine is a spirit of compromise, not words of devilish condemnation. Tusk should have stronger feelings towards Britain. He was Deputy Speaker of the Sejm, the Polish Parliament, in 2004, when Poland joined the European Union. Ironically given Brexit, Britain was the principle advocate of Polish accession to the European Union. Poland might not be in the EU – and therefore Tusk in his job – if the UK hadn’t been such an early and forceful arguer for enlargement in the 1990s. But this is part of a pattern: top EU politicians and officials have moved the negotiations away from finding a reasonable compromise with Britain, towards complete intransigence, straining relations with many of the member states, who want to maintain good relations with Britain.
FEB6	Here are five ways Brexit Britain can enjoy a great trading future even without a deal	The uncertainty that naturally surrounds any shift the size of Brexit has been compounded by the war of words, interests and persuasion that continues to unfold. For businesses, exporters, workers, investors and even for perceived bystanders on either side of the visceral, all-encompassing debate, more questions than answers have emerged – especially as the ‘deal or no deal’ question intensifies. However, despite the clouds of confusion that will continue to form as lawmakers from all sides debate next steps, here are five ways the UK can thrive even without a Brexit deal.
FEB6	How socialism – not sanctions – destroyed Venezuela	Once Latin America’s richest country, Venezuela is now a basket case. Its economy has shrunk by half since 2013 and about three million people have fled the country, a refugee crisis of Syrian proportions. The country is plagued by severe shortages of basic essentials, especially food and medicines, hyperinflation has reached Weimar Republic levels, and one of Latin America’s oldest democracies has turned into an authoritarian police state. Yet until just a few years ago, plenty of prominent Left-wing commentators in the West held up Venezuela as a shining example. How could a country go so badly off the rails? And how could so many well-informed observers show such colossally poor judgement?
FEB6	Eurozone weakness could help Mrs May in negotiations	One certainty of Brexit according to Remainers was that it would adversely impact on the UK economy just as the Europeans were enjoying growth. In the two years or more since the vote to leave, British employment and wages have improved, the economy has continued to expand, and the predicted flight of investors has failed to materialise. Far from powering away to leave an ailing UK economy floundering in its wake, the eurozone is in trouble. Its cornerstone economies – Germany, France and Italy – are all heading into recession, according to the latest statistics. This would be the third contraction for the eurozone in a decade, hardly an advertisement for stability or a guarantor of prosperity. The three big eurozone countries retain significant manufacturing industries, especially cars, and these have seen a fall in demand, not least in Britain which is their biggest market. Now the service sector is also being hit as new business inflows stall. Data suggest that growth for the first quarter will be close to zero, hitting confidence and investment and pushing the euro area into recession. Yet there is no obvious move by the European Central Bank or national policy-makers to head off the risk.
FEB6	Anti-Semitism is now a permanent stain on Labour's reputation	When Labour first faced accusations of anti-Semitism, Jeremy Corbyn denied the party had a problem. As the evidence mounted, not least with the abuse of Jewish MPs, the Labour leader conceded that there was an issue and said he would do something about it. Yet a backlog of complaints remains unresolved and members accused of anti-Semitism have been let back into the party after suspension. Moreover, the party’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, told a meeting of MPs that it was impossible to “completely eradicate” anti-Semitic incidents and rejected a demand to come back within a week with detailed information about how complaints have been handled. The national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement said “a culture of anti-Semitism, obfuscation and denial” was infecting the party and Dame Margaret Hodge, a former minister, said hard-Left anti-Semitism was being “allowed to exist unchallenged”.

FEB6	Letters: Nailing the Irish border fallacy will force Britain to leave with no deal	SIR – I would like to make an obvious point about the Irish border issue. The border is a problem for the EU, which wishes to protect its internal market, while keeping Ireland – a member state – happy. The United Kingdom is very relaxed about goods coming in this way from Ireland. Brussels has cleverly made the problem ours by saying we have to come up with a solution before we can get a trade deal. The only way we can go forward is to leave with no deal. It will then be apparent that the dilemma is between Ireland and the EU. We really mean it when we say that we won’t instigate a hard border. They don’t.
FEB6	Letters: First decide upon the nation’s strategic tasks and then fund them	SIR – During my first tour on the equipment staff in the Ministry of Defence, Tony Blair became prime minister, and I noted with approval that his government first conducted a foreign policy review which would inform a subsequent defence review.

The Military Tasks are not the fantasies of military officers about what they would like to do. They represent formal direction by government of what they must do.
FEB7	John Major's dire warning that Brexit could lead to the break up of the UK may yet come true	For Remainers like this one, I’d always taken with a pinch of salt the threat – first posed by John Major – that Brexit could lead to the break up of the United Kingdom. After a brief flurry of excitement in 2016 that prompted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to order teams of officials to work on the details of Scottish independence, things settled down and the polls soon reverted to their normal position, namely that the majority of Scots were still determined to stick to the Union. Now I’m not so sure. Although, according to Britain’s top psephologist, Sir John Curtice, the odds are still against a vote for Scottish independence, the margin is now closing: 11 per cent in 2016, compared to only six per cent now.
FEB7	Brussels is terrified of Brexit being a success – no wonder they’re threatening hellfire	If Theresa May were given to Donald Tusk-style outbursts, she might have had a thing or two to say on Thursday when she came back from Brussels. They had wasted her time. She had come with a message: that her party would (reluctantly) back her if the EU would add a standard break clause to the Brexit deal, allowing either party to terminate if they choose. Hardly an outrageous request. Her party, she said, were ready to swallow their objections. Here was a delicate, opportunity for compromise. But instead, Tusk chose this week to talk about Brexiteers going to hell. We then had Guy Verhofstadt saying that the devil would not let them in. As for Mrs May’s all-important request, Martin Selmayr, chief of the EU civil service, had already announced (on Twitter) that it was not even being considered. So the Prime Minister was sent away from Brussels, asked to come back at the end of the month – and the great Brexit psychodrama drags for longer. In Britain, we’re left asking: why? On the EU side, nobody is considering this. Asked whether any assurance would help to get the Withdrawal Agreement through the Commons, the answers of MPs were ... inconclusive .... The meeting confirmed that the EU did well to start its no deal preparations in December 2017.
FEB7	It's time to rethink the law on assisted dying	“By the time you read this, I will be dead.” It’s a phrase familiar to the point of cliché, the stock solictor’s office scene in the opening minutes of a clunkingly predictable whodunit. Except this time it’s fact, not fiction. These words, and a great many more, were written by Geoff Whaley in the days – perhaps hours – before he ended his life yesterday at a Swiss clinic, in the arms of Ann, his beloved wife of 52 years. And the 80-year-old grandfather’s powerful evocation of the fear and misery caused by his treatment, not at the hands of the NHS but the hands of the police, shames us all.
FEB7	Want to make childcare more affordable for everyone? Deregulate it entirely	Before I had children, I had no idea how complicated childcare could be. I knew I wanted to continue working, and blithely assumed that would be relatively straightforward. Eight years later, having deployed almost every childcare option possible, from nannies to nurseries, au pairs to childminders, spent countless hours painstakingly working out costs, interviewing people and wondering whether it’s all worth it just to be able to go to work myself, I’m no longer under any illusions: it’s a complex, complicated nightmare that’s enough to put you off having children at all. And I’m one of the lucky ones. I’ve lost count of the number of female friends financially down every month after paying for childcare, or whose career has been penalised by having children, or who have simply stopped working because it doesn’t make sense, emotionally or financially. I’m talking about this as if it’s a women’s issue, which it shouldn’t be, but basically still is. We’re the ones who give birth, and we’re the ones who tend to earn less than men – the median gender pay gap is 8.6 per cent; it jumps to 17.9 per cent once you factor in part-time workers.
FEB7	Our politicians are engulfed in pantomime and post-truth, but it won't stop us leaving the EU	Has Brexit chaos sucked Britain into a post-truth fifth dimension? Keeping up with our Government’s EU “negotiations” increasingly feels like dunking one’s head into a hallucinogenic vortex where nothing is as it appears, and everybody is lying, or trying to distract us from reality. First, there is Theresa May’s extraordinary talent for performative deception as she struggles to run the clock down before trying to ram her deal through the Commons one last time. This week she has acted out what will surely go down as the most farcical piece of diplomatic pageantry in British history, starting with an excruciatingly pointless trip to Northern Ireland and ending in equally pointless talks with an intransigent EU. The PM’s near-lies are  becoming increasingly obvious too. Last week, she put her weight behind an amendment saying that the backstop should be “replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”. Now she is now insisting that what Parliament really means by this is that there should merely be “changes made” to it. And, right on cue, the EU has today been quick to insist that these "changes" cannot be in the actual Withdrawal Agreement, but in the Political Declaration. Which means they aren't "changes" at all. 
FEB7	Eurozone weakness could help Mrs May in negotiations	One certainty of Brexit according to Remainers was that it would adversely impact on the UK economy just as the Europeans were enjoying growth. In the two years or more since the vote to leave, British employment and wages have improved, the economy has continued to expand, and the predicted flight of investors has failed to materialise.

It was never entirely clear what assurances had been given to the Japanese car makers to offset their concerns, but Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, denied that it involved a “sweetheart deal” unavailable to other manufacturers or other parts of industry.

FEB7	Letters: It’s the hell of a mess of the EU that Brexiteers had voted to escape	SIR – Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, has been wondering “what the special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan to carry it out safely”. More than 17.4 million people obviously think it looks preferable to the place they’ve been stuck for the last 45 years. Alan Rogers Epsom, Surrey
FEB7	Letters: The Irish backstop is the goat in the tiger-trap to keep the UK in a customs union	SIR – Theresa May is off to Brussels to try to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, worryingly with a full team of Remainers in tow. I don’t think we should hold out much hope of success because she, along with Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, and others in the Cabinet, seems to be particularly attached to the Irish backstop. Why is it, when alternative deals are proposed, she always insists that a backstop would be needed, and that, this being the case, it would be better to stick with her beloved deal? I suspect it is because the lady wants to keep us in a permanent customs union, but without herself getting the blame for doing so. The backstop would be the simplest way of achieving this. She could then claim, somewhat disingenuously, to have taken us out of the EU with the Irish backstop being just a temporary nuisance.
FEB8	Brexiteers are rejecting exactly the kind of Brexit they used to want	‘There is too little discussion,” said the MP, “on how we should engineer an orderly transition.” He added: “It took 40 years to progress to this stage of integration and we are not going to resolve all the issues in one stage.” The MP in question, one Owen Paterson, was speaking in 2014, making him the first former Cabinet minister to advocate fully leaving the EU. An important factor in doing so successfully, he argued, was to leave gradually, following “a definitive plan” that would keep Britain inside the single market at least for a period, while ditching the EU’s project of political integration. Now, though, Mr Paterson is one of the staunchest opponents of Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement and a firm advocate of no deal. His journey is one shared by many Eurosceptics. Ever since Maastricht, MPs like Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Bill Cash and Iain Duncan Smith have been pushing for reforms that would keep many of the EU’s economic elements without the political bits. All of them now oppose Mrs May’s deal.
FEB8	Why pro-Brexit Labour MPs like me are backing Corbyn's vision for a customs union deal	I voted to remain, but I represent a seat which is 70 per cent leave. There is no appetite among my constituents for a second referendum and I agree. All it will do is crystallise division and no one arguing for one seems able to tell me - definitively - what the question would be or the options available. I also couldn’t bring myself to vote for the Prime Minister’s deal last time because it seemed all of the concerns of the people and businesses I represent - on trade, on rights and protections and on any certainty for the future - were falling on deaf ears. I thought long and hard about it but just couldn’t do so despite being desperate to vote for a deal. Jeremy Corbyn’s intervention this week, writing to the Prime Minister outlining five proposals which, if accepted by Mrs May, will guarantee Labour support for a version of the Withdrawal Agreement, is a welcome one.
FEB8	Social media is taking baby steps to protect children. It's still not enough	At last, Instagram has taken a decisive step towards making its site safer for children by banning some graphic self-harm content. This is welcome, but it is not enough. I made this clear when I met Instagram’s head, Adam Mosseri, on Thursday. I explained how exposure to awful images is only one of the immediate dangers facing young people online. One platform making one change is not enough. All of them have a duty of care to their customers and this should be legally enforceable. What social networks seem to ignore in their race for connectivity and cash are the rights of children to enjoy essential protections from exploitation, abuse or life-threatening danger. In the offline world, from toys to playgrounds, we take that for granted. Businesses must build child safety into their designs and are punished if they do not. Shockingly, online it is currently only an optional extra.
FEB8	The 'Lean In' backlash: Where did it all go wrong for Sheryl Sandberg?	From the maelstrom of toxicity that now surrounds Facebook, one woman has emerged as the villain of the piece: Sheryl Sandberg. Once the darling of a world desperate for female role models in a technology industry dominated by surly, hoody-clad "bros", Sandberg has become the fall gal for Facebook’s blunders.  She has publicly confessed to only one, taking personal responsibility for the company’s work with opposition research firm Definers, which was hired to investigate left-wing billionaire George Soros, after he criticised the company in a speech. But, still, she has been pilloried from all angles - and she’s take far more flak than her boss Mark Zuckerberg. Only this week, Harvard Professor Emeritus Shoshana Zuboff called her the “Typhoid Mary of surveillance capitalism", on the basis that she brought a business model based on monetising people’s data from Google to Facebook. 
FEB8	My new Brexit party stands ready to defend democracy	It seems increasingly clear that Theresa May’s appalling Withdrawal Agreement, the worst deal in history, will not pass through the House of Commons. Perhaps the only way in which it could is if the Government repeats Edward Heath’s tactics in 1972, when he forced the original European Communities Act through with the support of Labour. Mrs May’s problem is that she knows doing the same now would irreparably split her own party. I have thought for many months that the most likely outcome is the can getting kicked down the road. I still passionately hope and pray that we will leave the EU on March 29, but be in no doubt that, if Article 50 does get extended, I am ready to act. That’s why the Electoral Commission’s official recognition of a new political party – the Brexit Party – is good news for those of us who believe in democracy.
FEB8	It's time for Parliament to stop the misuse of gagging clauses by the rich and powerful	When the Telegraph received information about an apparent cover up of alleged abuses of staff by Sir Philip Green, we considered it to be a matter of public interest that warranted an investigation. In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the MeToo movement had exposed the abuse of power and sexual harassment prevalent in all too many workplaces. It had also shown that many victims of such abhorrent practices were unable to speak publicly about what had happened to them because they had signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), contracts with confidentiality or “gagging” clauses. In the case of Sir Philip, our inquiries revealed that a number of individuals had been paid large sums of money under NDAs to prevent allegations of sexual misconduct and racial abuse from being aired in public. The NDAs also stopped these individuals from talking to the media. Even though the Telegraph was not party to these contracts, we were injuncted – arguably another form of non-disclosure agreement – and forbidden from naming Sir Philip. He was later identified in Parliament by Lord Hain, the Labour peer, using parliamentary privilege. But we remained subject to the injunction, preventing publication of the details of the accusations, pending a further court hearing. The case was due to be tried this week until Sir Philip’s lawyers indicated that they wished to walk away from the litigation, and the matter was finally ended in the High Court yesterday. We are delighted that the injunction on the Telegraph has now been lifted.

Mr Mosseri tells us that he supports a statutory duty of care “as a concept”, which is a cautious but significant breakthrough.sseri, the head of Instagram, accepts that his company "has a responsibility Now the Government must present to Parliament a white paper on social media which doesn’t just rely on good will and promises but which delivers the kind of tough, comprehensive regulation that governs every other aspect of our economy. This is not 1995. The internet is not still a novelty, reliant on creaky dial-ups and beyond the reach of most homes. It’s now an integral part of everyday activity, and so needs to be treated as something more serious than a “lifestyle issue” moderated by judicious parenting.
FEB8	Eurozone weakness could help Mrs May in negotiations	One certainty of Brexit according to Remainers was that it would adversely impact on the UK economy just as the Europeans were enjoying growth. In the two years or more since the vote to leave, British employment and wages have improved, the economy has continued to expand, and the predicted flight of investors has failed to materialise. Far from powering away to leave an ailing UK economy floundering in its wake, the eurozone is in trouble. Its cornerstone economies – Germany, France and Italy – are all heading into recession, according to the latest statistics. This would be the third contraction for the eurozone in a decade, hardly an advertisement for stability or a guarantor of prosperity. The three big eurozone countries retain significant manufacturing industries, especially cars, and these have seen a fall in demand, not least in Britain which is their biggest market. Now the service sector is also being hit as new business inflows stall. Data suggest that growth for the first quarter will be close to zero, hitting confidence and investment and pushing the euro area into recession. Yet there is no obvious move by the European Central Bank or national policy-makers to head off the risk.
FEB8	Letters: It’s the hell of a mess of the EU that Brexiteers had voted to escape	SIR – Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, has been wondering “what the special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan to carry it out safely”. More than 17.4 million people obviously think it looks preferable to the place they’ve been stuck for the last 45 years. Alan Rogers Epsom, Surrey
FEB8	Letters: The Irish backstop is the goat in the tiger-trap to keep the UK in a customs union	SIR – Theresa May is off to Brussels to try to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, worryingly with a full team of Remainers in tow. I don’t think we should hold out much hope of success because she, along with Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, and others in the Cabinet, seems to be particularly attached to the Irish backstop. Why is it, when alternative deals are proposed, she always insists that a backstop would be needed, and that, this being the case, it would be better to stick with her beloved deal? I suspect it is because the lady wants to keep us in a permanent customs union, but without herself getting the blame for doing so. The backstop would be the simplest way of achieving this. She could then claim, somewhat disingenuously, to have taken us out of the EU with the Irish backstop being just a temporary nuisance.
FEB9	Wreckers on both sides of the Channel must not stand in the way of a deal	Armed by the House of Commons with a clear mandate to revise the UK-EU Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, our Prime Minister, Theresa May, should be supported in redoubling efforts to secure acceptable terms. The greatest threat to a deal now comes from fringe efforts to derail the negotiations, in the EU and UK, at their most sensitive moment. On Wednesday, the President of the EU Council, Donald Tusk, mused that there was a “special place in hell” for those promoting Brexit. Not to be outdone, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, chirped up: “I doubt Lucifer would welcome them, as… they would even manage to divide hell.” Putting aside the disrespect to the 17 million who voted Leave, and the many more who want the referendum respected, do Mr Tusk and Mr Verhofstadt believe insulting the British people will make a deal more likely? It is difficult to read their interventions as anything other than a premeditated effort to derail reasonable compromise, leading to a UK departure on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. 
FEB9	You don't have to be Left-wing to run an Oxbridge college - but nowadays it certainly helps	I used to think Dame Sally Davies’ views were merely a function of her role as the Chief Medical Officer. She has dubbed herself the nation’s “chief nanny”, and called for a slew of new taxes on chocolate, crisps and other unhealthy foods. She denounced a voluntary agreement by the food industry to cut the sugar content of certain products, and has been a leading voice in the chorus demanding restrictions and compulsion as the only way to slim waistlines. Most medics I know, particularly the younger ones, love nothing better than telling me how disastrously wrong I’m leading my life. So in expounding such patronising opinions, I wanted to believe, Dame Sally wasn’t representative of any particular ideology that had come to dominate public life. Any Chief Medical Officer would have said the same. Now I wonder whether I was wrong, because Dame Sally has just been appointed the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. She joins a host of soft-Left political, cultural, and media figures at the helm of Oxbridge colleges. One is a former editor of The Guardian, another of The Observer.
FEB9	Utopia won't be built on universal basic income	Finland in recent years has become so much of a human laboratory that it’s a wonder it hasn’t attracted the same bunch of protesters who used to chant outside Huntingdon Life Sciences. We’ve been invited to study how it reduced heart disease through fat taxes and health campaigns, reduced infant mortality by giving new mothers a cardboard box full of kit, and how its education system leads the world on some measures. Finland’s latest social experiment, however, has proved less successful. Two years ago, it started paying a basic income of £490 a month to 2,000 randomly selected unemployed people, in the hope that it would encourage them to find work. Unlike traditional unemployment benefits, which get taken away if you find work, Finland’s guinea pigs were told that they could keep their basic income. In theory, it eliminated the “benefits trap” where unemployed people can find themselves financially worse off taking a job than staying on the dole.
FEB9	When even a fish is self-aware, being human doesn't seem so special	Is a fish self-aware? Is it, in other words, conscious of its existence as something separate from its environment? A new study shows that at least some fish can pass the standard cognition test – that is, they can recognise themselves. When a reef fish known as a cleaner wrasse (labroides dimidiatus) is placed before a mirror, it notices if it has had a coloured mark placed on it and seeks to scrub the spot away. Human beings typically reach that level of cognition at around 18 months. The change is quite sudden, and marks an important moment in our cerebral development.
FEB9	The endless claim that there are no solutions to Brexit is pure insanity	Most of the talk outside Westminster isn’t about political realities any more. Almost everybody you speak to now is discussing pathology. Precisely what personality aberration or psychodynamic imperative has produced the latest bizarre behaviour from one side or the other of the Brexit farrago. The general consensus is that all the principal players have gone technically insane. The mystifying obtuseness of Theresa May is countered by the wild opprobrium of Donald Tusk. There are grown-ups entrusted with responsibilities for the well-being of whole populations who are wishing their opponents eternal damnation. Social and diplomatic conventions are dissolving. Can this really be happening? The best evidence for this being what it seems – certifiable madness, rather than tactical bluster – is the lying. Telling more and more brazen, desperate untruths has to be the giveaway. The mendacity that prevails now goes way beyond the hyperbole that made the early stages of this drama rather absurdly endearing. Forget George Osborne’s emergency budget and the mass loss of jobs that would follow instantly on a Leave victory in the referendum. That’s all water under the bridge.

FEB9	Letters: Removing the backstop won’t make May’s deal any more acceptable	SIR – People need to stop watching the backstop birdie. Even without the backstop, the Withdrawal Agreement gives the EU the power to make rules that Britain would have to follow, but over which it would have no say. The Withdrawal Agreement would undermine Britain’s competitiveness and embed in international law everlasting EU control in matters of the environment, labour law, taxation, competition and state aid. It would allow the EU and the EU alone to determine the rules of trade in Britain’s future trading relationships. As remaining in the EU has been rejected at the ballot box, and as the agreement is unacceptable, and as the EU refuses to change its terms, the only option left for Britain is to leave without a deal. We should press ahead with this and take whatever measures are necessary to mitigate the short-term difficulties that would follow.
FEB9	Letters: Theresa May’s deal enables the EU to launch an irrevocable takeover bid	SIR – Ambrose Evans-Pritchard’s article (Business, February 7) clearly shows that the draft Withdrawal Agreement is actually an irrevocable, hostile takeover bid by the EU, backstop or not. This is far from the first time we have seen clear warnings of the threats buried in the draft’s small print, yet Theresa May still seems wedded to it. Why are government lawyers and MPs being so complacent? Leaving without a deal is not the end of the world, but signing up to Mrs May’s deal might well be just that for the UK as we know it.
FEB10	Sir Philip Green: We have so far only seen the tip of the iceberg	Poor, misunderstood Sir Philip Green. The clothing mogul is ‘passionate’, ‘over-exuberant and hot-headed’, according to his lawyers, which is why he sometimes makes the kind of social mistakes that seen him settle pay-outs of up to £1 million each with former employees. It could happen to any of us. When he was named in Parliament last year as the businessman seeking an injunction against The Telegraph, Green told the Mail on Sunday that this newspaper was making a meal out of ‘banter’ that had ‘never been offensive.’ Banter like telling a black employee that he ‘was still throwing spears in the jungle.’ ‘Passionate’ behaviour like groping and kissing female employees without their consent. Perhaps Sir Philip Green is too obvious a villain to inspire a sophisticated national conversation on workplace behaviour. (The BHS scandal; the Monaco tax set-up; the time he proclaimed a journalist to be illiterate on the basis he was ‘a f***ing Irishman.’) But plenty of employers still use terms like ‘banter’ to minimize behaviour that seriously degrades the dignity of their colleagues. Green feels like an extreme case, but his refusal to accept the impact of his behaviour makes him a very ordinary office bully. There’s a reason why Ricky Gervais’ portrayal of a cocky boss with boundary issues resonated in The Office.
FEB10	Why are the police wasting time arresting Twitter transphobes when they could be tackling knife crime?	If you have wondered what it takes to get arrested these days then let me tell you about the fate of Kate Scottow, 38, a mother of two from Hitchin in Hertfordshire. On December 1 last year three police officers – three – came to her home and arrested her in front of her kids, one of whom is still a baby. They took her to the local nick and if reports are to be believed – and the Hertfordshire police have certainly not contradicted them – they detained her for seven hours in the cells. They confiscated her laptop and her mobile phone, neither of which has been returned. And what was her crime? She is said to have insulted a transgender woman. She called her a man. Over the internet. On Twitter. Now I hold no particular brief for Kate Scottow. It appears that, like many other people on Twitter, she is unbridled in her tongue. It would seem, furthermore, that her attitude towards transgender people is antediluvian and offensive – but if, and only if, you can be bothered to read her tweets, and if and only if you can be bothered to take offence. When they read the story of Kate Scottow, I believe most people would indeed be outraged, but not primarily at the content of her tweets. Of course we care for anyone whose feelings are bruised, but we aren’t focussing on that. We are thinking about the three police officers, the custody suite that was occupied for seven hours, the witness statements, the court proceedings – the considerable expenditure of public money on what would seem to be a silly (if nasty) Twitter spat; and we think about that peculiar abuse of manpower and police facilities when we learn that in the last couple of days the NHS has reported a 54 per cent increase in stabbings, and when there seems to be a new and tragic incident of knife crime reported virtually every day.
FEB10	Britain was once a global trading power. After Brexit it can be again	A short distance from Australia House on the Strand, a commemorative plaque marks the location of the offices of the Anti-Corn Law League. The repeal of the Corn Laws was the great issue of 19th century politics. And, while it produced endless controversy in the Parliament and split the Tory Party, there are few today who would doubt that Britain made the right decision to throw off the chains of protectionism. In fact, it is hard to think of a nation in history whose prosperity was more directly the product of free trade. For centuries, Britain was a land of merchant adventurers, for whom the oceans were highways of a global commerce. Wherever one stands on the question of Brexit, it undoubtedly presents opportunities, denied to Britain for almost half a century, to once again embrace its historic role as a global trading power. Australia, too, is a nation whose modern prosperity is the product of free trade. Trade between our two nations has diminished in the 45 years since Britain’s accession to the European Economic Community. Brexit gives Britain the opportunity to revive that trade – as it does with other likeminded nations in the Indo-Pacific region: the engine of the 21st century global economy.
FEB10	My grandparents fled Iran in terror. How can some people in Britain still support the regime?	Forty years ago today, the final stages in the collapse of Iran’s Pahlavi regime were unfolding. In Tehran, mutineers and guerrillas were battling the Imperial Guard in what Le Monde excitedly described as a new “Paris Commune”. A day later, a revolutionary crowd stormed Evin Prison – the interrogation (and torture) centre of the Shah’s Savak secret police. Then the military declared neutrality. Just 10 days after Ayatollah Khomeini’s return from exile, the revolution was unstoppable. There was barely a year between President Carter’s declaration of Iran as an “island of stability” and the flight of the Shah. He never returned. Neither did my grandparents, leaving behind everything that they couldn’t carry with them, including their dog Pom-Pom. Across the world, the fall of the Shah was celebrated by those who naively anticipated a new democratic era. But it was especially hailed by the Left, who revelled in the humiliation of the United States. Some even welcomed the arrival of a political Islam, which they saw as the antithesis of the Western liberal capitalist model. The French philosopher Michel Foucault exemplified this, praising the “spirit” and revolutionary “élan” of the uprising and predicting that there “would not be a Khomeini government”. In fact, the Ayatollah ruled as “Supreme Leader” until his death a decade later. His revolutionary terror purged opponents of all hues – Leftists, secularists, ethnic minorities, democrats, as well as critics and erstwhile supporters within the Shia establishment.
FEB10	Jean-Claude Juncker embodies everything Britain detests about the EU	You want to understand why Britain voted Leave? Here is an explanation in three words. Jean. Claude. Juncker. There he was again this week, reminding us of all the self-satisfied, antiquated and anti-British attitudes that we rejected in 2016.  Though commentators focused on Donald Tusk’s “special place in hell” remarks, it was in reality far more obnoxious to watch Juncker cooing with Leo Varadkar over a card from a Dublin woman asserting that “Britain does not care about peace in Northern Ireland.” That the President of the European Commission thought it right to release the text is proof, if proof were needed, that his resentment against Britain outweighs his interest in the prosperity of the EU’s remaining members.​ Britain reacted wearily, almost resignedly. We have reached the point where our blazing rows have given way to quiet contempt. The tipsy Luxembourger embodies everything Britain was voting against in 2016. If you want a perfect symbol of the remote, smug, entitled Brussels bureaucracy, look no further.
FEB10	The Green case proves the urgent need to reform non-disclosure agreements	Compare and contrast. In today’s Sunday Telegraph, Auna Irvine, an American former employee of Sir Philip Green’s business empire, speaks publicly about the shocking abuse she claims to have suffered at his hands. Yesterday, in The Daily Telegraph, we reported on the allegations of five other people who say they suffered harassment when working under Sir Philip. We did not reveal their names. The reason? They, unlike Ms Irvine, are bound by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), an instrument that is being used to silence accusations of sexual and racial harassment. This is why we are puzzled by arguments such as those made by Lord Garnier, a Tory barrister, on the Today programme yesterday, who said of the NDAs used in the Green case: “There were lawyers of quality on both sides, they reached an agreement and they paid money for it.” This perspective is naive. For a start, even if Lord Garnier’s words are accurate, this is not how the NDA system is meant to work; it’s not supposed to allow a rich person potentially to contract out of the law. What is the point of even having laws against harassment if employers can theoretically buy their way around them? This doesn’t happen in any other sphere of life. Secondly, there could have been a real power imbalance. One accuser said Sir Philip is “like a general hiding behind an entire army… of wealth, power and influence”. If, as Sir Philip insists, the allegations against him were just banter, why did he fork out so much money to oblige silence? And why did he impose an injunction on the Telegraph that stopped us from reporting the details? Now that this injunction has been lifted, we can let readers judge for themselves.

FEB10	Letters: The wrongful attempt to hide allegations against Sir Philip Green	SIR – You have published details in regard to allegations against Sir Philip Green of harassment and abuse, and of sexual and physical assault, many of which appear to be, prima facie, criminal offences in English law).  The people of this land are protected by the Crown, and cases of a criminal nature are prosecuted by the Crown, not the individual.  Any attempt to prevent such allegations being properly presented before a criminal court is classed as “perverting the course of justice”, a criminal offence that carries a sentence of life imprisonment and or an indeterminate fine.

FEB11	Deselecting Brexit rebels would end up poisoning the Tory party – just look at what's happened to Labour	In 1998, when I was Tory leader, I laid down that our policy would be to oppose Britain joining the euro. I always think that, whatever I got wrong in my political career, I definitely got that decision right. Yet there were some MPs in my own party who were deeply unhappy about that policy, including a small number who resigned from my front bench team. One became a minor thorn in my side, whereupon his constituency association – thinking they were being helpful to me – started discussing deselecting him as a Tory candidate.  I quietly sent a message to that association asking them to desist, and to continue to support their rebel MP.  I thought then, as I do now, that a successful party needs a breadth of opinion for the long term, and should not embark on purges of those who from time to time disagree with the leader, or indeed the activists. This is not to say that MPs should have carte blanche for life from their local association. If they vote against their party on a vote of confidence, that is the same as quitting the party, and should be treated as such. And if they are not applying themselves to serving their constituents, their local party should hold them to account.
FEB11	My advice to the Pope? Take the million dollars and go vegan for Lent	Still no word from the Pope about whether he’s accepting the challenge from a 12-year-old girl in Long Beach, California to go vegan for Lent for a million dollars. Genesis Butler, who was pictured in full-page newspaper advertisements looking wistfully into the heavens, isn’t funding the challenge herself (to do so would admittedly suggest unusual financial autonomy for a preteen). Rather, she’s fronting a campaign called Million Dollar Vegan, which is backed by vegan activists including Sir Paul McCartney. Genesis – who presumably was christened after the first book of the Bible – has, it seems, been vegan since the age of six and has staged multiple protests against animal cruelty. She says there are many reasons for eating a plant-based diet: “An animal side, a health side and an environmental side”. She wears a T-shirt saying: Fight Climate Change with Diet Change. My own daughter is precisely her age and she doesn’t come up with this sort of stuff. I can only assume that poor Genesis has been indoctrinated by her parents with a thoroughness that organised religion can only dream of. Anyway, if the Pope has any sense, he’ll take the money and spend it on the poor. Because what even 12-year-old vegans should know is that fasting in Lent is par for the course, and until very recently, most Catholics would have had a fasting regime that was essentially vegan plus fish. Pope Gregory, in the sixth century, summed it up: Meat, dairy and eggs were off the menu for 40 days. It’s why we have Shrove Tuesday: pancakes were a useful way of using up the milk and eggs. It’s the reason for the festival we call Mardi Gras or Carnival – farewell to meat – to finish off the supplies before the fast started, and it was generally a festival of misrule. Actually, Lent was formerly a time to abstain from fighting and sex as well, but that’s rather less popular now.
FEB11	What I've seen in California has changed my mind about legalising cannabis in Britain	Someone who lives near the corner of west London parkland where I work out twice a week likes an early morning spliff. I’ve never seen his face, but as he takes up his usual position against the park railings between 8.30 and 9am to enjoy a quiet smoke, I’ll be crunching, lunging, squatting and Russian twisting (don’t ask) in a haze of wake and bake – wondering all the while: is this stuff basically legal now? Certainly the police care less than ever before. Maybe they think it’s only a matter of time now. Or maybe they just don’t recognize the smell. After all, the Commissioner Cressida Dick admitted on Desert Island Discs at the weekend that she “simply cannot smell, ever, the smell of cannabis” – whereas I’d know it in a heartbeat. Eight years in LA – where it’s been fully legal for 13 months and as common a street smell as coffee or bakeries for far longer – will do that to you. It’ll also challenge your beliefs on a subject I, for one, thought my mind was made up about. Witnessing the marijuana-fuelled descent into schizophrenia of a family friend as a child had always made me question how it could be defined as a “soft drug.” After all, here was a once wide-smiled, bright-eyed boy who took to turning up, dazed, confused and on one occasion suicidal at our house after years of use.
FEB11	Our children - and the economy - deserve better than the outdated GCSE	The UK economy is under threat. Barely a day goes by without fresh news stories about skills shortages in one sector or another, which cost the economy more than £6.3 billion each year. How did we get here? The Fourth Industrial Revolution, with the automation of jobs and digitisation of our workplaces, is one obvious factor. From driverless cars to artificial intelligence to 3D printing, the jobs market is experiencing unparallelled changes. Employers in my own constituency and elsewhere tell me that what they need to meet the demands of the 21st century economy is an adaptable workforce, with core skills like communication, problem-solving and team-work. Though sometimes dismissed as ‘soft skills’, more than ever, businesses need these qualities to succeed.
FEB11	Crackerjack was terrible at the time. Why is the BBC reviving it?	With its end-of-the-pier gags and inevitable gunge tanks, Crackerjack was, by the objective standards of any era, truly appalling children’s television. Yet the BBC, in their infinite wisdom, have decided to relaunch the programme after a 35-year break. In an age of such excellent kids programmes as Trollhunters and Girl Meets World, it’s difficult to imagine how an "ideas" meeting at the Beeb could have concluded that a show so spectacularly unfunny, unimaginative and stylistically tired, even by the standards of the early 1980’s, was ripe for revival. Desperation would appear to play a part here. With Netflix, Hulu and Amazon streaming an immense array of original kids programming of their own, perhaps the return of Crackerjack can be attributed to a saturnine combination of slashed budgets, withered creativity and misplaced sentimentality.
FEB11	If we're heading for a no-deal Brexit, why is the Government not acting now?	For much of this week the House of Commons was due to have been in recess, and for next week, too. The break was cancelled in order to deal with the Brexit crisis, for that is what it is becoming. Yet the business in Parliament this week is remarkably light. The mainstay is due to be a statement from Theresa May on Wednesday about the progress, or otherwise, of her talks with the EU that are aimed at changing the text of the Withdrawal Agreement to meet objections to the Irish backstop provision. So far, the EU side has refused to budge on this matter and looks unlikely to by Wednesday. If there is no agreement, Mrs May has pledged on at least three occasions, as have many Cabinet ministers, to table a motion on Thursday that can be amended by MPs. It was this commitment two weeks ago that persuaded potential Tory rebels to give Mrs May more time when it looked as if the Commons might try to seize control of events by removing the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Yet it now looks as if the Prime Minister yet again wants to postpone a showdown and seek another fortnight’s grace in the hope of securing changes able to get her deal over the line. If by February 27 she cannot bring a renegotiated agreement before Parliament for a so-called meaningful vote then she promises to let the House debate an amendable motion that would allow all the various alternatives to be voted on.
FEB11	Broadband has become a utility like any other – and must be provided in the same way	The urbanisation of Britain continues apace, almost, it seems, as a deliberate ambition of public policy. According to the latest State of Rural Services report, people living in the English countryside are constrained from building up their own businesses because in many cases they cannot even make a simple mobile phone call. One third of rural buildings on four major networks are affected by a problem that is almost unknown in urban premises. A 4G connection, essential for anyone wishing to work online, cannot be accessed in 58 per cent of countryside buildings. Rural dwellers are used to having fewer amenities and services than towns and cities, but what they do have is gradually being chipped away at. Public transport, for instance, has in many parts of the countryside disappeared altogether. In 2017, 200 bus services were withdrawn from shire districts and another 200 reduced. Less public funding is directed towards rural residents than urban areas, despite the higher cost of providing essential services such as social care, education and public transport in rural parts. The inability for many in the countryside to access superfast broadband compounds the problem. The ability to get online is no longer a luxury, it is essential – not only for those wanting to launch a small business, but increasingly, just to access public services. Soon, GP services will all be digitised, making connectivity essential, especially for older people.
FEB11	The Green case proves the urgent need to reform non-disclosure agreements	Compare and contrast. In today’s Sunday Telegraph, Auna Irvine, an American former employee of Sir Philip Green’s business empire, speaks publicly about the shocking abuse she claims to have suffered at his hands. Yesterday, in The Daily Telegraph, we reported on the allegations of five other people who say they suffered harassment when working under Sir Philip. We did not reveal their names. The reason? They, unlike Ms Irvine, are bound by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), an instrument that is being used to silence accusations of sexual and racial harassment. This is why we are puzzled by arguments such as those made by Lord Garnier, a Tory barrister, on the Today programme yesterday, who said of the NDAs used in the Green case: “There were lawyers of quality on both sides, they reached an agreement and they paid money for it.” This perspective is naive. For a start, even if Lord Garnier’s words are accurate, this is not how the NDA system is meant to work; it’s not supposed to allow a rich person potentially to contract out of the law. What is the point of even having laws against harassment if employers can theoretically buy their way around them? This doesn’t happen in any other sphere of life. Secondly, there could have been a real power imbalance. One accuser said Sir Philip is “like a general hiding behind an entire army… of wealth, power and influence”. If, as Sir Philip insists, the allegations against him were just banter, why did he fork out so much money to oblige silence? And why did he impose an injunction on the Telegraph that stopped us from reporting the details? Now that this injunction has been lifted, we can let readers judge for themselves.
FEB11	Letters: The wrongful attempt to hide allegations against Sir Philip Green	SIR – You have published details in regard to allegations against Sir Philip Green of harassment and abuse, and of sexual and physical assault, many of which appear to be, prima facie, criminal offences in English law).  The people of this land are protected by the Crown, and cases of a criminal nature are prosecuted by the Crown, not the individual.  Any attempt to prevent such allegations being properly presented before a criminal court is classed as “perverting the course of justice”, a criminal offence that carries a sentence of life imprisonment and or an indeterminate fine.
FEB11	Letters: Removing the backstop won’t make May’s deal any more acceptable	SIR – People need to stop watching the backstop birdie. Even without the backstop, the Withdrawal Agreement gives the EU the power to make rules that Britain would have to follow, but over which it would have no say. The Withdrawal Agreement would undermine Britain’s competitiveness and embed in international law everlasting EU control in matters of the environment, labour law, taxation, competition and state aid. It would allow the EU and the EU alone to determine the rules of trade in Britain’s future trading relationships. As remaining in the EU has been rejected at the ballot box, and as the agreement is unacceptable, and as the EU refuses to change its terms, the only option left for Britain is to leave without a deal. We should press ahead with this and take whatever measures are necessary to mitigate the short-term difficulties that would follow.
FEB12	It's strange that the 'gym date' is more significant than a meeting between two SNP bosses	That Liz Lloyd, Nicola Sturgeon’s chief of staff, recorded a visit to the gym in her official diary but not her presence at a secret meeting with Alex Salmond has thrown up once again the complex situation viz-a-viz government special advisors.  They are regarded, in a formal sense, as temporary civil servants and as such ultimately answerable to the permanent secretary in their government department for their adherence, or otherwise, to Civil Service codes of practice.  However, that is merely so much fiction. As has become clear over the years, their first duty is to the minster who employs them. 
FEB12	An unholy alliance of Left and Right could push the PM into a no-deal Brexit she doesn't want	Hold. Our. Nerve. The Prime Minister’s battle cry rang out across the Commons yesterday like that of an army commander who has led troops across a quagmire, losing men, ammunition and kit along the way, to confront a well-defended, heavily-armed enemy who cannot quite believe what it is witnessing. C’est magnifique, mais ce n’est pas la guerre! At least the Light Brigade made the charge that led to General Bosquet’s deathless observation. Does anyone really believe Mrs May is going to spur her horse towards the guns of a no-deal Brexit? In order for a bluff to work, the other side must believe you mean it. Yet the Prime Minister does not want a no deal withdrawal and everyone knows this. The Government’s avowed policy is to leave the EU with an agreement, and if that does not happen it will be one of the greatest failures of statecraft of modern times. Mrs May used to say no deal was better than a bad deal; yet by a majority of 230 the House of Commons rejected the agreement she reached last November with the EU so by definition MPs consider it to be a bad deal. But she is intent on forcing them to agree to it, albeit with changes to the Northern Ireland protocol, or backstop, if she can secure them.
FEB12	If social media companies want to be a force for good, responsibility must become core to their business	Like them or loathe them, social media companies have transformed the world in which we live. From finding love to toppling corrupt governments, this multi-billion dollar industry – with sharing as its organising principle – can be a force for good. As a former science and innovation minister, I know we are only at the start of this technological revolution. And I want Britain to be the go‑to place in Europe where digital platforms – including social media and messaging behemoths like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Tinder – can flourish. But that also means recognising that this great leap forward in connecting people can cause harm, to individuals and society at large. The argument that the web should be beyond careful regulation is long past its sell by date. Social media giants have come of age and are making vast profits. Now they must take on the big responsibilities we expect of all big companies.
FEB12	For the tragic boomerang generation, there is no place but home	I’m afraid that our downsizing plans have had to be put on hold as it becomes clear that providing a roof over the offsprings’ heads is a responsibility which no longer ends when they hit 18. After a gap, the nest, vacant save for a few twigs and a poignant tail feather, is full once more with ravenous chicks who are guaranteed to have eaten whatever it was you were saving for tonight’s dinner. “Yeah, but I was like staaaa-rrrving, Mum.” I was inclined to blame God who found it amusing to give me not one, but two “creative” children who think that rent is a musical about Aids. Where, I ask bitterly, is my missing third child, Brian, the chartered accountant, with his neat haircut, career trajectory and off-plan flat in Docklands?
FEB12	Is Peppa Pig really what it takes to teach Americans how to speak English?	When I first brought my British boyfriend to America to meet my grandmother 20 years ago, she greeted him warmly as he jumped out of the car, with these words: “Recite some poetry for me! Perhaps a bit of Hamlet?” Standing on her front lawn, he charmingly complied, and thus was the myth of the superiority of the British accent perpetuated, at least in Grandma’s corner of Virginia. These days, the Queen’s English has a new, rather stumpier transatlantic ambassador, in the form of Peppa, a cartoon pig from a popular children’s TV show. In a reverse migration that will enchant the legions of British parents who have long bemoaned the Californian twang their children affected, American parents have detected an invasion of received pronunciation among their children. “I’d like to thank Peppa Pig for the slight yet adorable British accent my toddler is acquiring,” tweeted @jenrofe. America’s morning TV shows were atwitter, too, about the trend, with parents citing a change in vocabulary. If generations of British parents have attempted to ban Americanisms, their US counterparts seem rather chuffed by their toddlers’ expanding lexicon. American children are now “going on holiday”, eating “tom-ah-toes” and re-labelling mom “Mummy”.
FEB12	Whatever our role on the global stage, the government's lack of joined-up thinking is worrying	Gavin Williamson cannot be faulted for the scale of his ambitions. In a speech yesterday, the Defence Secretary spoke of strengthening the ability of our Armed Forces to tackle future threats, as well as offering some thoughts as to how they might be used to project Britain as a global power post-Brexit. To that end, Mr Williamson wants to create two strike groups around the new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers: one to operate East of Suez in the Indo-Pacific, the other to concentrate on the Mediterranean, Atlantic and Baltic. In addition, he wants to increase the number of Typhoon fighter squadrons from five to seven, create what he calls a “Warfighting Division” able to deploy from bases at home and in Germany, and to use the Government’s Transformation Fund to develop swarm squadrons of drones that will confuse and overwhelm the enemy. By way of showing his determination to demonstrate Britain’s “hard power”, Mr Williamson declared his intention to sail one of the aircraft carriers, equipped with British and US F-35 stealth warplanes, through the disputed South China Sea as a warning to Beijing not to flout international law.
FEB12	The Cairncross review deserves a cautious welcome	As Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, observes on these pages, a free press is one of the cornerstones of democracy. But the decline in sales and a fall in advertising revenues have been problematic for the newspaper industry, especially regionally and locally. A year ago, Theresa May asked the academic Dame Frances Cairncross to conduct a review of the industry’s viability. After facing the threat of quasi-state regulation from a parliament emboldened by the Leveson inquiry, we were sceptical about government involvement. The whole point of a free press, after all, is to be free of state control. Dame Frances sees the goal of any intervention as not to protect publishing companies themselves but “to advocate measures that will ensure the market in which they operate is efficient, and to defend their most democratically significant outputs”. She rightly says society should care about the disruption of journalism, and of high-quality journalism in particular. This is a wide-ranging report whose conclusions need to be absorbed by the industry and the Government. We would need to be convinced, for instance, about the need for an Institute for Public Service News, which would channel finance into those parts of the industry “deemed most worthy of support”. Deemed by who and on what criteria?

FEB12	Letters: Theresa May's idea of a Brexit that can please the Labour benches	SIR – In her letter on Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader (report, February 11), Theresa May, the Prime Minister, wrote that “the urgent task at hand is to find a deal that honours our commitments to the people of Northern Ireland, can command support in Parliament and can be negotiated with the EU”. Strange: I thought it was to honour the wishes of the British people, as expressed in June 2016. Eve Wilson Hill Head, Hampshire

FEB13	Global Britain can lead the world in confronting the dark side of big tech	Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears to have done the impossible. He has brought consensus to Westminster. And he’s inspired Britain to be a global leader in technology policy without setting foot on British soil. Of course, the cross-party alliance that he has wrought comes at his own expense. Setting aside partisan battling for once, politicians of every stripe seem to agree that the titans of digital media should take responsibility for the harms their products can cause to public health, security, privacy and much more. And it would also be nice if they paid a fair share in tax. Despite the relentless turbulence of the Brexit debates, select committees in Parliament (led by the Tories and Liberal Democrats) have conducted serious investigations in the last few months into the social problems caused by the tech industry. Both have proposed major changes to the law.
FEB13	The PM's war on waste shows a real dash of the Blitz spirit	Politicians are warned against offering “jam tomorrow”, lest the electorate punish them for bandying about some idyllic future prospect that never comes to pass. On the face of it, then, it seems uncharacteristically bold of Theresa May to be proffering jam right now. Especially at a time when the more nervous among us may already be stockpiling jars in anticipation of a no‑deal Brexit. Yet the Prime Minister deserves to be commended for explaining how she scrapes the mould off her jam in order to consume the “perfectly edible” area beneath, during a Cabinet discussion on food waste, as she should for insisting on flouting sell-by dates – the PM declaring that she prefers “common sense” to printed decrees. It’s the sort of good, abstemious stuff one would expect from a vicar’s daughter. Moreover, it is clearly designed to be the type of advice that makes us feel we have a steady hand on the tiller, despite all appearances to the contrary.
FEB13	For grown-ups, Valentine's Day is a test - here's how to pass	Did you wake your beloved this morning with a bunch of red roses, a heart shaped box of chocolates, and a card with a picture of a pig in a jacket sunbathing on a lilo? No. Well, so far so good then. And, if you're planning on it, it’s not too late to turn things around and toxic-proof this Valentine’s Day, or maybe even turn it to your advantage. Do pay close attention though. The thing about Valentine’s Day, now, is that it’s irrelevant but at the same time the day of potentially causing offence. Nobody cares. Everyone’s past it. Maybe it’s even a bit creepy in 2019. And yet, how you play it has to be carefully managed. The fact is that the day of flirty love messaging  and 20 long-stemmed roses is over, but the day of proving your emotional sensitivity has arrived. It’s a test, basically. For men - if I hadn’t already made that clear. And here is how to pass... Regardless of how little we care, we will hear: “you are a blunt domestic instrument who I no longer think of romantically. You are wife. You are old. I’ve sort of forgotten you’re a female in a way”. 
FEB13	Just like Macmillan, we can deliver a housing market that works for future generations	Since we set the bold ambition to deliver 300,000 properties a year by the mid-2020s ministers, including myself, have noted the important connection with Harold Macmillan. Super Mac took up the challenge of rehousing the nation after the Second World War and within three years had managed to gear an industry up to achieve record levels of performance. We rightly look back at this era in awe at the scale of ambition and mine it for lessons we can use today. A recognition of the interconnection between state and industry at a time of significant building was a central theme of the 1950s mass building, and in that spirit I am proud today to announce £250 million of new housing deals to build almost 25,000 much-needed properties across the country.  Similarly, there was an approach which brought government together where different parts of the state worked in support of a common political goal. Fast forward to today and under an innovative agreement our housing accelerator Homes England will help deliver more than 10,000 properties on Ministry of Defence sites.
FEB13	Does Olly Robbins's hotel bar blunder hint at an anti-Brexit conspiracy?	It is almost as if the majority of our commentariat and MPs have Stockholm Syndrome; they have been captured by No 10 spin and don't want to believe anything else. In fairness, most curious occurrences tend to be “cock up” rather than conspiracy, but sometimes it is just that - conspiracy. The history books are littered with devious activity by politicians and Whitehall, so it must happen. The remarks Olly Robbins, the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, is alleged to have made in a bar in Brussels raise the very question of this dichotomy between accident and design.
FEB13	It's no wonder Europeans hold the EU in contempt when it flagrantly ignores its own rules	The EU is often called a rules-based organisation, which is ironic given the alacrity with which it breaks them. A recent example of this cavalier attitude to the regulations it imposes upon others was the appointment of Martin Selmayr as Secretary-General of the European Commission, one of the most powerful positions in the bloc. Mr Selmayr had previously been chief of staff to Jean Claude-Juncker, the Commission president, and is reputedly determined to see the UK suffer for having the temerity to vote for Brexit. The German’s elevation to such a key post last year was a surprise, not least because no one else appeared to have been considered for the role. An investigation by the EU ombudsman has now found that the appointment “did not follow EU law, in letter or spirit, and did not follow the Commission’s own rules”. Yet it seems there are to be no consequences for this blatant piece of favouritism, other than to request the Commission to look again at their appointments procedures. It is hardly surprising that disdain for the EU as an institution and for its practitioners is growing across the continent. This will be evident in the elections to the EU parliament in May when populist parties are expected to gain significant ground, though doubtless even that shock will be ignored by the powers-that-be in Brussels.
FEB13	The Universal Credit controversy must not distract the government from continuing to reform welfare	Since she was appointed Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd has introduced changes to the department’s flagship policy, Universal Credit (UC). She has scrapped plans to extend the two-child benefit cap to new claimants and has delayed the roll-out of the reform until next year. Earlier this week, she conceded that a greater use of food banks was linked to the delays in making payments to recipients of the new credit. Ms Rudd is anxious that the introduction of UC should be seen as “compassionate” and few would want it to be harsh. She is right to worry that a policy that began life with support across party lines, and from charities and campaigners, might have been bungled. In theory, UC is a good idea because it not only rationalises an unwieldy system of half a dozen benefits but is motivated by a proper ambition to make work pay. It is in its practice that UC has been found wanting, a problem caused as much by a failure to understand the disparate needs of claimants. The danger is that the controversy will deflect the Government from continuing along the path of welfare reform. Once Brexit is concluded and the parties revert to domestic priorities, the temptation will be strong for the Conservatives to match Labour’s spendthrift proclivities rather than pursue reforms which just a few years ago were considered an economic necessity.

FEB13	Letters: Constituency associations should act against MPs trying to derail Brexit	SIR – When will William Hague and others recognise that the concept of the Burkean MP does not apply to Brexit? MPs asked the electorate what to do and they were told. It is their duty to uphold that decision. Those who voted Remain, or are critical of the Government’s actions, hold legitimate positions. However, flagrant sabotage is unacceptable and should earn the wrath of constituency parties. Furthermore, with the proposed Brexit Party looking to split the vote, those MPs will become an electoral liability anyway. Does anyone expect the Tories to hold Broxtowe?

FEB14	SNP's blatant social engineering undermines Scotland's best universities	Nicola Sturgeon has made a point of insisting that at the next Holyrood election she wants the voters to judge her on how well she’s done in closing the educational attainment gap between the richest and poorest Scottish children. Most of those who heard the First Minister’s words assumed that the way she was going to achieve this entirely laudable objective was by raising standards in the country’s schools, and especially in those where standards had slipped alarmingly. However, it is now becoming crystal clear that if that promise is to be kept and that embarrassing  gap closed, then the Scottish Government’s main focus is not now on improving schools but, instead, on lowering standards in Scotland’s universities – in some cases by a significant extent.
FEB14	The case for faith remains saintly in this hostile environment	By the age of 32, Pugin had become one of England’s best-known architects – sometimes too well-known. He used to tell a story about being recognised on a train by a woman who exclaimed “You, sir, are a Catholic: I must get into another carriage.” A fairly common reaction in the days when his faith was seen as a kind of virus infecting the stupid, the untrustworthy and the Irish. So when John Henry Newman, one of the most greatest minds of the Victorian era, chose to convert to Catholicism, he would have expected the abuse that followed. He would not have expected a sainthood. The whole process will seem bizarre to non-Catholics: proof, perhaps, of what a funny bunch we are. You need two miracles to qualify as a saint and the second Newman miracle has just been recognised: a woman from Chicago says that her prayer to him stopped a miscarriage. Vatican authorities agree that it defied medical explanation. So Britain will soon have its first new saint since 1976: a former Oxford don whose life and (copious) works will now be held up an example. You might think that this is all a bit odd, and that something else is probably going on. You’d be right. The Catholic Church has long understood that saints convey religious points better than any number of religious texts. Take Catherine of Alexandria, whose teenage evangelisation efforts in the 4th century so irritated Emperor Maxentius that he had her cross-examined in public by 50 of Rome’s finest philosophers. He thought they’d humiliate her, exposing her errors to the world. Instead, each one ended up converting to Christianity. She was put to death, but not defeated. Now, that’s a story.
FEB14	Brexit vote: What did MPs decide on Valentine's Day, and how will it affect the deal?	Parliament has had its latest say on Brexit as MPs considered a new spate of amendments on Valentine's Day to a fresh Government motion. None of the amendments legally change anything, but are symbolically important and pile pressure on the Government and Theresa May. Even the Prime Minister's motion proved controversial, as Eurosceptics feared that they were being invited to endorse not just the Brady amendment MPs previously passed demanding "alternative arrangments" to the backstop, but also the Spelman amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit.
FEB14	Don’t underestimate the role of female jihadis like Shamina Begum	We have a dangerous habit of playing down the importance of women in extremist networks. Common prejudices about the ‘fairer sex’ often lead us to assume a passive role. Yet in reality, women are just as engaged as their male counterparts - if not more so. Our assumptions simply support a narrative that removes agency from them. These facts should be acknowledged when we are deciding what to do with Shamima Begum, a young woman who has made a series of terrible choices but must also be dealt with in a just and transparent manner. The conflict in Syria has thrown up innumerable questions for our society - chief among them, what to do with the cadre of young Britons initially drawn to fight alongside Isil, who now find themselves detained or lingering in refugee camps as the terrorist group dissolves. The government has so far given little indication or guidance on how to deal with such individuals. Although work is being done in some cases, overall, our strategy seem to be waiting to see how things play out, or else hoping someone else will deal with the problem.
FEB14	Tory Brexiteers have given Brussels the perfect excuse not to give ground on the backstop	Parliament might have humiliated Theresa May last month by rejecting her deal, but at least she could try and tell Brussels that it had been clear on what it wanted to change for it to be accepted. The House of Commons indicated last month by backing the Brady amendment that it would approve a Brexit deal if Mrs May secured "alternative arrangements" to the backstop, and - by backing Caroline Spelman's amendment - that it really did not want no deal to happen. That gave the Prime Minister three words to hammer home in Brussels to underline the importance of her demands for compromise on the backstop: Parliament. Has. Spoken. Mrs May needed Parliament to be clear as possible on that to convince European leaders that compromising on the backstop would clear a way for the deal. Michel Barnier remarked last month that he had "the impression that the backstop is not the central issue". He will undoubtedly feel that his first impression was correct now that MPs have voted down Government motion suggesting that Parliament still agreed with what it wanted last month. 
FEB14	What is Britain's current Brexit negotiating position?	Brussels must be scratching its head: what exactly is Britain’s position on Brexit? Last night, MPs appeared to vote down the very negotiating position they had endorsed two weeks before, and suddenly Theresa May’s claim that “Parliament has spoken” looks weak. Brexiteers rejected this motion because they suspected it could take a no-deal outcome off the table, despite Number 10’s insistence to the contrary. That’s the price Number 10 pays for two years of playing its cards close to its chest, ignoring ministers, crossing red lines and generally being “nebulous”. Those who really want Brexit no longer take the Government’s word on trust.   Mrs May could say to the Europeans: “This is proof that we must reform the backstop if we are to strike a deal.” That might lead to the insertion of a new time limit or a unilateral withdrawal mechanism. But it is more likely that she will conclude “nothing has changed” and press on with Plan A. The Prime Minister isn’t running down the clock, she is strolling on calmly, reportedly in the hope that Brussels will surrender at the last minute and hand her some rhetorical formula that satisfies Leavers and squeezes a largely unchanged Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament.
FEB14	The government must treat cannabis use as both a crime and a public health problem	The figures today showing the mental health impact of cannabis on young people are shocking. An estimated 60,000 adults who smoked the drug as teenagers have been permanently damaged. The landmark Oxford University study says that around one in 14 cases of depression can be attributed to cannabis use. This has occurred despite an apparent decline in consumption among young people in recent years. The explanation is that the THC content of the drug, the element that produces the so-called high, is far stronger than it once was. Most cannabis sold on the streets is super-strength “skunk”, which is highly potent and places users at risk of a range of mental disorders that include schizophrenia, psychosis and depression.
FEB14	If the PM were clearer about her Brexit intentions, Olly Robbins' remarks would be less worrying	Civil servants usually stay in the shadows, advising ministers but never proffering their own view of policy. Brexit has thrust Olly Robbins, the chief negotiator with the EU, into a limelight he would probably prefer to avoid. His seemingly incautious comments to colleagues in a Brussels hotel bar, overheard by a television journalist, have reignited speculation over the direction of Government policy. Ministers were forced to deny his apparent assessment that the only two options for Brexit were Theresa May’s deal, if and when it is amended by further negotiations with the EU, or a lengthy delay to the UK’s departure. To most observers of the Byzantine machinations surrounding Brexit, what Mr Robbins said sounded plausible, even likely. The Government’s stated policy is to leave the EU with a deal. Mrs May’s difficulty is that the agreement she reached with the EU was emphatically rejected by the House of Commons last month. She is now seeking changes to the Irish backstop arrangement in the expectation that these will remove the objections and see her deal over the line. She evidently wishes to keep open the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal in order to exert pressure on the EU side to make concessions. The reason Mr Robbins’s comments have caused such consternation is that they suggest this is a false threat: the Prime Minister has no intention of taking the UK out of the EU without a deal and would seek to extend the Article 50 process if it looked as though this was about to happen.
FEB14	Letters: The government strategy for dealing with Brexit: continuing shambles	SIR – We are in such a mess with Brexit because Theresa May came up with the Chequers plan in secret, with the help of only a small group of advisers. When it was presented to the Cabinet, MPs, the press and the public, the problems became only too apparent. Now, from Olly Robbins’s overheard bar chat, we learn that Mrs May has a plan that she intends to bully MPs into accepting when they see it for the first time at the end of March. Whatever party anyone supports, or whether they voted Leave or Remain, is there a single person who wants the Government to be run in this underhand and incompetent way?
FEB14	Letters: Constituency associations should act against MPs trying to derail Brexit	SIR – When will William Hague and others recognise that the concept of the Burkean MP does not apply to Brexit? MPs asked the electorate what to do and they were told. It is their duty to uphold that decision. Those who voted Remain, or are critical of the Government’s actions, hold legitimate positions. However, flagrant sabotage is unacceptable and should earn the wrath of constituency parties. Furthermore, with the proposed Brexit Party looking to split the vote, those MPs will become an electoral liability anyway. Does anyone expect the Tories to hold Broxtowe?
FEB15	Isil youths like Shamima Begum may be 'lost', but they are still a radicalised menace to society	Well, we now know that there is one place in which the NHS is indeed the “envy of the world”, as its fans so often claim: a refugee camp in Syria. Shamima Begum, one of three Bethnal Green schoolgirls who ran away to join Islamic State in 2014 when she was 15, now wants to come home. She wants to return not because she regrets leaving, because she feels guilty or because she repudiates any of Isil’s ideas. She wants to come back because she is pregnant with her third child and, after losing two babies already to Isil’s backwards and war-racked medical system, wants British healthcare. It’s hard to imagine a less sympathetic case. Given the risk she poses, no right-thinking person can want this woman back in the country and, thankfully, there is little chance of her returning. The UK would have to make an active effort to rescue her from rebel-controlled Syria, an operation that ministers have conclusively ruled out.
FEB15	There is nothing like a good puzzle in puzzling times such as these	With political uncertainty abounding and it being no clearer whether in a few weeks’ time the country will be in, out or shaken all about, these are puzzling times for us all. It was reassuring, then, to see the Queen unveiling a plaque this week to mark the centenary of a great British institution, GCHQ. Appropriately for an organisation that is synonymous with code-breaking, the plaque contained a simple code whereby letters and numbers with dots underneath spelled “1 HUNDRED YEARS”. Code-breaking and puzzles have been at the heart of British society for centuries, and it’s no exaggeration to say that without them our country would be a very different place. Perhaps the most famous code-breaking exercise of them all was the cracking of the Enigma code by the team at Bletchley Park during the Second World War – a team which included members of the public, recruited by virtue of being the quickest and most accurate solvers of the Daily Telegraph Crossword.
FEB15	We may eradicate Isil's territory but its ideology will live on	From its last dugouts in Syria, Isil is in its death throes. But though there is much to celebrate, it would be extremely naïve to equate loss of territory with an end to threats of violence - either in the Middle East or the Western World. Shamima Begum has become a media sensation from the ruins of the caliphate. Though very conscious of her own welfare and the rights of her unborn child, she seems wholly unaffected by the suffering inflicted by the jihadis she chose to join. Her inability to show empathy for the countless victims of this murderous movement echoes other ‘fellow travellers’ in recent history. The fall of the Third Reich, for example, saw many Nazis consumed by self-pity, yet indifferent to Hitler’s victims.
FEB15	Brexiteers may not trust the PM, but their move against her could massively backfire	The British press has surely by now run out of ways to describe the current Brexit-inspired chaos. So perhaps it’s best simply to lay out the current situation as simply and as objectively as possible and allow the reader to do the heavy lifting: last night MPs rejected the prime minister’s negotiation position with the EU, and a large swathe of her own MPs abstained because they don’t trust what she tells them. The European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative MPs, with the sort of organisational discipline for which the government chief whip must truly yearn, chose to abstain en masse, and so abandoned their leader to yet another parliamentary defeat. In fact, the Commons, in its collective wisdom, chose to defeat everything that was put in front of it – the government’s motion, that of the official opposition and one tabled by the SNP. So let’s look on the bright side: at least our political leaders know what they’re against…
FEB15	Trump has to build his wall: it's the great totem in America's war of identity	There’s no arguing with a wall. It’s either there or it isn’t, and Donald Trump either builds one or he doesn’t. If he doesn’t, his presidency will be judged a failure. That’s the risk a politician takes when he tries to bundle a country’s history, identity and aspiration into a single physical project – and he hasn’t got the money for it. Even a Republican-run Congress wouldn’t give him the cash, and the new, Democrat House certainly will not. Trump has taken the only avenue left: declare a national emergency. There are an estimated 10.7 million unauthorised immigrants in the USA, as of 2016 – a big number, although it has levelled off in recent years. Republicans say they lower wages, burden schools and commit crime. In 2014, Barack Obama called the system “broken … All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America.” Obama’s formula, like that of most presidents before him, was a mix of compassion and crack-down. He created a pathway to legal status for “alien minors” but it’s also claimed that he deported more illegal immigrants than any president before.
FEB15	The consequences  of Isil treachery	Shamima Begum, who ran away to Syria at the age of 15 to become a jihadi’s bride, now asks if she can come back to Britain to “live quietly”. Some will suggest that Britain should be “compassionate”, that we should forgive an impressionable young woman her errors. That is out of the question. By any sensible definition, Ms Begum committed a terrible crime against this country and our way of life by travelling to Syria to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil). Justice and public opinion demand that she be punished severely.  Unfortunately, we do not know what the Government’s approach will be, even if Ms Begum will face prosecution if she makes it back to the UK.
FEB15	What is Britain's current Brexit negotiating position?	Brussels must be scratching its head: what exactly is Britain’s position on Brexit? Last night, MPs appeared to vote down the very negotiating position they had endorsed two weeks before, and suddenly Theresa May’s claim that “Parliament has spoken” looks weak. Brexiteers rejected this motion because they suspected it could take a no-deal outcome off the table, despite Number 10’s insistence to the contrary. That’s the price Number 10 pays for two years of playing its cards close to its chest, ignoring ministers, crossing red lines and generally being “nebulous”. Those who really want Brexit no longer take the Government’s word on trust.   Mrs May could say to the Europeans: “This is proof that we must reform the backstop if we are to strike a deal.” That might lead to the insertion of a new time limit or a unilateral withdrawal mechanism. But it is more likely that she will conclude “nothing has changed” and press on with Plan A. The Prime Minister isn’t running down the clock, she is strolling on calmly, reportedly in the hope that Brussels will surrender at the last minute and hand her some rhetorical formula that satisfies Leavers and squeezes a largely unchanged Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament.
FEB15	The government must treat cannabis use as both a crime and a public health problem	The figures today showing the mental health impact of cannabis on young people are shocking. An estimated 60,000 adults who smoked the drug as teenagers have been permanently damaged. The landmark Oxford University study says that around one in 14 cases of depression can be attributed to cannabis use. This has occurred despite an apparent decline in consumption among young people in recent years. The explanation is that the THC content of the drug, the element that produces the so-called high, is far stronger than it once was. Most cannabis sold on the streets is super-strength “skunk”, which is highly potent and places users at risk of a range of mental disorders that include schizophrenia, psychosis and depression.
FEB15	Letters: It's nonsense to become a man then seek treatment to give birth	SIR – You report (February 14) that someone born a woman was able to receive fertility treatment in order to have a baby only 10 days after legally completing transition to being a man.  Accepting that this person was born a woman, went through a transition process and was recognised by the Gender Recognition Panel as legally a man, what sort of consultation would there have been at the fertility clinic? Did the person, called TT in court, present themselves as a female or as a male when requesting a procedure which could only apply to a female? I have a great deal of compassion for this person; however, the situation they find themselves in is of their own making, whether advised or otherwise by medical professionals.

FEB16	This Week is bizarre, cringe-worthy political TV at its best and I'll miss it	It’s 9am, and I am lying in a white marble bathtub, in an upmarket London hotel, wearing a second-hand wetsuit that belongs to a woman I have never met. It’s a bit short in the body. In my hand is a life-size plastic mallard, my eyes are covered with slices of cucumber, and on my chin is a false beard that I have fashioned from bubbles in order to look like Jeremy Corbyn. Two cameras are pointed directly at me, filming my every move. Welcome to BBC This Week, television’s most idiosyncratic political programme, whose 16-year run will come to an end in July, after its 69-year-old presenter Andrew Neil announced on Thursday that he is to step down at the end of the current series. “We couldn’t imagine This Week without the inimitable Andrew Neil, one of Britain’s best political interviewers,” said Fran Unsworth, the BBC’s Director of News.
FEB16	Let's hope Gavin Williamson’s attempt at a show of "lethal" strength doesn’t backfire	There is an unrecognised twist to the tale of why Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, wants to send our 65,000-ton aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, with two squadrons of F-35 fighters, halfway across the world to the South China Sea. Mr Williamson’s explanation for what he calls this show of “lethal” strength is that he wishes to demonstrate how, post-Brexit, Britain will once again be able to exercise “hard power”, as a global force to reckoned with. The largest ship ever built for the Royal Navy would be heading for the Spratly Islands, currently claimed, occupied and heavily militarised by China, because of the vast reserves of oil and gas beneath their surrounding sea. China’s claim to ownership is strongly opposed by the US, but such disputes are far from new. In 1988, there was a threat of war over the Spratlys between China and Vietnam, after “exchanges of fire” over their respective claims to the “islets, reefs and shoals” making them up. But it then emerged that similar claims were also being made by Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Even further back, my friend Laurens van der Post recalled how, in the late Thirties, when he was working in London as a journalist, he and a French colleague had one Friday afternoon been urgently summoned to the Foreign Office for a press briefing by Lord Halifax, the foreign secretary. He told them that Japan had just seized the Spratly Islands, which were then claimed by France as part of its Vietnamese colony in Indo-China. The French and British governments had drafted a stern note to Tokyo, protesting in the strongest terms at this “outrageous act of aggression”.
FEB16	Three good reasons the voting age should be raised to 21 - not cut to 16	The prize for the most vacuous, the most cynical campaign in British politics today must surely go to those demanding that 16 year-olds be given the vote. No good reason is ever offered for doing so. Yes you can join the Army or get married at 16, but only with parental permission. Elsewhere the trend is going in the other direction. I’m old enough to remember when the minimum age you could buy cigarettes was 16. You can’t even leave full-time education now until 18. Nevertheless, an unholy alliance of Remainers and the Left love the idea because they erroneously think it would give them a permanent electoral advantage. They look at the self-important children who played truant on Friday to shout anti-Tory slogans in London and are filled with hope, not despair. So they have given up trying to persuade actual voters and have elected to invent new ones. In the establishment’s weird logic, at 16 you are not old enough to be judged responsible for becoming a jihadi bride in Syria, but quite capable of choosing who governs us. Sorry, this won’t do. If we were discussing this issue with any semblance of rationality, we would be debating raising the voting age, not cutting it. There are three arguments for doing so.
FEB16	We're heading for the great Brexit trap -  so why not stay in and wreck the EU instead?	The Brexiteers have been outplayed. The government has now effectively ensured that the only choice on 29 March will be between Brexit in Name Only and no Brexit at all. It has even managed to make the European Research Group – the only party in this farrago which has at least been consistent in its policy and coherent in its aims (whether or not you agree with them) – appear irresponsible precisely because they have insisted on being consistent and coherent (whether or not you agree…etc). The ERG has always said that it would be a catastrophic negotiating mistake to rule out the possibility of “no deal”. In last week’s Meaningless Vote, they refused to support a motion that would have ruled out “no deal”. Why should this be a surprise? Maybe because nobody is expected to stick to first principles or to mean what they say anymore. Where exactly are we? Certainly not where Theresa May’s enforcers say we are. But you know that by now. We are never where the government says we are. Occasionally, a smug member of the negotiating team is overheard in a bar telling the real truth about our actual location and where we are going from here, but that is just an embarrassing lapse.
FEB16	Victoria Bateman's nudity strips her arguments of force	I met Victoria Bateman a few years ago at a serious event. It was an academic symposium on China and the Silk Road that, to be honest, was a bit arcane for me. Dr Bateman, an economic historian at Cambridge, was probably the only other women under 40 in the room. She is now and forever infamous as the “naked Remainer”, after stripping off her clothes on the Today programme to criticise Brexit and invite Jacob Rees-Mogg to “a naked debate”. Cue the inevitable media feeding frenzy as she toured bemused news studios. When I met her in 2016, I did think Dr Bateman rather eccentric, with her Heidi plait and striking clothes. Google brought up some news about a naked portrait she had done of herself. Unusual, I thought, but what actually prompted me to follow her online was the interesting mix of viewpoints she expressed.
FEB16	30 years on from the Rusdie fatwa, freedom of speech remains under threat	Thirty years ago this week, Ayatollah Khomeini put a fatwa on the head of Salman Rushdie. The Iranian cleric ordered that the author of The Satanic Verses, and all those involved in its publication, were “sentenced to death”. At least 22 people were killed; Rushdie went into hiding. Britain suddenly had to confront some unsettling truths. Muslim protesters who burned Mr Rushdie’s book had clearly not integrated into Britain’s tradition of free speech and religious inquiry; multiculturalism had accentuated difference and segregated communities. What is remarkable is how many Establishment figures of the time expressed their displeasure at Mr Rushdie, even if they strongly disagreed with the death sentence. Roald Dahl suggested he’d been deliberately insulting in order to send an “indifferent book on to the top of the bestseller list”. John Le Carré argued that nobody has a right “to be impertinent to great religions with impunity”. There was an unavoidable tension between defending conservative Muslims from what they regarded as profound insult to their faith and the freedom of Mr Rushdie to speak his mind. Britain, however, made the right choice: the Conservative government offered protection to one of its most strident literary critics. The UK stood decisively on the side of artistic liberty and should be proud of that.

FEB16	Letters: Britain can have better transport without wasting more money on HS2	SIR – There is now so much doubt about the merits of HS2 that the project should be abandoned immediately before any more money is wasted. The savings could be used to improve current transport, while investment in the North could be encouraged through tax breaks. John Roberts Oxshott, Surrey
FEB16	Letters: The Isil bride who now says that she wants to come home to Britain	SIR – Shamima Begum seeks “to come home” to Britain, after four years of living in an environment of virulent anti-Western and poisonous Islamist ideology. As she has made a choice, however ill-advised, of her own free will, and shows no sense of remorse – “not fazed” at seeing the severed head (of an opponent) in a bin – there is no good reason to rescue her from her chosen fate. Having rejected our values, why should she be assisted in returning, no doubt to become a permanent drain on the public purse? John W Smith Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire
FEB17	What could be more British than saving Saba the cheetah from the ravages of man?	As the cheetah leant forwards with his rabbit-scented breath and his yellow eyes suddenly trained on me like fiery golden marbles, I wondered, as I prepared my response, exactly how much familiarity he would expect. The cheetah purred. At least he made a low rhythmical rumbling noise in his rib-cage, and I hoped it was meant to be friendly. We were in the cheetah enclosure in Howletts wildlife park in Kent, and I knew that I was being somehow tested. Of course it was unlikely that I would sustain life-changing injuries in the next few minutes. I was reclining stiffly on a bed of straw not just with the cheetah but with members of the Aspinall family.
FEB17	The 'securocrats' have taken over the Government, and they have questions to answer	After the untimely death of Sir Jeremy Heywood last year, Sir Mark Sedwill became Cabinet Secretary, the most senior position in the Civil Service. At the time, he was National Security Adviser. It was announced he would combine the old role with the new until the right replacement was found. Last week, we were told by Sir Mark himself that he will be permanently “double-hatted”, holding both jobs. This must be bad news for Olly Robbins, the official who has been working flat-out for Theresa May to prevent a full Brexit. Mr Robbins had been tipped for the National Security post; but last week, he was overheard revealing in a Brussels bar Mrs May’s tactic of trapping us into not actually leaving the EU for the foreseeable future unless we knuckle under and accept her deal. This indiscretion may have done for him. The reason for Sir Mark’s amalgamation of roles, he says, is “to make a success of Brexit”. “It’s critically important that we bring together – Fusion, as we call it in the national security community – all our national capabilities, including economic, security, social and the rest.”
FEB17	Gavin Williamson's critics miss the point. There is a strong case for resisting Chinese aggression	China’s decision to cancel a trade summit with the UK over remarks made in a speech by Gavin Williamson seems like bad news for Britain - it is estimated that the expected deals could have been worth £10bn over five years. Former Chancellor George Osborne accuses the Defence Secretary of “gunboat diplomacy of a quite old fashioned kind”. The insinuation of these comments is clear: Williamson has hurt the economy by angering China. Yet beneath the outrage, China’s reaction suggests that the UK is finally beginning to develop a coherent response to Chinese aggression. China’s current diplomatic aim is to persuade foreign governments that access to its market is based on largesse and nobility, rather than the rules and regulations of the World Trade Organisation - heaven forbid we expect China to play by the rules. Not only is this type of discriminatory access illegal, it is also unlikely to be effective.
FEB17	It is ridiculous to say no one ever voted to be poorer	"No one voted to be poorer”. It has become a Europhile mantra, a slogan rattled off almost unthinkingly by Remainer MPs, especially Labour moderates. If we’re talking specifically about Brexit, it may or may not be true. Personally speaking, I expect Brexit to make me poorer (I am an MEP) but, over time, to make Britain richer. How much richer depends, obviously, on the choices we make as a country.  As a general proposition, though, the idea that no one ever votes to be poorer is utter tosh. We vote to be poorer all the time, knowingly or unknowingly. We vote to be poorer whenever we vote for stricter rules on where houses can be built. We vote to be poorer when we turn away able-bodied economic migrants.  We vote to be poorer when we back schemes to preserve the habitats of rare species. We vote to be poorer when we subsidise orchestras or art galleries. We vote to be poorer when we privilege particular industries with tariffs or grants.
FEB17	Britain needs a new treason law to tackle returning jihadis	The return of Britons who went abroad to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) – which may soon include Shamima Begum – is an alarming prospect. But our nation respects the rule of law and our citizens cannot lawfully be denied entry, at least not permanently. Exile is not an option; nor is killing those who otherwise could be captured, or leaving it to the Americans to lock them away. Instead, our authorities should charge and convict them before a jury of their peers. In most cases, this should lead to a life behind bars.
FEB17	When will the Conservatives start listening to their own voters?	Britain has been politically adrift since the Brexit referendum. Those who govern us are still reeling from the shock, and haven’t worked out how to process the result or even the dawning, almost unthinkable, realisation that their views are at odds with public opinion on a swathe of issues. This lack of clarity and direction has been all too starkly visible, once again, with the problem of jihadis and their brides seeking to return from Syria. A competent, coherent Conservative government with its finger on the pulse would have known exactly what to do, and what to say. In overwhelming numbers, voters want to be very tough on them; they believe that the behaviour of such people has been unforgiveable and they are disgusted by the possibility of them returning with impunity, let alone to the reward of a council house. Yet what is the Government’s position? What has been happening until now? Why are some ministers saying that Shamima Begum, a jihadi bride, will be blocked from returning while others say that is impossible? Why can’t the Government do anything? Why is it content with appearing so powerless? The UK’s laws defining treason are hopelessly out of date; we’ve only successfully prosecuted about 10 per cent of our returnees. In some cases, we’ve actually offloaded our trouble-makers on to the US. Americans now believe that the British Government’s confusion amounts to leaving potential murderers at large in the hope that they won’t come back. That’s a dereliction of duty, and one which the public will never forgive. This is our Government: it has power. It needs to change the law. It cannot hide behind excuses. This lack of leadership is found elsewhere. On Brexit: the Government is utterly rudderless, with ministers contradicting one another and Downing Street seemingly intent on running down the clock. There is no sense of direction, no vision, no principles, just blind panic and incompetence.

FEB17	Letters: Shamima Begum must have grasped the consequences of her actions	SIR – There is much talk about Shamima Begum, the 19-year-old who left her east London home in 2015 to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil), being “young and naive” at that time. If, instead of running off to Syria, she had gone to her doctor about a personal matter, she would almost certainly have been considered “Gillick competent” – that is to say, capable of understanding and making a judgment upon the advice given, despite being below the age of majority. Such an assessment of maturity is equally pertinent to her decision to leave the country and join its avowed enemies. Dr K Nesbitt Ramsey, Isle of Man
FEB17	Letters: Britain can have better transport without wasting more money on HS2	SIR – There is now so much doubt about the merits of HS2 that the project should be abandoned immediately before any more money is wasted.

FEB18	I should choose when my child learns about sex	“Education, not indoctrination.” It’s a sentiment an increasing number of British parents have expressed to one another in private – and one I’ve written about in the past. But until last week I’d never seen those words daubed across protest placards or heard them being chanted on the streets.  So when I saw footage of the scenes that took place outside Parkfield Community School in Birmingham last Thursday, for a brief moment, I felt hopeful. Whatever virtue-signaling nonsense the education authorities had decided to fill our children’s heads with now – that boys can menstruate, girls ejaculate and children of either sex are entitled to choose their gender – people were no longer going to stand for it. Then I read on and realised that the 300-odd parents gathered outside the primary school were predominantly Muslim – and there to protest against “lessons on homosexuality and gender”. And while the idea of teaching gender is as bemusing to me as teaching age or hair colour (sorry, but gender is neither a concept nor a construct), I hope every fair-minded person would agree with Parkfield’s embattled assistant head, Andrew Moffat – who devised ‘No Outsiders’ lessons “to teach children about the Equality Act and British Values” – and accept that at the appropriate age children need to be made to understand the importance of being tolerant of differences in sexuality. 
FEB18	Jane Austen knew that real happiness lies in domestic bliss	In the midst of the Brexit maelstrom, the collapse of the Labour party and political meltdown on Left and Right, thank goodness for Jane Austen, who, once again has reminded us where true contentment lies: to whit, a well-stocked linen cupboard and a home where everything has its place. I can’t be the only one who sighed with pleasure on reading the recently discovered remnants of one of Jane’s letters to her sister Cassandra, written in 1813, detailing her advice to her brother Henry’s French housekeeper. “I have given Mde. B my Inventory of the linen”, she writes, “and added 2 round towels to it”. Tantalisingly, Austen adds that Madame Bigeon has “shewn me all her storeplaces”, but alas, does not go into detail as to what they may contain. Oh for a copy of Jane Austen’s linen inventory. Because is there anything more pleasing in life than a bounteous supply of perfectly laundered towels? A cupboard-full of serried ranks of neatly ironed sheets? A home stuffed with “storeplaces” for all of life’s essentials?
FEB18	If children really want to understand climate change, they're better off in the classroom	It turns out that last week’s school strike in protest at climate change was not a one off. Buoyed in part by the wave of support from their teachers and parents, as well as the discovery that hanging out and having your picture taken is more fun than physics, a further protest has now been planned for March 15. When protesting is not only condoned but celebrated by world-weary, Brexit-jaded adults desperate for some youthful enthusiasm to sustain them, striking will no doubt become as frequent as posting on social media. Cue plenty more photo-ops for bright-eyed teenagers with witty placards basking, appropriately enough, in the sunshine. As a teenager, I marched, chanted and joined every Left-wing group going. But as a parent, I refused to help with the face-painting and placard-making. The whole point of teenage rebellion should be to outrage adults in authority. A teacher-supervised protest is a school trip; a strike signed off by parents is a day out.
FEB18	The view of Labour painted by my now ex-colleagues is a bleak one, but I can't bring myself to leave	So the Labour Party is cracking. It’s not yet enough to call it a split but the glaze on our industrially-built Stoke pottery jug has had spidery lines etched through it for some time, and now a dirty great fissure has opened up in the spout and the handle is about to give way. At this point, a master craftsman could still repair it. The alternative is to give up the ghost and smash it into tiny pieces.  I felt nothing but sadness as I listened to my friends stand up and, with remarkable and quite moving candour, explain why they were leaving the Labour Party. Since I entered Westminster I have tried always to be honest, but politics has a knack of making you second guess your words. The MPs who left seemed to have no such difficulty in speaking honestly, sincerely and from the heart. It was hard to disagree with most of what they said. All political parties have become violently hostile to even the mildest criticism from within the ranks, while at the same time the public are desperate for nuance and pragmatism.
FEB18	Mark Zuckerberg is in serious trouble - and not just with lawmakers	Facebook wants you to know that it is changing. Its ads tell you so. Its high-profile PR hires tell you so. The mea-culpas of its Instagram executives following Molly Russell’s death tell you so. So too does its claimed willingness to submit to “meaningful regulation” after the damning House of Commons’ report about the spread of fake news. Perhaps most significantly, as my colleague Laurence Dodds has reported from Silicon Valley, its move towards creating a supreme court tells you so too. This “Oversight Board”, some 40 strong, independent, and able to deliver landmark decisions on what kind of content is or isn’t acceptable on the social media network, sounds like a game changer. Certainly, it is an admission of what we all instinctively knew: that like it or not, Facebook is as much “publisher” as “platform”, and must take some responsibility for the content it disseminates. The truth of this has been made apparent in the most devastating way: not by legal fiat, but by public opprobrium. Appalling content – whether terrorist rant or Russian-funded nonsense – has come to represent a potentially existential, reputational threat to the company. No wonder it wants to be seen to be bustling about.  
FEB18	Ministers must act now on social media	The internet is a liberating force, but also a potentially malign one. MPs and ministers have been all too happy to expound upon the undoubted benefits brought by the growth of the digital economy. Yet they have struggled to come up with measures that would address the damage that it can cause – from social media addiction and the abuse of online platforms by child groomers and terrorists, to the links between internet use and poor mental health among children. There are promising signs that action may be imminent, however. Today, a new report from the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee calls for technology companies to be required to adhere to a Code of Ethics overseen by an independent regulator. The code would set down in writing what is and is not acceptable on social media, and the regulator, crucially, would have teeth: the power to launch legal action against firms that breach the code. This is a welcome proposal, similar to the statutory duty of care that the Telegraph has been campaigning for. Much of the trouble that children and their parents have experienced online in recent years has been a consequence of a failure by the technology companies to take responsibility for the damage that their products and services can cause. They have continued to host harmful and sometimes illegal material, for example, and it is still too easy for young children to access their sites despite age limits.
FEB18	Shamima Begum should expect no sympathy from Britain	Shamima Begum, the jihadi bride, said yesterday that a “lot of people should have sympathy towards me for everything I’ve been through”. Why? Does she have sympathy for the victims of the atrocities perpetrated by the Islamic State of the Levant and Syria (Isil) – the Yazidis slaughtered in their thousands, the gay people thrown from tall buildings, the Westerners murdered on camera, and the countless others who were killed by the so-called caliphate she swore loyalty to? Ms Begum will certainly have known about some of these unspeakable crimes before she decided to leave for Syria. But she has admitted that she has no regrets about her time with Isil, saying the experience had made her “stronger, tougher”. This is the problem with those preaching compassion towards Ms Begum and her kind. Many will be sympathetic towards her son, who was born yesterday in a refugee camp. But it is hard to see why Britain should lift a finger for Ms Begum, who has demonstrated not an ounce of contrition for her crimes and who has by all accounts been left hardened by living willingly among extremists and murderers. She has herself recounted her lack of shock at seeing a severed head in a bin.
FEB18	When will the Conservatives start listening to their own voters?	Britain has been politically adrift since the Brexit referendum. Those who govern us are still reeling from the shock, and haven’t worked out how to process the result or even the dawning, almost unthinkable, realisation that their views are at odds with public opinion on a swathe of issues. This lack of clarity and direction has been all too starkly visible, once again, with the problem of jihadis and their brides seeking to return from Syria. A competent, coherent Conservative government with its finger on the pulse would have known exactly what to do, and what to say. In overwhelming numbers, voters want to be very tough on them; they believe that the behaviour of such people has been unforgiveable and they are disgusted by the possibility of them returning with impunity, let alone to the reward of a council house. Yet what is the Government’s position? What has been happening until now? Why are some ministers saying that Shamima Begum, a jihadi bride, will be blocked from returning while others say that is impossible? Why can’t the Government do anything? Why is it content with appearing so powerless? The UK’s laws defining treason are hopelessly out of date; we’ve only successfully prosecuted about 10 per cent of our returnees. In some cases, we’ve actually offloaded our trouble-makers on to the US. Americans now believe that the British Government’s confusion amounts to leaving potential murderers at large in the hope that they won’t come back. That’s a dereliction of duty, and one which the public will never forgive. This is our Government: it has power. It needs to change the law. It cannot hide behind excuses. This lack of leadership is found elsewhere. On Brexit: the Government is utterly rudderless, with ministers contradicting one another and Downing Street seemingly intent on running down the clock. There is no sense of direction, no vision, no principles, just blind panic and incompetence.
FEB18	Letters: Shamima Begum must have grasped the consequences of her actions	SIR – There is much talk about Shamima Begum, the 19-year-old who left her east London home in 2015 to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil), being “young and naive” at that time. If, instead of running off to Syria, she had gone to her doctor about a personal matter, she would almost certainly have been considered “Gillick competent” – that is to say, capable of understanding and making a judgment upon the advice given, despite being below the age of majority. Such an assessment of maturity is equally pertinent to her decision to leave the country and join its avowed enemies. Dr K Nesbitt Ramsey, Isle of Man
FEB18	Letters: Britain can have better transport without wasting more money on HS2	SIR – There is now so much doubt about the merits of HS2 that the project should be abandoned immediately before any more money is wasted. The savings could be used to improve current transport, while investment in the North could be encouraged through tax breaks. John Roberts Oxshott, Surrey
FEB19	The real surprise of the Labour defections is that only eight MPs have walked away	Some of the harshest criticism of the eight Labour MPs who’ve deserted their party has come from party stalwarts who’ve insisted that their departure is likely to undermine Jeremy Corbyn’s chances of winning a general election and, thus, make a Tory victory inevitable. But, in truth, this is just an excuse from moderates because the surprise with these defections is not that eight MPs have walked away from Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership this week, but that many more didn’t do it ages ago. To deal, first of all, with their claim; it’s a fact that at the 1983 general election the then SDP/Liberal Alliance – most of which was made up of Labour defectors - notched up 25.4 per cent of the popular vote , compared to 27.6 per cent gained by Labour and the 42.4 per cent gained by the Tories.
FEB19	I helped expel Derek Hatton from the Labour Party - why on earth are they letting him back in?	If I had set out before this week to ask members of the public – or indeed, many Daily Telegraph readers – whether they’d heard of Derek Hatton, I suspect that most would have looked at me blankly. So why is the re-entry of this individual to membership of the Labour Party of any interest or significance to the wider world? In the week when seven members of the Parliamentary Labour Party announced they were leaving to set up an Independent Group, and when it is expected that more will follow suit, the decision taken by the general secretary and national executive of Labour to allow Derek Hatton back into the party carries enormous symbolism. Clearly it has wide implications for the future of a party to which I have given my life and have been a member of for the last 55 years. But it should also be an issue of concern for everyone, way beyond those with sympathy for or the propensity to vote Labour. At stake is the very future of the official opposition in this country at a time of unprecedented political confusion and uncertainty. This matters deeply to the functioning of our democracy.
FEB19	Sunny Nature has a spring in  its step – but it’s out of kilter	I’ve an inbuilt awareness of mid-February temperatures. My birthday falls on the 15th: about the worst day of the calendar for dispiriting weather. But not in 2019. This year on my birthday I was striding through a Lincolnshire garden planted with snowdrops, crocuses and cyclamen, the sun sparkling on what might have been jewels strewn among the grass. Crocuses, like aconites, won’t open unless the temperature rises above eight degrees. No fear of that this year; the bulbs formed a carpet of mauve, white, magenta and yellow. The scent of honeysuckle charmed my nose. A skylark sang overhead. What a day to be alive. It’s even warmer this week, and we’re loving it. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to abandon ourselves entirely to the joys of early spring. As a shopkeeper said to me, after we’d exchanged the usual platitudes about the day: “Beautiful, but I dread to think of the trouble being stored up for our grandchildren.” Admittedly this was in Ramsgate, which has a Mrs Gummidge-like disposition to find things “going contrary”. But many of us suffer the same doubts. The Woodland Trust (for which I am an ambassador) tracks the first sightings of species through its Nature’s Calendar project, and thinks that spring actually started in November. Something must be awry.
FEB19	On everything from healthcare to winter fuel, the government is leaving expats out in the cold	Bob Dylan once sang that he pitied the poor immigrant. Perhaps now is the time for a bit of sympathy for the unfortunate expat. Slowly but surely, life is becoming that bit harder for those who decide to leave the country of their birth. Take healthcare, for example. In December 2013, the Government said it was looking to make life a little easier for UK expats - recognising that in the majority of cases they will have paid into the system for decades.
FEB19	It speaks volumes that Labour gained Derek Hatton just as it lost Luciana Berger	Reports as to when exactly Derek Hatton rejoined the Labour Party differ. One thing is clear, however: the Militant-supporting former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council is back in the fold. This is good news.  There is no question that his expulsion 33 years ago was justified. During the 1980s, Hatton led a gang of Trotskyite thugs which dominated Liverpool’s council. In an attempt to resist local government spending cuts, Mr Hatton and his colleagues hired taxis to deliver redundancy notices to more than 30,000 workers in the city. This was a massive PR stunt which sought to weaponise the livelihoods of its own employees and their families for political gain, a putrid example of municipal virtue-signalling. Along with a number of his council colleagues, Hatton was also found to have been a member of Militant, a revolutionary communist party proscribed by Michael Foot in 1982. From that moment on, membership of Militant became incompatible with membership of the Labour Party. Yet still the organisation and its adherents were tolerated – by other, more mainstream, Labour councillors, by activists and – crucially – by some Labour MPs. 
FEB19	The Labour splitters want to 'fix politics' but they won't do that by betraying Brexit	The denunciations of the hard-Left takeover of Labour by the seven MPs who quit the party yesterday were no less devastating for being so familiar. Luciana Berger said she could not remain a member of a party that she had “come to the sickening conclusion is institutionally anti-Semitic”. Labour “has now been hijacked by the machine politics of the hard-Left,” said former minister Chris Leslie. Angela Smith spoke movingly of the culture of working-class self-respect and self-improvement she grew up in, and then attacked the “Left-wing intellectuals who think being poor and working-class constitutes a state of grace.” Why, you might ask, has it taken them so long to act on conclusions that they – like the rest of us – must have reached some time ago? We have long known that a significant number of Labour MPs are unhappy with the direction Jeremy Corbyn is taking the party. After the EU referendum in 2016, 172 of them supported a vote of no confidence in him as leader, but he was kept in place by ultra-loyalists in the membership. After the 2017 general election, however, when Theresa May’s disastrous campaign permitted Mr Corbyn to substantially increase Labour’s vote share, all fight appeared to leave the so-called moderates.
FEB19	Ministers must act now on social media	The internet is a liberating force, but also a potentially malign one. MPs and ministers have been all too happy to expound upon the undoubted benefits brought by the growth of the digital economy.

FEB19	Letters: The split in the Labour Party is quite unlike the Conservative divide	SIR – Many have been quick to conflate the problems in the Labour Party that led to this split with those in the Conservative Party. The symmetry of the hard Right versus hard Left battle, the ugly new politics, makes a good story. However, that analysis is lazy.  Yes, there certainly is a serious split within the Tories, but it is overwhelmingly over the European Union. Other than the problems created by one person (that Marmite of politics, Boris Johnson), I do not believe you will find more than the usual range of political views within Tory ranks.  In contrast, the Labour Party has been taken over by the entryists of the hard Left, facilitated by (the bafflingly unapologetic) Ed Miliband’s constitutional changes. 
FEB20	Depriving dangerous people of British citizenship is legitimate and often effective - but in the case of Shamima Begum, it is an error	Shamima Begum is a traitor. When she left Britain, in 2015, she rejected our country and our values. She knew all about Isil. And in travelling to Syria, she knew she was breaking the law. She shows no remorse. She had a “good time” living under the Caliphate. She was “okay” with its beheadings. She believes the Manchester Arena bombing was justified. It would be easy to dismiss her as young and stupid. But with Islamist extremism and terrorism, the ideology is almost as dangerous as the bullets and bombs. Abu Hamza looked ridiculous with his hook hand, and Abu Qatada was a fat old man, but both were hate preachers and terrorist plotters. Anjem Choudary had his lawyerly language, but he was behind the radicalisation of hundreds of British Muslims.
FEB20	Will any political party be able to survive the second act of Brexit?	So that’s that, then. I disagree utterly, profoundly, completely with the Tory defectors’ stance on Brexit but I respect their decision to leave their party – on one narrow level, at least. During periods of great ideological dislocation, a functioning, healthy democracy requires every MP, every activist and every voter to study their conscience, to decide which side they are really on. Yes, Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston stood on a Conservative Party manifesto that was committed to Brexit; and yes, they voted for Article 50. But at a time when hypocrisy is eating away at our putrefying body politic, better for them to leave now than to keep pretending they belong to a party they no longer feel any connection to. Too many MPs live a political lie, striving for power and advancement for the sake of it. They end up as second-rate actors mouthing lines they don’t agree with, voting for policies they detest, rather than as the thrusting social entrepreneurs fighting to create a better world they thought they would be when they entered politics. We can all think of many, including some in the Cabinet, who fall into that category and shouldn’t be able to look at themselves in the mirror.
FEB20	I'm Sarah Wollaston's constituent, and she should put her defection to us voters	When I heard that my MP Sarah Wollaston had crossed the floor to join The Independent Group (TIG), I was unsurprised. As a constituent and member of her local Conservative Association in Totnes, it has been obvious for some time that Dr Wollaston, who shares few of our party’s core beliefs, is doing considerable damage to Britain’s negotiating position with the EU and even democracy itself. Many local members will cheer her departure. Dr Wollaston hypocritically took up the mantle of a safe seat. She was elected on a Conservative manifesto which promised to uphold the result of the referendum, then proceeded to break these promises.
FEB20	Why I'm not surprised that the gender pay gap is getting worse	First, the good news: the median pay gap in Britain has narrowed slightly - it is now ‘only’ 8.4 per cent, down from 9.7 per cent last year. Then the bad: in four out of 10 private companies, it is actually getting worse. Almost three-quarters of companies still pay men more than women.  Disappointing? Yes. Surprising? No. These figures have emerged this week, after the BBC took a look at the first 10 per cent of firms - just over 1,000 companies - who have reported their gender pay gap for the second time, after it became a legal requirement for all organisations with over 250 employees to do so in April 2018.   Despite the compelling business case for diversity - McKinsey has estimated it would add 150 billion a year to UK GDP- -  the reality is that fixing the gender pay gap takes hard work, time and a multi-pronged approach. There are no ‘silver bullets’ or quick fixes.
FEB20	I'm a liberal Tory and a member of the ERG. How dare the splitters call me an extremist	When I entered the House of Commons, I voted for equality so that men could have sex with men at the same age as men could legally have sex with women: 16.  I lost that vote back in the early 90s, but the age was dropped to 18 from 21.  Eventually, equality was reached.  I have consistently voted liberally on gay issues including gay marriage, on the age of abortion and alongside the Labour MP, Paul Flynn who recently passed away, on drug use.  I describe myself on social media as “socially liberal”. I am.  No-one can accuse me of being a rabid right winger. So I was appalled, angry and offended when the three Conservative defectors to The Independent Group tried to excuse their actions as being caused by a lurch to the right in the Conservative Party and suggesting it is dominated by the “right wing” European Research Group.
FEB20	Why won't the Government defend Brexit?	Ian Howells, the senior vice-president for Honda in Europe, stated more than once yesterday that the decision to close a plant in Swindon had nothing to do with Brexit. So why do Remainers say that it does? Lord Adonis: “The Japanese are now systematically withdrawing their 30 years of manufacturing investment in the UK, because of Brexit.” David Lammy MP: “Do not let Brexiteers pretend for one second that this series of closures is a coincidence.” Phillip Lee MP: “Every job lost is on the heads of [the Leavers] who misled people so badly.” And, to cap it all, even the Government appeared to join in. The Business Secretary, Greg Clark, cited uncertainty in the automobile sector, saying: “Decisions like Honda’s this morning show starkly how much is at stake.” Linking Swindon to Brexit is a disingenuous strategy by Remainers – using the tragedy of 3,500 job losses to score political points – but if they are allowed to get away with it, blame a government that is using the spectre of no-deal chaos to pressure MPs into backing its hugely flawed Withdrawal Agreement. The ministers charged with delivering Brexit thus find themselves in a perverse alliance with those implacably opposed to it. Project Fear Mark 2 is talking down the economy, spooking investors and drawing the wrong conclusions from events.

FEB20	Letters: The widening gulf between party members and MPs on Left and Right	SIR – Our political parties are split. In the Conservatives many MPs have moved away from their members, while in Labour it is the membership that has moved away from its MPs. Michael Staples Seaford, East Sussex  
FEB20	Letters: The split in the Labour Party is quite unlike the Conservative divide	SIR – Many have been quick to conflate the problems in the Labour Party that led to this split with those in the Conservative Party.

FEB21	No future in the Cabinet for David Mundell unless Theresa May rules out 'no deal' Brexit	He didn’t exactly confirm it but he sure as hell didn’t deny it either. The message from David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland, yesterday was pretty clear. He wants a Brexit "No Deal" taken off the table by Theresa May or he’ll join at least three colleagues and vote for a motion in the Commons next week that will make it impossible for him to continue in her Cabinet. He may well have denied that he wants anything to do with what he calls the "soap-opera psycho-drama" of MPs leaving the Conservative Party, such as the three who’ve already defected to join their eight ex-Labour Independent Group colleagues, but he left few in any doubt that he’s perfectly prepared to walk out of the government over what he calls the "disaster" of a No Deal exit from the EU. However, whilst it may well be the accepted opinion that the resignations are doing more harm to Labour than the Tories, Mundell’s resignation from the Cabinet would be a calamity for the Scottish Tories.
FEB21	Centrism is dead - and resuscitating the corpse won't fix our broken system	TIG's reheated ideology has failed us since the Blair years In the referendum of two and half years ago, Swindon, a town of nearly 200,000, voted by 55 to 45 per cent – somewhat above the national average – to leave the European Union. That vote seemed to get its comeuppance this week with news that one of the town’s biggest sources of employment, the Honda car factory, will soon be closing with the loss of 3,500 jobs. The company denies that Brexit has anything to do with it. Yet as one of its soon to be made redundant employees told the Financial Times, even accepting it was not the deciding factor, “you’d be an idiot to think Brexit hasn’t contributed”.
FEB21	However hard you try, you'll struggle to rebrand our dreary town centres	We must make our high streets beautiful again In this week’s plodding exercise in stating the bleedin’ obvious, a report from the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee has addressed the need for towns to up their game or die. With one in every five pounds spent in Britain now spent online, many town centres are at crisis point. We are all of us aware of the plight of our high streets – dreary, identikit stretches of the same brands, plate-glass-and-plastic storefronts, often shuttered at night with metal grilles, making many town centres feel like very hostile places indeed. Then there is the scourge of empty shops, and the possibility of a dozen different kinds of coffee but nowhere to buy anything genuinely useful, such as a reel of thread, a packet of laces or, increasingly, fresh fruit and veg.
FEB21	Telling pregnant women to stop 'eating for two' is not body-shaming... I only wish I'd known	Legend has it that, in Ancient Rome, a slave was tasked with standing behind Julius Caesar and softly whispering into the emperor’s ear: “Remember Caesar, though art mortal…” Speaking truth to power was never easy, not least because if Julius had just stubbed his toe and wasn’t feeling particularly receptive, the slave would be swiftly dispatched and replaced. My, how times have changed. These days, speaking to those who govern us is as easy as a few keystrokes on Twitter and an updated Facebook status.
FEB21	By branding Martina Navratilova a bigot, the trans lobby shows how intolerant and extreme it has become	Martina Navratilova is one of the last people you’d expect to be accused of intolerance. Arguably still the world’s most famous lesbian, the tennis player neither concealed nor apologised for her sexuality at a time when many gay people were afraid to come out to family, never mind a global sporting audience. She also gave a coaching job to Renée Richards, a player on the women’s circuit who was born Richard Raskind. This week, Navratilova was sacked by Athlete Ally, a US campaign for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in sport. The group has accused her of “transphobia” for questioning whether a transgender woman, born and raised male and retaining a full male body, should be allowed to compete in women’s sport simply because they have taken drugs to reduce their testosterone levels. That meets the criteria of many sporting authorities, but troubles a lot of people, including Navratilova. They note that underlying male biology means transgender women build up muscle mass, height and reach, giving them advantages that cannot be erased by changing their hormones.
FEB21	When Corbyn talks about Shamima Begum, he sounds like an Islington social worker	Yesterday offered a study in culture war contrasts. Sajid Javid is doing the best he can to keep Shamima Begum out of the country.  Jeremy Corbyn says the former jihadi bride has a right to return to the UK and should receive “some support”. Mr Javid is putting the public’s safety first; Mr Corbyn sounds like an Islington social worker. Can the Labour leader not grasp that the public is furious about Ms Begum’s actions and lack of remorse? Or that citizenship, though a right, is also a sacred contract that might be broken by treason or giving comfort to enemies?
FEB21	Whatever the splitters say, the Independent Group is about Brexit and very little else	The departure of Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston from the Conservative Party feels like the beginning of something significant. The first eight Labour resignations were internecine; being joined by three Tories shows that the new Independent Group can reach across the House. Many voters tell pollsters they are looking for a moderate alternative, and the cultural elite of this country is going to love the mirage of revived centrism. But it is a mirage. This is a grouping of Remainers who are every bit as ideological as Jeremy Corbyn or Nigel Farage. Issue must be taken with their characterisation of the Conservative Party, which they say has been captured by a radical Right-wing group. To whom are they referring? Theresa May? Philip Hammond? Amber Rudd? What government policy is particularly Right-wing? The billions more earmarked for the NHS? Prison reform? Lavish foreign aid?
FEB21	Why won't the Government defend Brexit?	Ian Howells, the senior vice-president for Honda in Europe, stated more than once yesterday that the decision to close a plant in Swindon had nothing to do with Brexit.

FEB21	Letters: The Conservative defectors are out of touch with the reality of their place in politics	SIR – Anna Soubry, on leaving the parliamentary Conservative Party, made two questionable statements: that all Tory leaders in the last 40 years were driven out by a pro-Brexit group, and that that group had seized control of the party “from top to toe”. First, it can hardly be said that William Hague or Michael Howard were driven out thus. John Major left because he lost the 1997 election, and David Cameron chose to leave after the 2016 referendum. Secondly, my local party, the West Berkshire Conservative Association, accommodates many opinions on Brexit. Brexit has no direct connection with local politics, and our chairman has rightly taken care not to allow it on the agendas of our group meetings.
FEB21	Letters: The widening gulf between party members and MPs on Left and Right	SIR – Our political parties are split. In the Conservatives many MPs have moved away from their members, while in Labour it is the membership that has moved away from its MPs. Michael Staples Seaford, East Sussex  
FEB22	Munich is the city that political correctness forgot	The culture police would have a field day in Munich, where I was this week for the city's annual security conference. In costume shops, amid fairy costumes and firemen’s helmets, you can make yourself the proud owner of an “Indianer” outfit. This authentic Native American get-up is illustrated by a picture of a dorky white guy holding a little axe and wearing face-paint, a long black wig with feather headband and head-to-toe brown tassels. At the higher end, one jewellery shop advertised its wares by hanging a carefully sculpted “negress” necklace in its window – a black, carved head of an African woman in a tribal gold hat. Good luck to whichever dope decides to wear that out in a more cosmopolitan setting.
FEB22	Brexiteers must now hold their nerve against Remain's desperate last stand	The Independent Group (TIG) in Parliament came into being this week, chiefly to stop Brexit. If the Conservatives hold their nerve, this reason for the group’s existence will have passed in five weeks’ time: we shall have left the European Union. That nerve – never strong at the best of times – is showing signs of fraying. In this long, exhausting story, fear has been the weapon used 99 per cent of the time by the Remain side. It did not work with the British electorate, but it does take its toll on some Tory MPs and so, as D-Day approaches, it is being recycled – each time faster and more furious. Since the three Tory “Tiggers” bounced out on Wednesday to join the more sorrowful and numerous Labour escapees, fear has been stoked once again. The Brexit Delivery Group of backbench Conservatives, seeking the sort of all-smiles divorce which will never be available so long as people like Jean-Claude Juncker walk this earth, wrote to the Prime Minister.
FEB22	The Left's terrible hypocrisy on Shamima Begum is putting our safety at risk	Shamima Begum is an unlikely poster-girl for the Left. The self-described “housewife” subscribes to a deeply regressive and dangerous Islamist ideology, which treats women with contempt and violence. Yet, Sajid Javid’s decision to strip her of her British citizenship has unleashed a chorus of condemnation from almost every progressive commentator in the land. Javid’s decision makes many – including me – uncomfortable. For all intents and purposes, Shamima Begum is British – Bethnal Green was the only home that she had ever known – and we must be cautious about playing fast and loose with laws on citizenship stripping.  As British Jews qualify for citizenship of Israel by birthright, a future anti-Semitic Government may well make arbitrary use of such a mechanism. Indeed, John McDonnell has in the past suggested stripping citizenship from British Jews who join the Israel Defence Force. Moreover, preventing Begum’s entry to the UK (even if it is legally possible) is unlikely to solve the problem of what to do with her. Bangladesh, the proposed option, is disowning her.  It is quite possible that, by virtue of the Home Secretary’s decision, she will continue to reside in a refugee camp, where she can give unfiltered media interviews that promote her distorted views.
FEB22	Ian Austin’s departure proves Labour’s crisis goes much deeper than Brexit	Ian Austin has done the political world a great favour by resigning from the Labour Party this week. In doing so, he reminds us that the defections of nine Labour MPs are less about their destination than where they came from. This crisis goes rather deeper than the Independent Group’s stance on Brexit, just as the defections on Wednesday by three Conservative MPs have more to do with the state of Theresa May’s government than their new parliamentary colleagues. But for the moment at least, this is not about Chuka Umunna’s nascent centrist party, its obsession with stopping Brexit, its absence of policies in other areas or the moral and democratic case for its members to stand down and fight by-elections under their new colours. It is, as it has been for the last three years, about Labour.
FEB22	Bright days await us after a no-deal Brexit, as long as we keep preparing for it	From a tactical standpoint, the persistent rejection of ‘no deal’ is staggering in its absurdity. Imagine going into any negotiation (buying a car, house, whatever) and declaring: ‘Just to let you know – I have to buy xyz. I cannot leave here without it.’ The seller (in this case the EU) will have the luxury of setting whatever terms they wish, no matter how unreasonable. The only way to have any genuine leverage in a transaction is by being prepared to walk away. Yet this is bizarrely what some of our MPs would have us do in relation to the Brexit withdrawal negotiations. Make no mistake - the EU is in this to secure the best outcome it can (tying the UK to its regulations as closely as possible). They are not seeking an outcome which is ‘mutually beneficial’ – they will only take this lesser outcome as the last resort if they realize that we won’t back down from the conditions they force upon us. They have drawn their red ‘no-renegotiation’ lines in the sand. We must draw ours. The UK must stick to its guns and continue to prepare for ‘no deal’ in earnest. As Brexit day approaches with the prospect of a serious withdrawal agreement (meaning a normal Free Trade Agreement) fading by the day, most of the UK public and business community are awaking to the reality that a clean break with the EU will be entirely manageable – nothing like the Armageddon that many in the media and government sadly still drum on about.
FEB22	Any Tory that quits the whip now must understand that there's no going back	Any Conservative MP who is thinking about joining the Independent Group rebellion should consider carefully what Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston have said and done. This is not Dr Wollaston’s first revolt: she has drifted so far from the Tory mainstream that she recently abstained from a vote on the Budget. In the past 48 hours, Ms Soubry launched a personal attack on the Prime Minister, suggesting that Theresa May is unhealthily obsessed with immigration (Ms Soubry herself campaigned three times on a manifesto that pledged to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands).
FEB22	When Corbyn talks about Shamima Begum, he sounds like an Islington social worker	Yesterday offered a study in culture war contrasts. Sajid Javid is doing the best he can to keep Shamima Begum out of the country.  Jeremy Corbyn says the former jihadi bride has a right to return to the UK and should receive “some support”. Mr Javid is putting the public’s safety first; Mr Corbyn sounds like an Islington social worker. Can the Labour leader not grasp that the public is furious about Ms Begum’s actions and lack of remorse? Or that citizenship, though a right, is also a sacred contract that might be broken by treason or giving comfort to enemies?
FEB22	Whatever the splitters say, the Independent Group is about Brexit and very little else	The departure of Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston from the Conservative Party feels like the beginning of something significant. The first eight Labour resignations were internecine; being joined by three Tories shows that the new Independent Group can reach across the House. Many voters tell pollsters they are looking for a moderate alternative, and the cultural elite of this country is going to love the mirage of revived centrism. But it is a mirage. This is a grouping of Remainers who are every bit as ideological as Jeremy Corbyn or Nigel Farage. Issue must be taken with their characterisation of the Conservative Party, which they say has been captured by a radical Right-wing group. To whom are they referring? Theresa May? Philip Hammond? Amber Rudd? What government policy is particularly Right-wing? The billions more earmarked for the NHS? Prison reform? Lavish foreign aid?

FEB23	The Remainer rebels plotting to cripple the PM next week need to step back from the brink	The sense of political jeopardy is now very great: we are seeing the fracturing of parties, MPs taking drastic destabilising action, the potential for a no-deal Brexit, and further uncertainty of an unknown duration. Oliver Letwin, Nick Boles, members of the Cabinet and a raft of junior ministers seem to want to take the Prime Minister’s legs out from under her in the next round of Brexit votes on February 27. Just when the EU27 have said they will provide “legal assurances” on the backstop and provide a “guarantee” on its temporary nature, these MPs are arguing that the time has come for decisive action to take no‑deal off the table. What is the “decisive” action proposed? It’s a three-step process: first, secure a majority for an amendment next Wednesday giving MPs the power to legislate; secondly, pass legislation to require the Government to hold and comply with a vote on March 14, at the earliest, on extending the Article 50 deadline; and finally, win that vote. There are flaws: the Bill may not pass in time for March Council.
FEB23	Shamima Begum is the product of a country that no longer believes in itself	To see the extent of the rift between the tweeting classes and the rest of the country, consider their attitudes to British nationals who joined Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil). The consensus in newspapers, on TV discussion programmes and on social media is that UK citizenship is an entitlement. Yet, by a margin of 78 per cent to 15, voters back Sajid Javid’s decision to remove citizenship from Shamima Begum, the jihadi bride now in Kurdish custody. The gap reflects differing ideas of what citizenship means. The liberal case may lack appeal, but it does not lack coherence. Removing people’s nationality is often the hallmark of an autocracy. The first act of the Nazis, when they conquered a new country, was usually to declare its Jews stateless. We rightly condemn the Burmese authorities for denying citizenship to the Rohingya. True, this case is technically different: Begum is theoretically entitled to Bangladeshi citizenship, just as Jack Letts, another British Islamist in Kurdish detention, is theoretically entitled to Canadian citizenship. In practice, though, neither Bangladesh nor Canada can reasonably be asked to take in an Isil radical who previously lived in the UK.
FEB23	Is anti-Semitism out of control in our universities?	The past week was a shameful one for anti-Semitism in Britain. One Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, and another MP of Jewish heritage, Ian Austin, decided to leave the Labour Party because of the racism against Jews that they say has been tolerated by the hard-Left leadership. But away from the political arena, anti-Semitism also reared its ugly head on the campus of a major university. The University of Essex held an online poll to determine whether an official Jewish association would be allowed to exist. As one social media user pointed out: “Allowing students to ratify the creation of an Ultimate Frisbee society is fine. Allowing non-affected students to block the creation of a society for an ethnic minority is majority tyranny.” Astonishingly, when the story broke, over a third of respondents – more than 200 people – had replied “no”. Rather than expressing alarm at these worrying attitudes, the university initially did not respond to public concerns – triggering further outcry. Eventually, the university’s vice‑chancellor was forced to intervene, confirming that a Jewish society would be created regardless.
FEB23	The supposedly impartial BBC should hang its head in shame at its relentless bias	How ironic it was last week to hear the BBC leading its news on that Commons report claiming that our “democracy is being destroyed” by the flood of “fake news” spread by social media. In fact, thanks to the relentless bias of its own coverage of so many issues, there is no more influential source of “fake news” than the BBC itself. Here are two glaring, but far from untypical, recent examples. The first began earlier in February with puffs on the BBC News website and Radio 4’s Today programme by Roger Harrabin, the BBC’s “environment analyst”, for a report by a body called the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), warning of “multiple crises” that threaten to “destabilise” the world’s entire environmental system. Particularly striking was a repeated claim that, since 2005, thanks to climate change, there has been a 15-fold increase in floods across the world and a 20-fold increase in “extreme temperature events”. This seemed so startling that it prompted Paul Homewood, the diligent statistical analyst, on his Notalotofpeopleknowthat blog to track down the evidence for these claims. It turned out that they originated from a database of natural disasters, EM-DAT. According to Homewood, this showed that the chief reason for these rocketing increases was a very significant change in the way such “disasters” were being recorded, to include thousands of more recent events that would previously have been far too small to register in the global figures (the IPPR itself warned that these figures should, therefore, be treated with “caution”).
FEB23	Sorry TIGs, but post-Blair Britain will not be duped by the pernicious lie of a 'centrist paradise'	How well I remember the golden era of the political Centre Ground. Those ecstatically over-excited Tory dissenters proclaiming their unity with Labour’s break-away grouplet last week were determined to revive that glorious age in which there was no anger and no conflict in the land. Maybe they hoped we had forgotten that what began as a promise of Moderate Heaven – the final triumph of Reason over extremism – ended by turning the democratic process into a branch of the advertising industry.   Out went principles, conviction and ideals. In came re-branding, message control and opinion-sampling. Governing was not to be a matter of ideological daydream or romantic conceits about transforming society. It was simply a question of good management.
FEB23	Labour is now a Corbynite party. How can any moderate stay inside it?	Until yesterday, the factor that united every Labour MP who left the party this week was opposition to Brexit. Ian Austin, however, who represents the West Midlands town of Dudley, voted for Theresa May’s withdrawal deal. His farewell letter spoke of a “culture of extremism, anti-Semitism and intolerance” taking over the party, saying Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell “cannot be trusted with our national security and would undermine our democratic institutions”. Mr Austin accused them of backing dictatorships, and even supporting the IRA “when they were planting bombs and murdering people”.
FEB23	Any Tory that quits the whip now must understand that there's no going back	Any Conservative MP who is thinking about joining the Independent Group rebellion should consider carefully what Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston have said and done. This is not Dr Wollaston’s first revolt: she has drifted so far from the Tory mainstream that she recently abstained from a vote on the Budget. In the past 48 hours, Ms Soubry launched a personal attack on the Prime Minister, suggesting that Theresa May is unhealthily obsessed with immigration (Ms Soubry herself campaigned three times on a manifesto that pledged to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands).

FEB23	Letters: British businesses are already trading with ease under WTO rules	SIR – I run and own two companies, one in the United States and one in Britain. We frequently ship products to and from countries all over the world under World Trade Organisation protocols, and experience no problems. The tariffs vary from zero to about 4 per cent. We have to answer three questions. What the goods are; what we are charging for them; and what the country of origin is. It takes about two minutes to fill in the form on the internet when we book a shipment. All shipping agents provide this service. There are no delays. I cannot understand why there is all this talk of chaos if we leave the EU without a deal.
FEB23	Letters: The Conservative defectors are out of touch with the reality of their place in politics	SIR – Anna Soubry, on leaving the parliamentary Conservative Party, made two questionable statements: that all Tory leaders in the last 40 years were driven out by a pro-Brexit group, and that that group had seized control of the party “from top to toe”. First, it can hardly be said that William Hague or Michael Howard were driven out thus. John Major left because he lost the 1997 election, and David Cameron chose to leave after the 2016 referendum. Secondly, my local party, the West Berkshire Conservative Association, accommodates many opinions on Brexit. Brexit has no direct connection with local politics, and our chairman has rightly taken care not to allow it on the agendas of our group meetings.
FEB24	Will ‘woke’ David Lammy tackle his unconscious bias against the suburbs?	What have the liberal-Left got against suburbia? Equivalent to “fly-over country” in America (those inland states which residents of the East and West coasts look down on as they flit from New York to San Francisco), Britain’s middle-class Leftists view the suburbs as the seat of all that is wrong with this country. Home of “rabbit-hutch” houses, two cars in the driveway, narrow minds and wide eyes peering from behind net curtains, to be suburban is to be guilty of a crime against aesthetics and liberal morality. It’s no wonder, then, that in a diatribe against the Prime Minister last week, David Lammy decided to attack her for being “suburban”.
FEB24	I helped found the ERG – accusations of extremism are ridiculous	Cripes. It’s all my fault, apparently. Justifying their decision to quit the Conservatives, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen cited the “dismal failure to stand up to the hardline ERG”. Those three letters have become an abbreviation, not just for “European Research Group”, but for the extreme Euroscepticism that, in the minds of commentators, has seized the governing party. And I, along with the amiable Michael Spicer, was the man who founded the ERG 25 years ago. Should I then declare, with Prospero, “This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine”? Actually, I’m proud to have played a part in setting up the ERG. The notion that it is a network of obsessives bent on taking over the Conservative Party is not just untrue; it is the pretty much opposite of the truth. The ERG is pushing for the implementation of the manifesto on which all Conservative MPs were elected 20 months ago. Its members have a far more loyal voting record than have the MPs who have just broken away. Its spirit, for 25 years, has been constructive.
FEB24	When did we become a nation of catastrophe addicts?	One of my favourite amusements of late is to note things that were once considered sources of innocent consolation, but are now apparently liable to drive you to an early grave. They include sofas (norovirus), wood-burning stoves (heart attacks, strokes, dementia), scented candles (lung-unfriendly carcinogens) and toast (toxic air pollution on a par with a busy intersection). All those decades when I was being warned about the perils of sex, drugs and rock’n’roll and it now turns out that if you’re lighting a scented candle and curling up on the sofa while chewing a nice bit of toast, you might as well be sniffing ketamine and drinking bourbon while having a sex orgy on a tightrope without a safety net, peril-wise. And now even the humble gas hob has been branded a killer. They could no longer be installed in new homes within seven years, over fears that they are harming the environment.
FEB24	TIGgers may have the establishment on their side, but the masses will decide their fate	Part of me admires them. It takes courage to walk into a press conference and tell the world you are quitting your party. Each of the 11 MPs joining the new breakaway Independent Group will have wrestled long and hard with their decision. No doubt there were plenty of sleepless nights and 4am conversations with their nearest and dearest around the kitchen table. They will have known that they weren’t just sacrificing the comradeship and campaign support that comes from being part of a big party. They will be saying goodbye to a number of friendships, too, all in pursuit of what they believe to be right.
FEB24	Luciana Berger is the perfect poster girl for Jewishness	Stereotypes, particularly ethnic ones, are generally false, lacking any grounding in reality. Nonetheless, they’re powerful, hard to let go of, and when you know the ones the world has for millennia harboured of your sort, it’s almost impossible to pretend they don’t matter, don’t inform – even subconsciously – the way one is judged. In the case of Jews (and not only Jews, of course) stereotypes matter a lot – they have been fully integrated into the campaigns of harassment, denial, torture and extermination against us that have defined our tenure in Europe since Roman times.  The 20th century alone made full use of imagery that construed our menfolk as having great blubbery lips, enormous beaked noses, hunched backs; an unending grasping after money, an inhuman greed, appetite for control and power, nefariousness beyond all imaginings, and a sexuality both unstemmably dangerous and pathetically grotesque. Even now, I worry if I quibble the cost of something – will I be seen as a penny-pinching Jew? 
FEB24	Brexiteers must stand firm, not panic	The old political order is in its death throes: Brexit has finally forced MPs to rethink their labels and even break from their party. The new Independent Group, although also a revolt against Labour’s disgusting anti-Semitism, is largely a Remainer bloc; more may yet resign their whips to sit with it. But the creation of the Group doesn’t actually change the mathematics in Parliament and will eventually help the Brexiteers in the country. Every MP who allies with the Independents was always against Brexit and will continue to be – and pro-Brexit MPs should not be spooked by all this political excitement into thinking that the advantage has moved to the Remainers.  To use a phrase popular with Theresa May, nothing has changed. Her Withdrawal Agreement is still a terrible document, it needs serious rewriting (at best) and a no-deal should not and cannot be ruled out. If anything, any further defections from Labour that genuinely give the Independent Group some momentum will split the Left and deliver a majority to a pro‑Brexit Conservative Party at the next election, strengthening the hand of the next prime minister when it comes to our future negotiations with Brussels. Therefore, even though this week will probably see the most dramatic attempt yet by Remainers to block the whole process, this is not the time for Brexiteers to panic. A group of MPs and ministers is trying to pressure the Prime Minister by backing a Commons move to take no-deal off the table and delay the Brexit date. This would be the equivalent of being caught in a “Hotel California” arrangement, whereby Britain never quite leaves. Of course, a new prime minister could force yet another showdown with the EU, but it would be even harder. As the Northern Ireland minister John Penrose writes, ruling out trading on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms would completely undermine negotiations because Brussels would know we could never walk away without an agreement. It could and would impose on us the worst terms possible: remember what happened to Greece in 2015.
FEB24	Don't revoke citizenship: update our treason laws	All those Westerners who travelled to Syria to support the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) knew exactly what they were doing. It was a bloodthirsty, fundamentalist theocracy, which is now, fortunately, collapsing. Many of these former fighters or brides want to return home to save their skins, and are obviously trying to exploit the very generosity and liberalism of the society they once turned against. There are no social workers or human rights lawyers under Isil, but there are probably plenty waiting back in the UK to give them “some support” (in the words of Jeremy Corbyn). And many Britons suspect that, under our current laws, they will escape prosecution and wind up living at the taxpayers’ expense in a cosy council house. Unlike the liberal-Left voices that dominate so much of the establishment conversation, Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, understands the public mood perfectly well and is using all the tools in his limited armoury. In the case of Shamima Begum, he has revoked her UK citizenship – a fate that has befallen well over 100 Isil associates and criminals since 2016.   But there is a better way that is equally tough on the terrorists, yet doesn’t try to make a problem disappear by pretending that it isn’t Britain’s. If the state can declare that anyone with actual or even potential dual citizenship belongs in another country, such a power could one day be used by an extremist government of Left or Right to punish its critics. Citizenship ought to be an unconditional, permanent status – which comes with responsibilities as well as rights. It is not a document akin to a temporary visa. Immigrants, or the descendants of immigrants, should not feel that their Britishness could suddenly be removed, or even called into question.

FEB24	Letters: The downsides of the HS2 project have long overtaken the benefits	SIR – I agree with Liam Halligan. HS2, if built, will cause massive environmental damage, break up communities and force thousands to move. It will cost £403 million a mile to save 27 minutes between London and Edinburgh. Furthermore, it will require nearly a gigawatt of additional electricity capacity at a time when the Government has closed our remaining coal-fired power stations and thousands of new electric vehicles have to be recharged. Britain’s geography is unsuited to 200 mph trains. Distances between towns are not great and the line is planned to go through scenic areas and valued habitats. Hundreds of homes will be blighted or demolished.
FEB24	Letters: British businesses are already trading with ease under WTO rules	SIR – I run and own two companies, one in the United States and one in Britain. We frequently ship products to and from countries all over the world under World Trade Organisation protocols, and experience no problems. The tariffs vary from zero to about 4 per cent. We have to answer three questions. What the goods are; what we are charging for them; and what the country of origin is. It takes about two minutes to fill in the form on the internet when we book a shipment. All shipping agents provide this service. There are no delays. I cannot understand why there is all this talk of chaos if we leave the EU without a deal.
FEB25	Britain needs to stop playing the EU's game and take a harder line on Brexit	Imagine that we knew the day of our death. Our lives would change drastically. Though we know we shall surely die, not knowing precisely when the mortal coil will be shuffled off makes all the difference, allowing us to live life productively on a day-by-day basis. For exactly the same reason, the fixed deadline embedded in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty guaranteed that nothing good would come out of the Brexit negotiations. A bad Brexit deal, and even more so a no-deal Brexit, will be detrimental to the UK and to the EU. Mrs Merkel, Mr Macron and Mr Juncker are just as aware of this as Mrs May. If Article 50 had not stipulated a fixed deadline, the EU’s leadership would have no option but to negotiate in good faith until they struck a mutually advantageous deal with the British government.
FEB25	With Labour imploding and Brexit in the balance, the Tories need to stick together	While I think the three MPs who left the Conservative Party last week were wrong to do so, their departure should alarm every sensible Tory in the land. I have known quite a few defectors over the decades but, until now, they have been lone individuals leaving for personal ambition or after an agonising change in their own beliefs. These three acted together and left in order, as they see it, to stick to their guns. Whatever you think of them, they are people who believe in an enterprise economy, individual freedom and a well-defended country – in other words, they are basically Tories. When Tories start leaving the Tory party, we should be very worried. Their loss cannot be shrugged off just because the Labour Party is in an even worse state. Their act of leaving without changing their views is a poor reflection on the Conservative Party, but it isn’t great news for the new Independent Group either. That group now mixes real Tories with social democrats, without knowing if anything enticing can be created out of such an exotic cocktail.
FEB25	Britain risks its own national security if it leaves us Kurds in the clutches of Turkey's Erdogan	The Islamic State (IS) is expected to be defeated within days by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in its final holdout in Baghuz. By then, the evil organisation will be deprived of all its territory (at the height of which comprised an area as large as Great Britain). Having recently toured Europe’s capitals, I cannot help but feel that the importance of the SDF’s victory over IS is not appreciated enough. The anti-IS military campaign has been a low-cost high-return campaign for the US and Europe. For Northeastern Syrian population, however, the cost has been grave grave. Around 8,000 fighters, Kurd, Arab, Turkmen and Christian in the SDF gave their lives to defeat Isil. And Kurdish-led parts of eastern Syria are still under threat of attack; we need continued support from our allies to prevent the IS sleeper cells that are scattered across liberated areas from attacking civilians.
FEB25	Backing a second referendum could definitively end Jeremy Corbyn's chances of becoming PM	If Jeremy Corbyn is about to win lots of new friends as a result of his announcement that he could, after all, back another referendum on Brexit, he also risks making a lot of his core voters very unhappy indeed. In the time-honoured traditions of Labour’s public statements, no one is yet quite sure what this new policy means. But there’s no doubt that Corbyn’s announcement – made to a meeting of his MPs at their weekly meeting at the Commons tonight – will have Remainers putting a skip into their step for the first time in weeks. Inevitably Corbyn has fallen just a bit short of saying he supports a new referendum where Remain will be an option. And neither has he committed his party to campaigning for that particular option.
FEB25	We police are all for plans to scrap shorter sentences – if we replace them with longer ones	When I joined the Police Force in 2000, one of the things that astonished me was the sheer lack of deterrent from courts. Back in those days we arrested far more offenders. Charging decisions for most offences were down to us, and therefore suspects usually had their day in court. Many times, I attended court as a witness or officer in the case, to see thieves, prostitutes, vandals, abusive drunks, small time drug dealers and addicts prosecuted. If we were lucky, they were sent to prison. Make no mistake, these were habitual criminals who blighted their communities.
FEB25	Brexiteers must stand firm, not panic	The old political order is in its death throes: Brexit has finally forced MPs to rethink their labels and even break from their party. The new Independent Group, although also a revolt against Labour’s disgusting anti-Semitism, is largely a Remainer bloc; more may yet resign their whips to sit with it. But the creation of the Group doesn’t actually change the mathematics in Parliament and will eventually help the Brexiteers in the country. Every MP who allies with the Independents was always against Brexit and will continue to be – and pro-Brexit MPs should not be spooked by all this political excitement into thinking that the advantage has moved to the Remainers.  To use a phrase popular with Theresa May, nothing has changed. Her Withdrawal Agreement is still a terrible document, it needs serious rewriting (at best) and a no-deal should not and cannot be ruled out. If anything, any further defections from Labour that genuinely give the Independent Group some momentum will split the Left and deliver a majority to a pro‑Brexit Conservative Party at the next election, strengthening the hand of the next prime minister when it comes to our future negotiations with Brussels. Therefore, even though this week will probably see the most dramatic attempt yet by Remainers to block the whole process, this is not the time for Brexiteers to panic. A group of MPs and ministers is trying to pressure the Prime Minister by backing a Commons move to take no-deal off the table and delay the Brexit date. This would be the equivalent of being caught in a “Hotel California” arrangement, whereby Britain never quite leaves. Of course, a new prime minister could force yet another showdown with the EU, but it would be even harder. As the Northern Ireland minister John Penrose writes, ruling out trading on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms would completely undermine negotiations because Brussels would know we could never walk away without an agreement. It could and would impose on us the worst terms possible: remember what happened to Greece in 2015.
FEB25	Don't revoke citizenship: update our treason laws	All those Westerners who travelled to Syria to support the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) knew exactly what they were doing. It was a bloodthirsty, fundamentalist theocracy, which is now, fortunately, collapsing. Many of these former fighters or brides want to return home to save their skins, and are obviously trying to exploit the very generosity and liberalism of the society they once turned against. There are no social workers or human rights lawyers under Isil, but there are probably plenty waiting back in the UK to give them “some support” (in the words of Jeremy Corbyn). And many Britons suspect that, under our current laws, they will escape prosecution and wind up living at the taxpayers’ expense in a cosy council house. Unlike the liberal-Left voices that dominate so much of the establishment conversation, Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, understands the public mood perfectly well and is using all the tools in his limited armoury. In the case of Shamima Begum, he has revoked her UK citizenship – a fate that has befallen well over 100 Isil associates and criminals since 2016.   But there is a better way that is equally tough on the terrorists, yet doesn’t try to make a problem disappear by pretending that it isn’t Britain’s. If the state can declare that anyone with actual or even potential dual citizenship belongs in another country, such a power could one day be used by an extremist government of Left or Right to punish its critics. Citizenship ought to be an unconditional, permanent status – which comes with responsibilities as well as rights. It is not a document akin to a temporary visa. Immigrants, or the descendants of immigrants, should not feel that their Britishness could suddenly be removed, or even called into question.
FEB25	Labour is now a Corbynite party. How can any moderate stay inside it?	Until yesterday, the factor that united every Labour MP who left the party this week was opposition to Brexit. Ian Austin, however, who represents the West Midlands town of Dudley, voted for Theresa May’s withdrawal deal. His farewell letter spoke of a “culture of extremism, anti-Semitism and intolerance” taking over the party, saying Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell “cannot be trusted with our national security and would undermine our democratic institutions”. Mr Austin accused them of backing dictatorships, and even supporting the IRA “when they were planting bombs and murdering people”.
FEB25	Letters: Mrs May’s deal is bad and delaying Brexit would just prolong the agony	SIR – It takes two to tango. It has been clear for months that the European Commission is not prepared to dance. We have the Prime Minister’s deal, to which the EU dragged her – no voice, no vote, no veto, no rebate, no trade deal, all at a cost of £39 billion, with nothing in return. Parliament has defeated it by a majority of 230 votes. We have the people’s decision to leave, endorsed by Parliament, with a timetable to boot. 
FEB25	Letters: Britain can’t cut off domestic gas without other reliable energy sources	SIR – The recommendation by the Committee on Climate Change that gas should not be used in homes built after 2025 (Letters, February 23) must be coupled to a government strategy for sources of energy in the future.  All existing coal and nuclear stations are being decommissioned within 16 years, with only one new nuclear power station under construction. Investment in tidal power is pitifully inadequate; wind and solar power are intermittent and this cannot yet be compensated for by large-scale energy storage. Electric vehicle numbers will increase significantly. Everything therefore indicates increasing reliance on (foreign) gas for electrical power generation, with all its environmental and supply security implications.
FEB26	Jeremy Corbyn is committed to a second referendum he must pray will never happen	The Archbishop of Canterbury is so concerned about the state of the nation after March 29th that he is planning five days of prayer. Is he quite sure five days is enough? A sample of headlines just from the past 48 hours: Brexit may be delayed by two months! Article 50 extended! A second referendum (for crying out loud…)! Please can they make it stop? Seriously, apart from the headbangers on both sides, everyone has had enough. Not a week more. Not a minute longer than is absolutely necessary. If we can get out on March 29th with the shirt on our backs, a few quid for the bus and a Thorntons voucher from Donald Tusk, let’s just do it. End of. Done. Had it. Fini. No more.
FEB26	The creative inertia of modern politics is destroying the people's trust	Why does the PM continue to insist that leaving on March 29 is achievable? At this stage, it is quite obviously impossible. When a dog goes swimming, you can see its head bobbing gently above the water. Below the surface, however, its legs are paddling frantically to propel it forward. For British politics, alas, the story is currently the exact opposite. We have been overwhelmed by a hyperactive brand of inertia. Despite the impression of frenetic surface activity in government, very little is actually happening – yet our politicians are desperately trying to pretend that it is. If they were in the water alongside the dog, they would be in a rowing boat, paddling in circles with a single oar.
FEB26	Labour's second referendum won't go ahead, but it will destroy the credibility of my party	Ever since the British public voted decisively to leave the European Union in June 2016, the pro-EU establishment in this country has sought to undermine the referendum result. They have undercut the Government’s negotiating strategy at every turn, spread unwarranted fear about our ability to prosper outside the EU, and encouraged the Brussels bureaucracy not to compromise in a deal. And now they have convinced the Labour leadership to support another referendum to try to overturn the mandate of the people. When Jeremy Corbyn and I first stood for Parliament in 1983, we fought on a Labour manifesto which pledged to take the UK out of the then-EEC – without a referendum. I have been proud to maintain this traditional Labour policy since then, and joined Jeremy in voting against every European Treaty since I was elected in 1989. I was equally proud to stand on Labour’s manifesto in 2017, in which the first words of the Negotiating Brexit chapter were “Labour accepts the referendum result”.
FEB26	Am I the only one who didn't want Olivia Colman to win at the Oscars?	A guilty confession: I was hoping that Glenn Close would win the Oscar for Best Actress. Not because Olivia Colman’s Queen Anne in The Favourite isn’t brilliant – hilarious, heartbreaking, it is.  But Close has the cruel distinction of being the most nominated living actor, male or female, to have never won an Oscar. With her seventh nod, for a devastating, emotionally complex performance in The Wife, victory was so near, Close must have been able to taste it. The 71-year-old even came dressed to the 91st Academy Awards in a gold dress and train (weight: 42lbs). She looked like the statue she was planning on taking home.
FEB26	Theresa May is trying to back Tory Brexiteers into a corner with her no-deal ploy	When Tory Brexiteers joined MPs in rejecting Theresa May's deal last month, Michael Gove warned them that they had effectively voted for a "softer Brexit". The Prime Minister has since proved him right by offering up legal guarantees on following EU employment law to woo Labour MPs, as well as a vote to shadow it more closely. The biggest overture Mrs May has made to Remainers is her concession today that if Parliament rejects her deal again, she will not let the United Kingdom leave on March 29th without a deal unless Parliament gives "explicit consent" for it in a vote. Given that supporters of a no-deal Brexit are vastly outnumbered in the House of Commons, that makes such a vote nigh-on impossible to win, with its rejection paving the way for MPs to then vote to delay Brexit. 
FEB26	Brexiteers must stand firm, not panic	The old political order is in its death throes: Brexit has finally forced MPs to rethink their labels and even break from their party. The new Independent Group, although also a revolt against Labour’s disgusting anti-Semitism, is largely a Remainer bloc; more may yet resign their whips to sit with it. But the creation of the Group doesn’t actually change the mathematics in Parliament and will eventually help the Brexiteers in the country. Every MP who allies with the Independents was always against Brexit and will continue to be – and pro-Brexit MPs should not be spooked by all this political excitement into thinking that the advantage has moved to the Remainers.  To use a phrase popular with Theresa May, nothing has changed. Her Withdrawal Agreement is still a terrible document, it needs serious rewriting (at best) and a no-deal should not and cannot be ruled out. If anything, any further defections from Labour that genuinely give the Independent Group some momentum will split the Left and deliver a majority to a pro‑Brexit Conservative Party at the next election, strengthening the hand of the next prime minister when it comes to our future negotiations with Brussels. Therefore, even though this week will probably see the most dramatic attempt yet by Remainers to block the whole process, this is not the time for Brexiteers to panic. A group of MPs and ministers is trying to pressure the Prime Minister by backing a Commons move to take no-deal off the table and delay the Brexit date. This would be the equivalent of being caught in a “Hotel California” arrangement, whereby Britain never quite leaves. Of course, a new prime minister could force yet another showdown with the EU, but it would be even harder. As the Northern Ireland minister John Penrose writes, ruling out trading on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms would completely undermine negotiations because Brussels would know we could never walk away without an agreement. It could and would impose on us the worst terms possible: remember what happened to Greece in 2015.

FEB27	The Tories have a historic opportunity to destroy Labour once and for all	Mrs May must make her party the Brexit party and stick to its core values  Utter, abject incompetence is the new normal in British politics, and that could yet prove the Conservative Party’s saving grace. Not since Lord North was prime minister in the 18th century has Britain been governed so appallingly, and yet the Tories could paradoxically still end up crushing Labour and winning the next election with a massive majority. As Friedrich Nietzsche put it in Beyond Good and Evil, “In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.” For now, at least, Jeremy Corbyn’s failings as a political strategist are proving to be even more crippling than Theresa May’s. His first misjudgment was to have underestimated the potency of what he wrongly calls “Blairism” – in reality, European-style social-democracy of a kind practised by Gordon Brown.
FEB27	Hurtling towards war, India and Pakistan are discovering the trouble with democracy	In both nations, voters support tough action There is a popular theory in foreign policy circles that democracy is a cure for warmongering. It encourages compromise and sidelines extremism, students of international relations are told, and therefore makes war between two democracies highly unlikely. India and Pakistan seem on course not just to tear up this received wisdom but to incinerate it with their arsenals on the Kashmiri border where the two countries are facing off. In each country, popular pressure is working to prevent compromise between two leaders who each fear seeming weak in the eyes of their voters. As a consequence, India and Pakistan, nuclear-armed powers, are sliding closer to the brink than Washington and Moscow ever did.
FEB27	The fate of Theresa May's deal - and Brexit itself - is now in the hands of Geoffrey Cox	Theresa May deflated today’s potential for Brexit drama (notwithstanding the Government’s flap over an amendment protecting EU citizens’ rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit) with a promise to hold votes on whether to proceed to no deal or delay Brexit in the event her own deal is defeated. That leaves the Prime Minister with just under a fortnight to improve her deal to enough of an extent that it can be passed by Parliament. Jacob Rees-Mogg, tribune of the Tory backbench Brexiteers, has been garnering a lot of attention for the softer tone he has been striking about how much needs to change over the backstop to make the deal acceptable. After declaring last month that he would not vote for the deal “as long as that backstop is there”, the ERG chairman is now arguing that he would be “quite happy with an appendix”. Usefully for the Government, he has indicated that they do not necessarily have to reopen the withdrawal treaty text for him to be happy.
FEB27	The timeless Mr Men books capture modern stereotypes perfectly	We all know a Mr Mean and a Little Miss Bossy When Little Miss Neat spots a puddle outside Twopin Cottage, she gasps and seizes a duster. “She mopped up every drop of puddle, and then she rushed inside and washed the duster, and then she ironed the duster, and then she folded the duster, and then she placed the duster very neatly back in its drawer.” As she should. When I was five, my nanny gave me a copy of Roger Hargreaves’s Little Miss Neat. I saw the joke. Little Miss Neat was me! A strange, small person who liked tidying her toys even more than playing with them. My younger brother was, yes, you guessed it, Mr Messy. Our favourite, though, was Mr Tickle, who tickles a teacher through a classroom window. “There was terrible pandemonium,” writes Hargreaves. Good word: pandemonium. “Hello, darling, how was the playground/park/bouncy castle?” “It was pandemonium…” Little children love big words. A friend couldn’t keep a straight face when her three-year-old protested against going to nursery with: “This is intolerable, Mummy.”
FEB27	Now is not the time for Brexiteers to go soft on the PM's shoddy deal	More than ever, our MPs must be brave and hold out for what is right. This is no time for Brexiteers to go soft. What is right is what the majority of people voted for - that is the essence of democracy. What is right is what is in the long term economic and business interests of the UK. There is no question that an extension of Article 50, engineered by the government or Parliament, will be seen as a betrayal of Brexit, a betrayal of one of the largest democratic plebiscites and one in which two thirds of UK constituencies (nearly three quarters of those in England and Wales) voted to leave the EU. Note that when they voted to leave, no mention was made of a deal, let alone “a close and special relationship”.
FEB27	Cabinet coup has placed the future of Brexit in peril	There are many questions that arise from the Prime Minister’s latest Brexit statement, not least why she made it. After consistently rejecting calls for a delay to Brexit and insisting that no deal could not be taken off the table, she promised to give Parliament the opportunity to do precisely that. Should her deal be voted down again on March 12, MPs will be able to vote on whether or not they support leaving without a deal on March 29. If that is rejected, almost certain given the misgivings most MPs have towards no deal, a vote will then be held to commit the Government to seek an extension to the Article 50 timetable. These commitments were made after a lengthy Cabinet meeting at which the threat of resignations hung in the air. Three ministers had made it clear that unless the prospect of no deal was removed they would support a cross-party move to take control of the process away from the Government. This was an extraordinary public snub to the Prime Minister. As she said in the Commons, it would have “far-reaching implications for the way in which the United Kingdom is governed and the balance of powers and responsibilities in our democratic institutions.” Yet dozens of her ministers were apparently prepared to do just that. What we witnessed, then, was tantamount to a Cabinet coup. Remainer ministers point out that as it is not Government policy to leave without a deal, what is wrong with specifying that fact? But by allowing the Commons to block a no-deal Brexit, the pressure on MPs to back her or risk a disorderly departure has been removed. Her main bargaining chip with Parliament and with the EU has now been thrown away.
FEB27	The real threat to global peace is developing in the Indian sub-continent	Even as Donald Trump arrived in Vietnam for talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un about his nuclear programme, a far greater threat to global peace was developing in the Indian sub-continent. Two week ago, a murderous terrorist attack by Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) militants based in Pakistani-run Kashmir killed 40 Indian troops. The Indians responded by bombing the JeM training camp, risking a clash with the Pakistani air force which was scrambled in response. The strikes are the first launched across the line of control since the 1971 war. Kashmir has long been a flash point between the two nuclear powers but the bellicose rhetoric attached to the latest stand-off is especially worrying. In India, the BJP government of Narendra Modi has been under pressure from its Hindu nationalist supporters to hit back and, with an election due by May, does not want to appear weak. This is being replicated in Pakistan, which has promised to retaliate “at a time and place of its choosing”. Once such a pledge has been made it would be hard for the relatively new prime minister Imran Khan not to follow it through.
FEB27	What exactly does the Government plan to do about Huawei?	The next great advance in mobile digital technology is 5G, and yet its future is mired in uncertainty amid security concerns, diplomatic confrontations and geopolitical friction. The reason is that one of the main providers of the new infrastructure is the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. The Americans, Australia and New Zealand have all barred Huawei from involvement in building their 5G system because they fear it could be used by Beijing as a backdoor for spying or mounting cyber attacks. Here in Britain, however, there is confusion over whether Huawei is a threat and, if it is, whether it can be safely managed. Jeremy Fleming, the head of the government spy centre GCHQ, told a conference in Singapore that a “clear view” was needed on the implications of China’s technological acquisition strategy. The problem is that clarity is precisely what we do not have at the moment. The Government’s difficulty is that, unlike America, the UK is already heavily dependent on Huawei for much of the 4G network. Along with Nokia and Ericsson, it controls almost the entire mobile infrastructure. Nick Read, chief executive of Vodafone, told reporters at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that cutting the number of network suppliers from three to two would damage the industry and economic growth. He called for “a fact-based, risk-assessed review” before any decisions were taken about Huawei’s continued involvement. The industry, its customers and the country’s security agencies are entitled to be told as soon as possible what the Government has in mind.
FEB27	Letters: The Brexit debacle means the death of Conservatism and of trust in the democratic system	SIR – They gave the nation a referendum. The nation voted Leave. They promised to execute the result, and put it in an election manifesto. The nation voted for it again.  But the Parliamentary Conservative Party has another idea. Not to leave.
FEB27	Letters: Britain is being railroaded into an unacceptable version of Brexit	SIR – There is, and has always been, only one sensible way to leave the EU – and that is without a deal. Theresa May said that no deal was better than a bad deal, but now she is trying to get us to swallow a very bad deal. I always thought it would be a real fight to get out, and so it is proving. The blame lies not just with this Government but with all the governments of the past 45 years, which have embraced the EU’s undemocratic, integrationist policies, while lying to the public about it. Now freedom is within our grasp, but our politicians don’t want it. They are terrified at the prospect of being truly responsible for Britain’s future.
FEB28	We desperately need to be honest about the links between race and gang violence	For all too many British children, the phrase “childhood innocence” is an oxymoron. For my post-war generation, William Brown and his Outlaws would be as close as most of us came to being part of a gang and Richmal Crompton’s eponymous hero’s scraped knees and torn blazer the worst damage anyone suffered. Fifty years on from the last Just William book, the redoubtable Children’s Commissioner for England has thrown a bucket of cold water over any lingering romance attached to such childhood memories. Anne Longfield’s report, published yesterday, into childhood violence and vulnerability asserted that some 27,000 under-19s identify themselves as gang members.
FEB28	Moggism is the future of the Conservative Party, and British politics	When Jacob Rees-Mogg was eleven years old, he set out his life plan: he’d be a millionaire at the age of 20, a multi-millionaire by 40 and then Prime Minister by 70, “when I’ve made enough money to afford to waste some on politics”. But as he said recently, he’d never have imagined following Bruce Forsyth in selling out the 2,300-seat London Palladium - as he did on Tuesday. I spotted Andrew Lloyd Webber in the crowd, perhaps trying to work out what on earth was going on. It’s a very good question. The Mogg show was organised by The Spectator and none of my colleagues can understand it either. We initially booked a small venue, but when it sold out in two days we gambled on booking one of the largest theatres in the West End. That sold out in two weeks. I was fascinated (and, as the host, just a bit terrified) at all this: who on earth were these people? Why were they travelling from Cornwall, Crewe and Edinburgh? What did they expect? We contacted all of them to ask what they’d like to talk about, and the responses were fascinating. First, this wasn’t a Mogg fan club. A striking number of questions sent in were hostile. Did he regret his botched attempt to defenestrate Theresa May? Why had his European Research Group of MPs made such a pig’s ear of things? One or two were admiring (“I tell my friends I’m a Moggy,” said one lady. “What name would you prefer?”). But the vast majority were serious questions on Brexit, housing, religion, economics and more. This is what united them: they had tough, detailed questions and they believed Rees-Mogg would provide interesting, direct answers.
FEB28	Britain's economy is set to boom and become the largest in Europe - because of Brexit	The public finances are on the mend, recording a healthy surplus in January on booming tax receipts. Employment is at record levels, with real wage growth at a two-year high. Despite a global slowdown, Britain expanded 1.4 per cent last year, recording just 4 per cent unemployment. Yet Germany and France are on the brink of recession, the Italian economy is contracting and eurozone joblessness is twice as high. The UK has economic problems – and let no-one say we don’t hear about them, given the relentless drumbeat of anti-Brexit media negativity. Just as the economy held up after the 2016 referendum, though – belying Treasury warnings of “an immediate and profound economic shock” – there are signs of defiant economic strength once more and confidence in our long-term future. Norway’s $1 trillion (£753 billion) sovereign wealth fund, among the world’s most respected investors, has just confirmed it will boost its UK holdings.
FEB28	The downfall of Justin Trudeau	When Justin Trudeau became Canada’s 23rd prime minister in 2015, he was immediately crowned as the darling of the political Left. Shortly after his election, Trudeau and his wife posed for a glossy feature in Vogue magazine, portraying him as a youthful, telegenic leader. Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev heaped praise on him at the United Nations in 2016, saying: “I love him. I admire him. He is a wonderful young leader of this planet.” Following the accession of President Donald Trump, CNN gushed that “Justin Trudeau, ‘the anti-Trump,’ shows Canada’s progressive, diverse face.” He was seen as the natural successor to Barack Obama, and a champion of modern liberal values.
FEB28	Trump has learnt a valuable lesson - it's better to walk away from a bad deal than be too embarassed to reject it	“Sometimes you have to walk”. Donald Trump’s words – spoken at an afternoon news conference in Hanoi before he boarded Air Force One for his return to Washington – were greeted with relief by some on his national security staff. While many things can be laid at the flamboyant President’s feet, negotiating naively is not one of them. During the summit between the two nations, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, perhaps counting on the domestic pressure created by Michael Cohen’s testimony before Congress, ramped up his demands of the US side. In exchange for the removal of US sanctions, Kim offered to dismantle the North’s nuclear facility at Yongbyon . In practice, he offered a terrible deal, where the US put all of its cards on the table while North Korea continued taking from the pack. Why was this such a bad offer? Because it flouted the “Libya Model” approach proposed by National Security Advisor John Bolton prior to the Singapore Summit last year. Tired of North Korea’s delaying tactics and repeated false-flag negotiations designed to wear the US down, Bolton advocated a robust position that saw maximum rewards for maximum surrender. The only catch? North Korea had to give way first.
FEB28	Is George Eustice a prophet for the coming delay of Brexit?	Thirty four MPs have resigned from Theresa May’s government since the 2017 election, for a variety of noble and embarrassing reasons. The 34th, who quit today, was George Eustice, and he appeared to resign in protest at the Prime Minister’s handling of her own Brexit policy. In his resignation letter, Mr Eustice stated that he’s always been in favour of a compromise, he backed Chequers and he would vote through Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement. But he is concerned that Brexit might be delayed or that a no-deal outcome will be taken off the table, which are things Mrs May has criticised but, of course, has promised MPs a vote on. The situation is surreal. There’s a lot in Mr Eustice’s letter that Mrs May has said herself at one time or another. So why would two people who want the same thing have to part company?
FEB28	Tom Watson has transformed into a voice for reason in Labour. But is the party ready for change?	Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, has lost weight and gained status. Once dismissed as something of a political bruiser, he has transformed himself into a paragon of reason in a party taken over by the hard Left. We have had our differences with Mr Watson over his mercifully unsuccessful efforts to impose restrictions on press freedom but welcome a voice of moderation at the top of the major party of opposition. Mr Watson has taken it upon himself to stand up against the pernicious anti-semitism that has infested the Labour party along with its takeover by the militants of Momentum. After nine MPs walked out last week partly in protest at the failure to eradicate this scourge he assured everyone that the party was listening and would act decisively. Yet the first test was anything but decisive.  Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North and a prominent ally of Jeremy Corbyn, told a Momentum meeting that the party had been too quick to accept the accusations of racism. This angered many moderates who have been desperate to rebuild the party’s image but the party leader let it be known that he did not want Mr Williamson suspended. Only when it became clear this was a PR disaster, was the whip removed from the MP.

FEB28	Letters: Mrs May’s deal is bad and delaying Brexit would just prolong the agony	SIR – It takes two to tango. It has been clear for months that the European Commission is not prepared to dance. We have the Prime Minister’s deal, to which the EU dragged her – no voice, no vote, no veto, no rebate, no trade deal, all at a cost of £39 billion, with nothing in return. Parliament has defeated it by a majority of 230 votes. We have the people’s decision to leave, endorsed by Parliament, with a timetable to boot. 
MAR1	Don't let smears about US farms trap Britain into the EU’s Museum of Agriculture	This week the United States published our objectives for a future trade deal with the UK. We are now ready to negotiate the most ambitious and comprehensive trade deal in the history of our special relationship. And of course we want agriculture to be part of those negotiations – it is a great opportunity for both of us. But the British public has been led to believe otherwise. You have been presented with a false choice: either stick to EU directives, or find yourselves flooded with American food of the lowest quality. Inflammatory and misleading terms like “chlorinated chicken” and “hormone beef” are deployed to cast American farming in the worst possible light. It is time the myths are called out for what they really are: a smear campaign from people with their own protectionist agenda. There is a difference between American and European agriculture. It is not a question of quality but philosophy.
MAR1	Parliament is snuffing out the last Brexit hopes	Inexorably, inescapably, with every turn, in an almost-perfect, reverse-Panglossian circle, we seem to be wending our way into the worst of all possible worlds. Opportunities open up, like glimmers through the trees, and we whip straight past them, further into the woods. Informed observers will argue over what degree the EU was ever likely, in any circumstances, to give Britain a meaningful, last-minute concession on the Irish backstop. But it looks, yet again, like we will never truly test this proposition. Instead, through a remarkable convergence of governmental ineptitude, parliamentary cowardice and anti-democratic skulduggery, we will veer away from this crossroad too. If there really had been an ingenious, illuminati-run conspiracy to thwart Brexit, it could hardly have come up with a set of interlocking circumstances so perfectly calculated to achieve its aims.
MAR1	The EU smells our fear and thinks we are biddable. It's time to walk out of the room	Greenland is not the world's fifth largest economy, nor a member of the G7, nor home to the financial capital of the world. However, they did vote to leave the EU in 1982, they did respect the result of that referendum and they did conclude a withdrawal agreement within two years and then they left.   In 1990 Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union. There was no deal and no agreement, it was even allowed to leave. Its leaders didn't know whether Russian tanks would arrive or not. It took real courage. There was an attempted blockade that folded after a couple of months, there were some skirmishes and tensions, but the other Baltic states followed suit and they never looked back. Why are we finding it so hard to summon the confidence to leave the EU with everything we have going for us? In the country at large, especially outside of London, we see courage in spades. 
MAR1	Sadiq Khan's clampdown on Uber gives a taste of life in Corbyn's cronyist Britain	In recent weeks, London has resounded with the sound of horns as Uber drivers do battle with City Hall. Every Monday, during rush hour, the city’s Uber drivers block off London Bridge. I’ve never been one for protest and I’m sure I’m not the only person who has - pun intended - been driven round the bend by the noise and blocked roads. Yet their anger is completely justified. Uber drivers are furious that the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has decided to charge them - but not their black cab counterparts - a hefty levy for driving their vehicles in his brand new “ultra-low emissions zone”. From next month, they will be charged £12.50 each day to enter the city centre. City Hall spokespeople claim the measure will reduce congestion and protect Londoners from harmful emissions. Fair enough. There is much to be said for easily defined, measurable outcomes. Yet the fact that this charge won’t apply to black cabs is a classic case of cronyism. Mayor Khan is, quite simply, picking winners.
MAR1	You should never trust someone who doesn't read books - just look at Jeremy Corbyn	Jeremy Corbyn never opens a book in anger. When asked how he expected the Leader of the Opposition to react to Dangerous Hero, his damning new biography, author Tom Bowers replied, “Corbyn doesn’t read books, and therefore I have this wonderful feeling that perhaps there won’t be a complaint. The one target, after all these years, who won’t sue me.” Bowers's remarks are as revealing as they are amusing. Corbyn, like so many of his supporters, is a cultural wasteland. No surprises there. And how can you trust anyone who doesn’t read books? Despite an expensive spell at private school, Corbyn, a famously lacklustre student, achieved two Es at A-level and dropped out of his Trade Union Studies degree. Yet the problem is not the lack of formal education – John Major, along with many distinguished figures from politics and literature, didn’t attend university. 
MAR1	Why must MPs like David Lammy inject politics into everything?	One of the most irritating things about the Left is its assumption of bad faith. It spreads ill feeling and injects politics where it’s just not needed. For example, when journalist Stacey Dooley shared some photographs of a visit she paid to Uganda for Comic Relief, the Labour MP David Lammy said: “The world does not need any more white saviours.” Ms Dooley asked if the problem was her skin colour and Mr Lammy, despite having been incredibly personal, replied: “This isn’t personal.” The problem is that the use of “white celebrities” by Comic Relief “sends a distorted image of Africa which perpetuates an old idea from the colonial era”. In fact, Mr Lammy made some good points. Africa does have an expanding middle class; many countries have become freer and richer since the Nineties, and the narrative of “helpless” Africa that sustains the aid industry is misleading and, we might add, helps justify an exorbitant UK foreign aid bill. Nevertheless, Mr Lammy’s suggestion – made in a newspaper article in 2017 – that Red Nose Day be re-calibrated to feature debates about trade, dictatorship and climate change would make an already self-consciously virtuous evening of television downright insufferable. Part of the reason why Comic Relief has raised over £1  billion since it started is that it has tried to balance entertainment with education. How successfully it does so is for the viewer to judge. But it’s doubtful that large numbers will tune in to watch a six hour edition of Question Time.
MAR1	Is George Eustice a prophet for the coming delay of Brexit?	Thirty four MPs have resigned from Theresa May’s government since the 2017 election, for a variety of noble and embarrassing reasons. The 34th, who quit today, was George Eustice, and he appeared to resign in protest at the Prime Minister’s handling of her own Brexit policy. In his resignation letter, Mr Eustice stated that he’s always been in favour of a compromise, he backed Chequers and he would vote through Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement. But he is concerned that Brexit might be delayed or that a no-deal outcome will be taken off the table, which are things Mrs May has criticised but, of course, has promised MPs a vote on. The situation is surreal. There’s a lot in Mr Eustice’s letter that Mrs May has said herself at one time or another. So why would two people who want the same thing have to part company?
MAR1	Tom Watson has transformed into a voice for reason in Labour. But is the party ready for change?	Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, has lost weight and gained status. Once dismissed as something of a political bruiser, he has transformed himself into a paragon of reason in a party taken over by the hard Left. We have had our differences with Mr Watson over his mercifully unsuccessful efforts to impose restrictions on press freedom but welcome a voice of moderation at the top of the major party of opposition. Mr Watson has taken it upon himself to stand up against the pernicious anti-semitism that has infested the Labour party along with its takeover by the militants of Momentum. After nine MPs walked out last week partly in protest at the failure to eradicate this scourge he assured everyone that the party was listening and would act decisively. Yet the first test was anything but decisive.  Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North and a prominent ally of Jeremy Corbyn, told a Momentum meeting that the party had been too quick to accept the accusations of racism. This angered many moderates who have been desperate to rebuild the party’s image but the party leader let it be known that he did not want Mr Williamson suspended. Only when it became clear this was a PR disaster, was the whip removed from the MP.
MAR1	Letters: The Conservatives will be destroyed if they vote for Mrs May's bad deal	SIR – Robert Halfon MP (Commentary, February 28) says that he will support Theresa May’s deal despite its imperfections. He precisely demonstrates why the Conservatives will not destroy Labour, as Allister Heath’s column yesterday suggested. Mrs May’s deal is so bad that it locks us forever into the EU with no say on its decision-making in so many areas (taxation, financial regulation, foreign policy, tariffs, defence, security). How any of our MPs can support this and then proclaim they are being democratic is mind-boggling. The Conservatives will be destroyed long before they can turn their guns on Labour unless there is reconnection of the Parliamentary Conservative Party, the leadership, the members and the voters. 
MAR1	Letters: The Brexit debacle means the death of Conservatism and of trust in the democratic system	SIR – They gave the nation a referendum. The nation voted Leave. They promised to execute the result, and put it in an election manifesto. The nation voted for it again.  But the Parliamentary Conservative Party has another idea. Not to leave.
MAR2	The worst kind of White Saviours take offence on behalf of minorities	Liberals who side with extremists are helping no one If David Lammy is serious about eradicating the scourges of the "White Saviour Complex" from our society, I have the perfect mission for him. The MP has accused TV presenter Stacey Dooley of perpetuating “tired and unhelpful stereotypes” about Africa after she travelled to Uganda for Comic Relief and shared a picture of herself carrying a young child.
MAR2	No self-respecting country would accept this deal. MPs must vote it down	A good Brexit in 2020 is better than a bad one now The deal that will come before Parliament next week represents a devastating failure of British statecraft. It would keep most of the costs of EU membership while junking most of the benefits. It would require Britain to cede part of its territory to foreign jurisdiction. It would allow Brussels to control our commerce with non-EU states even after we leave. MPs who believe in parliamentary sovereignty should vote against it. MPs who believe in the Union should vote against it. MPs who believe in free trade should vote against it. MPs who believe that there is such a thing as national honour, and who recognise that we are being treated in a calculatedly vindictive way, should toss it out with especial force.
MAR2	We promised the voters we would leave - if that means backing Theresa May's Brexit deal for now, so be it	You can’t say I didn’t warn you. This column has been pretty much consistent in its prediction of what was to come – if not particularly consistent in its recommendation of a remedy. And here we are at last, faced with the two ghastly choices: a bad deal or No Brexit. Theresa May’s terrible Withdrawal Agreement looms out of the miasma of confusion and incoherence as the only possible way of avoiding the trap laid long, long ago by the invincibly arrogant Remain forces.  Forget about No Deal: that has been definitively eliminated from the realm of possibility by Mrs May’s decision to let the Commons vote to rule it out. And in the absence of the possibility of leaving without a deal, there is no more scope for serious negotiation. So that’s it – game over. The only question now is how the MPs who will have to vote on these equally horrendous alternatives judge their moral obligations. (I say “moral” because those who are most exercised by this see the question as one of ethical and social significance.) Paradoxically, the Never Leave option – sometimes known as “an extension of Article 50” – could seem, to those who regard their commitment to Brexit as necessitating a purity that can brook no compromise, less wicked than the prime minister’s botched Withdrawal Agreement. Better to give up altogether, or even to precipitate an incalculable breakdown of our political functions, than to accept a messy, self-cancelling mongrel arrangement which delivers so few of the original objectives and which reneges on the true intention of the country’s decision. 
MAR2	China has turned cheating into a national industry	It’s tough climbing the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party, membership: 89 million. One popular way of getting ahead is to get hold of a PhD. Unfortunately, a really ambitious party official can’t always take time out to study. So it’s not unusual to earn one’s doctorate in a topic relevant to party work while also serving as a full-time official. The Chinese are famously hard-working, but nevertheless, there are only so many hours in a day. It’s a tall order to expect a promising vice-mayor in a place like Sichuan, for example, to find time to enrol at Chengdu University and complete a dissertation on “Effective human resource management in Sichuan state-owned enterprises”, or some such, while simultaneously managing a sizeable local budget.
MAR2	Labour can suspend Chris Williamson. But what can they do about all his fans?	All Out War – Tim Shipman’s 2016 book about the raging bin fire that is modern British politics – is full of extraordinary quotes. But the one that really sticks in my mind is the following, from a despairing Labour MP. He or she insisted on anonymity. You’ll see why. “There are always going to be 500,000 people in this country who are off-the-page nuts,” sighed the MP. “The problem we’ve got is that they’ve all joined the Labour party because of Jeremy Corbyn.”  At first glance, you might think: what an awful thing to say. How snobbish. How unfair. 
MAR2	Let's cut down on government-backed student loans	A good idea floating around Whitehall relates to universities: should a government-backed student loan be denied to applicants with bad grades? Obviously, yes. It’s bizarre that they already aren’t. University places are growing out of control and, in their desperate bid to fill them, some institutions are relying heavily on unconditional offers, offering places to students regardless of their suitability for study. Universities are piling up debts, as are the customers; and students who do not meet an income threshold don’t have to pay the money back.
MAR2	Britain doesn't need a new Remain party. Remainers already run the country	Brexit is undeniably in trouble and Parliament is in gridlock. But the Independent Group is an answer that only politicians could dream up: a big dose of elite politics to cure a politics brought low by the elites. Only a politician would say that the solution to a tricky Brexit is to reverse it, or react to Labour’s extremism by jettisoning philosophy altogether. And only a politician would conclude that Britain was happiest under New Labour. In their nostalgic desire to return to the Noughties, when they think politics was blander and thus a bit nicer, members of the Independent Group betray their essential conservatism. This might win them a few votes among the disaffected. Aren’t we all sick of Labour’s class war and anti-Semitism? Or the constant noise of identity politics? But the public will soon see this new group offers nothing new, even in terms of style. Indeed, some of the Independents have been rather vicious about their opponents (Heidi Allen said she wants to destroy the Tories, while Anna Soubry suggested Theresa May is obsessed with immigration). Moreover, this reduction of politics to a search for a managerialist “progressive consensus” results in a vacuum of ideas and principle. Consider the way the Group divvied out its jobs: apparently they stuck Post-it notes on tables and the 11 MPs scribbled their name next to whatever issues concerned them the most. This is not serious politics, and we’re none the wiser as to where each individual will stand on the issues of our time. By the very nature of their coalition and their rejection of doctrine, the Independents proudly lack philosophy.

MAR2	Letters: NHS Continuing Healthcare is surrounded by a box-ticking maze that harms patients	SIR – My husband, aged 80, has atypical Parkinson’s disease. He is chair-bound and can do nothing for himself.  His appeal for NHS Continuing Healthcare has been under way for 15 months. I am a retired GP battling with a terrible system that lets so many people down.  We pay £2,000 a month for carers at home, and I act as a free carer. 
MAR3	Geoffrey Cox faces a mammoth challenge in his legal showdown with the EU	Just a few months ago, few people outside the Bar had heard of Geoffrey Cox QC, a successful barrister who entered Parliament only in 2005. He was appointed Attorney General last year and sprang to prominence as the “warm up” act ahead of Theresa May’s party conference speech. Suddenly, he is the central character in the greatest political drama of modern times. It falls to Mr Cox to decide the fate of Brexit. He has been tasked with persuading the EU to agree to changes to the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement. This would be a significant achievement in itself since Brussels has so far insisted it would not reopen the legal text. Furthermore, it places Mr Cox in the difficult dual role of negotiator and legal arbiter of any bargain that he strikes. As we report today it appears that he has been unsuccessful in getting the EU to agree a time-limit on the backstop.
MAR3	How can we put Bloody Sunday squaddies in the dock for murder, yet tell the IRA they can get away with it?	We cannot yet know for certain whether charges will indeed be brought against the four ex-paras who were at Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. But if it is true – as seems very likely – that on March 14 they are charged with a number of offences, including murder, then I believe there will be a storm of utter fury from the public. And as that storm rages, some objections to the prosecution will be good; some will be frankly less good. It is important, therefore, to focus on what is truly nauseating in this affair. Yes, it is incredible that we are on the verge of putting these old men on trial for crimes that are alleged to have been committed 47 years ago – and yet that is not the worst feature of the business, and certainly no reason, in principle, for stopping the trial. You could point out – and I would agree – that the mere lapse of time should be no protection for anyone guilty of a serious offence. We pursue war criminals to the ends of the earth. Only the other day it was announced that an ex-Labour peer is to appear in court later this month charged for sex offences he is alleged to have committed in the 1970s. I have no idea as to the strength of the case against him – but if he was guilty then he is guilty now. No one should escape justice – where the offence is grave - just because it was all so long ago. And I am afraid that rule must apply to British soldiers as much as to anyone else.
MAR3	Geneva motor show 2019: Can the gloomy car industry survive myriad global challenges?	As we approach the traditionally neutral Swiss extravaganza that is the Geneva motor show, which opens to the press on Tuesday March 5, the spectre of Brexit, deal or no deal, and its effects on the UK motor industry loom large. Roelant de Waard, Ford of Europe’s marketing boss, reckons the paperwork alone for all the parts crossing and re-crossing the Channel in the event of 'no deal' would amount to about an €80 (£70) charge per car. But the question on everybody's lips is whether £61 million of Government support would have changed Honda’s mind about closing its Civic plant in Swindon. For that is the amount of money that business secretary Greg Clark secretly promised to Carlos Ghosn of Nissan if he agreed to produce new versions of the Qashqai and X-Trail SUVs at the firm’s Sunderland plant.
MAR3	We're teaching our children to be self-soothing sissies	I’ve never had much time for the old saw about schooldays being the best days of one’s life – unless one had the good luck to be on the same netball team as Rachel Weisz. But the education system certainly seems to be doing all it can to rebrand itself from rough and ready – embodied by Wackford Squeers of Dotheboys Hall or the pugilistic principal of Madness’s Baggy Trousers who “Sits alone and bends his cane/Same old backsides again” – to caring and sharing. Schoolchildren are being taught mindfulness and meditation, while a primary school in North Yorkshire went the whole hog last week with its Well-Being Day featuring yoga, self-esteem workshops and visualisation exercises during which children learned about “unkind words” using toothpaste. “The children had to squeeze the toothpaste into a bowl,” a teacher enthused. “They were then told that the toothpaste represented unkind words. They then had to try and get all the toothpaste back into the tube. The children realised that it was not possible – that once those unkind words have come out, you can’t take them back, no matter how sorry you are.”
MAR3	Despite what Corbynistas say, when it comes to tax we're more of a Sweden than a Singapore	To listen to Jeremy Corbyn’s fan club, you’d think that Britain was a tax-cutter’s paradise, with the rich and corporations paying a tiny fraction of what they should while public services run to ruin. But when you actually look at Britain’s tax system, you quickly realise that it isn’t true. However much some of us might wish it otherwise, Britain is much more of a Sweden than a Singapore. It’s true that since 2010, the Government has cut some taxes – to great effect. Raising the threshold at which you start paying income tax single-handedly ensured that take‑home pay increased in real terms in recent years, even as real wages shrank. Cutting the corporation tax rate had a galvanising effect on business.
MAR3	Government takes a step in the right direction on non-disclosure agreements	It is welcome news that the Government has pledged to ban those non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that are designed to keep employees from reporting potentially unlawful behaviour to the police. The move comes after an investigation by The Telegraph revealed how Sir Philip Green, the retail tycoon, used NDAs to silence and pay off at least five members of staff who accused him of sexual harassment and racism. Nazir Afzal, the former Chief Prosecutor in North West England, has said that some of the allegations were, on the face of it, “clearly” of a criminal nature, and the Metropolitan Police are “looking into” allegations reported to them by a Labour MP.

MAR3	Letters: Prosecuting ex-soldiers who served during the Northern Ireland Troubles is biased and unjust	SIR – We write to express our dismay at the prospect of former soldiers being charged with murder arising out of the Northern Ireland Troubles. We believe this is totally unjust and a betrayal of those men, many of whom are now in their twilight years, who served the Crown in the Troubles where the enemy wore no identifying uniform and mingled with the crowd. In January 2017, the Prime Minister stated that: “The Government has always acknowledged an ongoing duty of care to former soldiers.” Yet that duty seems only to extend to the provision of legal help. The Prime Minister also admitted that “there is an imbalance in the investigations and cases relating to the Troubles”, with legacy-related cases almost exclusively focusing on the military and police, “while many hundreds of unsolved terrorist murders are left uninvestigated”. But while the forces of the Crown maintain records, the IRA has none, so this imbalance can never be rectified. 
MAR3	Letters: Enthusiasts for the HS2 project would do well to learn from history	SIR – Although it occurred 200 years earlier than the troubled high-speed route to Birmingham and the “Powerhouse” of the North (Letters, February 24), the story of the Caledonian Canal project and its similarities with HS2 deserve to be explored in full. At the turn of the 19th century the great civil engineer and architect Thomas Telford was commissioned by the government to build a waterway along the Great Glen, from Fort William to Inverness. The object was to create a link that would save a 300-mile voyage around the tempestuous seas of the Pentland Firth, while bringing prosperity to the Highlands of Scotland through trade. In today’s terms the HS2 project has very similar objectives. However, despite the best efforts of Telford and his sub-contractors, the costs far exceeded the estimates and the completed canal was delivered several years late. In an attempt to save on costs the original depth of the canal was reduced, as was its width, which meant only smaller vessels could actually use it. The demand for trade and the passage of goods was significantly less than had been hoped for, particularly as the tolls to use the canal were very high.
MAR4	If the Conservatives aren’t careful, their next leader could be their last	The thought of who might be the next leader of their party is never too far from a politician’s mind, particularly if the person doing the thinking has any chance of being elected to that position. Yet in the days of Thatcher, Wilson or Blair, this could only be a fanciful daydream as the incumbent leaders went on and on, seemingly for a political lifetime.  Today, by contrast, an aspiring leader in any of Britain’s main parties can live in a state of permanent and anxious expectation. All the leaders are in trouble, or have said they are going before long. Anybody can be elected, and Jeremy Corbyn has proved it. If you think you have the answer to all the nation’s problems, you can be fairly confident that you will soon be asked the question. Vince Cable has said he is standing down once Brexit “is resolved or stopped”. Theresa May has pledged to resign before the next general election. Corbyn himself shows no sign of departing, but if the next election is not until 2022 he would be plagued by questions about whether he could serve a five-year term to the age of 77. By historical standards, the collective political life expectancy of today’s party leaders is unusually short. 
MAR4	No energy drinks till you're 18, no smoking before 21: our nanny state won't let youngsters act like grown ups	Gone are the halcyon days of puffing away behind the bike sheds in sixth form. Ministers are reportedly considering raising the legal smoking age from 18 to 21 following the release of a report by a cross-party group of MPs. Reading their recommendations, you’d be forgiven for thinking they were seeking to protect winsome 12-year-olds from the dangers of tobacco. Except these young people are not children. A 20-year-old is meant to be an adult. But in recent years, a series of legal changes has raised the age at which adulthood kicks in. Students can no longer leave school at 16 without taking on part-time education or an apprenticeship, and are often barred from jobs that were once staples of teen employment, such as bartending. Supermarkets have banned the sale of energy drinks to under-16s, and there is talk of extending these restrictions to adulthood.
MAR4	We can end this terrible epidemic of knife killings, but not with so few police officers	As the knife crime crisis continues to spiral – with the latest victims including a 17 year old girl in Essex, and a 17 year old boy in Cheshire – there can no longer be any pretending that this is just a “London problem”. As the chair of the West Midlands Police Federation, I have seen first-hand how knife crime is gripping places like Birmingham. Last week in the city, three teenage boys were stabbed to death within days of each other. Our response cannot be half-hearted. That is why, in Birmingham, we have implemented so-called Section 60 powers, which enable us to increase the numbers we stop and search by allowing us to do so “without reasonable grounds”. And the impact has been tangible. The feeling among officers is that the operation is paying dividends across the city. Members of the public have been approaching my colleagues to praise what they see as welcome respite from what too often can be an aggressive atmosphere. Arrests are up and dangerous weapons have been removed from the streets. For too long police have been absent from the streets in any numbers, and this has encouraged a sense of licence among those carrying knives, whatever their initial motivation to do so.
MAR4	How Meghan's arrival cheered Prince Charles after years of public anguish and simmering family tensions	It was undoubtedly the royal family photo of the year. Capturing a beaming Prince Charles on his 70th birthday last November with his eldest grandchild Prince George on his knee, the endearing image of the future king surrounded by his nearest and dearest gave a touching insight into close bond between three generations of royalty. On Tuesday, the heir to the throne will once again be flanked by his beloved wife Camilla, his sons William and Harry and his daughters-in-law Kate and Meghan as the Queen hosts a lunch reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the 50th anniversary of Charles’s investiture as the Prince of Wales. Marking her eldest son’s half century of service to Wales, the UK and the Commonwealth, the event will celebrate a range of Welsh charities, organisations and businesses and feature a performance by the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, of which Charles is patron.
MAR4	Tory MPs must vote down any deal that fails to deliver a proper Brexit or the people will never forgive us	We are about to witness some of the most important political decisions certainly of our lifetimes and most probably since the fateful year of 1940. While it was the clear mandate of the country to simply leave the EU (the referendum question never mentioned a deal) and two-thirds of UK and three-quarters of English and Welsh constituencies voted for this, there are a majority of MPs in Parliament who are determined to frustrate this outcome.  Parliament has stripped the Government of its remaining negotiating lever, the determination to choose no deal rather than a bad deal and, as a consequence, Brexit-supporting MPs are now left with an apparently invidious choice between voting for the Prime Minister's deal, with or without Cox’s so-called “codpiece”,  (a codicil suggesting an end date to the fabled “backstop”) or facing the likelihood of an extension of Article 50. This is not to say of course that Number 10 isn’t delighted with this outcome having regard to their determination for a “close and special relationship” ie not leaving.

But the Independent Group is an answer that only politicians could dream up: a big dose of elite politics to cure a politics brought low by the elites. Only a politician would say that the solution to a tricky Brexit is to reverse it, or react to Labour’s extremism by jettisoning philosophy altogether. And only a politician would conclude that Britain was happiest under New Labour. In their nostalgic desire to return to the Noughties, when they think politics was blander and thus a bit nicer, members of the Independent Group betray their essential conservatism. This might win them a few votes among the disaffected. Aren’t we all sick of Labour’s class war and anti-Semitism? Or the constant noise of identity politics? But the public will soon see this new group offers nothing new, even in terms of style. Indeed, some of the Independents have been rather vicious about their opponents (Heidi Allen said she wants to destroy the Tories, while Anna Soubry suggested Theresa May is obsessed with immigration). Moreover, this reduction of politics to a search for a managerialist “progressive consensus” results in a vacuum of ideas and principle. Consider the way the Group divvied out its jobs: apparently they stuck Post-it notes on tables and the 11 MPs scribbled their name next to whatever issues concerned them the most. This is not serious politics, and we’re none the wiser as to where each individual will stand on the issues of our time. By the very nature of their coalition and their rejection of doctrine, the Independents proudly lack philosophy.
MAR4	Letters: Obstacles to stop-and-search have resulted in the rise in knife crime	SIR – With the recent horrific incidents of knife crime, it’s time to compare the numbers with the level of stop-and-search activity by the police over the last few years.  Since the Home Office bowed to political pressure and introduced measures to make it more difficult and time-consuming to carry out stop-and-search, the message to would-be knife carriers has been clear. Not only are gang members carrying knives to enforce their will, but others are also carrying knives to “protect” themselves.
MAR4	Letters: Prosecuting ex-soldiers who served during the Northern Ireland Troubles is biased and unjust	SIR – We write to express our dismay at the prospect of former soldiers being charged with murder arising out of the Northern Ireland Troubles. We believe this is totally unjust and a betrayal of those men, many of whom are now in their twilight years, who served the Crown in the Troubles where the enemy wore no identifying uniform and mingled with the crowd. In January 2017, the Prime Minister stated that: “The Government has always acknowledged an ongoing duty of care to former soldiers.” Yet that duty seems only to extend to the provision of legal help. The Prime Minister also admitted that “there is an imbalance in the investigations and cases relating to the Troubles”, with legacy-related cases almost exclusively focusing on the military and police, “while many hundreds of unsolved terrorist murders are left uninvestigated”. But while the forces of the Crown maintain records, the IRA has none, so this imbalance can never be rectified. 
MAR5	We must give police more powers to fight the knife crime disease infecting our young people	Another two teenagers were brutally stabbed to death on the streets of the UK on the first weekend of March. Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney are the latest victims in a cycle of senseless bloodshed that is robbing young people of their lives and futures up and down the UK. What’s clear is that one fatal stabbing is one too many. It cannot and must not go on. I fully understand people’s fears and concerns. Among proposed solutions have been calls to treat the rising levels of crime as a national emergency. But I want to assure people that I have been treating this as an absolute priority since taking the job as Home Secretary. I will not hide away from this critical issue and have been doing everything in my power to ensure we have the strongest possible response in place. But the recent horrific stabbings in Birmingham, Manchester and London are a stark reminder that there is so much more to do.
MAR5	Knife crime is now a national emergency – how long must we wait for the fightback to begin?	My son was heading for Manchester at the weekend, and I sent him off with even more dire warnings than usual. “Don’t get in a fight, OK? Hand over your phone. No, that doesn’t matter. Don’t argue with me. Just run.” He responded to my obvious anxiety with the testy impatience of any teenage boy who knows for a fact that a) mothers are annoying, and b) he is immortal. What’s the point? What’s the point of telling him not to get into a fight? You don’t need a fight to get killed anymore. Jodie Chesney didn’t provoke anyone. The 17-year-old Explorer Scout was just sitting on a bench in a playground with her boyfriend when she was stabbed in the back. Horrifyingly, there doesn’t even seem to be a motive for the attack. There is speculation it was an initiation, a macabre auditon for gang membership by two youths who were seen fleeing the scene. How are we supposed to protect our children against such motiveless malignity? Jodie was a good kid, a bit old-fashioned even. In November, she was pictured standing smartly to attention at the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall. A tearful friend called her “the nicest, loveliest, kindest person you could meet with everything to look forward to in life”.
MAR5	Why is it that only Left-wingers can enjoy the privilege of double standards?	Tony Benn’s papers are en route to the British Library, knocking some 200 grand from his family’s inheritance tax bill. To be fair, Tony (an advocate of make ’em bleed taxation for the rich) could well be achieving a remarkable torque rate in his grave in rage at his family’s actions. Nevertheless, it is amusing how often principles are set aside by mouthy Left-wingers, and how the luxury of double standards cannot be resisted, especially when it makes life so much more agreeable. Like Bono, you can preach globally about social justice and the environment, while making sure the Lithuanian shopping centre you once invested in is getting you the best tax breaks and your private jet is on standby.
MAR5	Dear Mr Macron, your arrogance will only make Europe’s problems worse	Cher President Macron, It’s kind of you to write, especially when you’ve had so much going on at home recently. I share many of your concerns about Europe’s future, but we disagree profoundly about some of the causes of Europe’s problems and the right solutions to them. At the start of your letter, you launch a bitter attack on Brexit. But perhaps it would be worth reflecting more on why the Continent’s second biggest economy (yep, sorry), and one of Europe’s most innovative, tolerant and diverse societies chose to leave.
MAR5	Thank goodness for the power to recall jailed MPs like Fiona Onasanya	Fiona Onasanya will, after all, face attempts to recall her as Peterborough’s MP following her failed attempt to overturn her conviction for perverting the course of justice. Judges ruled today that the conviction, for which the MP was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment (and served four weeks), stands. It now falls to the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, to notify the Petitions Officer in Peterborough (who is the Returning Officer, acting in a separate role) to begin the process of alerting local voters that a recall petition is open. If, in the following six weeks, more than 10 per cent of the total electorate – just over 7,000 in Peterborough’s case – add their names, then a by-election will be held. The fun and games will really start if Onasanya chooses, as is her right, to stand as a candidate in that contest, though few would rate her chances in the circumstances.
MAR5	Rather than bung cash to left behind areas, we should use the opportunity of Brexit to let them thrive	A key factor behind the vote to leave the EU was a perceived grievance among people in some parts of the country that they had been left behind by the globalist advances that had benefited places like London. Whereas the capital voted heavily to Remain, many northern towns and cities saw the highest levels of support for Brexit. This cannot be explained solely by concerns over EU immigration since in some of these areas it is low. Moreover, immigration is highest in London. So identifying the causes of popular disgruntlement and seeking to address them is a legitimate ambition of government, even an obligation. How to do this, however, is a political question. The Left would be inclined to pump money into deprived areas paid for by higher contributions from the better off. The Conservative approach should be to encourage places down on their luck because of a historic decline in manufacturing and heavy industry to diversify and create their own wealth. The Northern Powerhouse idea fostered by former chancellor George Osborne falls into this category.
MAR5	There's no point having more police officers if they are not being properly utilised	Lord Hogan-Howe, the former commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, had some harsh words for Government ministers yesterday over the rise in violent offending. They had failed to get a grip on knife crime and should appoint a “tsar” to provide the leadership necessary to ensure the epidemic was properly dealt with. “If it’s not treated as a crisis, it will take another two years before we see action,” he said. Lord Hogan-Howe also proposed that an additional £1 billion to be spent on policing should go specifically to recruiting extra officers.
MAR5	Government takes a step in the right direction on non-disclosure agreements	It is welcome news that the Government has pledged to ban those non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that are designed to keep employees from reporting potentially unlawful behaviour to the police. The move comes after an investigation by The Telegraph revealed how Sir Philip Green, the retail tycoon, used NDAs to silence and pay off at least five members of staff who accused him of sexual harassment and racism. Nazir Afzal, the former Chief Prosecutor in North West England, has said that some of the allegations were, on the face of it, “clearly” of a criminal nature, and the Metropolitan Police are “looking into” allegations reported to them by a Labour MP.
MAR5	Letters: Why is it impossible to search a sector connected with knife crime?	SIR– How did we arrive at the situation where it would seem radical to stop and search young black men in order to curtail knife crime? As is widely proven and reported, however uncomfortable that is, knife crime is predominantly committed by offenders fitting this description. We don’t need Section 60 powers, or indeed any new legislation – just the political will to allow street policemen to do their job and actively target those whom we know full well are bent on ruining society in this way.
MAR5	Letters: Obstacles to stop-and-search have resulted in the rise in knife crime	SIR – With the recent horrific incidents of knife crime, it’s time to compare the numbers with the level of stop-and-search activity by the police over the last few years.  Since the Home Office bowed to political pressure and introduced measures to make it more difficult and time-consuming to carry out stop-and-search, the message to would-be knife carriers has been clear.

MAR6	British schoolchildren don't need a better curriculum – they need better parenting	This week saw a group of well-intentioned academics and experts seek to pressurise the Government to create a GCSE in Natural History and for this to be taught as a subject in all schools. The idea, supported by the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, is of course exemplary. All children should know and care about the natural world – particularly our native birds, trees, and flowers – and its importance is  as undeniable as the value of mother’s love or apple pie. The problem is that this latest lobby group is asking that a child does not learn mother’s love from the mother, but rather from the school. It is part of a wider trend to grossly overburden the school curriculum.
MAR6	Workers' rights were won in Westminster, not Brussels. So why is Labour spreading fake news?	As Theresa May seeks to win the support of Labour MPs by reinventing herself and her government as unlikely champions of workers’ rights, the time has come, once more, for a history lesson. The Labour Party, at least before its current iteration led by Jeremy Corbyn, has long been seen as unashamedly pro-EU. The Conservatives, meanwhile, have pursued their time-honoured tradition of sacrificing leader after leader to internal battles over EU membership. Yet you don’t have to go back too far to find a time when Labour was equally divided over the Europe. Only one major party, after all, has ever gone into a general election promising to withdraw from the European Project - the EEC as it was in 1983 - and it wasn’t the Conservatives.
MAR6	There are plenty of savings schools can make before they start begging parents for cash	Whether it’s schools asking families for stationery or cash, headteachers shortening the school week, or union-backed petitions forcing MPs to debate the issue, in recent days there's been no shortage of people complaining about the underfunding of education. The Government, predictably, takes issue with this. It says that there has never been more money in schools and that funding is more fairly distributed than ever before. But who's right? I was a teacher in state schools for 15 years, and spent the last five of those running a small secondary in Bedford, a low-funded area. I fully appreciate the challenges heads face, but I have been worried for some time now that people aren’t getting the full picture from what has become an increasingly rancorous debate. The truth is that both sides have a point. School budgets have gone up, although the school population has gone up even more meaning the amount per pupil has dropped since 2015. Funding for children over the age of 16 or for those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) has faced additional challenges, so schools with sixth forms and lots of pupils with SEND have been hit harder than average.
MAR6	Is Theresa May condemned to the most wretched legacy in British political history?	Theresa May has always wanted to make history. As a Geography student at Oxford she once casually informed fellow scholars over breakfast of her intention to lead the Conservative Party. And when Margaret Thatcher beat her to become the first British female Prime Minister in 1979, her response was reportedly stark and morose: "She got there first."  Even as the scaffolding collapses around her slipshod Brexit deal, one can still see flashes of Mrs May’s hunger for a legacy. This week, as the country shuddered with horror over soaring knife crime, she took to the air waves and in her usual over-precise, slightly metallic way, insisted there was no link between police cuts and rising crime. This despite her own Home Secretary Sajid Javid and police chiefs contradicting her. It reveals Theresa May’s instinct to defiantly defend her record, even when she looks sure to lose the argument; the country overwhelmingly seems to view Mrs May's acquiescence – when she was home secretary in 2010 – to a Treasury demand to cut police budgets by 18 per cent, and her curtailment of stop and search, as serious errors. (Perhaps she should have taken a leaf out of her female predecessor's book - even in the deepest doldrums of recession in the early 1980s, Margaret Thatcher ring-fenced police funding, knowing that if she didn’t it could severely damage the Tories’ record as the party of law and order.)
MAR6	Theresa May will soon have to decide if she is serious that 'no deal is better than a bad deal'	Theresa May has come out with many mantras in her mission to ensure that, as she put it, "Brexit means Brexit". Undoubtedly the most significant has to be her insistence that "no deal is better than a bad deal".   That slogan made its way into the Conservative Party's 2017 election manifesto, a sign that she wanted to bind fellow Tories into this. Whenever Brexiteers feared that the Prime Minister was giving too much away in the negotiations, she would comfort them by repeating that mantra, leading them to believe that she would prefer to walk away rather than sign away too much.
MAR6	There's no point having more police officers if they are not being properly utilised	Lord Hogan-Howe, the former commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, had some harsh words for Government ministers yesterday over the rise in violent offending.

MAR7	Nicola Sturgeon arrives home to a furious internal row over indyref2	When Nicola Sturgeon and her seven strong entourage recently arrived back from their trip to Canada and the USA they would have expected a row about the cost of what was little more than a jolly. After all, that’s par for the course when politicians take to their club class seats ( the minions did go steerage), when there’s not really a rock-solid reason for their trip. And sure enough, what was the point of the £44,000 that the trip cost the taxpayer - British and Scottish - in hotels, air fares and things like “subsistence” for the First Minister’s transatlantic mission? It wasn’t as if she met anyone of significance, at least on the highest international level. In both Canada and the USA, Messrs Trudeau and Trump had other things on their mind. So, was it all about selling Scotland and its products to major markets, or just about Ms Sturgeon seeking to emulate Alex Salmond, her predecessor, who was determined to get an independent Scotland a seat at the top table, and to persuade the Scottish electorate that she’s recognised as a world figure.
MAR7	Is Philip Hammond's plan to thwart Brexit about to reach fruition?	Had Brexit gone to plan, Philip Hammond’s Spring Statement next week would have been a dazzling manifesto for a no-deal Brexit. As Chancellor, it’s his job to give the Prime Minister options. She could sign a deal, if the EU made an offer that Parliament was able to accept – but if not, the government’s official policy is to leave without a deal. Mr Hammond could then spell out what that would mean: becoming a low-tax competitor to the EU, for example, specialising in low tariffs and global free trade. And if the EU didn’t like the sound of all that – well, it was free to offer Britain a more attractive alternative. But Hammond has always regarded Brexit as a disaster – and a no-deal Brexit as the worst outcome of all. He still sees the Cabinet as being a fight between Remainers and Brexiteers and lets this slip now and again: only yesterday, he referred to his opponents in “the Brexit wing of the party.” Rather than make no-deal sound viable, he wishes to make it sound a terrifying act of national self-harm. A few horrifying Treasury “scenarios” would do the job nicely – and the Prime Minister would have no choice but to sign whatever deal the EU offered. Had Mrs May won a majority in her election she would have celebrated by sacking Mr Hammond, something she allowed to become an open secret. He would have been tied to Sajid Javid and defenestrated, a punishment for messing up his first Budget and a warning to other ministers who might defy her. His survival was a signal to everyone that she no longer felt strong enough to sack anyone – so anyone could get away with anything. Mr Hammond has used this freedom with frustrating brilliance.
MAR7	Sadiq Khan should stop playing politics and take responsibility for stopping knife crime in London	Yesterday, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, decided for political reasons to pin the blame for the tragic rise in violent crime on the Government’s schools policy. Mr Khan is in charge of the Metropolitan Police, with the power in his hands to help put a stop to the murders on his city’s streets. Surely he would want to take responsibility? Apparently not. Instead of engaging constructively with the issues, the Mayor instead prefers to play party political games. The current spate of knife murders didn’t come from nowhere. Nor should the solutions be a mystery. A decade ago the think tank I founded set up a programme to investigate violence prevention strategies. Its researchers went to America and looked at Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Boston and even New York before coming back to examine Glasgow and Liverpool. They found the cities that have successfully controlled their levels of gang activity, and thus violence and violent crime, have all employed a two-pronged approach. First, policing needs to be robust, effective and well co-ordinated. Second, the younger members of gangs need to be stripped out through remedial support. While Mr Khan seems happy to pay lip service to what needs to be done, he has done very little to actually tackle knife crime on the front line.
MAR7	Will Tory MPs be satisfied by what's inside Geoffrey Cox's codpiece?	Geoffrey Cox titillated the House of Commons this morning by acknowledging “Cox’s codpiece”, the moniker Brexiteers have been using to refer to the changes to the backstop they fear will amount to a glamourised fig leaf.  The Attorney General told MPs that his mission was to ensure "that what is inside the codpiece is in full working order". Senior Tory ERGer Mark Francois carried on this theme by chiding him for being in charge of assessing the legal significance of whatever he ends up negotiating, quipping he would end up “examining his own codpiece” in front of MPs. "It is said codpieces were developed either to facilitate greater freedom of movement from highly restrictive hosiery or to hide venereal disease," one senior Tory Eurosceptic observed to me. "I sincerely hope Cox’s is more of the former than the latter!"
MAR7	From Trudeau to Macron, the Left's virtue-signalling demigods are falling to earth	When Justin Trudeau became Canada’s Prime Minister four years ago, progressive men and women around the world swooned with pleasure. The 43-year-old son of Pierre Trudeau, Canada’s longest-serving Prime Minister, Justin was a left-wing dauphin. In addition to being the leader of the Liberal Party – Canada’s equivalent of Labour – he was good-looking, tattooed, pro-immigration and had worked as a bungee-jumping coach before going into politics. He was like a woke version of Tony Blair, except with better hair. Imagine the gnashing and wailing of teeth, then, when his premiership became engulfed in a corruption scandal last month following the resignation of Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s first indigenous Attorney-General. She claims Trudeau pressured her to cut a deal with one of Canada’s largest companies, SNC Lavalin, which is facing bribery charges. It employs 15,000 people in Quebec – a key state the Liberals need to win at the forthcoming General Election – and Trudeau was reportedly worried about the impact a public trial would have on his Party’s electoral prospects. In another unfortunate twist, it transpires that Trudeau demoted Wilson-Raybould to Minister of Veterans Affairs when she refused to do his bidding – presumably because he thought it would look bad if he fired a woman from his Government – and it was that public humiliation which prompted her resignation.
MAR7	MPs need to know the government's plans for a no-deal Brexit	In 23 days’ time, the UK is due to leave the European Union. Judging by the logjam in talks over possible changes to the Withdrawal Agreement aimed at securing its support in Parliament, if we do leave on that date it will be without a deal. Geoffrey Cox QC, the Attorney General, has so far failed to secure the EU’s agreement to reopen the legal text of the draft treaty to accommodate objections to the current Irish “backstop” proposal. Without such undertakings, the chances of Theresa May’s deal getting through the Commons at its second attempt next Tuesday must be vanishingly small. The likelihood must be that MPs will then vote to halt departure on March 29, pending an extension of the UK’s membership. But this is not certain: the default position remains that we leave on March 29, since this date is currently written into law.
MAR7	Small businesses just aren't ready for the Government's botched digital tax reforms	From next month, small businesses with a turnover above £85,000 a year are required to complete their VAT returns digitally. This has been a long time coming, but few knew about it and not many are ready. Indeed, why should they be? Is it necessary? There is a view in government that attaching the word “digital” to anything makes it progressive, modern and therefore imperative. Yet the move to digital tax returns has been undertaken to satisfy HM Revenue and Customs, not small enterprises, nearly two million of which still file returns manually. This trend to push all government business online has been forced on the country, like it or not. Many of the groups most likely to interact with state agencies, such as the elderly and the vulnerable, do not even use the internet.
MAR7	Abolishing juries in rape trials would be a recipe for injustice	The attempts to skew the criminal justice system so that a greater number of defendants in rape cases are found guilty continue apace. As we report today, a new review being established by the Government might even consider scrapping trial by jury and introducing tougher rules of consent. Such an approach merely opens up the prospect of even greater injustices both to alleged perpetrators and victims. Juries are there to establish whether the evidence exists to convict beyond reasonable doubt. Rape is one of the most serious crimes and rightly carries a heavy sentence on conviction. That is one reason why many juries in so-called “date” rape cases decline to find defendants guilty because they do not consider that the right charge has been brought. The law is trying to find a single template for myriad social interactions that 12 men and women sitting on a jury panel can understand. Various collapsed trials have shown that consent is not a simple issue however much the law is tweaked.
MAR7	Letters: The shameful link between middle-class drug use and knife crime	SIR – Nick Timothy neglects to mention how much the demand for drugs drives knife attacks. Commentators tend to focus on supply, but the growth of demand among the professional classes is a worrying trend. Do these people not recognise that they are as responsible for the violent crime associated with the drugs trade as a street addict? We need to stop turning a blind eye to middle-class drug use, which should have the same stigma attached to it as drink driving. It is time to name and shame.
MAR7	Letters: Offences of carrying a knife should be tried by judges not magistrates	SIR – I suggest it is time to make carrying a knife in public an indictable only offence. This would ensure it is tried by a judge and not a magistrate.  Some of the reported sentences passed by magistrates appear unduly lenient, especially for repeat offenders who ought to receive a sentence of imprisonment (even if suspended for special reasons). A firm sentence policy will hopefully show that society is serious about addressing the current rash of stabbings, usually of young people by young people.
MAR8	You need to be relentless to crack down on violent crime	Fourteen years ago, on the day I stepped down as Home Secretary, we held a round table on the growing problem of knife crime. The issue was rightly in the public eye, but we had learnt lessons from two previous surges of criminality. The first of these was an upsurge in street crime involving muggings, theft and sometimes worrying violence. The second, and more serious, was a big rise in the use of guns, mainly associated with drug gangs. We were successful in dealing with these challenges because we not only put immediate extra resources at the disposal of the police, but drew together, on a regular basis, all the agencies involved in tackling this scourge. That meant a fortnightly round table in Downing Street, where people got the message that, from the Prime Minister downwards, there was a determination to take practical steps and also to send very clear messages that we were not going to tolerate this. The process involved everyone. We talked and listened to head teachers, who were in the centre of communities most affected. We required schools to install metal detectors and, with the help of neighbourhood policing, to supervise children on their way home. We appealed to magistrates and district judges to send out the right signals by providing the maximum sentences for those carrying knives (and guns). The Crown Prosecution Service took the risk of going through with prosecutions, even when a neighbourhood remained silent. And church leaders and youth workers worked with families, helping turn around the behaviour of those who could so often be clearly identified before the calamity occurred.
MAR8	No, Labour isn't a family. It's a rotting institution	If a teenage girl told you she would “rather die” than switch from being a Beyonce fan to a Rihanna fan, you would probably take her declaration with a little pinch of salt. This silly girl will calm down in a few years, you’d think, and you’d probably be right. Unless, instead, she joined the Labour Party. The Labour Party, you see, is an institution whose members are meant to be committed until death, and preferably beyond. As Emily Thornberry, its fully grown shadow foreign secretary, declared recently: “We are Labour to our core and we are Labour to the tips of our fingerprints and we would rather die than join any other party.” Having whipped up her audience, Ms Thornberry then paused to admonish a supporter who was being rude about the eight MPs who had split from the party. “Be civil,” she said. “Be civil.”
MAR8	The deal is still bad, and there is no reason for Brexiteers to compromise now	Readers will probably remember the notorious Farage poster “Breaking Point” during the 2016 referendum campaign. It showed a winding queue of dark-skinned refugees/immigrants. This week, the “People’s Vote” campaign (an organisation 100 per cent devoted to frustrating what the people voted for) produced an amusing parody. The words “Breaking Point” stay, but the faces at the front of the queue now consist of what the poster calls “the Brexit elites” who have “failed us all”: “The UK is being swamped by a tide of incompetents.” Eager to discover who these “Brexit elites” might be, I identified, in the front rows, such luminaries as Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg (in a top hat) and Rupert Murdoch. The rows behind, however, contained several people whom I failed to recognise at all, although after a bit I realised that one of them was me. At the very back were some famous foreigners – Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Geert Wilders. Even more surprising were two other front-row faces – Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, and Theresa May, the Prime Minister. Both of them are Remainers, and therefore in the wrong poster.
MAR8	Why we should all embrace the glorious comeback of the afternoon nap	Forty winks, it used to be called. Probably still is, by people who clean their shoes every day or take a “heart-warmer” in the pub. Or, should you prefer, it’s an old-fashioned nap, favoured by begowned schoolmasters as their pupils get on with the glorious business of translating Latin verses in the hour before lunch. ‘Troiani laeti sunt...’ Churchill napped while helping to keep us all free. Wagner closed his eyes as he plotted the twilight of the Gods. Gibbon nodded off as he pondered the fall of Rome. So those who favour a spot of shut-eye around the lunch hour are keeping the best of company. Greek doctors have now “revealed” what non-medics have known since men crawled out of the swamp: a nap does you good.
MAR8	Airbnb's move into hotels is smart. The age-old industry is far from done	As Airbnb continues its meteoric rise, its further expansion into hotels with the acquisition of last-minute booking app HotelTonight is a smart one. What started ten years ago as a means of finding cheap lodgings for business networkers in San Francisco has become one of the travel industry’s most profitable unicorns. The Airbnb online platform now has 6m lodgings in 81,000 cities across the world, ranging from homeowners offering a spare room to entire cottages available to rent. The company was valued at $31bn (£24bn) at its last funding round in 2017. You can see why the idea of enabling hosts to advertise their lodgings on such a centralised platform has disrupted the travel industry so much. If I look now, I can find a perfectly serviceable looking bunk-bed near Tokyo’s shopping district of Shibuya for less than £50 a night, should I wish to further indulge my love of karaoke, Tonkatsu and banana cake.
MAR8	The Conservative Party has lost the plot on crime	When interrogated by an interviewer on knife crime in the Capital, London Mayor Sadiq Khan rolled his eyes and said he’d done all that he can. Well, he could try redirecting some more money towards policing. Since taking office, there's been a 27 per cent increase in City Hall bureaucrats and the wage bill for his own office has risen by £2.2 million. This is typical of an administration under which Transport for London is heading for a deficit of £1 billion and the Crossrail project is running late via emergency loans. As for crime, there have been 21 murders in the capital this year. Mr Khan has done all he can to pass the buck. "Blame the Tories" seems to be the argument. On the Today programme, he implied that one source of the problem is school expulsions: many of England's schools are now academies and are free to expel, whereas in Glasgow the local authorities remain in control and only one child was expelled in 2017 – a triumph, apparently. But does Mr Khan not know that performance in Scottish schools has declined?
MAR8	Creating a level playing field for female entrepreneurs would add billions to the UK economy	A year ago, the Telegraph launched its Women in Business campaign aimed at encouraging the development of policies designed to help female entrepreneurs. It was supported by business leaders, MPs and academics concerned that a great opportunity for British economic advancement was being missed.  Figures show one in eight working women wanted to start their own business yet less than 10 per cent of start-up funding went to women. Men are far more likely to be funded by venture capital and to secure angel investment. Women entrepreneurs, on average, have lower loan approval rates than men and can be charged higher interest rates.  Cut off from access to traditional funding, many rely on alternative sources such as crowdfunding, personal cash and credit for growth. This means the British economy is losing billions in potential income, a shortfall it can ill afford at the best of times and especially on the cusp of Brexit. 
MAR8	MPs need to know the government's plans for a no-deal Brexit	In 23 days’ time, the UK is due to leave the European Union. Judging by the logjam in talks over possible changes to the Withdrawal Agreement aimed at securing its support in Parliament, if we do leave on that date it will be without a deal. Geoffrey Cox QC, the Attorney General, has so far failed to secure the EU’s agreement to reopen the legal text of the draft treaty to accommodate objections to the current Irish “backstop” proposal. Without such undertakings, the chances of Theresa May’s deal getting through the Commons at its second attempt next Tuesday must be vanishingly small. The likelihood must be that MPs will then vote to halt departure on March 29, pending an extension of the UK’s membership. But this is not certain: the default position remains that we leave on March 29, since this date is currently written into law.
MAR8	Letters: A bungling Parliament will damage Britain by voting against no-deal	SIR – The next parliamentary vote in the coming week will be on whether to accept the shameful Withdrawal Agreement, along with its useless Political Declaration. It makes a laughing stock of our sovereignty, and should be howled down, since it may tie us into the EU for ever. (Can no one in Government understand that the EU’s “best endeavours” to reach an amicable exit for the UK will always result in “regrettable” failure?) Parliament then moves to a vote on whether it will accept a no-deal Brexit. Good luck with that, Brexiteers, given the pro-EU leanings of too many of our elected representatives, who are not remotely interested in the democratic wishes of the electorate. No-deal will be emphatically and idiotically thrown out, leaving us at the mercy of EU negotiators and facing the indignity of an extension of Article 50, possibly far into the future.
MAR8	Letters: The shameful link between middle-class drug use and knife crime	SIR – Nick Timothy neglects to mention how much the demand for drugs drives knife attacks. Commentators tend to focus on supply, but the growth of demand among the professional classes is a worrying trend. Do these people not recognise that they are as responsible for the violent crime associated with the drugs trade as a street addict? We need to stop turning a blind eye to middle-class drug use, which should have the same stigma attached to it as drink driving. It is time to name and shame.
MAR9	Tories need a new blueprint for a society that gives all children the chance to succeed	Leaving the EU presents economic opportunities and challenges. But what about our vision for a fairer society in post-Brexit Britain? As Conservatives, we need an optimistic agenda for reform, to give every child – whatever their start in life – the opportunity to reach their potential. My father came to the UK, in 1938, as a refugee with no English. This country offered him the chance, through a grammar school and a great job at Marks and Spencer, to get on in life. For young people growing up in this country in the aftermath of the Second World War, that story of social mobility was common in Britain. Now, it is far less likely. In a speech at the think-tank Onward, I will be setting out how we can break down the barriers holding young people back and raise more ladders of opportunity for bright kids from tough backgrounds.
MAR9	Time's up for a PM who has shown herself to be incompetent, indecisive and weak	Should Theresa May fail to convince Parliament this week that her “deal” for our departure from the EU merits support, by what moral right would she stay in office? Despite the crushing defeat when the deal was last debated – by 230 votes, after which a prime minister with a scintilla of honour would have walked – the EU has remained entirely unresponsive. It has displayed obstinacy and bloody-mindedness in patronising and snubbing the Attorney General. A prime minister with a modicum of gumption would long since have told Brussels where it could stick its deal.
MAR9	Whether it's crime or foreign aid, grand gestures are no match for genuine action	As the death toll from Britain’s epidemic of knife crime continues to rise, the pressure on politicians to find a solution grows. The murder of so many young people – including Ayub Hassan, Jodie Chesney, and Yousef Makki – has horrified and alarmed a public increasingly desperate for quick action. However, as those in charge are finding, this isn’t entirely straightforward. Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, is said to have clashed with Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, over police resourcing. A £10 million bid for an emergency package of measures to assist police forces hit by spiralling knife crime is reported to have been put to the Treasury. The Chancellor is thought to have turned down the request, saying police chiefs should move resources from other areas of policing to tackling knife crime. Here’s a statement I don’t make often, but I have some sympathy with the Chancellor’s position. Take West Yorkshire Police for example. It apparently has resources enough to not only encourage residents to report hate crimes – which the police have a legal duty to address – but also “hate incidents”. This is a police force which is in charge of a part of the country where knife crime has doubled in the last eight years.
MAR9	Politicians don't lie as much as you'd think, they're actually far more slippery than that	When I tell people that I am playing Diplomacy with a group of MPs, the usual response from non-politicians is: “Ah, they must make good liars.” In fact, almost the opposite is true: the real skill of an MP is to avoid outright lies. Diplomacy, for those who don’t know it, is the nastiest strategy game ever devised. There are seven players, each taking the part of one of the European powers at the beginning of the 20th century: France, Germany, Russia and so on. The objective, of course, is to dominate Europe. But unlike other war games, there are no dice, no elements of chance. The players spend most of their time making agreements with each other about what they are going to do. Their moves are then revealed simultaneously, at which point you see who has betrayed whom. The only way to win is by playing like an utter swine.
MAR9	Mrs May’s deal is our only way out of the EU, Brexiteers have to take it	It's not perfect, but the most important thing is to reclaim our sovereignty Yes, this is really happening. Conservative Brexiteers, known in a more innocent age as “Eurosceptics”, are about to allow the only chance of escaping the European Leviathan to slip away, in their furious exasperation with the incompetence and duplicity of their own prime minister. That this disgust may be justified is, for our purposes here, beside the point. In the meantime, Conservative Remainers have effectively destroyed the credibility of their own government by acts of almost unbelievable treachery against the electorate in general and their own constituents in particular. Is this hell? You may be losing count of the absurdities. This would be understandable since nobody is talking sense anymore. On Friday, Theresa May went to Grimsby (a former fishing port whose local livelihood was decimated by the EU) to, as the headlines put it, “plead” with European negotiators to offer something – anything – that would make her deal seem plausible enough to be passed by Parliament.
MAR9	MPs should vote down the Withdrawal Agreement - again. As the PM likes to say, 'nothing has changed'	Unless it is drastically, miraculously rewritten in the next 48 hours, MPs should vote down the Government’s Withdrawal Agreement on Tuesday. As the Prime Minister likes to say, nothing has changed. The deal is just as terrible now as it was when Parliament defeated it by a majority of 230 in January, and it deserves the exact same short shrift. The fact that the clock is running down isn’t a reason to suddenly surrender and sign up to what would be the most humiliating treaty this country has ever agreed to.   After Mrs May’s historic defeat, Brexiteers bent over backwards, making endless concessions and reducing their demands to the bare minimum. Even with a way out of the backstop, the deal would still be poor for Britain, but at least it wouldn’t trap us in a defenceless position ahead of the next round of talks – turning us into permanent supplicants, forced to concede everything.
MAR9	Parliament will suffer a terrible backlash if Brexit doesn't happen on time	Theresa May’s speech in Grimsby yesterday was a waste of time. The Prime Minister rehearsed the case for her Withdrawal Agreement and urged MPs to vote for it on Tuesday, but the EU hasn’t given her the changes necessary to appease Brexiteers and it is still likely to be defeated. In fact, the political situation hasn’t altered since the Chequers agreement of July last year. Since then the Government has been going round and round in circles, trying to sell the same Brexit-in-name-only. Leavers say “no”; the Government seeks alterations; the EU says “non”, too. The public, meanwhile, watches the dance in disbelief. As this newspaper has argued from the very start, when Britain voted to leave the EU it voted for rupture: out of the EU means out of the customs union. But the Conservative leadership, particularly the Treasury, has tried to maintain the status quo – and Parliament essentially has the same goal. There may be no majority in the Commons for Mrs May’s deal, but nor is there a majority for leaving without any deal at all, which is what would otherwise happen on Brexit day, March 29. Therefore it is eminently possible that after the defeat of Mrs May’s Agreement, Parliament will support an extension of Article 50 and, if the EU agrees, push back that leaving date almost as a matter of course. The attitude among many MPs seems to be that because they are fine with it, the rest of the country won’t object to a longer wait either. They are wrong. If the people see the MPs they elected delaying the Brexit that millions voted for, expect shock and outrage. Politicians had two long years in which to negotiate our withdrawal from the EU and if they fail to do so on time that will be a damning indictment of the executive. But it will also confirm suspicions that the political class as a whole is opposed to Brexit and is doing all it can to stop it. What follows delay? Probably an alliance between Tory and Labour Remainers to cook up a so-called Norway-plus treaty, which would tether Britain permanently to the customs union without any say over the rules. That is called vassalage. What right-minded, patriotic person could swallow that? Presumably, this dog’s dinner would then be put to the people in a second referendum and, so goes the plan, face probable defeat, leaving the UK humiliated and stuck in the EU. The voters can see through all of this.

MAR10	No-deal is our Brexit bargaining chip and we must hold our nerve now more than ever	It is safe to say that for much of the past 46 years the EU has treated the political anxieties of the UK government with a condescension that borders on contempt. We may be right and prescient – as we were over the euro, or immigration control, or the Euro-army, or the intrusion of EU law into every “nook and cranny” of our lives, as Douglas Hurd once put it. But all too often we are simply patted on the head, like some half-witted child, and told to run along. In their chronic disdain for the UK position, I am afraid that the EU has been fortified by repeated evidence of our basic wobbliness: that we are not in the end prepared to defend the logic of our case. For decades the mantra in Brussels has been that Britain objects, Britain protests – but in the end Britain always signs up. Never has that EU contempt been clearer than today, as we struggle to leave. Our negotiators have done their best to explain UK democratic and constitutional objections to the Irish backstop. They might as well have been talking to the wall. No, says the EU, there will be no time limit. There will be no unilateral escape mechanism.
MAR10	We need to scrap the foreign aid target - and spend the money on policing instead	Day after day, we are witnessing more stabbings on our streets and more young lives tragically cut short. In such desperate circumstances, it’s time for a rapid reassessment of our priorities and how we spend taxpayers’ money.  There’s no magic formula, but the Conservative Party I joined understood the need to trust the professionals. That means listening to the police when they tell us that with emergency funding they would be able to send a surge of officers into the hardest-hit areas, finally starting to stem the tide and bring the knife crime currently blighting our nation under control. There is an obvious place where the money for this could be found. In 2017, the Government spent more on overseas aid than it did on the police in England and Wales. A full £14.1 billion was handed to other countries, while the entire Home Office budget came to just £13.1 billion. As far as I am concerned, this is a scandal.
MAR10	Oh how I wish companies would spare us the torment of hideous hold music	‘Dah, dahdah, dah dahdahdahdah DAH! Your call is important to us. Please continue to hold and an operator will be with you shortly…” Ah, the familiar sound of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik being tortured to death at the end of a tinny telephone line. See also Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, Ravel’s Bolero and assorted Strauss waltzes. Not to mention the auditory Polyfilla mendaciously known as “easy listening”. Does anyone really feel more warmly towards companies who decline to pick up their phones because they have been subjected, during the interminable wait for their call to be answered, to the musical equivalent of navel fluff? Someone must, for there are reams of market research extolling the “positive effects on customer retention” of the right sort of hold music. Songs such as The Beatles’ Help are best avoided, apparently, because they remind irked customers that they aren’t getting any. Still, “whatever you do,” an apologist of hold music urges, “it’s best not to let your callers opt for silence.”
MAR10	The imposition of endless bans is infantilising responsible citizens	Rare burgers, energy drinks, “sexist” adverts, junk food adverts, plastic straws, cotton buds, wood burning stoves, 10-packs of cigarettes, menthol cigarettes, petrol cars, diesel cars, scented candles: if they haven’t been banned already, one government body or other is considering banning them, has imposed limited bans, or would like to ban them in some fashion in the future. You can only serve rare burgers in a restaurant if you have approval from the Food Standards Agency, for example. Several of the above look set to fall foul of green targets. And the Mayor of London’s ban on junk food advertising on the Tube has now taken effect, with farcical consequences. We discovered last week that one advert had to be censored because it included a pat of butter and some eggs. In fact, many of the products that can no longer be displayed aren’t junk food in any commonly understood sense. The ban could affect tomato soup, sultanas, and hummus, according to the Institute of Economic Affairs.
MAR10	Unless the government starts to focus on education again, crime on our streets will continue to rise	Over the past 30 years, there has been massive reform of the English education system. Most of it has improved our schools: greater autonomy for headteachers and governors of schools, direct funding to school budgets, matched by much greater accountability through Ofsted and the publication of league tables of school performance has meant that most schools in the country are now judged to be good. Literacy and numeracy levels in primary schools have reached record levels and nearly seven in 10 of our GCSE students now reach the benchmark grades compared to two in 10 20 years ago. More youngsters and going to university, including those from poor backgrounds. The reason these reforms have taken place is because there has been the political will to change the education system,  from Tony Blair with his education, education, education mantra, to David Blunkett’s focus on basic skills, to Michael Gove and his expansion of the academy programme and curriculum and examination reforms. Most schools in this country are now good, particularly at primary level, while more poor and state-educated youngsters are going to university. But all these improvements could be derailed unless the government now starts to focus on education once more. I believe there is a palpable inertia at the Department for Education which is failing to recognise and address the growing problems of regional variation in standards and a funding crisis which is leaving headteachers scrabbling for teachers and to pay for basic equipment.
MAR10	Criminals have a choice: they are to blame for their own actions, not society	Every sensible avenue should be exhausted in the war on knife crime: Matt Hancock tells us that he wants to send social workers into hospitals to identify gang members who have been stabbed and work to reform them. It’s a compelling idea that will hopefully help tackle a crisis that has taken an estimated 41 lives this year. But it is ultimately not the job of the Health Secretary to solve a crime wave. The fashionable notion of treating knife crime as a quasi-medical epidemic misrepresents both the solution and the problem. Yes, this strategy helped reduce deaths in Glasgow, but the Scots didn’t only use social workers. Sentences were raised; stop-and-search went up. Scotland proved that reducing knife crime is impossible without aggressive policing. Moreover, there’s a risk in all the talk of an “epidemic” that crime itself is treated as a natural phenomenon, as if the disease of poverty compelled the murderer of 17-year-old Jodie Chesney to stab her in the back. People have agency and they make immoral choices of their own free will. Shamima Begum, for example, chose to travel to Syria to become a bride for an Islamist movement so depraved that it rapes and cuts off heads. That her baby has died in a refugee camp is undeniably tragic, but blame lies squarely with Ms Begum, not the Home Office.

MAR10	Letters: Britain should walk away from these pointless Brexit talks and seize opportunities elsewhere	SIR – We run companies that manufacture hi-tech products in northern England and ship them around the world. Collectively, our export-led businesses employ thousands of people. Now more than ever we need certainty. And certainty means leaving with no deal on March 29, with no delay. Employers cannot afford to bear the uncertainty created by month after month of negotiations that will almost inevitably lead to a bad deal. A bad deal will leave us shackled to Europe’s dubious mix of rank protectionism and never-ending red tape. Manufacturing employs 350,000 people in almost 15,000 companies in the North-West alone. With some 90 per cent of global economic growth set to come from outside the EU in the coming years, the future of manufacturing jobs depends on our unhindered access to high-growth developing countries.
MAR10	Letters: Brexiteers must hold firm and reject Theresa May’s disastrous deal	SIR – If the Brexiteers think they are going to save the Conservative Party by backing Theresa May’s disastrous Withdrawal Agreement, they are very much mistaken. Allowing this dreadful agreement to become our future will consign the Conservatives to oblivion, even more than their soft-Left policies. Philip J Honey Retford, Nottinghamshire
MAR11	Brexit is there on the table. Take it and run, while there's still a chance	As human beings, we have a natural tendency to blame others for landing us in a mess. And now, with British politics on the verge of the most complex, intractable, emotional and all-consuming muddle since the Civil War, preparations to blame everybody else are in full swing. If Brexit doesn’t happen on March 29, disappointing or enraging the 17 million people who voted for it, blame will be flung everywhere. Leavers will blame Remainers for undermining negotiations and Remainers will blame Leavers for not taking the deal in front of them. Many will blame the Irish for taking a hard line, and the EU in general for being so intransigent. Tories will blame each other for not uniting, and virtually everyone will blame Theresa May for not finding the genius solution. Unfortunately, there will be some truth in all of this, giving scope for all sides to whip up resentment and stoke division. For anyone who wants to hate the Establishment, or despise the majority, or split a party, or just rubbish their opponents, it will be a field day like no other.
MAR11	Crufts' snobbery is barking, and undermines the whole point of having a dog	Ah, the annual Crufts row. It’s almost comforting. Here we are, days away from skittering out of Europe, but mostly furious about dogs. Dachshunds, in particular. Never mind the Northern Irish backstop, the main issue of the day is a dog breed with the dimensions of an Arctic roll. It all kicked off on Saturday night when television presenter Peter Purves criticised dachshund owners for letting their dogs jump up on sofas and climb stairs. Such displays of athleticism are “real no-nos”, said Purves, because their short legs and long backs make them prone to injury. Enter the RSPCA, who took to Twitter to remonstrate. Although the organisation was pleased that Purves had raised awareness of “the problems that dachshunds face”, it was less pleased that he’d suggested jumping up was the problem. The real issue, said the RSPCA, is that the dogs are being bred increasingly long and low. Quite, but actually the problem behind this is that too many people remain crashing dog snobs who view them as a status symbol and are more worried about their animal’s pedigree than anything else. “What is he?” someone will ask, staring down at a baleful creature on the end of another’s lead. “A Braque du Bourbonnais,” comes the reply, as if the dog went to Eton.
MAR11	Tony Blair's collusion with Macron is  harmful, unpatriotic - and completely predictable	Tony Blair, it seems, has been advising French president, Emmanuel Macron, about Brexit.  The former PM has reportedly been advising the French leader on how thwart the referendum result and force the UK to remain in the EU. Stop and think about that for a moment. The French government is taking advice on how to deal with our country from someone last elected to public office fourteen years ago. That’s the same year that YouTube started - or two years before the first smartphone appeared. It's not only relations between Paris and London that are a little strained at the moment.  Macron himself had a bit of a falling out with Italy after a prominent Italian politician met with a leader of the French protest movement, the gilets jaunes. Enraged by what he saw as undue interference in French domestic politics, Macron took the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Rome.
MAR11	I have long admired Tony Blair, but his latest interference goes too far	The House of Commons into which I was elected in 2001 was the first not to have a former prime minister on its benches in more than 50 years - and even that was only for a short period between the resignation of David Lloyd George as an MP and the 1945 General Election which consigned Churchill to the opposition benches. Both Ted Heath and John Major stood down in 2001. I found this slightly deflating, a sign, perhaps, that the House was losing its prestige, that it was no longer seen as the nation’s Parliament, but rather the political classes’ debating club. Former premiers, I believed, belonged in the Commons, where they would sit almost as non-partisan figures, delivering thoughtful verdicts on world events and sharing their experience of office. I have never indulged in the petty, envious criticism of Tony Blair. He has built a successful career in post-public life as an adviser to world leaders and as the head of his eponymous foundation. The British have always had a peculiar problem with individuals earning large amounts of money, particularly if they began their careers in the public realm. Tony is merely living by long-held principles, that aspiration and achievement should be admired and encouraged, not despised.
MAR11	A no deal Brexit is simple in principle, but fiendishly tricky to manage smoothly	As the law stands, the UK leaves the EU on 29 March, deal or no deal.  If Parliament wants to prevent a no deal Brexit MPs must vote for this. Should the Prime Minister lose another meaningful vote, as is looking increasingly likely, MPs will be given the opportunity to take ‘no deal’ off the table this coming Wednesday. But why do so many MPs oppose no deal when there are many things to commend about it, not least that it avoids a delay to Brexit and delivers on the result of the referendum?  A no deal Brexit would also be a ‘clean Brexit’, no need to fulfil those obligations the EU will impose on the UK which are within the Withdrawal Agreement. A no deal Brexit means no Irish backstop. Both sides have said they don’t want a hard border anyway, so that’s taken care of without the need for an Agreement. No deal means no Transition period during which the UK becomes a ‘rule taker’ and abides by EU rules but has no representation in the EU institutions.
MAR11	Criminals have a choice: they are to blame for their own actions, not society	Every sensible avenue should be exhausted in the war on knife crime: Matt Hancock tells us that he wants to send social workers into hospitals to identify gang members who have been stabbed and work to reform them.

The deal is just as terrible now as it was when Parliament defeated it by a majority of 230 in January, and it deserves the exact same short shrift. The fact that the clock is running down isn’t a reason to suddenly surrender and sign up to what would be the most humiliating treaty this country has ever agreed to.   After Mrs May’s historic defeat, Brexiteers bent over backwards, making endless concessions and reducing their demands to the bare minimum. Even with a way out of the backstop, the deal would still be poor for Britain, but at least it wouldn’t trap us in a defenceless position ahead of the next round of talks – turning us into permanent supplicants, forced to concede everything.
MAR11	Parliament will suffer a terrible backlash if Brexit doesn't happen on time	Theresa May’s speech in Grimsby yesterday was a waste of time. The Prime Minister rehearsed the case for her Withdrawal Agreement and urged MPs to vote for it on Tuesday, but the EU hasn’t given her the changes necessary to appease Brexiteers and it is still likely to be defeated. In fact, the political situation hasn’t altered since the Chequers agreement of July last year. Since then the Government has been going round and round in circles, trying to sell the same Brexit-in-name-only. Leavers say “no”; the Government seeks alterations; the EU says “non”, too. The public, meanwhile, watches the dance in disbelief. As this newspaper has argued from the very start, when Britain voted to leave the EU it voted for rupture: out of the EU means out of the customs union. But the Conservative leadership, particularly the Treasury, has tried to maintain the status quo – and Parliament essentially has the same goal. There may be no majority in the Commons for Mrs May’s deal, but nor is there a majority for leaving without any deal at all, which is what would otherwise happen on Brexit day, March 29. Therefore it is eminently possible that after the defeat of Mrs May’s Agreement, Parliament will support an extension of Article 50 and, if the EU agrees, push back that leaving date almost as a matter of course. The attitude among many MPs seems to be that because they are fine with it, the rest of the country won’t object to a longer wait either. They are wrong. If the people see the MPs they elected delaying the Brexit that millions voted for, expect shock and outrage. Politicians had two long years in which to negotiate our withdrawal from the EU and if they fail to do so on time that will be a damning indictment of the executive. But it will also confirm suspicions that the political class as a whole is opposed to Brexit and is doing all it can to stop it. What follows delay? Probably an alliance between Tory and Labour Remainers to cook up a so-called Norway-plus treaty, which would tether Britain permanently to the customs union without any say over the rules. That is called vassalage. What right-minded, patriotic person could swallow that? Presumably, this dog’s dinner would then be put to the people in a second referendum and, so goes the plan, face probable defeat, leaving the UK humiliated and stuck in the EU. The voters can see through all of this.
MAR11	Letters: Theresa May must go . . . and allow voters to clean out Parliament too	SIR – If our Prime Minister has any shred of integrity left she will resign after losing today’s vote.  Instead, she will cling on to the shreds of her office with all the blind tenacity of a mollusc.  Only a general election with a new leader can save us now and clean out the Augean stable that Parliament has become, with Remainer MPs in Leave-voting constituencies voting in Parliament to obstruct the will of their own electorate, though it has been endorsed by referendum, manifestos and parliamentary vote.
MAR11	Letters: Britain should walk away from these pointless Brexit talks and seize opportunities elsewhere	SIR – We run companies that manufacture hi-tech products in northern England and ship them around the world. Collectively, our export-led businesses employ thousands of people. Now more than ever we need certainty. And certainty means leaving with no deal on March 29, with no delay. Employers cannot afford to bear the uncertainty created by month after month of negotiations that will almost inevitably lead to a bad deal. A bad deal will leave us shackled to Europe’s dubious mix of rank protectionism and never-ending red tape. Manufacturing employs 350,000 people in almost 15,000 companies in the North-West alone. With some 90 per cent of global economic growth set to come from outside the EU in the coming years, the future of manufacturing jobs depends on our unhindered access to high-growth developing countries.
MAR12	Why I took the tough decision to vote down the PM's Brexit deal	Tuesday began well for the Government. The Prime Minister had lost her voice. “If you think mine’s croaky, you should hear Juncker’s” she quipped at a hastily-called 1922 Committee in the morning. Yet she seemed to have returned from Brussels with a spring in her step - and an improved Draft Withdrawal Agreement. Then came the legal opinion from our Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. Non-lawyers, including MPs and journalists, immediately turned to the final page and executive summary. The last 12 words spelt disaster for the Government: “... no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement”. In other words, the United Kingdom still cannot leave the Northern Ireland backstop unilaterally. This was the crucial issue which drove many of us to resist the deal back in January, when the Government lost by 230 votes. When questioned in front of the House of Commons later in the morning, however, Cox defended the Government’s position admirably. He made the point on everyone’s minds, that this is not just a legal matter, but a political one. And it is also a question of trust.
MAR12	How we could end up with a general election and new prime minister in three steps	What does Parliament want? No one is entirely sure, as Theresa May is finding to her cost after failing for a second time to get her deal through. The stalemate could well be broken by a general election and quite possibly a new prime minister. That might sound far-fetched, given how long Mrs May has staggered on like a parliamentary version of Monty Python's Black Knight, but here is how it could happen in just three steps. The Prime Minister's deal was once again rejected by Parliament on Tuesday night.
MAR12	By voting down the deal again, Brexiteers have left Brexit at the mercy of Remainers and the EU	Some Brexiteer MPs who voted against Theresa May's deal the first time she presented it to Parliament in January have voted for it tonight, but not in enough numbers to see it through the House of Commons. Yet again, we have seen Brexiteers walk through the voting lobbies with fervent Remainers against the deal.  The debate on the legal robustness of the extra changes Mrs May secured in Strasbourg on Monday has been important, but, as I've argued before, is a sideshow compared to what has been at stake politically. Jacob Rees-Mogg recognised that himself.  The European Research Group chair told BBC News that the key question he and his Eurosceptic colleagues have had to answer today is "political": "Does this deliver enough of Brexit to be worth accepting against the risk Michael Gove has highlighted of not leaving?" Later on Sky News, he argued that the "only reason for voting for the deal" was the fear that rejecting it would mean Brexit might not happen. Such a fear, he said, was a "phantom" leading him to conclude that "it is safe to vote against her deal tonight". 
MAR12	Face facts, Mrs May, it's time for you to step aside	In any walk of life there must come a point when you know the game’s up. A Test batsman who can no longer get past 50 and is watching his average slowly decline; an airline pilot unable to react quickly enough in a crisis; an opera singer whose voice is well past its best; a writer with nothing more to say (yes, yes, I know). In such circumstances, why carry on? We may wish to cleave to past glories, or cannot afford to quit, or are too lacking in self-awareness to recognise a brick wall when we have run into it. Which is Theresa May? She has no past glory to speak of and can retire in comfort. Are we to conclude that she, almost alone, cannot see that the road along which she has been kicking the proverbial Brexit can for months has finally run out? I understand that a sense of public duty drives the Prime Minister on. I see that the Byzantine complexities of Brexit render normal political considerations redundant.
MAR12	This deeply flawed deal only served to show how we have caved in to the EU from day one	So that was that. Following weeks of negotiations after Parliament rejected the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Agreement back in January, the Government brought its deal back to the House – only to lose once again. It’s fairly obvious why. In the hours following the release of the revised agreement, it was pored over by numerous legal experts, including the ERG’s legal team (the “Star Chamber”), the Attorney General, the DUP’s experts and others, including Lord Anderson. A clear picture emerged. The new deal only limited the risks posed by the backstop, and did not remove them entirely.
MAR12	After thirty years of the world wide web, it's time the tech giants took responsibility	Who, from our times, will be remembered in 600 years as Gutenberg is, or in 200 years like Stephenson or Faraday – all of whose inventions irrevocably changed the way people live? The most likely candidate is Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web which has transformed communications more rapidly than any previous innovation in history.   Sir Tim could one day be venerated for one of humanity’s greatest moments, or vilified for unleashing a monster. Even he must wonder which. Children in particular are today exposed to images and material at the touch of a computer mouse which would once have been denied them. And Sir Tim has warned against the power that the internet gives states to eavesdrop on citizens.
MAR12	It's the day of reckoning for Theresa May's Brexit deal	The imagery of a British prime minister heading to the Continent in a last-ditch bid to avert a crisis is an unfortunate one that is etched on the national consciousness. When Neville Chamberlain went to Munich it was with the hopes of a nation on his shoulders. Last night, Theresa May flew to Strasbourg for eleventh hour Brexit talks against a backdrop of exasperation. When will this farrago ever end? Theoretically, it could be all over today if the Prime Minister has managed to change the Withdrawal Agreement in a significant way from the deal defeated in January by a record 230-vote margin. There is to be another vote in the Commons later today but she is only likely to win it if her colleagues can be persuaded that the treaty text now leaves no doubt that the so-called Irish backstop is temporary and that there is a clear exit route should the UK want one. Is this, then, the moment of truth or yet another staging post on a road to who knows where? The Prime Minister spent the weekend ringing around a dozen EU leaders in an effort to get their support for concessions that might get her Brexit deal over the line. The European Commission has obdurately refused to budge from the mandate given to it by the Council of Ministers, so Mrs May was right to go to the political leaders to break the impasse.
MAR12	MPs have a duty to make sure Brexit happens on time	This Friday is the Ides of March, a date heavy with symbolism for leaders who have lost their authority. By the end of the week, Theresa May will know the fate of both her Brexit deal and her premiership. Tomorrow, MPs look likely to vote down the Withdrawal Agreement she reached with the EU last November, which has already been defeated by a record 230 votes in January. That will lead to a second vote on Wednesday on whether the country should still leave as planned on March 29, without a deal. Since that is the date for departure set out in an Act of Parliament agreed by a vast majority of MPs, this is what should happen next. Yet the expectation is that the Commons will vote against leaving without a deal and seek to postpone Brexit. For many Remainers, that would be the precursor to  cancelling it altogether. We still do not know whether the Government will whip Tory MPs to vote to leave on March 29 in Wednesday’s vote should it come to pass. Mrs  May used to say that no deal is better than a bad deal, and the logic of that position is to oblige her MPs to fulfil the promise made in the party’s 2017 manifesto.
MAR12	Letters: Theresa May must go . . . and allow voters to clean out Parliament too	SIR – If our Prime Minister has any shred of integrity left she will resign after losing today’s vote.  Instead, she will cling on to the shreds of her office with all the blind tenacity of a mollusc.  Only a general election with a new leader can save us now and clean out the Augean stable that Parliament has become, with Remainer MPs in Leave-voting constituencies voting in Parliament to obstruct the will of their own electorate, though it has been endorsed by referendum, manifestos and parliamentary vote.

With some 90 per cent of global economic growth set to come from outside the EU in the coming years, the future of manufacturing jobs depends on our unhindered access to high-growth developing countries.
MAR13	Britain’s Remainer elites have declared war on democracy itself	At moments like this, when democracy is being traduced, it is easy to be angry, to rage or to fulminate. I’ve been prone to such emotions myself over the past few years. Today, I’m merely grief-stricken: sad, but no longer furious. There have been many bad days on the road to the Great Brexit Betrayal, but this was the most devastating so far. The vote by MPs to rule out “no deal” was a psychological bombshell, confirming that most of our “representatives”, including many members of the Cabinet, are ready to thumb their noses at us. Theresa May’s deal, which would be the worst treaty the UK has ever signed, is back on the table. Philip Hammond wants an even worse solution, with the UK permanently stuck in the customs union, as he implied in his typically useless Spring Statement. To achieve such a super-soft Brexit in name only, there is only one solution: a Labour-Tory Remainer coalition would have to seize control, imposing a government of national unity while it reopens negotiations with Brussels. A fleeting majority at one moment in time – for example, in an indicative vote this week – wouldn’t be enough to achieve this. The Tory party simply wouldn’t hold together, and the Government would fall: the Remainers would need a different, more robust mechanism.
MAR13	Mrs May is responsible for losing control of Brexit	The Prime Minister has lost her ability to lead her party, her Government, and the country. We can question the actions of many MPs throughout Brexit. Labour, for opposing everything while proposing impossible alternatives. The Lib Dems, the new independents, and Tory Remainers, for trying to overturn the referendum result. And Leavers, for failing to recognise that, despite its terrible flaws, the Prime Minister’s deal was the cleanest form of Brexit left. Ultimately, however, responsibility must lie with Theresa May herself. She inherited a tough situation, of course. Negotiating Brexit was never going to be easy, particularly with a Government, Cabinet and Parliament full of Remainers. But she knew that when she took the job on.
MAR13	The betrayal of Brexit is one of the most shameful chapters in our country’s history	The great Brexit betrayal has begun”. I first wrote those words in a piece for the Telegraph in July 2017. How everybody laughed at the time. “Poor old Nigel,” they said. “He’s so desperate to be relevant.” Well, although it pains me to say it, the vote in Parliament to take no deal off the table proves that, 20 months ago, I was right. I know Westminster’s current crop of career-minded politicians only too well. They are anti-democrats posing as men and women of honour, many of them unaware of the workings of the political project that is the European Union. Indeed, I doubt if they could even name its seven key institutions.
MAR13	I fear Parliament will now find a way of stopping Brexit	Many will be surprised that I supported the Government’s proposed Withdrawal Agreement on Tuesday following assurances from the Prime Minister and Attorney General. There have been many difficult decisions since the referendum, but we must never forget one thing. The priority is to deliver Brexit and what record numbers of Britons voted for. They wanted to take back control over borders, laws and money and they want to leave the EU on time at the end of March. On this basis I supported the Government on Tuesday - although the deal is a long way from perfect - because the alternative carries big risks. The vote was lost. The House of Commons has now decisively rejected the Prime Minister’s deal on two occasions by record margins.
MAR13	Philip Hammond is ready to go down fighting against a no-deal and for a softer Brexit	Philip Hammond muscled his way into Westminster's ongoing Brexit drama this afternoon as he had a lot to say for his Spring Statement. The Chancellor's mini-budget heralded the customary round of giveaways at the despatch box, although he roved far beyond the world of finance and dived into the Brexit fray. MPs were warned that their rejection of Theresa May's Brexit deal last night "leaves a cloud of uncertainty hanging over our economy" and urged them to vote this evening to "remove the threat of an imminent no-deal exit".  Leave aside the fact that the motion, and amendments under consideration, can do no more to "remove" a no-deal Brexit than the Spelman amendment MPs passed back in January. Those who do want a no-deal Brexit would be understandably bemused to hear the Chancellor coming out so fiercely against a no-deal, given that he has previously made a virtue of how much he was ready to spend to make it work.
MAR13	After thirty years of the world wide web, it's time the tech giants took responsibility	Who, from our times, will be remembered in 600 years as Gutenberg is, or in 200 years like Stephenson or Faraday – all of whose inventions irrevocably changed the way people live? The most likely candidate is Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web which has transformed communications more rapidly than any previous innovation in history.   Sir Tim could one day be venerated for one of humanity’s greatest moments, or vilified for unleashing a monster. Even he must wonder which. Children in particular are today exposed to images and material at the touch of a computer mouse which would once have been denied them. And Sir Tim has warned against the power that the internet gives states to eavesdrop on citizens.

MAR13	Letters: What are voters to make of MPs’ refusal to abide by their pledge to deliver on the Brexit vote?	SIR – On December 7 2016, MPs in the House of Commons voted to support a motion on Brexit by a majority of 373 that “recognises that this House should respect the wishes of the United Kingdom as expressed in the referendum on 23 June”. How should we now view that same group of MPs, given the current proceedings in Parliament (report, March 13)? Alan Dorn Loughborough, Leicestershire
MAR13	Letters: The EU must shoulder its share of the blame for the Brexit imbroglio	SIR – One of the more depressing aspects of the whole Brexit saga has been the way the narrative has focused on the weakness of the British negotiators rather than on the intransigence of their EU counterparts. Theresa May was definitely the wrong leader at the wrong time, but I wonder if any other leader would have done substantially better. The EU’s “Gang of Three” (chief negotiator Michel Barnier, the president of the European Council Donald Tusk, and Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator) have shown arrogance and hostility throughout the process.  Certainly, leaving under World Trade Organisation rules – the so-called “no deal” option – would be disruptive in the short term, but once Brexit has been achieved a new reality would be created. The debate will soon be over and we will have to come together to deal with the facts on the ground. 
MAR14	Now Brexit is to be delayed, we must demand to take part in the EU elections	Britain can remind Brussels what democracy looks like There has been much talk of a constitutional crisis and certainly there are constitutional matters to be considered in the process of leaving the EU, but the real crisis is one of democracy. Parliamentarians should be hanging their heads in shame. Parliament votes to run a referendum, a ballot which gave an option of leaving the EU but never mentioned a deal, it simply said “leave”. 
MAR14	Britain will have plenty of scope to cause trouble in Brussels after delay to Brexit	The likes of EU Council President Donald Tusk and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney have been doing their utmost to scare Brexiteers in Parliament into backing Theresa May's deal by raising the prospect of a very long extension of the UK's EU membership. Apparently, Tusk has an extension of one year in mind, which puts him in agreement with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s right-hand man, Martin Selmayr, and follows the strategy being outlined by Theresa May’s chief Brexit advisor Olly Robbins when he was overheard in a Brussels bar. They might need to think twice before they make such an offer. It’s certainly worth considering what, precisely, a long extension would entail. 
MAR14	This Brexit betrayal is turning mild-mannered people into unexpected revolutionaries	Last year, I founded a grassroots campaign group called Stand Up 4 Brexit. As its name suggests, our group aims to hold Conservative MPs accountable for their manifesto commitments by encouraging them to support the clean break from the EU for which 17.4 million people voted in 2016. We have always tried to spread a positive and optimistic message, asking people to engage in the democratic process through traditional means, like writing to their MPs. So it was with a growing sense of anguish that I watched the extraordinary developments in the House of Commons last night. Yesterday, our MPs voted against an act of Parliament they themselves passed, which enshrined our departure from the European Union on March 29, regardless of whether any withdrawal terms had been agreed.
MAR14	It is an insult that the government puts a soldier in the dock while letting IRA killers go free	Most law-abiding people in Northern Ireland believe that anyone who committed a crime should be brought to justice – and that the terrible events of Bloody Sunday were inexcusable. What is causing enormous distress is the completely disproportionate treatment of the security forces. Sinn Fein will inevitably respond to the news that one soldier has been charged with murder and attempted murder by encouraging the bereaved to feel angry that more aren’t being brought to court. As further evidence of the wickedness of the British government they will cite a stupid remark, made by the Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley last week, that security forces killers were not committing crimes “but fulfilling their duty in a dignified and appropriate way.” What isn’t being much quoted, though, is her accurate remark that “over 90 per cent of the killings during the Troubles were at the hands of terrorists [and] every single one of those was a crime.”
MAR14	MPs have handed our fate over to the EU. The political establishment has humiliated itself	Today brought a very significant moment in the history of Brexit, as the Commons voted to request a delay to leaving the EU. The British political establishment is humiliated. The Commons has voted many times to say what it opposes, including the Government’s Withdrawal Agreement, a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum.    It even voted against holding indicative votes to find out what MPs prefer instead (a cynic might say that they are wary of their own judgment).
MAR14	MPs have plunged Westminster into a constitutional crisis	It was the night Theresa May finally lost control of Brexit. The UK will not now be leaving the EU on March 29 (assuming European leaders agree to an extension). More than that, the Commons effectively took power over the process, plunging Westminster into a constitutional crisis. We may conceivably be witnessing the end of Brexit, a betrayal of the referendum result in June 2016. Mrs May endured two further defeats as Tory Remainers, including several Cabinet ministers, rebelled against government efforts to keep no deal on the table. If they remain in office it will be a further indication of the Prime Minister’s loss of authority. As always with this saga, nothing is straightforward. Even though Parliament voted against leaving on March 29 that remains the Brexit date in law. A motion does not trump a statute so the Government will need to bring forward legislation to enact the will of the House. Yet another dramatic day at Westminster was marked by procedural shenanigans that are baffling even to seasoned observers of the political scene, let alone most of the country which is heartily fed up with the failure of the politicians to deliver on the Brexit referendum. The woman who said on TV that she had “lost the will to live” spoke for the nation. But what we are witnessing is the gradual death of Brexit.
MAR14	After thirty years of the world wide web, it's time the tech giants took responsibility	Who, from our times, will be remembered in 600 years as Gutenberg is, or in 200 years like Stephenson or Faraday – all of whose inventions irrevocably changed the way people live? The most likely candidate is Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web which has transformed communications more rapidly than any previous innovation in history.   Sir Tim could one day be venerated for one of humanity’s greatest moments, or vilified for unleashing a monster.

MAR15	Irreconcilables, waverers and converts: how the fate of Theresa May's Brexit deal lies in the hands of 19 Eurosceptics	As Brexit bombshells go, it was sudden and unexpected. By his own admission, David Davis’s revelation that he planned to vote for the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement left the European Research Group “stunned”. The former Brexit secretary had been invited to address the influential group of Eurosceptic Tories by its chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg in a bid to give “all sides of the argument” ahead of Tuesday night’s meaningful vote. But as the former leadership hopeful told The Telegraph: “I got a respectful but completely silent response. I think it’s fair to say I am not very popular with the ERG right now.”
MAR15	Theresa May's revolting ministers should either resign or be sacked	Without discipline, chaos can, and will, ensue. The events of this week are one of the clearest examples of this statement being correct. Amidst all of the votes, debates and campaigns, we have seen a major event take place, and one which will have major ramifications for the weeks ahead. First, however, context is needed. Last year, I resigned by role as Parliamentary Private Secretary (a fancy title for a Minister’s bag carrier) over the Prime Minister’s stance on Brexit. In doing so, I was following a long-standing tradition, and one which serves as a cornerstone of our constitution today: collective responsibility. This rule, outlined in the Cabinet Manual, states that if you are a member of the Government you should resign if you want to vote against it. Since my decision last year, others have followed from all levels of the Government, from other PPSs through to members of the Cabinet. Even earlier this week, we saw one of my colleagues, Sarah Newton, resign as a Minister in order to vote against a hard Brexit. Whilst I disagree with her stance on Brexit itself, her move was courageous, and I hold her in high regard, especially in comparison to those who broke this code. 
MAR15	Why I prefer to back the PM's deal than go down fighting with Brexiteer soldiers	This week has been pretty awful in Parliament. We have had a series of Brexit votes that have achieved very little and my constituents in Mansfield and Warsop are increasingly frustrated, as are most people across the country. Earlier this week I voted in favour of the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal. This came as a surprise to many people as I’ve repeatedly spoken out about the problems with the deal. I haven't lost my mind, I accept that the deal has many issues within it and I still don't like it. We don’t want to take EU rules over which we have no say; we don’t want to answer to European courts; and certainly not permanently. We asked in January for the PM to make it better. 
MAR15	Why Syria's war is far from over	The Syrian war is almost over, the headlines tell us. One of the bloodiest conflicts in modern history is reaching its “final chapter”. There are plenty who would disagree with the assessment. For one, the children whose father was killed in a government air strike in the northern province of Idlib yesterday. As too would the mother from Homs who still does not know whether her son - who was imprisoned in President Bashar al-Assad’s notorious Sednaya jail in 2013 - is dead or alive.
MAR15	The New Zealand atrocities prove that far-right terrorism is an organised, global threat	Today’s tragedy in Christchurch is the bloody manifestation of a growing global threat. The extreme right is increasingly looking across borders for inspiration and moral support. Although he chose New Zealand to be the site of his attack, the suspected terrorist referenced similar attacks in Canada, Italy and Norway as well as the Rotherham abuse scandal, which has become a call to arms for right wing extremists globally. This should be viewed in the context of an increasingly polarised political sphere, with far-right politicians empowering extremist ideology through their inflammatory rhetoric.
MAR15	MPs have handed our fate over to the EU. The political establishment has humiliated itself	Today brought a very significant moment in the history of Brexit, as the Commons voted to request a delay to leaving the EU. The British political establishment is humiliated. The Commons has voted many times to say what it opposes, including the Government’s Withdrawal Agreement, a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum.    It even voted against holding indicative votes to find out what MPs prefer instead (a cynic might say that they are wary of their own judgment).

Mrs May endured two further defeats as Tory Remainers, including several Cabinet ministers, rebelled against government efforts to keep no deal on the table. If they remain in office it will be a further indication of the Prime Minister’s loss of authority. As always with this saga, nothing is straightforward. Even though Parliament voted against leaving on March 29 that remains the Brexit date in law. A motion does not trump a statute so the Government will need to bring forward legislation to enact the will of the House. Yet another dramatic day at Westminster was marked by procedural shenanigans that are baffling even to seasoned observers of the political scene, let alone most of the country which is heartily fed up with the failure of the politicians to deliver on the Brexit referendum. The woman who said on TV that she had “lost the will to live” spoke for the nation. But what we are witnessing is the gradual death of Brexit.
MAR15	After thirty years of the world wide web, it's time the tech giants took responsibility	Who, from our times, will be remembered in 600 years as Gutenberg is, or in 200 years like Stephenson or Faraday – all of whose inventions irrevocably changed the way people live? The most likely candidate is Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web which has transformed communications more rapidly than any previous innovation in history.   Sir Tim could one day be venerated for one of humanity’s greatest moments, or vilified for unleashing a monster. Even he must wonder which. Children in particular are today exposed to images and material at the touch of a computer mouse which would once have been denied them. And Sir Tim has warned against the power that the internet gives states to eavesdrop on citizens.
MAR15	Letters: By voting to block no deal, Parliament has disregarded a fundamental principle of Brexit	SIR – What madness is this? MPs voted to invoke Article 50 knowing full well that it might involve, if necessary, leaving the EU without a deal. Yet on Theresa May’s rudderless ship, even ministers are able to ignore their own manifesto and defy a three-line whip to take this option off the table. The Prime Minister, her Cabinet, her Government, the Conservative Party and Parliament have totally lost the plot. Iven Chadwick Poynton, Cheshire
MAR15	Letters: What are voters to make of MPs’ refusal to abide by their pledge to deliver on the Brexit vote?	SIR – On December 7 2016, MPs in the House of Commons voted to support a motion on Brexit by a majority of 373 that “recognises that this House should respect the wishes of the United Kingdom as expressed in the referendum on 23 June”. How should we now view that same group of MPs, given the current proceedings in Parliament (report, March 13)? Alan Dorn Loughborough, Leicestershire
MAR16	The patriotic thing for MPs to do is vote for my Brexit deal	Amidst the Parliamentary drama at Westminster last week, a greater clarity emerged about the choices we face as a country. In Strasbourg last Monday, I secured a package of legally-binding improvements to the Brexit deal that respond to the legitimate concerns of MPs about the Northern Ireland backstop. I said that a failure to support that improved deal would open up a range of undesirable alternatives, from not leaving the EU as scheduled on March 29, to the risk of a second referendum, a general election or the increased possibility of leaving without a deal. So it proved. Over three dozen of my Conservative colleagues switched their support to give the improved deal their backing. I am grateful to each one of them. But I know that I will have to do more to convince others, as well as the DUP, if I am to succeed in finally securing a majority for the deal.
MAR16	Theresa May is wreaking havoc with the British constitution - thankfully, her days are numbered	Shortly after she and three cabinet colleagues had dynamited the doctrine of collective cabinet responsibility last Wednesday, by abstaining in the Commons vote on a no-deal Brexit, Amber Rudd sought to justify herself. Leaving without a deal “would, in my view, do generational damage to our economy and our security”. She is entitled to her opinion, and the few who still listen to her are used to her risibly defective judgment. However, the luxury of holding a view contrary to the Prime Minister’s and the Cabinet’s has always only been available to those choosing not to hold the office and collect the salary of a minister. The four abstainers patently care less about behaving correctly than they do about keeping their jobs. Yet there is also a doctrine about the Prime Minister being primus inter pares – first among equals – that requires Mrs May to enforce the rules. The most important is collective responsibility, for the alternative (as we are seeing, and shall see until Mrs May goes) is to render governing impossible. This she has utterly failed to do, even though, as doctrines go, it is not an ornament but a necessity. Presumably briefed by Downing Street in a pitiful attempt to prove Mrs May retained some authority, the media reported that she “rebuked” Miss Rudd and the others for abstaining. That signified, paradoxically, an absence of authority: an authoritative, and constitutionally correct, prime minister would have insisted on the resignations of all those who had defied the whip.  
MAR16	The PM is dire, but this shameless Remainer Parliament will go down in history, too	MPs claim to be taking control - but they had it all along It was with a degree of incredulity that I heard Hilary Benn stand up in the House of Commons on Thursday and declare that “the House has never been given the chance” to “try to find a way forward” out of the Brexit logjam. Really?  The accusation that the Prime Minister simply doesn’t listen is evidently fair – she is trying to resurrect a deal which has been overwhelmingly rejected twice by the House of Commons. But her colleagues in Parliament are guilty of exactly the same charge, demanding as they did last week a series of “indicative votes”, despite having spent the last two years debating and rejecting every kind of Brexit. 
MAR16	If we can't leave on time, we should stay in - and become Macron's worst nightmare	Who better than the British to demolish the EU from within? We have to assume that the chances of an agreed withdrawal from the EU are all but gone. True, there is a possibility that a number of Tory Brexiteers and even perhaps the DUP will be prepared, out of utter desperation, to support the third attempt at passing the May “deal”. But I am led to believe that the significant number of European Research Group MPs who will oppose it is sufficient to ensure that it cannot pass. So we will be pleading with (sorry, applying to) the EU for an extension to Article 50, as was almost certainly inevitable from the start. That maniacally dedicated team of Remain saboteurs has succeeded in winning the battle of Westminster. So let’s get over the grieving and get on with the plans. Otherwise they will win the war as well – although such a victory might be Pyrrhic from the European point of view. I shall return to this point.
MAR16	Why, with a heavy heart, Brexiteers should now back Theresa May's deal	I have been a critic of the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement right from the start. I have spoken against it, twice, in the House of Lords. Had I still been a Member of the House of Commons I would have voted against it twice. As the Attorney General, with commendable courage confirmed, the risk of the United Kingdom being trapped in the backstop against our will remains, though it has been reduced. And that is not the only feature of the Withdrawal Agreement that I dislike. It does not provide the Brexit I voted for. What’s more, I have no great fear of what is misleadingly called a No Deal Brexit. A number of preparations have been made on both sides of the Channel to ensure that the worst predictions of the doomsters would not come to pass.
MAR16	The New Zealand massacre was a dreadful reminder of the lingering evil of fascism. It must never win	The horrific attack on two mosques in New Zealand was a dreadful reminder of the lingering evil of fascism. The killer’s manifesto was rooted in the grotesque Islamophobia of the contemporary far-Right, but it also reached back decades, to some of humanity’s darkest hours. It cited Oswald Mosley and was peppered with biological racism. It portrayed a mythical West that was once home to a pure white race, “invaded” by outsiders be they “Roma, African, Indian, Turkish, Semitic or other”. Fascism, the faith of the inadequate, rejects what is in fact best about the West – compassion, tolerance, open-mindedness – in favour of totalitarianism, trying to compel everyone to inhabit its grim fantasy of the survival of the fittest. Fascism puts itself in opposition to the essentials of good religion, too, namely love and peace.
MAR16	This horrific atrocity in New Zealand was designed for the social media age	The attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand was an act of savagery – proof that the Islamophobic far-Right is as malevolent and detestable as the radical Islamists it professes to hate. The murders were also the first true example of a social media massacre. The killer teed up his attack online and broadcast the spree live, in the style of a video game. He name-dropped figures known on the internet to generate confused debate.
MAR16	Parliament leaves so many broken promises on Brexit	This was the worst week for Brexit yet. On Tuesday, the House rejected the Government’s Withdrawal Agreement – and rightly so, because it threatened to turn Britain into a rule-taker without a get-out clause. On Wednesday, MPs voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit – rendering it impossible to negotiate a better alternative and removing the one guarantee the voters have that Brexit will definitely happen. And on Thursday, MPs delivered the coup de grace by voting for a delay of Brexit, dependent upon approval from Brussels. If in 2016 the British people voted to return lost powers to Parliament, Thursday was the day that Parliament voted to hand power straight back to the EU. Much of the blame lies with the executive, which has failed to deliver on promises it cast in stone. On January 17 2017, Theresa May gave a speech at Lancaster House in which she outlined her objectives. Some are met in her Withdrawal Agreement, but many have been abandoned, including control over our laws, a strengthened Union and a “smooth, orderly Brexit”. Also missing is her Trumpian formula for success in talks – “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain”. This statement of the obvious was enshrined in the 2017 Tory manifesto. The deal Mrs May wrung from the EU was plainly “bad”: she lost several ministers over it and the polls now reveal popular discontent. In that sense, the Commons was simply doing what it is meant to do by scrutinising the Agreement before voting it down. But instead of sending Mrs May back to the table to thrash out a better deal backed by a committed political establishment, Remainers seized the chance to undermine the withdrawal process entirely. 
MAR16	Letters: Theresa May’s attempt to force her failed deal through Parliament is an attack on democracy	SIR – What is the difference between Theresa May, who is bringing her Brexit deal back to Parliament to be voted on for a third time, and the people who have been calling for a second EU referendum? The latter event would, according to many, be going against the will of the people and letting them down. How does the repeated voting on Mrs May’s deal not do the same? Patricia MacManus Skerries, Co Dublin, Ireland
MAR16	Letters: The Brexit debacle has exposed the self-interest of those elected to serve in the Commons	SIR – The process of leaving the European Union has exposed the venality and self-interest of the political class in this country. With a few exceptions, politicians have sought to water down the clear mandate to leave the EU or else to thwart it altogether. The Prime Minister has created confusion by refusing to heed advice, in spite of record-breaking votes against her Withdrawal Agreement. It is time that our political system was cleaned up and politicians held to account. Alexander Stilwell Godalming, Surrey
MAR17	To back the PM's deal, we need proof that the next stage of Brexit talks will be radically different	Sometimes in politics you can face a dilemma so painful that the best thing can be to lay it out before your own constituency association, and ask for their advice. Last Friday I had the chance to do just that. By way of background, the Uxbridge and South Ruislip Conservative Association could not be remotely described as hardline. We are a diverse, thoughtful, metropolitan bunch of One Nation Tories. There are probably as many Remainers as Leavers. In consulting my association, I tried to frame the choice as neutrally as I could. There was a chance, I said, that the Government would ask parliament to vote for a third time on the Prime Minister’s EU Withdrawal Agreement. If such a vote took place, I had two options. I could either stick to my guns, or I could fold.
MAR17	There's more to calling me Miss Shilling than formality and politeness	There is something quite poignant about the drop-down list of alternative forms of address that the computer offers when you shop online: Mrs, Lady, Dr, Professor … There was a time, I suppose, when I might have become any of those. Instead I am Miss, and likely to remain so. Not (apart from a pang of regret for the learned Professor Shilling who dwelt at the end of a path not taken) that I don’t cherish my spinster’s handle. Since my aunt was ordained and became the Reverend, I am the only Miss Shilling in my immediate family, and I cherish both the lingering girlish overtones of Miss (Ms, avaunt!) and my membership of an excellent company of women, both fictional and real – Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple, the “spinsters innumerable” of Elizabeth Gaskell’s Cranford, and my formidable university moral tutor, Miss Bruten – for whom “Miss” was less a signifier of marital status than a breastplate of identity. While I am Miss Shilling to the online shopkeepers, it is rare for anyone to call me that in real life. But as time goes on, I may have to get used to it, for last week Mr Justice Hayden, presiding over a case involving an elderly woman with dementia, told lawyers that she should be referred to in court as “Mrs”, adding, “I profoundly dislike the way hospitals infantilise senior citizens by referring to them by their first name.”
MAR17	The US college admissions scandal proves that kids are just pawns in academia's brutal game	To say that college preparation starts young in America is an understatement. Sick of my claustrophobic provincial school north of Boston, MA, at 16 I somewhat drastically left the country for a sixth-form place at Bedales, a boarding school in Hampshire. By then, I’d already undergone years of drilling by a range of tutors for the SATs (scholastic aptitude test), the college admissions exams all American pupils take. My scores remained patchy, however, and – having a very bad feeling indeed about my prospects in the wildly stressful and expensive bonanza of American college admissions – I was pleased to try my luck elsewhere, aided by a music scholarship. I was fairly privileged, of course, and thanks to supportive parents had played the violin quite seriously since I was 4 (out of interest, rather than college ambition). But there was no chance I would be able to compete with my peers gunning – or, more accurately, being gunned by their parents – for places at the top universities.  Unless you were a natural genius who had deduced and published on a new theory of evolution, invented a computer or cracked the trickiest problem in string theory (not me), or a champion athlete in a mainstream sport (also not me), you needed to be world-beating at archery, snowboarding, bouldering, debating, the harp or chess, as well as the founder of at least one internationally successful charity.
MAR17	The end is nigh for the People's Vote parade, but I've got a great new job for them...	Following Thursday night’s defeat of Sarah Wollaston’s amendment calling for a second referendum, will the People’s Vote campaign finally call it quits? I know, I know. These die-heard Remoaners could give the Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail a run for his money – “A loss by 334 votes to 85? Tis but a scratch!” – but even Tony Blair must recognise it’s now a lost cause. Had Jeremy Corbyn whipped his MPs into supporting the amendment, it still wouldn’t have passed. There just isn’t a majority in Parliament for a second vote. It’s a busted flush. So what should people like Alastair Campbell and Gina Miller do now? It looks as if we’ll be out of the European Union soon – if not on March 29th then by June 30th – at which point a divided nation can start to heal. And I think there’s an important role for the People’s Vote champions in this ‘peace and reconciliation’ process. What I have in mind is a tour in which these smart, politically engaged folks travel to Leave-voting parts of the country, fall to their knees and beg the electorate for forgiveness. They should dip into that vast war chest of theirs, purchase a fleet of busses, write ‘Sorry’ on the sides in giant letters and then have Anna Soubry, Gavin Shuker, Sarah Wollaston, Angela Smith and Chris Leslie drive them round their Leave-voting constituencies. The buses should have loud speakers attached and every time they come to a Poundland or a Wetherspoons they should pull over so the MPs can then broadcast the following message: “I would like to apologise for portraying you as racists and bigots who were too stupid to understand what was at stake in the EU referendum. Please forgive me. I am just a sore loser.”
MAR17	This is the Tories' last chance to reject May's deal, press reset and undo her appalling mistakes	A delay is held up as a threat to Eurosceptics, but it's an opportunity In Brussels, they are looking on with incredulous joy. Never did they imagine that Britain would so deliberately and publicly weaken itself. When MPs voted not to leave without the EU’s express permission (or, as they put it, not to “crash out” with “no deal”) they left only two options: either to accept the EU’s vindictive terms or, for now, to stay put. Eurocrats are happy with either outcome. Some, notably Donald Tusk, would rather that we remain. Others, especially in the European Commission, believe that hanging on to us as a non-voting member is even better than reversing Brexit. Under their proposed terms, Britain would still be subject to most of the costs and obligations of membership, but would lose its ability to check further moves towards a federal Europe. What could be better, from their point of view, than to set the UK’s technical standards, even to control its trade with non-EU countries, without any British input?
MAR17	In Brexit Britain, there is no real policy choice. It's the establishment's way, or nothing	Trust in British politics is on the verge of collapse. The vast majority of the political class promised one thing in relation to Brexit and is delivering another. They said they would implement the result of the referendum, but Remainers have frustrated it with a shameless campaign of attrition. No 10 set a date for leaving but is now having to beg the EU for a delay. And while the Tory manifesto stated that no deal is better than a bad deal, last week 13 Conservative ministers defied their party’s whip to abstain on a vote to retain a no-deal option – meaning that Britain might lose the option to walk away, no matter how terrible the EU’s next offer.

MAR18	Sorry, Mr Bercow, the PM's deal is not dead yet	Last week I asked readers to picture the scene as the Speaker declares there cannot be a third vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal because it breaks parliamentary convention. Imagination is no longer needed – you can watch the video because that’s what happened yesterday. In a moment of grandstanding to rival all his previous moments, the Speaker pronounced that the Government could not legitimately resubmit to the House the same proposition, or substantially the same proposition, as that rejected by 149 votes on March 12. The grounds for this judgment are rooted in the convention that parliament should not be asked the same question twice in the same session if it has already come to a decision on that matter. It is the parliamentary equivalent of the double jeopardy rule. The Speaker has therefore made it harder, but not impossible, for the Government to facilitate a further vote on the deal. The easiest route is to prove that the next vote is on a motion that is “neither the same nor substantially the same” as that of March 12. That vote, he suggested, was acceptable because there had been further concessions from the EU since the deal was first voted on, and three new documents accompanied the motion.
MAR18	If the Comic Relief ‘white saviour’ row has put us off charitable giving, we’ll all be sorry	Is this image worth £8million? Because that’s what it might have cost Comic Relief. Although, actually, it wasn’t the image but the words MP David Lammy saw fit to caption it with – “the world does not need any more white saviours"  – that might have been responsible for the UK charity’s lowest profits in 12 years.  In the build-up to Red Nose Day, those words sparked a row that turned the apparently harmless image of TV presenter Stacey Dooley cradling a Ugandan child into a “trigger image”. And we all know that there is no room for nuance in trigger words or images. Like the double-sided Tiny Tot Flashcards you hold up in front of an infant, everything is reduced to sunshine and rain, fairies and witches: good and bad. And if you’re white, like 51 odd million Brits, the message received loud and clear wasn’t just “your help isn’t needed or wanted”, but “you should feel ashamed and embarrassed for even wanting to help. That impulse is bad.”
MAR18	Come what May, the PM has bungled her chances of getting Labour MPs to back her deal	“My big problem,” one Labour MP recently told me, “is that the only people round here who voted to Remain are members of my local party.” That’s the essential political dilemma facing the group of Labour MPs which LabourList dubs the Inbetweeners – MPs who campaigned to Remain but whose constituencies voted to Leave. Most MPs in this group believe that their political interests lie in backing rather than frustrating Brexit and 31 of them have rebelled against Jeremy Corbyn’s line to make Brexit harder. A minority think that regardless of political calculation, the referendum result must be enacted and honoured. John Bercow's announcement earlier today forbids the government from holding further meaningful votes on motions that are "substantially the same", or similar to, previous attempts. This represents a serious obstacle for the Prime Minister's Brexit plan - though Number 10 will be working hard to identify procedural loopholes and other workarounds that might bring the proposed deal back into play. 
MAR18	Speaker Bercow may have just paved the way for an even softer Brexit	Were Tory Brexiteers ready to swallow Theresa May's Brexit deal this week? We'll never know now thanks to John Bercow scuppering her hopes of an imminent "third time lucky" ratification. Brexiteers loyal to the Government are up in arms about the Speaker drawing on Erskine May to stop the Prime Minister from putting her deal to a third vote, just weeks after merrily defying convention in order to help arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve out. At the time, he defended himself by insisting that: "If we only went by precedent, manifestly nothing would ever change". The Speaker cited the parliamentary rulebook to argue that the Government could not put a deal to Parliament that was "the same" as something MPs have already voted on, even though he has been perfectly happy to let MPs table amendment after amendment demanding the same things - staying in the single market, the customs union, and holding a second referendum - despite them being constantly rejected. 
MAR18	It's a scandal that the Government is still punishing the sex abuse victims of Britain's vile grooming gangs	Most people would see these women as survivors of horrendous crimes. One of them, Sammy Woodhouse, has become well-known, not just for giving evidence against a notorious grooming gang, but as a courageous campaigner for other victims. Yet, now, these same women have accused Government ministers of further punishing survivors of child abuse like them. Their pleas for a pardon for girls, mostly underage, who were forced to commit crimes by adult abusers have been ignored. It means that they are forced to reveal their decades-old criminal convictions to prospective employers.
MAR18	Five years after the annexation of Crimea, Russia has been left an international pariah	The referendum confirming the annexation of Crimea by Russia five years ago today marked a significant shift in the geopolitical relationship between Moscow and the West. For Vladimir Putin it was a sign that he could face down Nato with total impunity. The Russian leader regarded the sanctions which still exist as a small price to pay to flex his revanchist muscles. He was subsequently emboldened to interfere in the Syrian conflict and to disrupt democratic processes in Europe and the US. However, while Mr Putin may have reinforced his strong-man reputation in Russia, increasing his domestic popularity ratings at the time to around 80 per cent, elsewhere it deepened suspicions about his intentions. The annexation cost the Kremlin any residual benefit of the doubt about the threat posed to Eastern Europe. Ukraine has refused to buckle in the face of this aggression and of the proxy war taking place in the east of the country. Moreover, Nato has belatedly woken up to the reality of what it is facing, even if some members still expect the US to pay for their defence. What has become apparent to Mr Putin is that he is not going to be allowed to get away with any more attempts to undermine countries on the borders of Russia and to which it claims some historic title, such as the Baltic States.
MAR18	It's a dereliction of duty that the Government has not prepared Britain for a no-deal Brexit	Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, told the BBC yesterday that it was “physically impossible” to leave the EU on March 29. Why is this the case? The House of Commons has voted twice by large majorities for the UK’s membership to cease on that day: when MPs triggered Article 50 and when they passed the EU Withdrawal Act. The reason we are not leaving at the end of March is because the Government, and notably the Treasury, failed to make adequate preparations to do so, despite knowing for two years that Brexit was due to happen. Theresa May has instead insisted that the deal she has negotiated with the EU – but which parliament has twice rejected – must be passed or otherwise we stay in, either temporarily or for good. Throughout this tortured process, the alternative to leaving with a deal was supposed to be leaving without one. Indeed, the Prime Minister has inveigled fearful Remain MPs into backing her deal by making that possibility explicit. Now she is trying to bludgeon Leave MPs into supporting it by making the opposite threat. It is hardly surprising that trust in Mrs May has evaporated, with Tory MPs openly talking about replacing her as soon as Brexit is concluded, assuming it ever is.

MAR18	Letters: The moral course for MPs who wish to honour the referendum result	SIR – We believe that, if Britain leaves the European Union as planned on March 29, “no deal” will prove to be the precursor to a very good deal indeed. At the time of the 2016 referendum, the choice was between leaving the EU (Brexit) and remaining within it. After Remainers lost the referendum, they set up a new choice between “hard” and “soft” Brexit – in reality, between real departure and leaving in name only. Now, “hard/real” Brexit has been redefined as a “catastrophic no-deal Brexit” and purportedly removed from the table by a Parliament of Remainers who hold a country with a majority of Leavers in contempt. Charles Moore concludes (Comment, March 16) that Brexiteers like us now face...

MAR19	Would a written constitution have prevented this Brexit quagmire?	It was always likely that May would make a mess of Brexit. But I thought the blame would lie with Theresa, not Erskine. The latter May – apparently no relation to Philip May, the Prime Minister’s husband – has been thrust onto the Brexit stage through his invocation by the Speaker John Bercow on Monday. Anyone who has worked at Westminster over the years, whether as MP, political aide or journalist, is aware of Erskine May. It is the parliamentary rule book, often quoted but rarely read. This is not surprising since it costs about £350 and has only this year been made available online. It is regularly updated by the parliamentary clerks, the priesthood of procedure and keepers of the holy writ. The latest edition – the 25th – includes a new chapter “on the process of implementing the outcome of the 2016 referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU”. That will need daily revision at this rate.
MAR19	Refusing to name terrorists won't help us fight the sick ideology that drives them	In the book of Genesis, when God makes creatures to accompany man on Earth, he gives Adam the task of naming them. Since even before Genesis was written down, from Ancient Egypt to the Harry Potter books, we have obsessed over the power of a name. We are still at it. Opening a session of parliament in New Zealand on Tuesday, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, called the white supremacist, mass killer Brenton Tarrant a “criminal” who was desperate for fame. “That is why you will never hear me mention his name,” she declared. “He will, when I speak, be nameless.”  In a 74-page manifesto Tarrant sent out before he gunned down at least 50 people, including a three-year-old child, he included a comprehensive Q&A that covered this point. “Did you carry out the attack for fame?” it says. “No,” he answers, that would be “laughable”. No one remembers the names of the 9/11 attackers, he points out. “I will be forgotten quickly. Which I do not mind. After all I am a private and mostly introverted person.”
MAR19	Britain is at the end of its tether – yet our politicians are having the time of their lives	“Paging G. Fawkes. Would a Mr G. Fawkes please make himself known at the front gate of the House of Commons? Forty million people have left him a package containing firelighters and a box of matches…” Before you accuse me of hate speech, or even Bercow-phobia (the fear of a small, vain man acting twice his size), let me make one thing crystal clear: I don’t actually want to see Parliament burnt down. If the Speaker and most of the elected representatives were taken to the Terrace and chucked in the Thames, that would be sufficient. It is ten days till we leave the European Union – “I guarantee that we will be leaving the EU on the 29th of March” (Theresa May) – and not only do we not seem to be leaving, no one has the faintest clue what we are doing. 
MAR19	An Article 50 extension would be terrible for Brexiteers, but it is still infinitely better than the PM’s deal	The Speaker’s ruling that the government cannot bring back Theresa May’s deal to the House of Commons for a third time, unless there are “substantial changes”, has triggered outcries that he is biased and trying to frustrate Brexit. I don’t know what is in the Speaker’s mind or what his motivations are, so it is best to look at the ruling on its merits. The rule he cites is Parliament’s equivalent of the “double jeopardy” rule in the courts. It stops the same question - or substantially the same question - being brought to votes repeatedly during the same session of Parliament. Theresa May’s first motion to approve her deal was overwhelmingly defeated on 15 January. After another vote on the ‘Brady’ amendment, she promised to get “legally binding changes” to the backstop.
MAR19	Theresa May should have taken my father's advice on Brexit	Next Friday, March 29, is supposed to be the British people’s Independence Day. But because the elites control London from Brussels, the will of the people is likely to be ignored. Nearly three years ago, the British people shocked the global power-brokers by voting to leave the European Union. Promises were made, elections were held, and debates over Great Britain’s exit plan from the EU began shortly after, with every politician promising to respect the decision of the people. Britons were told to wait, to be patient and to trust the politicians. But, was it all a ruse?
MAR19	John Bercow's intervention is just the latest twist in the neverending Brexit drama	As if the Brexit saga could not get any more dramatic, the intervention of John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, gave the plot yet another twist and triggered a constitutional clash between the executive and parliament. His ruling yesterday that a third “meaningful vote” on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement with the EU could be out of order may well have killed any lingering hopes she harboured of getting it through the Commons. Through a combination of threats, bribes and brinkmanship, the Prime Minister was seeking to persuade enough MPs, who have twice rejected her deal, to change their minds. A third vote was pencilled in for this week, though only if she could be sure of getting it through, which was by no means certain. But Mr Bercow has all but wrecked this strategy. He invoked an age-old convention set out in the parliamentary rulebook, Erskine May, stating that “a motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session may not be brought forward again during that same session.”
MAR19	Five years after the annexation of Crimea, Russia has been left an international pariah	The referendum confirming the annexation of Crimea by Russia five years ago today marked a significant shift in the geopolitical relationship between Moscow and the West. For Vladimir Putin it was a sign that he could face down Nato with total impunity. The Russian leader regarded the sanctions which still exist as a small price to pay to flex his revanchist muscles. He was subsequently emboldened to interfere in the Syrian conflict and to disrupt democratic processes in Europe and the US. However, while Mr Putin may have reinforced his strong-man reputation in Russia, increasing his domestic popularity ratings at the time to around 80 per cent, elsewhere it deepened suspicions about his intentions. The annexation cost the Kremlin any residual benefit of the doubt about the threat posed to Eastern Europe. Ukraine has refused to buckle in the face of this aggression and of the proxy war taking place in the east of the country. Moreover, Nato has belatedly woken up to the reality of what it is facing, even if some members still expect the US to pay for their defence. What has become apparent to Mr Putin is that he is not going to be allowed to get away with any more attempts to undermine countries on the borders of Russia and to which it claims some historic title, such as the Baltic States.
MAR19	It's a dereliction of duty that the Government has not prepared Britain for a no-deal Brexit	Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, told the BBC yesterday that it was “physically impossible” to leave the EU on March 29. Why is this the case? The House of Commons has voted twice by large majorities for the UK’s membership to cease on that day: when MPs triggered Article 50 and when they passed the EU Withdrawal Act. The reason we are not leaving at the end of March is because the Government, and notably the Treasury, failed to make adequate preparations to do so, despite knowing for two years that Brexit was due to happen. Theresa May has instead insisted that the deal she has negotiated with the EU – but which parliament has twice rejected – must be passed or otherwise we stay in, either temporarily or for good. Throughout this tortured process, the alternative to leaving with a deal was supposed to be leaving without one. Indeed, the Prime Minister has inveigled fearful Remain MPs into backing her deal by making that possibility explicit. Now she is trying to bludgeon Leave MPs into supporting it by making the opposite threat. It is hardly surprising that trust in Mrs May has evaporated, with Tory MPs openly talking about replacing her as soon as Brexit is concluded, assuming it ever is.
MAR19	Letters: Mrs May is running out of options for her terrible deal – so it’s time to walk away without one	SIR – Now that our wonderful Speaker has decided that the “only” Brexit deal available cannot come back to the House of Commons unless substantial changes are made to it, I pray that the EU countries will fail to agree an extension to Article 50. There will then be nothing stopping Britain leaving on March 29. With a bit of luck, the Prime Minister will resign and furious MPs will drag the Speaker out of his chair. Peter Owen Woolpit, Suffolk
MAR19	Letters: The moral course for MPs who wish to honour the referendum result	SIR – We believe that, if Britain leaves the European Union as planned on March 29, “no deal” will prove to be the precursor to a very good deal indeed. At the time of the 2016 referendum, the choice was between leaving the EU (Brexit) and remaining within it. After Remainers lost the referendum, they set up a new choice between “hard” and “soft” Brexit – in reality, between real departure and leaving in name only. Now, “hard/real” Brexit has been redefined as a “catastrophic no-deal Brexit” and purportedly removed from the table by a Parliament of Remainers who hold a country with a majority of Leavers in contempt. Charles Moore concludes (Comment, March 16) that Brexiteers like us now face only the “two wretched options” of Brexit in name only or the indefinite postponement of any Brexit, and says that he does not envy our dilemma in choosing between them. Yet our moral course is clear: it is not our fault that we are confronted by two unacceptable choices, but it will be our fault if we cast a positive vote in favour of either for fear of the other.
MAR20	Expelling pupils doesn't cause knife crime	Children who skip school are most at risk For a child to be killed is the most heart wrenching tragedy. And for any child to feel driven to violently attack, or even murder someone is a tragedy. The recent spate of horrific attacks in which young people have lost their lives to knife crime, has rightly prompted both outrage, and difficult questions about what we can do to prevent such crimes. As Education Secretary, I have responsibility over those young people who are the most vulnerable in society, those who lack a stable family structure around them, those children in care for whom we are the corporate parents. But I have another interest, as it has been suggested that it is a rise in exclusions from schools that has caused a rise in knife crime. The reality is more complex than that.
MAR20	Theresa May is now the Remainers' greatest asset – they are in no hurry to see her go	Leavers may try to use the delay to force her out Could this finally be the end of the line for the Prime Minister? She is begging the EU to delay Brexit until June 30, but is hinting that she will resign if the date slips further. As ever with Theresa May, nobody, perhaps not even herself, knows whether she actually means it, or if it is just more verbiage designed to facilitate another round of can-kicking. If she is serious, this might prove to be the first piece of good news in a long time for beleaguered Brexiteer MPs. Even if she is not, it might jolt them into devising a proper post-May strategy, rather than simply whining and complaining while the forces of Remain slowly crush them.
MAR20	15 signs you might be a fully functioning adult	This week’s big scientific news: we don’t become fully adult until our thirties (not 18, as the law has it) and everyone matures at different rates. Well that makes sense, but only up to a point. In our experience, some people are grown ups at 25, while others are just about turning the corner, making the final adjustments, well into their fifties. We might even include ourselves in that category... Also - and this never ceases to surprise us - you can be happily chugging along being an adult in most respects, but then you’ll suddenly be hit with the realisation that whoops… still ten per cent off the full package! Something will happen (eg you throw a strop in a tennis lesson when you can’t get your serve right), which reminds you that there is still work to be done. You haven’t got your Full Adult Wings yet.  If you’d like to know whether you’re a Full Adult, or you just look like one, take our simple test (and you must be able to tick the lot, we’re sorry to say…)
MAR20	If Theresa May buckles and delays Brexit, I will do my best to tear her party limb from limb	As the Prime Minister heads to tomorrow’s EU summit in Brussels with little prospect of achieving her desperate attempt to engineer a short-term Article 50 extension, I want to give her something else to think about: the survival of the Conservative Party. Today, the Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom told Nick Ferrari on LBC: “It's absolutely essential that we're out of the EU before the European elections [on 23 May].” I am in no doubt that Leadsom meant what she said. So what is really surprising, and what raises the question of Downing Street’s fundamental competence, is the Prime Minister’s continued insistence that an extension until 30 June could avoid Britain taking part in those European elections.
MAR20	We French feel nothing but pity for your Basil Fawlty Brexit	The French European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau recently joked that she'd nicknamed her cat "Brexit" because it yowls to be let out, then endlessly dithers on the threshold of the open door.  It is an apt summary of the bewilderment felt by us French at Britain's Brexit mess. It feels like you British have been at this Brexit business for aeons, not two and a half years, with the same arguments being endlessly recast, chewed up, ruminated, and regurgitated, like toxic hairballs. True, much of France has been sceptical about Brexit from the outset. Emmanuel Macron has used Brexit as a case study in populist self-harm: a harbinger of what would happen to those French voters who refused his grand vision of an ever-closer Europe.
MAR20	Even the Government admits it's in crisis, what next for Mrs May?	Normally when political pandemonium breaks out, No 10 tries to remain the still voice of calm at the centre of the storm. Such insouciance can backfire as when James Callaghan returned from an overseas visit in 1979 into the middle of the “Winter of Discontent” to ask (though he actually didn’t) “Crisis? What crisis?” A few months later his government was toppled by a vote of no confidence. As is all too apparent, these are not normal times; so Downing Street, far from pretending all is under control, when it patently is not, used the ‘‘C’’ word. Yes, said a spokesman, a crisis has come to pass. Disconcertingly, there is little to suggest they know how to deal with it. Theresa May evidently takes the view that this is all the fault of MPs who she warned on many occasions risked just such a crisis if they failed to support her Withdrawal Agreement with the EU. There seems to be no sense behind the famous black door that the responsibility might lie within. Mrs May’s method of chairing Cabinet meetings is to hold a discussion but then leave ministers in the dark as to what she considers to be the agreed position. This is one reason why several of her colleagues no longer feel bound by collective responsibility and either brief against the Prime Minister or vote against her in the Commons.

MAR20	Letters: The crisis over Brexit has exposed our parliamentarians as ill-informed and under-prepared	SIR – How pathetic was the surprise displayed by our parliamentarians following the Speaker’s decision to disallow a third vote on Theresa May’s Brexit agreement unless substantial changes were made to it. The Solicitor General (a QC) resembled a rabbit caught in the headlights. I hold no candle for John Bercow, but it seems his decision was perfectly rational. Why was it that so few MPs were aware of the rule he cited? Why hadn’t they been briefed by their advisers that this could happen? This latest episode has shown that those elected to represent us – and those charged with the delivery of Brexit – are ill-informed and under-prepared. No wonder they have allowed the EU’s negotiating team to run rings around us.

MAR21	Mrs May offering to quit might be what it takes to get her deal passed	When the inevitable Royal Commission is convened, and the official history of the Brexit negotiations written, what will emerge as the main reason for things going so wrong? The bungled general election, the failure of no-deal planning, the negotiating strategy (or lack thereof) – or all of the above? And the big question: at what point did it become inevitable that Brexit would descend into the chaos we see now? A campaign whose motto was “Take Back Control” has now ended up with a Government that has visibly lost all control. Last night, we saw the Prime Minister arrive in Brussels not to ask but to beg for an extension of EU membership. The day before we saw the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, announce that Mrs May was about to give a statement in No 10, as if she is already reporting to Brussels. That statement saw her blame MPs for her Brexit mess: it was as if she has already resigned herself to failure, and wants everyone to know that it was Parliament’s fault.
MAR21	Online rows about 'misgendering' are a waste of police time	First, they came for our school skirts. Then they commandeered our single-sex loos. And now they have requisitioned our pronouns. Is nothing sacred? I’m joking and not joking. Joking because some things are too serious not to laugh at, and not joking because somebody, somewhere has to raise their head above the parapet and challenge our slide into a crazy quagmire of bullying and self-censorship. As the police have become embroiled in yet another social media battle about who said what about whom, I fear even the grammar Nazis are no match for the militant transgender brigade as it rides roughshod over common sense.
MAR21	Britain now has only two choices - No Deal, or a long delay	There is no point in apportioning blame. The Prime Minister has a point about the House of Commons. However, let he (or she) who is without sin cast the first stone. The 2016 EU Referendum result was the first time that the electorate's opinions differed from those of its politicians. But instead of humbly acknowledging that the country they governed wanted something significantly different, many MPs have invented all sorts of excuses for distorting the meaning of the result, or simply dismissing its authority. Leave voters were misled, they were too old, too stupid - or even racist. Some have argued that enough Leavers have now died or changed their minds since the referendum to discount the winning margin - an analysis which, funnily enough, is never applied to the 48 per cent. Then came the conspiracy theories. Did social media swing the vote unfairly? Or was it Putin? But there are certain immutable facts. Parliament agreed the referendum and then accepted the decision. The Electoral Commission has never even hinted that the result was unsafe.
MAR21	Asking famous women how they manage childcare isn't sexist - as long as we ask men, too	The issue is the biggest drag on sexual equality in the West Is it sexist to ask a working mother how she juggles her responsibilities? The pop singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor – who recently delivered her fifth baby, as well as her eighth album – thinks so. She got a huge round of digital applause this week, when she tweeted: “I love making music. I love promoting a new record. I do not love talking over and over about how I sort my childcare. I am a singer. I am a mum. I will sort the childcare. Ask me something else.” I understand her irritation. Famous men never get asked this question. Neither, for that matter, do unfamous men. But that doesn’t mean the question shouldn’t be asked.
MAR21	Sorry, Madame May - Macron will block a lengthy Brexit extension	There are many reasons why France will veto a long extension to Brexit next week if, as expected, Theresa May doesn’t manage to pass her deal on the third (or hundredth, as it often feels) attempt. The obvious one is that Emmanuel Macron believes an extension will only lead to more of the same Westminster omnishambles. Allowing the extension to run after May 22 means Britain would need to hold European elections. Forget the complete mess this would cause in the UK. Forget the obvious question of what happens with the former UK MEP seats that have already been apportioned to other nations’ contingents now running for election. It’s the performance of his own embattled La République En Marche (LREM) party at the EU elections that Emmanuel Macron is thinking of, as well as his overweening pan-European ambition.

MAR21	Letters: Europeans who love freedom cannot understand Britain’s hesitation in leaving the EU	SIR – When Britain voted for Brexit, its instinct was deeply correct. I saw it as a great hope for my country too, and for the whole of Europe.  We have seen how the European Union has transformed itself into a rigid bureaucracy, unable to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The EU’s trade policy no longer allows a country to adapt to economic change.  The common agricultural policy has turned against those it was supposed to serve – our farmers. One commits suicide every other day in France. 
MAR21	Letters: How the European Union could turn a short delay into the gradual dissolving of Brexit	SIR – How is this for a forecast of what is likely to happen? 1. The Prime Minister applies for a short delay. 2. The EU considers this but suggests, recommends or insists that a longer delay is required.
MAR22	Land commission tells SNP what it wants to hear on the future of sporting estates	Its costs won’t have been negligible, but whatever amount of taxpayers’ cash the Scottish Land Commission spent on its report on land ownership will undoubtedly be viewed as money well spent by the Scottish Government. There’s an obvious reason for this – in that the commission’s "findings", if that’s not too grandiose a description for its contents, reinforce entirely the SNP’s, as well as most of urban Scotland’s, prejudices about rural life. Land reform is, if memory serves me, number three on First Nicola Sturgeon’s list of priorities after education and health, and so what better than to have an official and independent-of-government body that generally agrees with the SNP’s premise that "something must be done" about the fact that too much of Scotland’s land is owned by too few people?
MAR22	What’s at stake now is not just Brexit, but how we are governed as a country	Theresa May is like a driver who takes her vehicle confidently down a cul-de-sac. After a bit, she reaches the brick wall which blocks the road. Instead of turning round to find another way, she just starts shouting at the passengers. As a result, they shout back. For as long as this happens, the vehicle goes nowhere. The logic of the situation is that someone else has to take the wheel. Unfortunately, this cannot be accomplished before March 29, the current legal date of our departure, and probably not within the short extension that she now seeks. Twice, Mrs May has called the “meaningful vote” upon which Parliament insisted, and been defeated by enormous margins. Now, armed with the threat of extension, she wants it voted on a third time, which shows that the vote was not meaningful to her. On Wednesday, she addressed the relevant voters (MPs) in terms so insulting that she probably sealed her own fate.
MAR22	Petition signatures and celeb endorsements are nothing compared to the Will of the People	As March 29 edges closer, the levels of Brexit-related hysteria reach new heights with every passing hour. Yesterday, an online petition calling on the Government to revoke Article 50 passed three million signatures, causing no end of oversharing among Remainers (some of whom have taken to calling themselves “Revokers”), and raising hopes among the faithful that it might spark some late rally to stop the process dead in its tracks. Truly, Brexit Derangement Syndrome has gone viral. Already, an impressive list of characters has signed the petition. Jacob Rees-Mogg has given it his seal of approval over 8,000 times. Idi Amin, of all people, has signed it over 700 times. Journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer registered herself under the name “Remoaner McRemoanface”, seemingly without detection. One Leaver, Bruce Lawson, testing the online system’s limits, found that he could sign the petition on multiple email accounts. Others have set up automated systems to sign up over and over again.
MAR22	As Brexit goes down to the wire, the EU are finally starting to blink	It’s squeaky bum time on Brexit. Faced with the very real prospect of Britain “crashing out” without a deal, on Thursday the unthinkable happened: Brussels finally blinked. Having stared down Theresa May over her Withdrawal Agreement, the EU now appears to be wincing over the idea of a no deal exit - made more likely by the latest ultimatum issued by Brussels. Mrs May now has until April 12 to get her Withdrawal Agreement through parliament, and only then – if she wins, which looks unlikely – will she be granted a further extension until May 22 to allow all the necessary legislation to be passed.
MAR22	Tolerating another view is going out of fashion	Tolerance: it’s surely one of those values no one can condemn, like motherhood and freedom. In reality, however, tolerance is radical and difficult, especially when social norms and demographics are changing rapidly. Take just the last week. In Wiltshire, a woman is being investigated by police for criticising another mother’s decision to let her teenage child change sex. In Birmingham someone is smashing in mosque windows with a sledgehammer. In Cambridge, university administrators rescinded a fellowship offer to the Canadian academic Jordan Peterson because of his conservative views. It’s clear that significant parts of Britain are no longer prepared to tolerate views or cultures they dislike. The dislike, of course, is the point. Tolerance isn’t required for things we find agreeable. It is only needed when we confront the rude, unorthodox and downright offensive.
MAR22	Theresa May must think hard about both the country's future and her own	Theresa May will no doubt spend this weekend contemplating both the country’s future and her own. She has lost control of Brexit. Exactly when this happened will be hotly debated by historians: the disastrous general election that returned a minority Government? The historic defeat of her Withdrawal Agreement in January? Or perhaps this Thursday, when the EU concluded that she has only a “5 per cent” chance of fulfilling Brexit on their agreed terms. Now Parliament will try to take over with votes on a series of alternative plans.   Mrs May seems stuck with two options: committing to her Agreement, which is almost doomed to defeat, or pivoting towards a customs union, which would tear the Conservative Party apart. Her stubbornness and perseverance might have been strengths in the past – they got her through countless resignations and the loss of her voice – but key aspects of her character now imperil her historical reputation.
MAR22	Mrs May was wrong to attack Parliament	Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, made a heroic attempt to defend the Prime Minister from criticism, even derision, following her televised broadcast from Downing Street on Wednesday evening. On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said Mrs May was “determined to deliver the Brexit people voted for”.  Yet there is no sign whatsoever that this is what she is doing. She is attempting to railroad through Parliament a deal that she has negotiated in order to meet the parameters she has herself laid down. It has twice been rejected by massive majorities in the Commons and opinion polls suggest that MPs’ disdain is shared by the general public. In her brief and somewhat peevish address to the nation, she sought to recruit the country to this endeavour, itself a questionable constitutional procedure.  But to whom was she speaking? Both Remainers and Leavers say she is not delivering what they want. Indeed, her difficulties are caused by the  very fact that they cannot agree what they want; but a failure to reach a consensus in Parliament is not a reason to circumvent the institution. Moreover, she is Prime Minister by dint of Parliament’s indulgence. MPs can vote her out  of office at any time. Another problematic constitutional proposition uttered by Mr Hunt was that in a hung Parliament MPs had an obligation to support the Government in getting its Brexit deal over the line.
MAR22	Even the Government admits it's in crisis, what next for Mrs May?	Normally when political pandemonium breaks out, No 10 tries to remain the still voice of calm at the centre of the storm.

MAR23	The reason we're in such a mess over Brexit is because of Theresa May – it's time for her to go	The United Kingdom is in crisis, says Number 10. It is a doubly odd statement to make. For one thing, although the situation in Westminster is indeed lamentable, there is no crisis in the country at large. We have just recorded the best employment figures in our history. Growth, exports, the stock exchange, manufacturing output and wages are all rising. The deficit is back to pre-Gordon Brown levels. Yes, there is an almighty mess in Parliament, but whose fault does the Prime Minister think that is? Watching the government mulishly bringing back the same defeated motion again and again makes me think of that scene in The Simpsons where Homer keeps electrocuting himself by repeatedly trying to grab some beer cans from a tangle of live wires. D’oh! There was nothing inevitable about the failure of the government’s Brexit policy. It resulted from a series of unforced errors, some made by Leavers, some by Remainers, most by Downing Street.
MAR23	No, of course 'misgendering' a trans person shouldn't be a crime	When will the police stop harassing people for failing to comply with transgender dogma? Yesterday, we learnt that Surrey Police have finally dropped their investigation of Caroline Farrow, a 44-year-old Catholic journalist, for ‘mis-gendering’ a trans women, i.e. referring to her as ‘he’ rather than ‘she’. But not before they’d contacted the mother of five and threatened to arrest her if she didn’t appear at her local police station to be interviewed under caution. This is not the first time the authorities have over-reacted in response to a complaint from a transgender activist – in Farrow’s case, her Torquemada was Susie Green, head of Mermaids, a charity that campaigns for trans children to be given access to sexual reassignment surgery. Miranda Yardley, a trans woman, was charged with committing a ‘hate crime’ after getting into a Twitter spat with the mother of a transgender child, but the case was thrown out at the beginning of March by the District Judge, who said the prosecution had failed to provide any evidence that the tweet constituted harassment.
MAR23	The Caliphate may be defeated but the ideology lives on: Why Isil is still dangerous	This is a story we’ve become accustomed to in the ‘War on Terror’ years. Our politicians now proclaim that Islamic State (Isil) has been defeated and that its menace has receded. Similar emphatics were declared by President George W Bush aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln in May 2003 when the invasion of Iraq was celebrated as a “mission accomplished.” Al-Qaeda in Iraq then waged a brutal and bloody insurgency against coalition forces – a campaign which also claimed the lives of British servicemen – and was not declared until 2008. President Bush subsequently signed the US–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement which mandated the withdrawal of American combat forces from Iraq, a process that his predecessor, President Obama, then completed. Again, mission accomplished.
MAR23	A flicker of life wouldn't hurt your reputation, Prime Minister	Are you familiar with “Lorraine Kelly”? No, not that Lorraine Kelly, but her on-screen alter ego, who a judge this week ruled was in fact a “theatrical artist” who merely performs under her own name. This, the logic went, exempted the Scot – that’s Lorraine Kelly, not “Lorraine Kelly” – from £1.2 million in national insurance and income tax charges because what we see when she is on television is her playing, rather than being, herself, making her a freelancer with a “chatty” persona, and not an ITV employee. So when is a presenter not a presenter? When they have a large tax bill to settle, perhaps. But beyond Kelly’s masterful circumnavigation of HMRC, there is something to be learnt from a woman who has spent an hour on-air every morning for a quarter of a century convincingly feigning interest in someone from EastEnders, or giggling uncontrollably when handed a quiche lorraine. Because her name is Lorraine! Which is also the name of a quiche! It’s a very funny joke. And so it is here “where the performance lies”, the judge explained – a strategy that would have done well at No 10 this week. (As would any strategy, frankly.) Indeed, “Lorraine’s” ability to slap a smile on and be herself-but-not-quite-herself even in the most pathetic of pastry-based circumstances is at odds with the miswired Maybot who, in times of strife, reverts to the same dead-eyed pronouncements and one-track trajectories that now seem wilful in their depressing of both her and the nation at large.
MAR23	Sacred Mysteries: Whose blood waters whose furrows?	Consult the lyrics of the Marseillaise if you doubt that the Enlightenment’s secular heirs stand in a tradition steeped in the language of utopian violence. This advice comes from Rupert Shortt’s compelling new book Does Religion Do More Harm Than Good? He has a point. Marchons, marchons! / Qu’un sang impur / Abreuve nos sillons! “March! Let impure blood water our furrows!” It looks to me like a secular mash up of Torquemada and Patrick Pearse. But when Madeleine Lebeau as Yvonne in Casablanca sings it, there is not a dry eye in the cinema. That’s because the French are goodies and the Nazi German baddies. The song has been reduced to an emblem – or transcended.  
MAR23	Theresa May must think hard about both the country's future and her own	Theresa May will no doubt spend this weekend contemplating both the country’s future and her own. She has lost control of Brexit. Exactly when this happened will be hotly debated by historians: the disastrous general election that returned a minority Government? The historic defeat of her Withdrawal Agreement in January? Or perhaps this Thursday, when the EU concluded that she has only a “5 per cent” chance of fulfilling Brexit on their agreed terms. Now Parliament will try to take over with votes on a series of alternative plans.   Mrs May seems stuck with two options: committing to her Agreement, which is almost doomed to defeat, or pivoting towards a customs union, which would tear the Conservative Party apart. Her stubbornness and perseverance might have been strengths in the past – they got her through countless resignations and the loss of her voice – but key aspects of her character now imperil her historical reputation.
MAR23	Mrs May was wrong to attack Parliament	Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, made a heroic attempt to defend the Prime Minister from criticism, even derision, following her televised broadcast from Downing Street on Wednesday evening. On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said Mrs May was “determined to deliver the Brexit people voted for”.  Yet there is no sign whatsoever that this is what she is doing. She is attempting to railroad through Parliament a deal that she has negotiated in order to meet the parameters she has herself laid down. It has twice been rejected by massive majorities in the Commons and opinion polls suggest that MPs’ disdain is shared by the general public. In her brief and somewhat peevish address to the nation, she sought to recruit the country to this endeavour, itself a questionable constitutional procedure.  But to whom was she speaking? Both Remainers and Leavers say she is not delivering what they want. Indeed, her difficulties are caused by the  very fact that they cannot agree what they want; but a failure to reach a consensus in Parliament is not a reason to circumvent the institution. Moreover, she is Prime Minister by dint of Parliament’s indulgence. MPs can vote her out  of office at any time. Another problematic constitutional proposition uttered by Mr Hunt was that in a hung Parliament MPs had an obligation to support the Government in getting its Brexit deal over the line.
MAR23	Even the Government admits it's in crisis, what next for Mrs May?	Normally when political pandemonium breaks out, No 10 tries to remain the still voice of calm at the centre of the storm. Such insouciance can backfire as when James Callaghan returned from an overseas visit in 1979 into the middle of the “Winter of Discontent” to ask (though he actually didn’t) “Crisis? What crisis?” A few months later his government was toppled by a vote of no confidence. As is all too apparent, these are not normal times; so Downing Street, far from pretending all is under control, when it patently is not, used the ‘‘C’’ word. Yes, said a spokesman, a crisis has come to pass. Disconcertingly, there is little to suggest they know how to deal with it. Theresa May evidently takes the view that this is all the fault of MPs who she warned on many occasions risked just such a crisis if they failed to support her Withdrawal Agreement with the EU. There seems to be no sense behind the famous black door that the responsibility might lie within. Mrs May’s method of chairing Cabinet meetings is to hold a discussion but then leave ministers in the dark as to what she considers to be the agreed position. This is one reason why several of her colleagues no longer feel bound by collective responsibility and either brief against the Prime Minister or vote against her in the Commons.
MAR23	Letters: Theresa May might well be Britain’s worst prime minister, but staying makes her even worse	SIR – Theresa May is now well established as Britain’s worst ever prime minister. Every day she stays in office makes it more difficult for any future leader to challenge her position. David James Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire  
MAR23	Letters: Europeans who love freedom cannot understand Britain’s hesitation in leaving the EU	SIR – When Britain voted for Brexit, its instinct was deeply correct. I saw it as a great hope for my country too, and for the whole of Europe.  We have seen how the European Union has transformed itself into a rigid bureaucracy, unable to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The EU’s trade policy no longer allows a country to adapt to economic change.  The common agricultural policy has turned against those it was supposed to serve – our farmers. One commits suicide every other day in France. 
MAR24	Sacred Mysteries: In Watford, the loveliest church  of the 19th century	I’ve been to Dublin and to Lublin, to Guadalcanal and Canaveral, but I’d never been to Watford. I’d often passed through, on the train, but never got off. Yet in Watford is “the most lovely church the 19th century gave to England”, as the new volume for Hertfordshire of Pevsner’s architectural guides says, quoting H S Goodhart-Rendel. So I went to see. Watford architecturally is not so much a town as a tragedy. In the High Street, the occasional pitched roof of old tile only goes to emphasise the general catastrophe. In 1950, there were 121 buildings of historic interest; in 1975, 40, and since then 13 have been demolished. Instead of looking to the river Colne, Watford town centre is an island girt by a ring-road. Half that island is now occupied by a hideous shopping centre called Intu.
MAR24	Theresa May is a chicken who's bottled Brexit. The only way forward is to come out of the EU now	There have been many times over the last 30 years when I have found myself nodding in passionate agreement with Michael Heseltine, who is, among his other virtues, my fellow ex-member for Henley on Thames.  I have enjoyed his floating-haired trouncing of socialism on the Tory party conference platform. I generally approve of his lust for infrastructure and great public works. He is right to champion urban regeneration, and fiscal devolution. He was ahead of his time in calling for the creation of big city mayors. He knows that we must make capitalism popular again – as he once did when he helped to organise the sale of council houses. He combines a zest for free market enterprise with a strong One Nation belief in opportunity for all.  And though we disagree about EU membership, I found that on the central point of his speech to the anti-Brexit march on Saturday he was absolutely 100 per cent spot on.
MAR24	Theresa May has abandoned constitutional precedent by committing to extend A50	Every day of the Brexit process brings new and startling turns, but Theresa May’s latest gambit moves events into new realms of astonishment. On Friday, she instructed Sir Tim Barrow, our man in Brussels, to write a letter to the EU which formally agrees to Article 50 being extended to April 12 (at least), without first waiting for Parliament to approve the extension. The EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 governs our exit from the EU. It says that “exit day” will be on March 29. After that day, the European Communities Act 1972 - which gives effect to EU treaty obligations in UK domestic law - will be repealed. 
MAR24	To prevent another Christchurch, Islam must confront the attacks in its name that have radicalised the West	How can we – Muslims and non-Muslims together – prevent another atrocity like the one in Christchurch? As I have watched New Zealanders of all faiths mourn, this has been the question on my mind. So far, few of the answers offered have come close to the truth. What the massacre revealed was the need for a clear understanding of the weaponisation of ethnic, religious and political identities that is going on throughout the world. This was Brenton Tarrant’s evil aim: to contribute to a polarisation of the West – and to a parallel phenomenon in the Muslim world. His actions, which eerily resemble those of Isil and other Islamist terror groups, were calculated to intensify the hostility and suspicion that already exist towards Muslims in the West. They were also designed to elicit a response from Islamists and so encourage a cycle of retaliatory violence. We must not let him, or anyone else, succeed. Solidarity across racial, religious, cultural and political lines to address this global crisis is the only answer. But this means resolutely acknowledging the causal factors of the violence that we are seeing in so many parts of the world. As a Muslim, this leads me to questions that require difficult but honest answers.
MAR24	No matter what happens with Brexit, David Lidington is not the man for the job	David Lidington is being touted as the right “caretaker” Prime Minister to succeed Theresa May suddenly and soon. I have known him slightly for more than 40 years, from Cambridge University days. He is a moderate, intelligent person, who would be a competent member of any British Cabinet. But Mr Lidington is also an unrepentant Remainer. His role in the recent Brexit contests has not been that of peacemaker, but of trying – mostly successfully – to persuade Mrs May to stick with the Remain side of her Cabinet from which she comes. He has largely succeeded. It was he who protected the recent Cabinet rebels – Amber Rudd, Greg Clark, David Mundell and David Gauke – the week before last. They defied the government whip by abstaining on a no-deal motion. As a result, a parliamentary vote to prevent no deal was passed. Thus they helped the Government disintegrate and break its promise to the electorate. So if Mr Lidington becomes “caretaker”, of what would he take most care? Not of government unity; certainly not of delivering Brexit. He would be busy advancing the cause of the six or seven members of the Cabinet, led by the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, who are trying to frustrate it. How would that bring peace and harmony?
MAR24	Britain is slipping into a constitutional crisis. The Cabinet must act	Do we still have a functioning government? Do we still have a working Cabinet? Does something resembling a normal executive still run Britain? Or is the country on autopilot with civil servants in charge and utter chaos in Westminster? Next week, MPs will try to take over Brexit with the complicity of No 10, confirming that the usual power structures have broken down. This cannot continue for much longer. It’s not just that the agenda is about to be seized by various Remainer factions in Parliament, none of which are coherent and none of which will be able to legislate in any meaningful sense; the fundamental problem is that we are slipping into a constitutional vacuum. Parliament is not a government. A loose coalition of MPs – many of whom intend to defy their 2017 manifesto – does not have the legitimacy of a political party that stood on an explicit platform, or the ability to negotiate directly with the EU. Unfortunately, they have been encouraged to rebel by Speaker John Bercow, who appears to have some ludicrous ambition to become Parliament’s chairman of the board. Mr Bercow has shamelessly interpreted precedent to his liking and been blatantly partisan. As Brexit shifts from a party political crisis to an all-out constitutional one, it will partly be because of this man’s ego.
MAR24	Good riddance to the Islamic State	The liberation of Baghouz in East Syria brings to a belated end the genocidal caliphate once claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil). There are moments in history when it is worth raising a glass in celebration, even if what comes next is uncertain. Tanzania’s invasion of Uganda in 1979 and Vietnam’s of Cambodia in the same year brought further, miserable conflict –  but driving out Idi Amin and the Khmer Rouge were still good outcomes in their own right. Isil is the Khmer Rouge of the Middle East: both barbaric regimes that spread hate and destruction in their attempt to turn the clock back. The present, with its complexities and language of human rights, has little appeal to totalitarians. Isil tried to create a kind of Islamist fantasy land stuck in the glory days of the 7th century, although the appeal was as much about sex and violence as it was inaccurate theology. They raped women prisoners and slaughtered gay people. They cut off heads in propaganda videos. All of this was known, and any foreign volunteer for the caliphate who claims otherwise is lying. One can defeat fighters, but ideas live on. As we wrote last week in the aftermath of the New Zealand attacks, fascism cannot be swept under the carpet but must be confronted and intellectually interrogated. The same goes for violent Jihad.

MAR24	Letters: Removing the Prime Minister does not turn a bad withdrawal agreement into a good one	SIR – A number of MPs have declared that they will vote for Theresa May’s bad deal if she resigns or is dismissed. How does her resignation change the terms of her very bad deal? Ian Anderson Bristol
MAR24	Letters: Britain can still make a success of Brexit – and lead the way in revitalising Europe	SIR – Not for the first time, powerful interests, with strong media support, are working to wreck a referendum vote of a sovereign people. The difficulties surrounding Brexit are for the most part artificially created by those who wish to negate democratic choice. Brussels must not try to humiliate Britain in order to intimidate other nations. Sensible people reject the shameful Project Fear and its prophecies of economic catastrophe. The Brexiteers are not without support in Europe: opposition to a federal superstate that is barely democratic, opaque, over-administered, centralised, costly and incompetent is rising. Another Europe and another economy are possible.
MAR25	Brexiteers will soon discover that all other deals are worse than Theresa May's	The upshot of the Prime Minister’s statement on Monday afternoon is that the House of Commons will finally get to vote on the alternatives to the Brexit deal they have twice rejected. It is understandable that ministers have long resisted such a moment, for if MPs actually managed to deliver a majority for a specific plan, it would be that much harder to justify yet another attempt to pass the one negotiated by the Government. Furthermore, if that plan is one that a large part of the Cabinet cannot stomach, then the constitutional crisis many of us have long feared would be upon us, and a general election not far away. Holding the "indicative votes" that now appear imminent might open the Pandora’s Box of extended and intensified political chaos, with the fall of the Government to boot.
MAR25	The anti-Brexit march revealed the polite face of tyranny	As a firm Brexiteer who’s never been much of a marcher, I was quite surprised to find myself unexpectedly in the midst of the ‘Put It To The People’ protest in London after getting diverted to the wrong tube stop last weekend. Though estimates vary, and march numbers are often exaggerated by the participants, turnout was clearly in the hundreds of thousands. Most marchers seemed good natured and polite, save a few slogans of the “piss off Theresa May” variety and the ubiquitous “bollocks to Brexit” stickers. Although there were numerous teenagers present, I saw more from the Baby Boomer era - the average attendee had a retired Geography teacher vibe rather than that of a Morning Star-wielding anarchist.
MAR25	Don't be fooled by the 'indicative votes' charade. MPs face a two-way choice: No Deal, or No Brexit	With no chance of May’s deal passing on a “meaningful vote”, the government now appears intent on holding a series of “indicative votes” on the way forward. Apparently the intention is to hold votes on a wide range of options, including revoking Article 50, a second referendum, a “Norway Plus” arrangement, May’s deal, May’s deal with the customs union made explicitly permanent, and no deal. In reality these come down to just three options. The first is no deal. The second option is May’s deal, whether that is in its current form with a very vague Political Declaration suggesting an indefinite customs union or by making having a customs union explicitly permanent.
MAR25	Snicket? Chuggy-pig? There's a whole new language out there, just waiting to be discovered	Despite growing up in Yorkshire, the fact I wasn’t born there – and don’t speak with the famous Yorkshire lilt – has always made me feel like something of an outsider (they can be quite fierce about these things up North; not having Viking blood running through my veins counts against me). But the fact that I can correctly identify the meaning of the words ginnel, snicket and whisk surely marks me as a real child of God’s Own Country. Only a true Yorkshire lass would know that they refer to, respectively, an alleyway, an(other) alleyway and an old-fashioned neckerchief worn by women.
MAR25	Dump the distraction of impeaching Trump and the Democrats are well-placed to win in 2020	So it looks as if Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib is going to be disappointed. A few months ago she was caught on camera calling for Donald Trump to be impeached, using language which may be appropriate for her constituents in Detroit, but perhaps not for a broader audience. Put simply, the Mueller report has failed to find the smoking gun which could justify impeachment proceedings.
MAR25	Public confidence in the Conservatives must be in free-fall	This week, the Brexit war moves into a new, more dangerous stage. The Conservative Party is focused on who runs No 10, which is undeniably vital, but the battle for leadership in Parliament is at least equally important. Backbenchers may now seize control of the process or else the Government could hand it to them – either way, the plan is to hold a series of indicative votes to ask MPs what they prefer instead of Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement. This could result in an even softer Brexit than the one the Government was planning: Mrs May’s Agreement plus an eternity trapped in the customs union. It really says something about Britain’s political class that they would consider signing up to economic vassalage, but it also says something about the Government that things have reached this tragic point. The Tories would argue that they are handling factors beyond their control, but they created their own misfortunes. David Cameron decided not to plan for a Leave result after the referendum; he chose to walk away when he lost. No 10 bungled the 2017 campaign, returning a minority government. Mrs May selected the red lines for negotiations and opted to give Brussels almost everything it wanted from the outset. The deal she got back from the EU was Remain-in-all-but-name. The Treasury took a no-deal alternative off the table; Tory Cabinet members abstained from a three-line whip in order to kill it in the House. Some Conservative MPs have voted repeatedly against the letter of the 2017 manifesto. Whatever one concludes of Mrs May’s culpability, if the thought of the party machine wresting control from her fills few voters with enthusiasm then it’s because responsibility for what has gone wrong extends so far and so wide. Philip Hammond put another nail into the coffin of public confidence yesterday by telling an interviewer that the argument for a second referendum “deserves to be considered”. No, it does not. The fact that a Chancellor could at this late stage say such a strange thing gets to the heart of the problem, which is that many Tories still do not grasp what is going on. To spell it out for them: the country voted to leave the EU, which requires some degree of rupture from Brussels. This commitment was made in the Conservative manifesto. And the only hope the Conservatives have of winning a majority in the future is if they deliver on that promise. Failure will split their coalition and put Jeremy Corbyn in office. If Mr Hammond believes he is standing up for stability and common sense, he needs to realise that popular anger can trump economic logic – that many voters, if disillusioned, will turn to Labour and replace sound Tory housekeeping with radical socialism.

MAR26	I am sick of being silenced by social-justice warriors whose self-assurance is only matched by their ignorance	Cambridge University’s deplorable decision to withdraw its offer of a visiting fellowship to Jordan Peterson is yet more evidence that, contrary to time-honoured practice, students are now telling their teachers what to think and do. The abominable blizzard of snowflakes has university authorities frozen with fear, and winter is coming for free speech. A Canadian professor of psychology, Peterson has unfashionable views on gender, masculinity and political correctness. To the horror of his critics, he has drawn the kind of crowds normally associated with rock stars, not bearded academics discussing Genesis (the Bible book, not the band). He came to fame in 2016 when he opposed an anti-discrimination law requiring him to use the preferred pronouns of his students and colleagues. Learning on the grapevine last week that he was no longer welcome, Peterson said he had fallen foul of the “diversity, equality and inclusivity mob”, and rebuked Cambridge for its “cowardly” decision.
MAR26	Brexit created as many relationships as it destroyed – surely that's a reason to celebrate	March 29 will come as a disappointment for many Brexiteers. Our planned departure from the European Union has been postponed, through a combination of subterfuge, weak leadership and political paralysis. On Friday, the “March for Leave” will meander into London on a date now rendered meaningless. So far, so depressing. Despite all this, I believe Friday offers good reasons to crack out the champagne – beyond merely drowning our sorrows. Amid the relentless negatives underlining abuse and relationship breakdown, we hear very little about the positives of Brexit. In the run-up to the referendum, I had hoped to spare my sanity by avoiding this hot potato on Facebook. But it proved impossible to ignore. I encountered a wall of bigotry; often from otherwise reasonable, valued friends. Some rebranded euroscepticism as a fringe, lunatic view, or spoke, nauseatingly, about being on “the right side of history”.
MAR26	Brexiteers can sleep easy with gormless Oliver Letwin in charge of the Remainer 'coup'	So, Parliament has now ‘seized control of Brexit’.  We can all now relax, knowing that the agonising process has been taken out of the hands of our stubborn and unimaginative Prime Minister, and entrusted to all these sensible backbench MPs who will swiftly and decisively come up with a workable plan. After all, with Sir Oliver Letwin in charge, what could possibly go wrong? At least now we can be sure that a Brexit deal will not be sewn up in secrecy. We will all be able to find out what is going on by the simple expedient of rummaging through the bins in St James’ Park.    The gormless Mr Letwin is best known for his habit of walking around the park with his correspondence, dictating replies to letters from constituents and MPs, and then stuffing the said letters in the nearest waste bin – until his unusual filing system was rumbled in 2011.      
MAR26	We won't let the PM or the Remainer horde in Parliament bully us into backing a toxic Brexit deal	We are now engaged in a war of attrition, as the Prime Minister seeks to achieve support for the toxic deal which she allowed the EU to impose on her and the referendum-defying Remainer horde in Parliament try to beat the truculent British public into submitting to their plan to keep us in the EU. The latest tactic is their plan for Parliament to vote on alternatives to the Withdrawal Agreement. They describe it as Parliament taking control and the message which they are blasting out is that further resistance is futile because the Remainers are in charge. This message also suits the Prime Minister because she has used the claim that a Remain Parliament is taking control to try and bully those who want to leave the EU into supporting her flawed and damaging deal. The threat is that, if the Withdrawal Agreement is not supported, these Remainers will vote for alternatives which means no Brexit. First of all let us be clear: the Withdrawal Agreement itself means no Brexit. It ensures that the EU has the legal power to prevent us ever leaving except on their draconian terms, which would include a Customs Union and adherence to EU regulations. Those who negotiated the agreement have been quite open about that. They insist that the terms of the deal will be the basis for any future relationship with the EU. They also make it clear that different treatment for Northern Ireland will have to continue. As Leo Varadker has said, the agreement’s terms settle the arrangements required to keep the Northern Ireland border open.
MAR26	The Government is in crisis, but what makes Parliament think it can do any better?	It is hard to think of a more humiliating moment for a sitting Prime Minister than what happened in Parliament yesterday. MPs from across the House, including ministers, voted to take matters out of her Government’s hands into their own – "taking control" as they put it – because they do not trust Theresa May to get a grip and find a workable response to Brexit. The Prime Minister, whose self-assigned task was to clear up the mess after her awful general election campaign, appears to have created an even bigger disaster involving a political and constitutional crisis. If it turns into an economic crisis, three horsemen of the political apocalypse will have saddled up.  Yet, in the aftermath of yesterday’s vote, a procession of Remainer MPs have been crowing that Parliament is now in the driving seat and will set about sorting things out, first through indicative votes and then, if necessary, its own Brexit legislation. These are the very same MPs who, according to a poll this week, the public overwhelmingly believes wish to stop Brexit.
MAR26	Trump's opponents must swallow their defeat and focus on policy, not personality	The relief was apparent in Donald Trump’s demeanour when he received the report of the Special Prosecutor’s inquiry into the alleged collusion of his election team with Russia. For months, the president’s detractors had been predicting his downfall once Robert Mueller’s findings were released.  But unfortunately for them, the president was able to claim “complete exoneration”, even if he did gild the lily somewhat. The report implied there were efforts by the White House to impede the investigation, but was inconclusive on whether Mr Trump had obstructed justice. Democrats say they need to see the report in full beyond the four-page summary issued by William Barr, the Attorney General and considered partisan. But the reality is that the air has gone out of their bid to see Mr Trump impeached or so badly damaged that the remainder of his presidency would be tarnished.  The president is entitled to feel aggrieved that this matter was pursued with such alacrity by Democrats, many of whom have been asserting his guilt as though the outcome of the inquiry was a foregone conclusion.
MAR26	Faced with a difficult situation, Mrs May offers only obfuscation	Crispin Blunt MP described the Prime Minister’s statement on Brexit as “the most shameful surrender by a British leader since Singapore in 1942.” That seems a bit unfair both to Theresa May and to Winston Churchill since there was no way to save Singapore once it had been occupied by the Japanese, while Mrs May denied it was she who was the obstacle to leaving the EU; it was Parliament. While she appeared contrite at the fractious language she used in her televised broadcast last week, the Prime Minister made clear she still blamed MPs for the imbroglio. Just four days before we were due to leave the EU, nothing is clear apart from the fact that we are not going on Friday. We may be leaving without a deal on May 21; more likely we will be staying in for longer. Possibly we will not be leaving at all. We just don’t know because the Government has lost control of the process. The Prime Minister’s statement in the Commons was a paragon of obfuscation dressed up as a series of pragmatic responses to a difficult situation. The fact is that Mrs May has not achieved Brexit on the date she chose and which she has assured the Commons on scores of occasions would happen on March 29.
MAR26	Public confidence in the Conservatives must be in free-fall	This week, the Brexit war moves into a new, more dangerous stage. The Conservative Party is focused on who runs No 10, which is undeniably vital, but the battle for leadership in Parliament is at least equally important. Backbenchers may now seize control of the process or else the Government could hand it to them – either way, the plan is to hold a series of indicative votes to ask MPs what they prefer instead of Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement. This could result in an even softer Brexit than the one the Government was planning: Mrs May’s Agreement plus an eternity trapped in the customs union. It really says something about Britain’s political class that they would consider signing up to economic vassalage, but it also says something about the Government that things have reached this tragic point. The Tories would argue that they are handling factors beyond their control, but they created their own misfortunes. David Cameron decided not to plan for a Leave result after the referendum; he chose to walk away when he lost. No 10 bungled the 2017 campaign, returning a minority government. Mrs May selected the red lines for negotiations and opted to give Brussels almost everything it wanted from the outset. The deal she got back from the EU was Remain-in-all-but-name. The Treasury took a no-deal alternative off the table; Tory Cabinet members abstained from a three-line whip in order to kill it in the House. Some Conservative MPs have voted repeatedly against the letter of the 2017 manifesto. Whatever one concludes of Mrs May’s culpability, if the thought of the party machine wresting control from her fills few voters with enthusiasm then it’s because responsibility for what has gone wrong extends so far and so wide. Philip Hammond put another nail into the coffin of public confidence yesterday by telling an interviewer that the argument for a second referendum “deserves to be considered”. No, it does not. The fact that a Chancellor could at this late stage say such a strange thing gets to the heart of the problem, which is that many Tories still do not grasp what is going on. To spell it out for them: the country voted to leave the EU, which requires some degree of rupture from Brussels. This commitment was made in the Conservative manifesto. And the only hope the Conservatives have of winning a majority in the future is if they deliver on that promise. Failure will split their coalition and put Jeremy Corbyn in office. If Mr Hammond believes he is standing up for stability and common sense, he needs to realise that popular anger can trump economic logic – that many voters, if disillusioned, will turn to Labour and replace sound Tory housekeeping with radical socialism.
MAR26	Letters: One more slip and Gina Miller could come riding to a courtroom rescue of a no-deal Brexit	SIR – Martin Howe QC (Commentary, March 25) highlights the unconstitutional nature of Theresa May’s instruction to our Brussels ambassador, Sir Tim Barrow, formally to extend the Article 50 period to April 12 before obtaining parliamentary approval.  The statutory instrument required under the 2018 EU (Withdrawal) Act for any such extension might not be approved by Parliament. If not, then the Supreme Court judgment in the Gina Miller Article 50 case suggests that a legal challenge to the validity of Sir Tim Barrow’s letter would be upheld, rendering it ultra vires and void. 
MAR26	Letters: Removing the Prime Minister does not turn a bad withdrawal agreement into a good one	SIR – A number of MPs have declared that they will vote for Theresa May’s bad deal if she resigns or is dismissed. How does her resignation change the terms of her very bad deal? Ian Anderson Bristol
MAR27	Theresa May, the Brexit Prime Minister, has put her country ahead of herself	Like the leadership campaign that made her Prime Minister, Theresa May’s premiership has been truncated, suddenly but inevitably, by forces beyond her control. She did not want to announce her departure from Downing Street in this way. She did not really want to say she was going at all. But her resignation, she only reluctantly judged, was the price worth paying to persuade Conservative MPs to back her EU Withdrawal Agreement. Many Tory Leavers are starting to accept the inevitable as they realise that, as bad as the Prime Minister’s deal is, it is the best remaining form of Brexit possible.
MAR27	The welcome departure of Theresa May is the last chance to save Brexit	Rejoice, rejoice: everything has changed. At some point over the next few weeks, after three painful, debilitating, embarrassing and above all largely wasted years, Theresa May will quit, triggering the mother of all battles for the Tory party’s soul. Her decision to step down couldn’t have come a moment too soon: the constitution is collapsing, with the Speaker and Parliament grabbing power, Brexit is being betrayed, and the economy is drifting. For a while Mrs May has been in office, not in power, at a time when the country is desperate for a fresh vision, for competent leadership, for hope: she needed to go. The decision cannot have been easy, and the implosions of all high-profile political careers are tragic, even shattering affairs, but she has made the right choice.
MAR27	Speed limiters on cars may save lives, but we'll still fight to get rid of them	The three Ps: Politics, psychology and philosophy. That’s what the implementation of technology is about these days, just as much as circuit boards. The new EU ruling that all new cars are to have speed limiting technology and black boxes is a prime example. It is certainly not a safety debate. There is no doubt that such measures will save lives. Anyone who has been forced to sit through the videos on a speed-awareness course knows that.   But that won’t stop drivers feeling driven up the wall by yet more diktats from yet another regiment of faceless bureaucrats in Brussels.
MAR27	The EU's mindless new diktats on clocks, cars and copyright show why we have to leave	If the EU had been deliberately trying to remind 17 million Britons of why they voted three years ago to leave the EU it could not have done better, in the week when MPs may finally decide a form of Brexit they can agree on, than to approve three pieces of overbearing legislation.  Regulations will require, from 2022, all new models of car to be installed with speed-limiters and devices to identify drunk or sleepy drivers. Daylight saving will be abolished from 2021, with all EU nations having to decide whether they want to stay on summer time or winter time. On top of that the EU Parliament voted to rubber-stamp a new copyright directive which will introduce a tax on internet links, interfering with how it has operated for the past two decades.     We can all argue over the merits of the rules themselves. There are plenty of people, for example, who think changing the clocks twice a year is a ridiculous business. Personally, I am much in favour of fitting speed-limiters to cars, which would force vehicles to slow down when they entered a zone covered by a speed limit. After all, driverless cars would have to be fitted with such technology. When it comes to the copyright directive, it would be churlish not to note that the UK has been a keen supporter of the legislation and a version of it would most likely have been adopted by us whatever happens after Brexit.
MAR27	The search begins for a new Tory leader - but this time, don't let MPs perform a stitch up	Theresa May became leader by default - our system needs reform  It’s hard to recall a moment in my lifetime when there was such a divide between politicians and the public. A huge majority see the Government’s handling of Brexit as a national humiliation. The voters think Parliament is seeking to block Brexit, and I don’t blame them. And the Prime Minister apparently wants to bring her Withdrawal Agreement back for a third time in a desperate attempt to get this terrible deal across the line – if the Speaker will allow it. I respect colleagues who have changed their mind and have decided they would back the PM’s deal if it returns, though it should be pointed out that their support is often heavily caveated. Nobody has woken up and suddenly realised that a toxic agreement which will consign the UK to a state of vassalage – betraying the voters who were told they could take back control of their money, borders and laws – is actually a good one. Some Brexiteers think there are no better options left and fear that a Remain-dominated parliament will stop Brexit entirely. Others may have different calculations. I will continue to oppose the deal for the simple reason that it does not represent Brexit in any meaningful sense and it locks the UK in as a rule-taker.
MAR27	Brexiteer MPs are running out of options	The Prime Minister was right to voice her scepticism about the procedure taking place in parliament today. In the absence of an agreement on her deal with the EU, the Order Paper has been commandeered by the legislature in an effort to find a Brexit position on which a majority of MPs can agree.  The chances must be high that they will fail. A similar exercise was conducted, though in less dramatic circumstances, in Feb 2003 when the Labour government put seven proposals for reforming the House of Lords to a free vote and every single one was rejected. As a result, nothing has happened since. The same could happen today, deepening confusion rather than ameliorating it. But at least the Government controlled the business. Today’s exercise is not only constitutionally questionable in that the executive is being sidelined, but the methodology leaves much to be desired. MPs are to be issued with ballot papers listing all the options and will then be invited to signify 'yes' or 'no' for each.
MAR27	The EU's diktat on changing clocks shows why it's time to leave	The Commission shouldn't be seeking to regulate areas where member states' requirements are so wildly different Were we actually leaving the EU on Friday as planned, our clocks would still have gone forward on Sunday along with those in the rest of Europe. This biannual adjustment has been harmonised for many years and the UK would doubtless have remained in step for the foreseeable future. The two dates for changing the clocks – the last Sundays in October and March – make sense.
MAR27	Trump's opponents must swallow their defeat and focus on policy, not personality	The relief was apparent in Donald Trump’s demeanour when he received the report of the Special Prosecutor’s inquiry into the alleged collusion of his election team with Russia. For months, the president’s detractors had been predicting his downfall once Robert Mueller’s findings were released.  But unfortunately for them, the president was able to claim “complete exoneration”, even if he did gild the lily somewhat. The report implied there were efforts by the White House to impede the investigation, but was inconclusive on whether Mr Trump had obstructed justice. Democrats say they need to see the report in full beyond the four-page summary issued by William Barr, the Attorney General and considered partisan. But the reality is that the air has gone out of their bid to see Mr Trump impeached or so badly damaged that the remainder of his presidency would be tarnished.  The president is entitled to feel aggrieved that this matter was pursued with such alacrity by Democrats, many of whom have been asserting his guilt as though the outcome of the inquiry was a foregone conclusion.
MAR27	Letters: As MPs face a choice between no deal and no Brexit, they should heed their constituents	SIR – I don’t care what sort of soft Brexit MPs prefer in their indicative votes. Our constitution needs to catch up with the impact of a referendum on the role of MPs. The 1774 view that MPs should use their own judgment on behalf of their constituents is suspended when they ask the electorate to take a decision for them in a referendum. In this case they should do whatever the electorate instructs, whether they like it or not. Brexit always was a binary choice: we either get back control of our laws, money, borders and trade, or we do not. The Withdrawal Agreement does not get back control, so the true choice for MPs is between no deal and no Brexit. The constituents of any MPs who vote for no Brexit will express their view at the next general election.
MAR27	Letters: One more slip and Gina Miller could come riding to a courtroom rescue of a no-deal Brexit	SIR – Martin Howe QC (Commentary, March 25) highlights the unconstitutional nature of Theresa May’s instruction to our Brussels ambassador, Sir Tim Barrow, formally to extend the Article 50 period to April 12 before obtaining parliamentary approval.  The statutory instrument required under the 2018 EU (Withdrawal) Act for any such extension might not be approved by Parliament. If not, then the Supreme Court judgment in the Gina Miller Article 50 case suggests that a legal challenge to the validity of Sir Tim Barrow’s letter would be upheld, rendering it ultra vires and void. 
MAR28	The EU is shutting out views that do not chime with the Brussels elite. We can't leave too soon	We need to leave the European Union as soon as possible. The EU is rapidly becoming the trusted enforcer for the aims of left-leaning activists seeking to restrict commerce, individual freedom and the freedom of competition that is so essential for business. The EU is turning into the epitome of the interventionist big state that squeezes out views and organisations that do not conform with the ideological preferences of the Brussels elites. Many such activists start their campaigns in the United States, but often fail to find fertile ground for their efforts. This resistance does not exist in the EU, which is only too happy to bash business and only too keen to restrict the freedoms of both companies and individuals.
MAR28	In this leadership race, the future of Conservatism is up for grabs	If Boris Johnson was even half as egotistical and calculating as his enemies say, things might not be in such a mess now. Had he not collapsed in a heap immediately after the referendum and slunk off to play cricket at Althorp, without anything resembling a leadership campaign, he might have won. Instead Theresa May, fresh from having sat out the referendum campaign, saw her chance and pounced. Mr Johnson failed to become leader because of a lack of basic organisation. This is not a mistake that anyone now eyeing No 10 intends to repeat. Now that Mrs May has offered to resign if her deal is voted through (and it might be tomorrow) the battle to succeed her has begun.
MAR28	I admire Theresa May's backbone - but her last days are looking as pitiful as Gordon Brown’s	If the highway to hell is strewn with good intentions, the slip road to Brexit will surely be littered with tattered indicative votes, smeared red lines and trashed statutory instruments. As Theresa May prepares to serve up her deal for a third time like a proverbial rotten mackerel, by turns stinking and shining, will the House turn up its nose again? Is a bad deal better than no deal? Is this actually a good deal, being the only deal? Is no Brexit better than no deal? And what about the not-so-crazy  talk of an eleventh hour customs union? God only knows. I interviewed Theresa at the start of her rollercoaster Brexit “journey”. It was the day she became PM after her leadership opponent Andrea Leadsom said something so unpleasantly crass about May’s childlessness she was compelled to bow out of the contest.
MAR28	MPs should back the PM's deal. With the right leadership, we can still prosper	Theresa May has now said she will step down if her deal is voted through so a new prime minister can take charge of the all-important negotiations on our future relationship with the EU. While attention will inevitably fall on the identity of the next Conservative Party Leader and Prime Minister, that new PM’s negotiating strategy will be crucial to realising the Brexit prize. My view of the Withdrawal Agreement has not changed. It cedes much of our negotiating leverage and certainly guides the future negotiation to a permanent customs union with the EU. As someone who passionately believes in the power of liberalising international trade to lift people out of poverty and boost prosperity, it is a matter of deep regret that we have ended up here. I have been asked many times whether I believe that, even under the shadow of the backstop, a successful negotiation of Phase Two would be possible. While this will be incredibly difficult, I do believe with the right team and the right approach, it is possible. But how?
MAR28	We must resist the PM's wretched deal - a clean Brexit is within sight	It is no surprise that a Remain Parliament failed to reach any conclusion on the way ahead for Brexit on Wednesday, even when a number of its options were flavours of Remain. It is no surprise, either, that there is still no majority in the House for the wretched Withdrawal Agreement. Not a single word of it has changed since the Prime Minister first brought it back from Brussels. It was a bad deal then and it is a bad deal now. I will not vote for an agreement which sees the UK broken up, have laws imposed upon it by a foreign power, subjected to substantial fines for non-compliance, from which there is no unilateral right of exit, and pay £39 billion for the privilege.
MAR28	The Tories look like wets and wimps on crime	Whoever is the next Tory leader is going to have to correct the party’s image on crime. Falling police numbers, political correctness and an obsession with penal reform give the impression that they have gone soft, just as the country is seeing a grisly rise in knife crime. Conditions in some prisons are bad, no doubt, and reoffending depressingly high, but the real issue isn’t an excess of discipline – rather, too little of it. The regime at Berwyn prison, a new-build jail in Wales, is a case in point: prisoners have been issued with keys to their own cells and officers are expected to knock before going in.
MAR28	The PM's pledge to resign leaves many questions unanswered	Theresa May has played her final card. After conceding control of the Brexit process to Parliament, she agreed last night to step down once it is delivered and before the next - and hardest - phase of negotiations.  She addressed her party’s MPs and peers at a meeting of the 1922 committee with less authority than any prime minister in living memory. The message to her recalcitrant backbenchers was “Back the deal and I will go”, yet another Tory leader undone by Europe.  Arguably, given the circumstances, she had little choice; but this was still a gamble since there is no guarantee that the deal will go through. Without a parliamentary majority, its fate lies with other parties, notably the Democratic Unionists, and even with their support it is impossible to judge whether enough Tory MPs will be encouraged to change their minds.
MAR28	Brexiteer MPs are running out of options	The Prime Minister was right to voice her scepticism about the procedure taking place in parliament today. In the absence of an agreement on her deal with the EU, the Order Paper has been commandeered by the legislature in an effort to find a Brexit position on which a majority of MPs can agree.  The chances must be high that they will fail.

MAR29	To save the system from collapse, the Tory party must now be led by a Leaver	On Friday afternoon, MPs defeated the Government. Forty years and one day before that, they did the same. Jim Callaghan’s Labour government lost a vote of confidence on March 28 1979. The ensuing general election brought Margaret Thatcher into office for the first time. By sheer chance, I was there that day. I was a student, but had somehow procured a seat in the public gallery. I arrived after lunch, because in those days Parliament began its daily sittings then. I listened to some boring questions in a thinly attended House, and left. Only when I woke the next morning and turned on the radio did I discover that, after the debate later in the day, the Government had fallen. I had narrowly missed a historic moment. I reflected that the place was an utter mystery to me. That autumn, I became a journalist, and have followed proceedings closely ever since. So I would like to be able to tell you with perfect confidence that there is no mystery for me now. But I cannot honestly say that, because the present situation is unprecedented.
MAR29	They won the chance to change things, but Brexiteers were too incompetent to make the most of it	Since the referendum of 2016, it’s been popular to depict the reaction of the losing side as a very slow progression through the early “stages of grief”, as described by two Swiss psychiatrists in the 60s. In response to loss, the subject first goes into denial, then exhibits anger, next starts trying to bargain her way out of the situation before succumbing to depression and finally reaching acceptance. This was meant to be the first day of our life as a newly independent country. That it isn’t indicates that the last stage of grief – acceptance – was never reached. On the contrary, it now appears clear that even as the Eurosceptics were still crowing over their victory in 2017 and taking ever-more extreme positions on Brexit, it was in fact they who had gone into denial. They lost their ideal Brexit when the Tories lost their majority in 2017. Yet rather than salvaging what they could from the situation, they embarked upon a doomed march into the wilderness. Along the way, I have lost count of the number of times Tory Brexiteers assured me confidently that everything was on track. “Number 10 is fully onside,” they declared. “The legislation has already been passed,” they exclaimed. “Nothing can stop us,” they boasted.
MAR29	The Tories are the party of the nation. No wonder Europe has destroyed so many of its leaders	Theresa May is but the latest victim of Britain’s ill-fated engagement with the Continent. Europe has proved toxic for the Conservatives, ruining six of their last seven Prime Ministers. Harold Macmillan was the first, when, in 1963, President de Gaulle vetoed his application to join the European Community, as the EU then was. “All our policies at home and abroad are in ruins,” Macmillan wailed. De Gaulle correctly predicted that Labour would win the next election. His information minister, Alain Peyrefitte, records him as slicing the air with the back of his hand, “as pitiless as a Roman emperor turning down his thumb as though denying a reprieve to a defeated gladiator”, and saying “That Macmillan vanishes!”. It was Edward Heath who took us into Europe in 1973. But, in the February 1974 election, he was narrowly defeated. A host of factors could have been responsible – but Enoch Powell, who broke with his party and urged voters to support Labour to secure a referendum – plus ça change – was undoubtedly crucial in Heath’s defeat.
MAR29	Rally for Palestine zealots embrace Hamas killers and ignore the real injustice in Gaza	Today, so-called Palestinian solidarity activists are going to stand outside my Embassy and ‘Rally for Palestine’. Their demonstration will ring hollow in both Israel and Gaza, for it coincides with the one-year anniversary of Hamas’ latest campaign of terror and violence on our border, and takes place as authentic popular protest inside the Strip is crushed by the Islamist regime. At dawn on Monday, Hamas launched a rocket. Seventy-five miles away, Israeli-British joint nationals Robert and Susan Wolf, together with their children and grandchildren, were awoken by sirens and rushed to a protective shelter. Seconds later, the missile flattened their house. Had they remained, they would have been killed. Though an aberration for Robert and Susan Wolf’s community in central Israel, for those living in the south near Gaza, 15-second warning sirens and frantic dashes to the bomb shelters have unfortunately become all too routine.
MAR29	Brexit vote results: Theresa May hints at long delay after MPs fail to agree on indicative votes	MPs once again failed to agree on a way forward for Brexit on Monday as Theresa May prepared to use the threat of a long delay or a general election to persuade her party to back her deal. Parliament voted on four alternatives to Mrs May’s deal, including a customs union and a second referendum, without reaching a majority for any of the options on offer. The Tories will now push Mrs May to pivot to a no deal Brexit, but the Prime Minister will hold a marathon five-hour session with her Cabinet on Tuesday in attempt to create unity around her EU Withdrawal Agreement.
MAR29	Britain needs to move on from the Withdrawal Agreement. If it is defeated one more time, let it die	This has to come to an end. The Government has chosen to put to the House a vote on the Withdrawal Agreement – for the third time. Yes, it is now separated from the Political Declaration (which shapes our future relationship with the EU) and, yes, the Speaker has decided it is constitutional, but Theresa May is wrong repeatedly to gamble the country’s fate on passage of her deal, including via the transparent act of snapping it in two and offering one half to the House in the hope that it’ll bite. Labour says it won’t back the Agreement without the Declaration because that means voting for an uncertain future – and not nearly enough movement has occurred on the Tory backbenches to secure passage without Jeremy Corbyn’s help.
MAR29	The Tories look like wets and wimps on crime	Whoever is the next Tory leader is going to have to correct the party’s image on crime. Falling police numbers, political correctness and an obsession with penal reform give the impression that they have gone soft, just as the country is seeing a grisly rise in knife crime. Conditions in some prisons are bad, no doubt, and reoffending depressingly high, but the real issue isn’t an excess of discipline – rather, too little of it.

MAR30	This is how I would set about tackling the knife crime epidemic blighting Britain	On Monday the Prime Minister will host a knife crime summit, bringing together police, local leaders and voluntary groups in a renewed effort to turn the tide on the tragic murders we’ve seen in communities across the country. There is no single silver bullet solution. We need to combine more robust law enforcement, with more effective preventative work in local communities, if we’re going to end the scourge of knives. First, we must change the attitudes of a minority of young people who, through malice, bravado or just plain fear are willing to carry a knife in the first place. When it comes to deterrence, increasing likelihood of getting caught is the most potent way to dissuade criminal behaviour. Stop and search has an important role to play. The reforms introduced back in 2014 were well intentioned.
MAR30	Theresa May's deal was a Brexit betrayal - but our country and our institutions can arise renewed	On Thursday evening, I decided to support the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal. By the grace of God, I changed my mind with the help of friends. Now I see how my noble and brave colleague Richard Drax feels about backing this awful deal. He said in a television interview, “I personally feel utterly ashamed of myself for betraying everything I believed in, that this deal was a rotten deal.”  I could not be more proud of my Parliamentary colleague, both for the way he was willing to put his name to a proposition for the sake of the stability of the government and for the astonishing courage he has shown in revealing how he feels about it afterwards.
MAR30	The next Tory leader should be a politician who voted for Brexit	The future of the Conservative party needs to be as the Brexit party. It ought not to cede this title to any other contenders as the nature of its opposition to the EU grows out of its core beliefs. The Tory party in all its guises, over many centuries, has had the view that society is best organised from the bottom up rather than the top down. In the 18th century it was the squires of rural England rather than the grand Whig magnets; in the 19th century, it was Peel’s desire to favour the consumer against the producer. In the 20th it was defined by opposition to socialism, whether this was Churchill’s abolition of identity cards, or Lady Thatcher’s council house sales. The great events in the party’s history can be seen as backing the individual against the overmighty.
MAR30	Number plates are the wrong way to curb insufferable cyclists	No, I don’t support requiring cyclists to have number plates. Too much of life is governed by permits, regulations, and not-so-voluntary guidelines, and all it seems to do is empower petty officials while creating mantraps for unsuspecting innocents to fall into when they manage to transgress some rule. Even in these days of lycra-clad superlouts, it should be possible to pick up a bike and go on a spontaneous ride up the road without pre-registering with the authorities, passing a safety course, and logging your “vehicle” on a database (number plates would be an open door to the introduction of a bike tax, incidentally). But then again, Lord Winston has a point. The peer says he was attacked by a woman whom he had told off for riding her bike on the pavement. Instead of meekly accepting her mistake, he says she kicked him repeatedly and snatched his phone, only for him to then see a second cyclist race dangerously the wrong way down a one-way street.
MAR30	The only way to save Brexit now is a general election	Britain no longer has a functioning government, parliament or constitution. Are we even a democracy operating under the rule of law? Arguably, the Government’s agreement with the EU to delay Brexit was illegal in advance of parliamentary votes. Parliament, unrepresentative of the country, contemplates pulling down fundamental pillars of the constitution. Cabinet responsibility, one of the oldest principles of representative government, is flouted. MPs seem set on acting as an oligarchy, based on a misunderstood and now archaic idea of absolute parliamentary sovereignty, dating back to the days before universal suffrage consecrated the sovereignty of the people. The most alarming aspect of the Brexit issue is the damage being done to our whole political system. The first rule of democracy, that a legal majority decision must be carried out, is assailed both inside and outside parliament.
MAR30	Theresa May must step down as prime minister: for the sake of Brexit, her party and democracy itself	Friday was supposed to be Brexit day. Instead, the Government spent it trying to heave its Withdrawal Agreement over the line, with the threat that it could be this or no Brexit at all. They did their best; a few Tory sceptics were converted. Nevertheless, the deal died in the lobbies for a third time. Theresa May had told the 1922 Committee that she would resign if the Agreement passed. What will she do now that it has been beaten yet again? She cannot continue. The Prime Minister needs to consider her position urgently, bearing two things in mind: the longer this goes on, the softer Brexit will become and, second, that the public is losing faith not just in the Government or the Conservative Party, but in democracy itself. No 10 is reportedly considering a fourth vote next week. If the plan is to offer even more concessions to Labour in a nod towards a customs union, that would be a disaster: the Government would lose the votes of any pro-Leave MP who believes a customs union would be worse than staying in the EU, which is correct. Britain would end up obeying Europe’s rules without a say in writing them. Why would anyone sign up to this? Ignorance? To produce a Brexit so bad that there is a popular demand to overturn it? All of the above plus the poison of Project Fear that the Tories have done nothing to cure. Throughout this saga, the Remainers – and the Government – have talked up the economic risks of Brexit, but delaying and softening our EU-exit has had side effects of its own. The longer we’ve waited to go, the deeper the economic uncertainty; the softer Brexit looks, the greater the political damage. If the UK ends up participating in the Euro elections – which is a bad joke in itself – we can expect radical Remain and Leave parties to flourish. The Tories and Labour are testing the patience of the voters.
MAR30	Britain needs to move on from the Withdrawal Agreement. If it is defeated one more time, let it die	This has to come to an end. The Government has chosen to put to the House a vote on the Withdrawal Agreement – for the third time. Yes, it is now separated from the Political Declaration (which shapes our future relationship with the EU) and, yes, the Speaker has decided it is constitutional, but Theresa May is wrong repeatedly to gamble the country’s fate on passage of her deal, including via the transparent act of snapping it in two and offering one half to the House in the hope that it’ll bite. Labour says it won’t back the Agreement without the Declaration because that means voting for an uncertain future – and not nearly enough movement has occurred on the Tory backbenches to secure passage without Jeremy Corbyn’s help.
MAR30	The Tories look like wets and wimps on crime	Whoever is the next Tory leader is going to have to correct the party’s image on crime. Falling police numbers, political correctness and an obsession with penal reform give the impression that they have gone soft, just as the country is seeing a grisly rise in knife crime. Conditions in some prisons are bad, no doubt, and reoffending depressingly high, but the real issue isn’t an excess of discipline – rather, too little of it. The regime at Berwyn prison, a new-build jail in Wales, is a case in point: prisoners have been issued with keys to their own cells and officers are expected to knock before going in.
MAR30	Letters: The United Kingdom is now divided as never before, except in its exasperation with politicians	SIR – Has this nation ever been as divided as it is now over Brexit, yet at the same time almost completely united in its exasperation with the political class, bordering on contempt? Bill Bailey Cardiff  
MAR30	Letters: Theresa May's desperate bribe to MPs does not make her terrible Brexit deal any better	SIR – How does Theresa May’s promise to resign make her dreadful deal any better? And how can anything she says be believed? Jocelyn Gardner Thatcham, Berkshire
MAR31	Delivering Brexit is the best way for the Tories to avoid a Corbyn government	The Brexit saga has had more twists and turns than an Agatha Christie novel but without, as yet, a denouement. In the Commons today MPs will once again commandeer the Order Book from the Government and try to reach an agreed approach after the Prime Minister’s deal with the EU was defeated for a third time on Friday. Last week MPs rejected eight separate alternatives in a series of “indicative” votes; but the two options that received the biggest support – a customs union and a second referendum – will be reconsidered today. They are both supported by the Opposition parties and since Theresa May does not have a majority in parliament she can be outgunned if her opponents can maximise their vote. So far they failed to do so but that might conceivably change. Still, both of these options are opposed by the Government, and ministers have indicated that they will not implement them even if they are supported.
MAR31	The Tories need to get on with Brexit and learn to believe in Britain again	I reckon I speak for millions of people on all sides of the debate when I say that after almost three years of Brexit I am fit to burst with impatience. We cannot go on like this. We need to get on with it and to get it done. We should really come out with no deal – now looking far the best option; but if we cannot achieve that, then we need to get out, now, with an interim solution that most closely resembles what the people voted for, in the knowledge that – following the PM’s decision to step down – we have at least the chance to fix it in the second phase of the negotiations. Yes, it will be tough, and yes, it will mean we will need a very different approach. But it is absolutely essential now that we in the UK recover our courage and self-belief. We need to get Brexit done, because we have so much more to do, and so much more that unites the Conservative party than divides us. We have so many achievements to be proud of – and yet every single one is being drowned out in the Brexit cacophony.
MAR31	Theresa May was never up to the job of delivering Brexit and, while she remains in office, we cannot rescue this national tragedy	In a parallel universe, we would this weekend be embracing the euphoric sense of freedom, true self government, independence and the prospect of a future as a self-confident, outward looking global trading nation, having left the European Union after a fractious and unhappy forty six years of membership, with power passing back to the people via a newly emboldened Parliament. Instead, Theresa May continues to squat in Downing Street, with no mandate or authority, notionally heading a dysfunctional Cabinet and broken-backed government but tragically presiding over a national humiliation with more to come, as she most likely begs the EU for a further Article 50 extension on April 10th at the EU Council. The central broken promise, repeated 108 times, that we were leaving the European Union on 29th March, will be the ball and chain that attaches to her until she quits office.   Instead, like when we see the detritus on the shoreline revealed as the tide goes out, today’s political impasse points up a broken constitutional set up, a Whitehall elite suffering Stockholm Syndrome, big business myopically eschewing the opportunities of Brexit in favour of their cosy relationship with Brussels and our legislators paralysed by fear, cowardice and determined to thwart the will of their constituents.    
MAR31	Farewell to the Telegraph and its readers after 60 wonderful years	Sadly, for health reasons, this is my last column for the Telegraph, marking an end to my links with the newspaper which, in various guises, dates back exactly 60 years. In 1959, when I was still at university, I was invited by John Warrack, the distinguished music critic of The Daily Telegraph, to review jazz records; and in 1961, with the launch of The Sunday Telegraph I joined it as its first jazz critic But later that year, I became the first editor of Private Eye and soon a full-time satirist, and also, by the end of 1962, the chief political scriptwriter, along with my old Cambridge friend David Frost, of the BBC’s ground-breaking satire show TW3 (That Was The Week That Was).
MAR31	Farewell to Christopher Booker, a Fleet Street giant	Christopher Booker, who retires today as a columnist at the age of 81, is a titan of Fleet Street. He has written for The Sunday Telegraph since its launch in 1961: his first job was a jazz critic. Few journalists have his versatility. Mr Booker has written about literature, butterflies, religion, architecture, climate change and, perhaps with the most historic impact, the European Union. His journalism has always been indispensable, which is why his name appears so often in Hansard. In 1992, Douglas Hurd commented from the despatch box that that the phenomenon of a decision being taken in Brussels yet implemented with maniacal enthusiasm here in Britain had become known as a “Bookerism”, after the writer who identified it. The then-foreign secretary noted for the record that Mr Booker is an “honest journalist”.
MAR31	Theresa May must not lead the Conservatives into a general election	There is, for better or for worse, a growing chance of a snap election. For reasons that are hard to fathom, some figures around the Prime Minister believe that she must lead the party into a campaign, or at least are threatening to deploy her in such a way; other Tories who grasp that this would be a catastrophic idea, including in the Cabinet, simply cannot see how she could be replaced in time. These people need to take a cold shower: there is absolutely no way that Theresa May must be allowed to lead the Conservatives into battle against Labour. Some method must be used to convince her to step down. Failing to do so would be almost terminal. Jeremy Corbyn would have a very high chance of being in No 10 before the summer, after a chaotic, incompetent election wherein the Tories would be effectively leaderless, manifesto-free and at each others’ throat. If it looks, over the next few days, that a general election is inevitable, either because Oliver Letwin and his allies impose terms that even the PM finds unacceptable, or because too many Tory MPs begin to lose confidence in the Government, then Mrs May must step down immediately – but the process of then selecting her replacement and going to the polls must be slowed down as much as possible in order to give the party and its new leader some breathing space and a chance to lay out a fresh agenda. This is the only way to save Brexit and free markets.
MAR31	Theresa May must step down as prime minister: for the sake of Brexit, her party and democracy itself	Friday was supposed to be Brexit day. Instead, the Government spent it trying to heave its Withdrawal Agreement over the line, with the threat that it could be this or no Brexit at all. They did their best; a few Tory sceptics were converted. Nevertheless, the deal died in the lobbies for a third time. Theresa May had told the 1922 Committee that she would resign if the Agreement passed. What will she do now that it has been beaten yet again? She cannot continue. The Prime Minister needs to consider her position urgently, bearing two things in mind: the longer this goes on, the softer Brexit will become and, second, that the public is losing faith not just in the Government or the Conservative Party, but in democracy itself. No 10 is reportedly considering a fourth vote next week. If the plan is to offer even more concessions to Labour in a nod towards a customs union, that would be a disaster: the Government would lose the votes of any pro-Leave MP who believes a customs union would be worse than staying in the EU, which is correct. Britain would end up obeying Europe’s rules without a say in writing them. Why would anyone sign up to this? Ignorance? To produce a Brexit so bad that there is a popular demand to overturn it? All of the above plus the poison of Project Fear that the Tories have done nothing to cure. Throughout this saga, the Remainers – and the Government – have talked up the economic risks of Brexit, but delaying and softening our EU-exit has had side effects of its own. The longer we’ve waited to go, the deeper the economic uncertainty; the softer Brexit looks, the greater the political damage. If the UK ends up participating in the Euro elections – which is a bad joke in itself – we can expect radical Remain and Leave parties to flourish. The Tories and Labour are testing the patience of the voters.
MAR31	Letters: Brexiteers voted to strengthen our democracy – and now Parliament is destroying it	SIR – We voted to leave the EU after much weighing up of the pros and cons. The factors that meant the most to us were the undemocratic procedures of the European Parliament and its complete disregard for the will of the people. Sadly, whichever way events move beyond this week’s unbelievable mess, it appears that we shall end up in the same situation. We are ashamed of our so-called Mother of Parliaments. Jan and Peter Molyneux Wrestlingworth, Bedfordshire
MAR31	Letters: The United Kingdom is now divided as never before, except in its exasperation with politicians	SIR – Has this nation ever been as divided as it is now over Brexit, yet at the same time almost completely united in its exasperation with the political class, bordering on contempt? Bill Bailey Cardiff  
APR1	If this is what it looks like when Parliament seizes power, maybe Theresa May's Brexit deal isn't so bad	Parliament seized power- and then couldn’t do anything with it. There is a kind of justice in that. They nearly wrecked the constitutional arrangements of the country and all they got was this hopeless anti-climax. The motions went down like dominoes one after the other. Nick Boles resigned from the party on the spot and won a smattering of applause. It was very dramatic but no less futile for that. The second referendum motion fared badly enough to put it out of the running for serious consideration. Ken Clarke’s customs union came closest to succeeding and he could claim that that was some kind of  moral victory but in legislative terms it means nothing. So here we are, back in purgatory.
APR1	It's not blackmail to point out that stopping Brexit would push our politics to extremes	No Brexit last week because Parliament cocked it up, but the Leave rally in London went ahead anyway, and as Channel 4’s Jon Snow surveyed the crowd, he said the thing that was on nobody else’s mind: “I’ve never seen so many white people in one place.” Now, I happen to know that’s untrue because I once met Mr Snow at a Republican convention. He was equally offended then: “What do you think of the show?” I asked. “It’s like Germany in the 1930s!” he replied. I’m coming to the conclusion that Mr Snow, for all his experience and courage, is a bit of an innocent. Both Remain and Leave marches looked quite pale but it doesn’t reflect the complexities of who voted for what (Jess Phillips’s diverse constituency in Birmingham ignored her advice and went for Brexit by 60 per cent). What reportedly distinguished each protest was class, with the Remain event resembling a university graduation and the Leaver one an odd alliance of provincial Tories and the working-class. Then there were the parasitical groups that latch on to any patriotic cause even if they don’t have the first clue what it’s about. The alt-Right held a side rally at the Leaver do, and when the speeches were over, and night had fallen, I watched a band of men with plastic beer cups march to Downing Street, singing Rule, Britannia.
APR1	When I took over, the Conservatives were in ruins. For the next leader, things could be even worse	For me, having become Tory leader after the election disaster of 1997, it has been impossible to read the newspapers of recent days without the haunting memories of those times coming back. So preoccupied had Conservatives become, in the mid-Nineties, with differences of opinion over Europe and calculations about who would be the next leader, that many of us failed to notice that the world outside our ranks was changing. Like today, we Tories had been in power for some time, with a good economic record overall. It was hard to imagine a party with half the seats in Parliament losing half of them at a stroke. Leadership contenders held dinners for MPs and prepared to inherit the mighty, enduring, election-winning party of Margaret Thatcher. Once the election came, some of those contenders were no longer even in Parliament. I, one of the surviving half, inherited the leadership, but I was bequeathed a ruin.
APR1	Ditching marriage might be the biggest mistake Generation-Z makes	“Marriage is like a deck of cards,” reads the embroidery on a throw pillow in our bedroom. “At the start all you need are two hearts and a diamond. By the end all you need is a club and a spade.”  It’s funny because it’s true. No wonder more and more of us are folding early on, with marriage rates between men and women already at their lowest on record.  But according to new figures released on Sunday, Generation Z are planning to take the trend a step further. Rather than risk playing a hand that’s increasingly likely to lose and could well lead you to experience GBH-levels of irritation, daily, this peaceable lot are forfeiting any interest in playing the marriage game at all. Which makes perfect sense – and might just be the biggest mistake their generation makes. In the research compiled by think-tank The Marriage Foundation, just 57 per cent of girls and 55 per cent of boys currently aged between 13 to 18 said they planned to marry later in life. Of course, you may say. I had no more interest in marriage at 13 than I did in the prospect of spending eternity slipping coasters beneath critically hot beverages, wrapping presents for someone else’s extended family, and bellowing “dinner time!” with increasing ferocity. 
APR1	Millennials are seeking solace in Bach – and who can blame them?	About six months ago, I made a new radio rule. Every time I heard the words Brexit, Barnier or backstop on Radio 4, I turned the dial to Radio 3 and Bach, Beethoven and Debussy. More recently, I’ve gone the full harpsichord. I barely bother with Radio 4 any more. I have Mozart instead of Today, Tchaikovsky for The World at One and Prokofiev in time for PM. It’s done wonders for my Brussels blues. I’m not alone. Research by the Royal Albert Hall and the music streaming service Deezer has discovered a boom in classical music among millennials. Over the past six months, Deezer has seen a 270 per cent rise in streaming of its most popular classical playlist, with under-35s accounting for 43 per cent of listeners. Johann Sebastian Bach has struck a particular chord:  32 per cent of Bach listeners are under 35, compared with 20 per cent for the over-55s. Perhaps there’s something about the majesty, the certainty and the soaring, soul-raising solemnity of Bach’s music that makes us turn to him in fraught, frenetic times.

APR1	Letters: With contempt for voters, MPs are pushing through a phony Brexit	SIR – David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, says that the Prime Minister “could not afford to ignore the will of Parliament if it united around a ‘softer’ Brexit”. This just shows the contempt MPs have for the 17.4 million who voted to leave the EU. Desmond Mulvany Shepperton, Middlesex
APR1	Letters: Britain cannot be taken for a laughing-stock in peacefully rejecting a bad Brexit agreement	SIR – Some readers have said in their letters that Britain has become the “laughing stock of the world” and that we have been “humiliated” with regard to Brexit. The truth is that people are attracted to our country and love it because we accept, we argue, we embrace,we protest, we disagree and even sometimes rejoice.  We don’t put on yellow jackets and fight. We don’t have self-imposed rulers who won’t go. We don’t have civil war. I’m definitely staying.
APR2	A cross-party process might have worked three years ago, but now it risks blowing the Tories to pieces	There I was trying to think of an apt literary or cinematic analogy for the current Brexit fiasco when up popped The Caine Mutiny on TV recently. This 1954 film based on a Herman Wouk novel stars Humphrey Bogart as a US Navy warship captain relieved of his command by junior officers who question his judgment. Captain Queeg had been behaving erratically for a while; but when the USS Caine runs into a Pacific typhoon, his crew fears he will lead them to disaster. His second-in-command urges the captain to reverse course into the wind but Queeg freezes and is unable to make a decision. He is confined to his quarters, whereupon the ship rides out the storm and returns to port – only for the junior officers to be court-martialled for mutiny. They are acquitted when it becomes apparent during the trial that Captain Queeg was, indeed, not fit to command. In the context of Brexit, Theresa May is Captain Queeg. She should have been relieved a long time ago but her officers – aka the Cabinet – were unwilling to act even as she steered the ship of state onto the rocks where it is now stuck fast. How to get it off? The Cabinet held a marathon meeting yesterday and even though most ministers wanted to leave without a deal next week and get this saga over and done with, she overrode them and now proposes to consort with the enemy in an effort to find a safe haven.
APR2	Isn't it the Home Secretary's job to deal with knife crime, not our teachers and nurses?	Picture the scene. It’s registration time at the East London Academy of Drive-By Shootings, and Mrs Smith is checking that 5C are all present and correct. Mrs S: LeJon, what is that object you have down your trouser leg? LeJ: Just pleased to see you, miss.
APR2	Time’s up for MPs like Heidi Allen who make a mockery of our democracy	Heidi Allen seems to have been rather confused.  The former Conservative MP, now interim leader of Change UK, denied rumours that her constituency association was talking about deselecting her. Rumours which I have reason to believe she knew were true. A few months ago, I tweeted that Allen’s South Cambridgeshire constituency association was so unhappy that the MP was in danger of losing her job. Allen swiftly tweeted back: “Ummm… no.” Ummm… yes, Ms Allen. South Cambs is my area, and people I know said that they attended a dinner party where someone who bore a striking resemblance to Heidi Allen wailed that the members hated her and were about to deselect her. She was right about that. Many local Tories were absolutely spitting. And rightly so. After the referendum, Allen, a Remainer, had vowed to respect the Leave victory in a heartfelt speech: “We might not all like the result… [but] the minute we ignore the democratic will of the people in this country, we are slipping very quickly towards the banana republic I don’t want to live in.”
APR2	Nick Boles is wrong, Brexiteers have compromised enormously on leaving the EU – why should they do so again?	On Monday night, Nick Boles dramatically resigned the Conservative whip on the floor of the House of Commons. The former minister’s “Common Market 2.0” plan had just been rejected by MPs. “I accept I’ve failed,” he declared. “I’ve failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise”. There is a convention in British politics that, when someone resigns, as long as there’s no scandal, other politicians roundly praise them. Indeed, Boles was applauded as he trudged from the Commons chamber – albeit largely by members from parties other than the one he just left. Boles is a thoughtful MP, with some smart policy ideas – particularly on housing. His determination to return to public life after serious illness is widely admired. I also respect that someone of his ability and privileged background has put himself out there, enduring the rough and tumble of front-line politics.
APR2	Food security is under threat from Cyclone Idai – but there are ways to help farmers bounce back	Cyclone Idai has brought destruction to parts of Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe in what could become one of the worst weather-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere in this decade. Hundreds have died and as many as 600,000 people have been displaced, according to the World Food Programme. In Malawi, President Peter Mutharika declared a State of Disaster on March 8 following the torrential rains and severe flooding and devastation in most districts in southern Malawi. Flooding in rural and urban areas collapsed buildings, washed away bridges, made roads impassable, and destroyed homes and belongings. As of March 22, more than 850,000 people have been affected in Malawi alone, with 59 deaths and 677 injured, according to the Department of Disaster Management Affairs. Close to 87,000 people are displaced. Phalombe, Chikwawa, and Nsanje districts in the Lower Shire Valley recorded the highest number of displaced persons.
APR2	The longest Cabinet meeting of modern times has utterly failed to end the Brexit uncertainty	The longest Cabinet meeting of modern times did not, at least, result in any Ministers walking out other than for a stroll around the Downing Street garden to stretch cramped legs. There was never any great expectation that they would agree on an approach given the deep divisions over the way forward for Brexit. It appears that a majority of Ministers, seeking an end to the Brexit impasse once and for all, wanted to leave next week without a deal but Theresa May vetoed that option. Instead, she has gone for a variant of the national unity approach proposed at the weekend by Sir John Major, the former Prime Minister. There is not to be a formal arrangement of the sort last seen in the Second World War and during the Great Depression; but Mrs May will invite Jeremy Corbyn to work in tandem to agree a plan that will get through the Commons. This option has always been available. Indeed, a Withdrawal Agreement allied to a customs union in the next stage of talks about future trading relationships could have got through months ago. That Mrs May has been forced into this position at this stage is the final humiliation for her.
APR2	Time to level the playing field in school sports	While great efforts have been made to reduce gender inequalities in the workplace and elsewhere, they remain in other walks of life, notably in school sports. As the Telegraph sports pages highlight today, there is a gulf in attitudes between the way the physical activity of girls and boys is treated across schools in England. Our new campaign, Girls, Inspired, has been launched with the intention of closing the gender sports gap. It seeks to enshrine equality of opportunity in the Government’s School Sport Action Plan, and to put the benefits of physical education on a par with core subjects. This is a deep-seated cultural matter as much as anything. In primary schools, girls and boys are often given equal chance to play sports. But in secondary schools, the system tends to be set up to find the best players for boys’ teams, especially football, rugby and cricket.
APR2	It's make-or-break time for this dithering Cabinet	Today’s marathon Cabinet meeting, expected to last five hours, is emblematic of the perilous position in which the British political system finds itself. Ministers will gather with no realistic expectations of agreeing a common Brexit policy on which the requirements of collective responsibility might rest. The meeting will be chaired by a Prime Minister who has already announced her intention to leave office in the near future but who seeks somehow to influence events despite seeing her EU deal voted down three times. It takes place when the Government has lost control of the proceedings in Parliament in an unprecedented putsch engineered by MPs to overturn the constitutional proprieties that have obtained for centuries. It is to work out what to do about this extraordinary state of affairs that will preoccupy the Cabinet today; and it is important that decisions are reached. The public has tired of dither and delay.
APR2	Letters: Mrs May’s poor leadership means that her terrible deal is now at risk of becoming even worse	SIR – Yesterday evening we had yet another uninspiring statement from Theresa May, showing no sign of leadership whatsoever. The idea of her sitting down with Jeremy Corbyn to reach agreement on Brexit is laughable. More worrying is the possibility that we will end up remaining in the customs union if it proves to be the only solution acceptable to our lily-livered MPs. Peter Robinson Guildford, Surrey
APR2	Letters: With contempt for voters, MPs are pushing through a phony Brexit	SIR – David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, says that the Prime Minister “could not afford to ignore the will of Parliament if it united around a ‘softer’ Brexit”. This just shows the contempt MPs have for the 17.4 million who voted to leave the EU. Desmond Mulvany Shepperton, Middlesex
APR3	By allying with Corbyn, our kamikaze PM has declared war on her own party	Is there no betrayal Mrs May won't countenance? Has it really come to this? Are we really stuck with a Tory Prime Minister who believes Jeremy Corbyn to be the country’s last hope of salvation? Is this just a nightmare from which we are all about to awake, or is Theresa May actually for real? Corbyn, for those who are now so afflicted with Brexit Derangement Syndrome that they need reminding, is the most dangerous leader in Labour’s history, a hard-core socialist desperate to tax, nationalise and control, a man who has allowed his party to be infected by a posse of despicable anti-Semites and who is soft on national security. Preventing him from gaining power ought to be any self-respecting Tory MP’s primary purpose: it is the reason we still have a Conservative Party.
APR3	Like so many Tory members, I can no longer stay in this party	The people have sensed a democratic stitch-up, and the results will not be pretty. Born in a northern mining town, raised by a single parent and the product of a comprehensive school education; I’m not your typical Shire Tory. Yet I have supported the party for almost three decades, ever since my teenage years when I first realised the vital importance of capitalism, self-reliance and individual freedom. But this Government’s disastrous handling of Brexit and betrayal of the electorate means that not only did I cut up my party membership card this week but I’ve decided never to vote Conservative again – and I’m not alone. Many members of my local association say they are doing the same.
APR3	I am a Party loyalist, but I can no longer support our reckless PM and this watered-down Brexit	Theresa May’s response to Brexit has resulted in falling opinion polls, a drop in donations to the Tory Party, and collapsing membership I am über loyal to Conservative Prime Ministers. I have been über loyal to Theresa May.  But no longer. I have become exasperated with this decent, kind, hardworking, but stubborn Prime Minister who is cursed with a political tin ear.
APR3	Mrs Hinch made cleaning fashionable... and I love it	Still fuming after some thoughtless person put the clocks forward one hour on Mother’s Day? Male probably. For goodness sake, man, does the term “lie-in” mean nothing to you? Then came the news that men are doing even less housework, reducing by 15 minutes a day the time they spend carrying out “non-routine” chores such as food shopping. Even among parents who both work full-time, mothers are doing about twice as much cleaning as their partners. Cue indignant feminist rant about lazy bastards, gender inequality blah blah. Well, maybe not. The truth, I suspect, is more complex and rather shaming. Women have a dirty secret. We love cleaning. At least I do.
APR3	May's sell-out to Corbyn is the final straw for us Tory members	Support has evaporated, with some resigning with immediate effect The mood among the Conservative grassroots is now grim. Fighting local elections in just one month’s time, many members in our constituency in Kent are staying at home or just delivering leaflets rather than knocking on doors.  Last night’s speech by Mrs May confirmed the sell-out many are saying is the final straw. Months and years of Jeremy Corbyn being the traitor, the Marxist, the anti-Semite and incidentally our default best electoral asset when things didn’t go so well have turned to this - Corbyn holding the key to a softer Brexit, and invited to turn it with Mrs May hand in hand. In the words of George Orwell, “The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.”

APR3	Time to level the playing field in school sports	While great efforts have been made to reduce gender inequalities in the workplace and elsewhere, they remain in other walks of life, notably in school sports. As the Telegraph sports pages highlight today, there is a gulf in attitudes between the way the physical activity of girls and boys is treated across schools in England. Our new campaign, Girls, Inspired, has been launched with the intention of closing the gender sports gap. It seeks to enshrine equality of opportunity in the Government’s School Sport Action Plan, and to put the benefits of physical education on a par with core subjects. This is a deep-seated cultural matter as much as anything. In primary schools, girls and boys are often given equal chance to play sports. But in secondary schools, the system tends to be set up to find the best players for boys’ teams, especially football, rugby and cricket.
APR3	It's make-or-break time for this dithering Cabinet	Today’s marathon Cabinet meeting, expected to last five hours, is emblematic of the perilous position in which the British political system finds itself. Ministers will gather with no realistic expectations of agreeing a common Brexit policy on which the requirements of collective responsibility might rest. The meeting will be chaired by a Prime Minister who has already announced her intention to leave office in the near future but who seeks somehow to influence events despite seeing her EU deal voted down three times. It takes place when the Government has lost control of the proceedings in Parliament in an unprecedented putsch engineered by MPs to overturn the constitutional proprieties that have obtained for centuries. It is to work out what to do about this extraordinary state of affairs that will preoccupy the Cabinet today; and it is important that decisions are reached. The public has tired of dither and delay.
APR3	Letters: Letting a revolutionary Marxist into the heart of government is not in the national interest	SIR – Theresa May can no longer claim she is acting in the national interest by allowing Jeremy Corbyn into the heart of government. Among other things, he is a revolutionary Marxist and a terrorist sympathiser who hates private enterprise. Mrs May’s decision will give him the respectability he does not deserve and will make him more electable. This is a decision she will come to regret. David Salt Bridgend, Glamorgan
APR3	Letters: Mrs May’s poor leadership means that her terrible deal is now at risk of becoming even worse	SIR – Yesterday evening we had yet another uninspiring statement from Theresa May, showing no sign of leadership whatsoever. The idea of her sitting down with Jeremy Corbyn to reach agreement on Brexit is laughable. More worrying is the possibility that we will end up remaining in the customs union if it proves to be the only solution acceptable to our lily-livered MPs. Peter Robinson Guildford, Surrey
APR4	No deal of any kind is what Nicola Sturgeon really wants	Amid the plethora of confusing words that surround the Brexit farrago, perhaps the hardest task for voters has been to work out which description fits best what Nicola Sturgeon desires. As Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn spend a weekend wondering whether they can come up with the way through the morass, it’s time to spell out what Scotland’s First Minister wants. It can probably best be summed up thus: She says she is determined to avoid a No Deal exit from the EU; that would spell, she says, economic misery for Scotland. But her real aim is no deal at all … in other words no deal of any kind that takes Britain, including Scotland, out of the EU, because as far as she’s concerned No Deal is still...
APR4	Don't write off the Tories yet. With a new leader, they have all the ingredients for a stunning recovery	The Conservative Party seems to be engaged in a slow but spectacular suicide, determined to confound anyone who thinks things cannot possibly get worse. Its obituary could be written now: that this once-great party hadn’t won a convincing election victory since 1987 and seemed to abandon conservatism once in government. It then clung on to Brexit, having little else to say. And when even this project was botched, it sought Jeremy Corbyn’s help – and, in so doing, filed for intellectual bankruptcy. Westminster is full of Tories offering such gloomy analysis. When you read a quote from an anonymous MP containing an expletive, it’s usually a Conservative. One was quoting Christ on the Cross this week, as if preparing for crucifixion. But there’s another way of looking at all this. Brexit need not be a Tory Calvary. Things are pretty bad, but most great political revivals begin in such crises. And a leader capable of providing hope and direction may be able to turn things around rather quickly.
APR4	Fiona Onasanya is a disgrace, but she's just one of 313 MPs who voted to sabotage Brexit	Most political geeks enjoy asking, “What if?” What if Margaret Thatcher had persuaded just two additional MPs to support her in the leadership election of November 1990? What if John Smith had lived until the 1997 general election? What if Florida had swung for Al Gore in 2000? Today there’s a new one for Brexit obsessives to consider: what if disgraced Labour MP Fiona Onasanya had served three months in prison for perverting the course of justice, instead of being released after four weeks? The answer is that Britain would, more than likely, be heading towards a no-deal Brexit next week. Onasanya, who was released from prison at the end of last month, was in parliament yesterday and duly voted for a new law brought by Yvette Cooper that will force the government to seek a long extension to Britain’s membership of the EU if no deal has been agreed. The measure was agreed by MPs by the narrowest possible margin: one. 
APR4	We'll soon discover what a Corbyn Brexit really looks like - and the Tories won't stomach it	Is Jeremy Corbyn a "man you can do business with", as Sir Oliver Letwin claimed this week? As talks continue between the Labour leader and Theresa May today, the widespread assumption is that they will agree on a customs union which can then be put to the House of Commons and be whipped by Conservatives and Labour alike.   That would in itself be a pretty disastrous outcome, leaving Britain at the mercy of trade rules in which we have no say. It would be a humiliating position for the world’s fifth largest economy to find itself in. The EU would be absolutely guaranteed to go round the world negotiating trade deals which open UK markets to overseas competition while doing little to help UK exporters. But Corbyn’s demands are not going to end at a customs union. He is going to want, too, the political declaration to be tweaked in order to ensure that the more socialist elements of EU law – on workers’ rights, working hours etc – continue to apply in Britain after Brexit. Meanwhile, he will already be plotting how a future Labour government will take advantage of the freedom from the more economically-liberal elements of EU law – those which, for example, ensure competition and which strictly control the extent to which governments can bail out failing industries.
APR4	Betrayed by establishment parties, Brexit voters long for a truly pro-Leave alternative	We stand agog at the daily, in fact hourly, political machinations of the Prime Minister, Parliament and the establishment. We have witnessed the rewriting of constitutional precedent, a blatant disregard for manifesto commitments, the bending of rules and lies on an industrial scale. All this to keep the UK a prisoner of the EU system and a milch cow for Germany and Brussels bureaucracy. No heresy allowed in the new inquisition.  What is astonishing is the apparent continued belief amongst our superior classes that “ordinary people” aren’t watching and understanding what is afoot.
APR4	Tech can create wealth and improve lives	Today we publish an eight-page supplement revealing the 100 most successful technology entrepreneurs in Britain at present. They and their companies represent so many things that The Telegraph champions – determination, imagination, hard work, and wealth and job-creation. They also show, as the Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright notes in the supplement, that technology has an enormous capacity to do social good as well as fuel economic growth. Indeed, as so often, the two go together. Encouragingly the list also reveals a growing maturity in the UK tech ecosystem. Previously, many successful start-up founders were happy to sell up as soon as foreign buyers came calling. These days they want to hold on and build their companies into global heavyweights with valuations in the many billions. This is good news because it is the only way that Britain will one day have a titan to rival American behemoths like Amazon and Google, or China’s Tencent and Alibaba.
APR4	The longest Cabinet meeting of modern times has utterly failed to end the Brexit uncertainty	The longest Cabinet meeting of modern times did not, at least, result in any Ministers walking out other than for a stroll around the Downing Street garden to stretch cramped legs. There was never any great expectation that they would agree on an approach given the deep divisions over the way forward for Brexit. It appears that a majority of Ministers, seeking an end to the Brexit impasse once and for all, wanted to leave next week without a deal but Theresa May vetoed that option. Instead, she has gone for a variant of the national unity approach proposed at the weekend by Sir John Major, the former Prime Minister. There is not to be a formal arrangement of the sort last seen in the Second World War and during the Great Depression; but Mrs May will invite Jeremy Corbyn to work in tandem to agree a plan that will get through the Commons. This option has always been available. Indeed, a Withdrawal Agreement allied to a customs union in the next stage of talks about future trading relationships could have got through months ago. That Mrs May has been forced into this position at this stage is the final humiliation for her.

APR4	Letters: Parliament’s appalling handling of Brexit will do lasting damage to voters’ faith in democracy	SIR – Yesterday I received my polling card for the May local elections. Incandescent with rage over the way in which our shameful Government has behaved, I will be tearing that card in half and sending it to Conservative Party headquarters.  At the next general election, in the absence of any sane party to vote for, I shall do the same thing. How else can I register my displeasure with Parliament and all those who hide behind its facade of democracy? Andrew Denley Selsfield, West Sussex

APR5	Forget the 'end is nigh' scaremongering – Britain is officially ready for no-deal Brexit	On Wednesday I resigned from Government. My role as a minister in the Brexit department, helping to coordinate our preparations for if the UK needed to leave the EU without a negotiated deal, had been made irrelevant by decisions in Government. Our preparations for this eventuality were very well advanced. Hundreds of civil servants had been working for over two years to ensure we would be ready; but parliamentarians and others who are doing everything they can to stop Brexit needed to maintain a narrative that leaving without a deal would be a “disaster” for jobs and our economy. Most of these “end of the world is nigh” stories originate in the myth that Calais and Eurotunnel will be blocked. It stems from what did happen back in 2015 where bad weather and strikes caused the “Short Straits” to close down, traffic backed up and parts of Kent turned into a lorry park. That, of course, was well before our decision to leave the EU.
APR5	The EU Empire is on the verge of victory, as Britain makes itself irrelevant	The first thing to say is that, despite everything, the law of the land remains that we leave the EU without a deal at 11pm on Friday next week. Given the alternatives, this would be much the best thing to do. The second thing to say, however, is that this is highly unlikely. The combined effect of Mrs May’s weak stubbornness, her crazy last-minute legitimation of Jeremy Corbyn, and the antics of Letwin-Bercow-Cooper-Boles-Benn – hereinafter referred to, for brevity, as “Letlose” – will probably see to that. The declared purpose of Letlose was for Parliament to “take control of the Brexit process”. This cannot happen, because Brexit is a negotiation, and only governments, not parliaments, can negotiate.
APR5	The dark clouds of Brexit and Corbyn are perfect storm from which the Tory Party may not recover	A perfect storm is approaching Theresa May’s Conservative Party. There is no law that political parties must last forever. Today, the dark clouds that are swirling above Britain’s most successful party are visible to all; the government’s disastrous handling of Brexit; a Cabinet that is deeply split; a parliamentary party that has fractured; a Conservative electorate and membership that are at logger-heads with their leaders; a rebooted and well-funded populist Right under a re-energised Nigel Farage; and a fundamentally damaged Conservative brand. At no other point in Britain’s post-war period has the Conservative Party looked so vulnerable.    To make matters worse, two decisions that were taken in the past week have added to this looming storm. Theresa May’s decision to invite Jeremy Corbyn into the heart of the Brexit negotiations sits uneasily with the fact that most Conservatives loathe all that Corbyn represents. The super-soft “Mr Whippy” vision of Brexit that Labour advocates is, in the eyes of most Conservative voters, indistinguishable from remaining in the EU. The promise of Brexit, of forging a radical new settlement, now risks being diluted into a weaker version of the status quo. Meanwhile, the polls show that an overwhelming majority of Conservative voters back the one thing that this week MPs decided to rule-out: a no-deal Brexit. If the Conservative leadership had no serious intention of preparing for no deal then it should have said so at the outset. Instead, the Prime Minister and her advisers have pursued an approach that will now be used in university courses on international relations as a textbook case of how not to negotiate.
APR5	Something is rotten at the heart of the Tory party - and it isn't just Brexit	An organisation which treats its committed supporters so poorly will struggle to recruit more. The Conservative Party is desperately ill. Its lurid symptoms ought to concern patient and loved ones alike.  It struggles to put up full slates of council candidates, even in areas where it has long been utterly dominant; some activists are reluctant to stand and casual supporters refuse to sign nomination papers. Parliamentary seats which ought to be hotly-contested attract a mere handful of applications, rather than the scores they would normally expect. Social media is full of pictures of cut-up membership cards, and many who have not resigned are either rationing their campaigning, or have gone on strike entirely. 
APR5	Labour's faux progressives will stop at nothing to reverse Brexit	It is a familiar accusation, and one used more frequently as any political crisis deepens: “X is putting their party before country!” Given that this has become the slam-dunk of all criticisms, the crime for which there can be no forgiveness, it is remarkable how frequently both our main parties transgress in exactly this direction. Theresa May is generally considered to have placed the unity of the Conservative Party above the good of the country in her management (I use the term in its loosest form) of Brexit. But it is Labour which stands accused of the most egregious pattern of behaviour. Were I still a party member, it would be the wing of the party with which I generally associated that has pursued the most cynical and dishonest course of action. Those in the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) who most strongly oppose Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership and principles are the traditional right wing: pro-trade union, pro-nuclear, pro-Israel and generally far more connected with (and more comfortable with) the party’s working class base than the cosmopolitan middle class activists of Momentum. This wing of the party prides itself on below-the-radar manoeuvrings, and its guiding philosophy is less “the end justifies the means” than Herbert Morrison’s old adage that “socialism is whatever a Labour government does”.
APR5	What the Conservative Party needs is a good leadership contest	British democracy at present is about as roadworthy as a clown car. On Wednesday, MPs rushed a bill through all its stages in one day so as to delay Brexit – a “coup” without guns, said Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House. It passed by the margin of a single vote, swung by a disgraced MP who was only recently released from prison. Yesterday, Remainer peers tried to ram the legislation through the Lords and Conservatives raised perfectly reasonable objections as to its constitutionality. Lord Howard argued that MPs had set a precedent that would have a “dire effect on our liberties”. As if in divine comment, the Commons chamber sprang a leak. Parliament is a mess, but we are where we are thanks to the catastrophic mistakes of the Government, for which the Conservative Party as a whole is now being punished, perhaps unfairly. It was the Government that bungled the last election, destroying its majority; the Government that mishandled the EU negotiations, mismanaged Parliament and – even though it technically remains within its gift – ruled out the no-deal option. Theresa May has gone cap-in-hand to Jeremy Corbyn in search of a solution. Tory activists are tearing up their membership cards and reports from the doorstep suggest the party’s reputation among the voters is in tatters. Presumably this will translate into apathy and mass abstention. Why bother to vote for, let alone join, a party whose leaders promised Brexit only to hand it over to Remainers and a Marxist? An old joke springs to mind: if voting changed anything, they’d make it illegal.
APR5	The battle for the soul of the Conservative Party is still worth fighting	British democracy at present is about as roadworthy as a clown car. On Wednesday, MPs rushed a bill through all its stages in one day to delay Brexit – a “coup” without guns, said Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House. It passed by a margin of a single vote; one Remainer, who is a convicted criminal, walked through the lobbies wearing an ankle tag. Yesterday, Remainer peers tried to ram the legislation through the Lords and Conservatives raised perfectly reasonable objections as to its constitutionality. Lord Howard argued that MPs had set a precedent that would have a “dire effect on our liberties.” As if in divine comment, the Heavens opened and the Commons chamber sprung a leak.

It was the Government that bungled the last election, destroying its majority; the Government that mishandled the EU negotiations, mismanaged Parliament and, even though it technically remains within its gift, rules out the no-deal option as if it has nothing to do with them.

APR5	Letters: Unless Brexit-supporting Conservatives make a stand, the party faces oblivion at the polls	SIR – Fraser Nelson (Comment, April 5) argues that the Conservative Party, under a new leader, could yet “heal the Brexit divide” in the country. That is all very well, in theory. However, given that the current likelihood is that Theresa May will achieve her aim of trapping Britain in some form of non-Brexit for an indeterminate period, I think the chances of success will be slim. Even if Mrs May’s successor is a committed Leaver, will he or she be willing to risk restarting the whole divisive debate by giving the EU a clear ultimatum that, unless a genuine, mutually beneficial free trade agreement can be reached within a very short timescale, Britain will indeed leave without a deal? Would Parliament allow it? If it came to a general election, would the voters believe it?

APR6	Take a year’s extension, replace the PM and get ready for a real Brexit	The irreconcilable Remainers must think that all their birthdays have come at once. Here at last is the beginning of the end that so many of us predicted. Donald Tusk has uttered the words that might yet deliver the country from what he would probably call a special place in hell. A year’s extension! The first step on to an endless road to nowhere – or rather on to a road that turns round and doubles back on itself! A year in which to exhaust all the energy of the Brexit movement! A delay that can happily go on forever! And best of all, the Brexiteers themselves will carry the blame for their own defeat. They were too purist, too ideologically driven, too intransigent, blah-blah-blah. They overplayed their hand and in the end they lost the game. Oh wait. Maybe that isn’t how it will go at all. Perhaps there is an alternative ending to this story. If the Brexiteers – by which I mean all of them, moderates as well as purists – are not so deranged by now that they cannot put one foot in front of the other, this could be the moment when it all begins to come right.
APR6	We are running out of time to save our Brexit - we must end this standoff	We are nearly three years on from the referendum and we still haven’t left the EU. To Leave voters, it is unjust. To Leave and Remain voters alike, it feels interminable. The country needs to move on and find a way to come back together. David Cameron’s government, at the time of the referendum, made clear it would be a once-in-a-lifetime decision. It cost millions of pounds to hold, has saturated public discourse, and it feels like we’ve been stuck there ever since. Parliament has so far shown itself unable to honour the result – something I sincerely regret. Not only has our planned exit date been and gone, but there is now a real risk that we might not leave at all. The Cooper-Letwin legislation set in train by some backbenchers, against all parliamentary conventions, feels like an unstoppable attempt to kick Brexit into the long grass. It’s time to confront the grim truth; the vision we had of Brexit is fading away – and we are running out of time to save it.
APR6	The 'same day delivery' morning-after-pill is not as good for women as it seems	If I told you that scientists had invented a completely safe pill that can be taken after a contraceptive failure to prevent pregnancy, that it was cheap to manufacture and suitable to prescribe to pretty much any woman, you’d think that was good news. Right? That medication already exists. It has existed for several decades, and it’s called the morning after pill. I have written about the morning after pill before; about how the compulsory consultation should be scrapped, about how it should be available from vending machines on every school and university campus, and how it should cost an affordable amount, rather than the exorbitant £38 previously being charged by some chemists as a self-confessed ‘deterrent’ from using it.
APR6	You cannot cancel Brexit forever, however hard Remainer MPs might try	It’s the dishonesty that makes me so bloody angry. Less than two years ago, when they were begging for our votes, Labour candidates promised that they would implement Brexit. Their manifesto was unequivocal: “Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first”. Yet the moment the votes had been counted, many candidates revealed that they had had their fingers crossed behind their backs. A dozen or so Conservatives were flat-out lying when they promised their constituents that they would respect the people’s verdict. So, far more significantly, were around 240 Labour MPs. I have no quarrel with the parties that were open in their opposition to Brexit. The Greens, the Lib Dems and the SNP all went into the 2017 election promising to overturn the result – and all of them lost votes in consequence. Nor do I criticise those individuals who distanced themselves from their party manifestos. Ken Clarke, for example, superbly flicked two nicotine-stained and liver-spotted fingers at the electorate, making clear that he had no intention of abiding by a majority verdict. Fair play to him.
APR6	The UK must lead the way in internet safety	Open a newspaper any time in the last few months and you’ll have seen the headlines. Amid the excitement, good and promise of all that technology can bring, there’s also a groundswell of mistrust.  Fears about the ease with which harm can be spread via social media, snooping and worries about work in an increasingly automated world.  And that harm can be tragically real, especially for young people.  Addressing online harms and restoring trust in the technology we use every day must be a top priority - and a shared responsibility.
APR6	If we want Brexit, Theresa May must go	Theresa May is now the chief roadblock to Brexit, and so long as she is Prime Minister no progress can be made. The country is trapped in a bubble of Mayite logic. She will resign, she said, if the House of Commons passes the Withdrawal Agreement, but if she softens the EU deal to win over Remainers, the Tories and DUP will turn against it – so there is a good chance that it will never pass, and thus she will never have to resign. The madness has no end in sight. Up until now there has been a lot of sympathy in the country for the Prime Minister, a sense that she was doing her best in the name of duty. But this week destroyed any benefit of the doubt. First, she said that she would talk with Labour, a move that – right or wrong – could have been made years ago and looks to be dishonest theatre. Labour’s demand for a customs union is already contained in the agreement (the backstop is arguably superior to what Labour imagines it wants) and Mrs May will not rewrite it. But even if she makes no compromises, just by talking to Labour – begging for parliamentary votes – Mrs May has elevated Jeremy Corbyn to the status of an equal. Tory activists are furious: the one argument many felt they had left was “Vote Conservative to stop Corbyn”, and yet the Prime Minister has invited him to the top table. Is there nothing she won’t do to try to save her sainted agreement?

APR7	Joy and command of the gerund are the secret to good writing	Among recent posts on my Facebook home page was an illustration from the 15th‑century book of hours of Marguerite d’Orléans. A central image is surrounded by a gilt margin, garlanded with flowers and scattered with random letters. Among the flowers, a quartet of little figures labours with brooms and baskets to sweep up the wayward alphabet. It is a telling visual metaphor for the business of writing, and a reminder that Making Your Mark, the British Library’s exhibition on the history of writing over the past 5,000 years, opens later this month. Charting the evolution of writing from hieroglyphs to emojis, the exhibition also considers the future of the written word. Meanwhile, in primary schools this summer, 10- and 11-year-olds will take spelling, punctuation and grammar (Spag) tests, showing their skill at wrangling modal verbs and frontal adverbials.
APR7	Theresa May's plan to enslave us in the customs union with Corbyn's help will never work	There are times when the news seems so disheartening that you can scarcely believe it. For years now we Tories have been pointing out the obvious – that the Marxist Jeremy Corbyn is not fit to govern. This is a man who still believes in the precepts of Bolivarian revolutionary socialism, even though they have have reduced Venezuela to destitution. As leader of the Labour party he has presided over a culture of rampant anti-semitism. When chemical weapons were used in Salisbury, he pathetically refused to denounce the Kremlin. His economic policies – crushing taxation, wholesale renationalisation – would be catastrophic for this country. If we Tories have one duty, it is to prevent this man getting anywhere near the levers of power. So it seems utterly incredible that he has now been invited into Downing Street to negotiate a Brexit deal. And it is doubly incredible that the government is – so we are told - willing to accede to his terms. We are informed that there are now “no red lines” in the negotiations with Labour.
APR7	Should those of us who think the BBC is biased against Brexit refuse to pay our licence fees?	When I appeared on BBC Question Time last week and asked the chairman, Fiona Bruce, why it was that Leave supporters are, on average, heavily outnumbered on the programme’s panel, she denied the charge, though I was the only Leaver out of five. Early calculations from the Institute of Economic Affairs, however, show that, over 2018 and this year, the balance of the panel has been 36 per cent Leave to 60 per cent Remain. The imbalance may be even more extreme than that: the BBC counts “Releavers” – Remainers who now say they want to Leave – as Leavers. By that definition, Philip Hammond would show up as a Leaver, yet he has undermined Brexit throughout. Yesterday he was reported saying that the Government had “no red lines” left.
APR7	I've too much self-esteem to care for status symbols like Franken-dogs and designer pot plants	The Tatler has just published a list of the latest status symbols: houseplants which need all the attention of a filthy-rich, bed-bound great-aunt, overbred dogs who look like some joker decided to play canine Frankenstein way back when, electric Tesla cars to drive self-righteously to the airport before taking a super-polluting flight to Barbados. It’s not just the rich who fall for boastful bagatelles – a recent report revealed that if you add the word “artisan” to bog-standard bread, you can flog it for twice the price. The Woke are just as likely to be suckered; see those allegedly feminist glossies which bang on about a woman being so much more than the way she looks – and then gush over “hero” and “saviour” face creams at a hundred quid a throw.
APR7	Britain isn't a European country, but our politicians are desperate to make it one	I’ve never felt European. We are a more globally minded people, more likely to emigrate to other English-speaking countries than to France or Spain, and our history would seem to have set us on a different course to those nations that haven’t got over defeat or devastation during the 20th century. This isn’t an old-fashioned view: one argument for why so many ethnic minority voters backed Brexit, for example, is that they happily feel part of an evolving and open-minded British, or English, identity, rather than a European one. But our politicians have different ideas. Contrary to the fulminations on the continent against “Anglo-Saxon” capitalism, and in addition to the EU’s own efforts to “harmonise” and centralise, British leaders have independently been trying to make Britain very European indeed.
APR7	Mrs May is inventing new Brexit red lines to woo Labour. When will this madness end?	Theresa May’s latest statement on Brexit is exactly why she has to go as Prime Minister – and the sooner, the better. First, she officially rules out a no-deal outcome, offering us instead a choice between disaster and catastrophe: her Withdrawal Agreement (with an ever worse Political Declaration attached) or no Brexit at all. This confirms that the Prime Minister wasn’t telling the truth when she kept insisting that no deal remained a possibility or that she believed Britain could “succeed” in the event. It has never been a strategy the Government took seriously, and the fact that MPs voted against it is entirely in keeping with the wishes of the Treasury, Civil Service, No 10 and the majority of the political class. Secondly, the Prime Minister has rewritten the UK’s red lines in order to cement an unholy alliance with Labour. What she’s effectively saying is, “I tried to work with my own party and the DUP, but they were so unreasonable that I’m now reaching out to Jeremy Corbyn instead” – a man she has previously attacked for being willing to sit down with the IRA. 
APR7	The crisis in Libya is a study in the failures of Western intervention	Libya is in chaos; it is a political and economic shell, exploited by extremists, and the capital is now threatened by a new strongman, General Khalifa Haftar. The situation is a study in the failures of Western intervention. On the one hand, the Europeans were keen to help remove Muammar Gaddafi – a bloodthirsty dictator who faced a genuine popular revolt. On the other hand, they didn’t want to commit to the kind of nation-building tried in Iraq, with its tremendous toll in money and lives.
APR7	If we want Brexit, Theresa May must go	Theresa May is now the chief roadblock to Brexit, and so long as she is Prime Minister no progress can be made. The country is trapped in a bubble of Mayite logic. She will resign, she said, if the House of Commons passes the Withdrawal Agreement, but if she softens the EU deal to win over Remainers, the Tories and DUP will turn against it – so there is a good chance that it will never pass, and thus she will never have to resign. The madness has no end in sight. Up until now there has been a lot of sympathy in the country for the Prime Minister, a sense that she was doing her best in the name of duty. But this week destroyed any benefit of the doubt. First, she said that she would talk with Labour, a move that – right or wrong – could have been made years ago and looks to be dishonest theatre. Labour’s demand for a customs union is already contained in the agreement (the backstop is arguably superior to what Labour imagines it wants) and Mrs May will not rewrite it. But even if she makes no compromises, just by talking to Labour – begging for parliamentary votes – Mrs May has elevated Jeremy Corbyn to the status of an equal. Tory activists are furious: the one argument many felt they had left was “Vote Conservative to stop Corbyn”, and yet the Prime Minister has invited him to the top table. Is there nothing she won’t do to try to save her sainted agreement?
APR7	Letters: Unless Brexit-supporting Conservatives make a stand, the party faces oblivion at the polls	SIR – Fraser Nelson (Comment, April 5) argues that the Conservative Party, under a new leader, could yet “heal the Brexit divide” in the country. That is all very well, in theory. However, given that the current likelihood is that Theresa May will achieve her aim of trapping Britain in some form of non-Brexit for an indeterminate period, I think the chances of success will be slim. Even if Mrs May’s successor is a committed Leaver, will he or she be willing to risk restarting the whole divisive debate by giving the EU a clear ultimatum that, unless a genuine, mutually beneficial free trade agreement can be reached within a very short timescale, Britain will indeed leave without a deal? Would Parliament allow it? If it came to a general election, would the voters believe it?
APR7	Letters: Parliament’s appalling handling of Brexit will do lasting damage to voters’ faith in democracy	SIR – Yesterday I received my polling card for the May local elections. Incandescent with rage over the way in which our shameful Government has behaved, I will be tearing that card in half and sending it to Conservative Party headquarters.  At the next general election, in the absence of any sane party to vote for, I shall do the same thing. How else can I register my displeasure with Parliament and all those who hide behind its facade of democracy? Andrew Denley Selsfield, West Sussex
APR8	The Prime Minister has a point: a no-deal Brexit could unravel our United Kingdom	Any approach by a prime minister to the leader of the opposition to work out a joint solution to the nation’s most pressing issue is fraught with risks and dangers. It is undoubtedly infuriating to many government supporters, and has only a slim chance of success. The tempting strategy for an opposition presented with such an initiative is to appear to engage constructively in the talks, draw the government into concessions that further antagonise its own side, and then pull the rug from under it by pronouncing those concessions as inadequate. They would thereby be closer to bringing down the government, their ultimate goal. The whole manoeuvre is akin to having a dinner date with a crocodile – its main interest is in eating you, not the dinner. It is difficult in any case to see how carrying through the programme of Brexit procedures and laws could be sustained by an agreement between part of the Conservative Party and the bulk of the Labour Party – the Government would be highly likely to collapse under such a strain.
APR8	The PM has a choice this week: deliver the Brexit she promised, or stand aside for someone who will	One thing has been clear from Downing Street over the last week. What the Prime Minister has said we would do for over two years, we have not. What she said we would not do has come to pass. I have never known such a level of public anger and such a gulf between people and Parliament.  We were told that “Brexit means Brexit.” But according to the Withdrawal Agreement – from which there is no unilateral right of exit – Brexit means breaking up the UK, having potentially prejudicial laws imposed upon us by 27 other countries, being subject to substantial fines for non-compliance and paying £39 billion for the privilege. We were told we would leave the EU on the 29 March. We were told that “no deal is better than a bad deal.” It was with this mantra ringing in their ears that MPs voted to trigger Article 50 and passed the Withdrawal Act.
APR8	Don't be surprised if Brexit is stopped - the EU has developed a talent for riding roughshod over voters' wishes	A golden rule of politics is always to listen to my friend Daniel. The night of the referendum, as the results came in, my old comrade was both upbeat and realistic. “It’s a great victory,” he said, “but you realise they’ll never let it happen.” In retrospect not only was he probably right but this was obvious. As outrageous as overturning Britain’s referendum result might seem, it’s the historic norm. “They” always get their way in the end, and when I write “they” I refer not just to the EU but also to national governments who have worked to override several democratic decisions of their own populations. Since Maastricht (and excluding Brexit), the EU has been beaten in a member state referendum nine times. In every single instance, the result has either been explicitly reversed, circumvented or fudged. In 1992, the Danes voted against Maastricht; their government secured opt-outs and, in 1993, the public backed the Treaty on a second referendum (in 2015, the country voted to keep a justice and home affairs opt-out but the legislature voted for continued cooperation with Europol anyway).
APR8	Labour's careerists must bear their share of the blame for this Brexit mess	Britain, by now, should have been able to describe itself as a "former member of the European Union". The reason this is not the case is due to MPs across the House who voted, on three occasions, to reject the only withdrawal agreement on the table.  As we wait with bated (or bored) breath for the cross-party talks between the government and the Labour Party either to bear fruit or collapse, we should consider the biggest obstacles to agreement. According to social media, many Labour MPs opposed the only deal available because they fundamentally object to leaving the EU without a deal. No, seriously. Given ample opportunity to explain to the public the detailed reasons why they voted against Theresa May’s deal, they simply repeated their fears about how awful it would be to leave the EU on a no-deal basis. This peculiar line of logic lasted right up to and beyond the debates in the Commons on the day these votes were taken.
APR8	World's biggest data breach is just the tip of the iceberg – Dark Web dangers are growing	The 773 million records recently posted on a hacking forum, now known as “Collection #1”, are merely the tip of a vast iceberg of stolen data now available to organised cyber criminals, hostile governments and terrorists. The Dark Web increasingly hosts Bitcoin sales of all kinds of data sets, ranging from customer and financial details to highly confidential data such as new product designs and business strategies. Almost all the data being traded on the Dark Web is earmarked for illegal use of some kind. Stolen data can be used for all kinds of purposes including bank robbery and terrorism.

APR8	Letters: The Conservative Party now risks becoming a mere footnote in history	SIR – Your headline on the “existential threat” facing the Tories (April 6) understates the party’s position. The Conservatives’ demise is already under way, as the Newport West by-election on April 4 demonstrated. There, although Labour had its lowest vote and lowest majority ever, it still romped home. With a swing to other parties of well over 12 per cent, the seat could have been won – but since almost 10,000 Conservative voters sat on their hands, a Labour victory was easily achieved. The Conservative Party is fated to echo the Whigs – who, despite dominating British politics for 150 years, are now a long-forgotten footnote in history. A cursory glance at the response of party activists and members, let alone voters, will show that this is anything but fanciful.
APR8	Letters: Parliament’s shameless betrayal of voters over Brexit will not be forgiven or forgotten	SIR – The British people watch helplessly as, daily, a majority of their representatives and the Speaker set out to overturn the result of the 2016 referendum, which they had been promised would be binding. It is truly an amazing and incomprehensible spectacle, which has permanently damaged the nation’s trust in democracy and left a political void. Who will believe any party’s promises in the future? Pauline Coleman Painswick, Gloucestershire
APR9	We must crack down on public sector waste and focus on the basics	Six-figure payoffs for senior public sector workers simply aren't right As Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my first responsibility is to the taxpayer. Every pound that comes into the Exchequer was earned by someone through hard work, and could have been used for a new car, a holiday or a treat for the children. It means I have a responsibility to make sure that all public spending is justified. That’s why we are capping pay-offs at £95,000 for senior public sector workers who leave their jobs. Every year, more than 1,600 highly-paid workers such as council chief executives get six-figure golden goodbyes – all from the taxpayers’ pocket.
APR9	The ‘deep state’ was never going to allow a no-deal Brexit to happen	In the absence of political direction, our institutions have acted to protect the UK’s long-term interests If you are visiting Hampton Court Palace this Easter, take time to see the magnificent painting of a young Henry VIII arriving at the Field of the Cloth of Gold to meet Francis I of France in June 1520. Their “summit” in what was then English territory south of Calais was staged amid great opulence as the two Renaissance princes sought to reinforce the peace ushered in by the Treaty of London a few years earlier. The painting, a collaboration between several artists, captures the power of the king, resplendent in his gold tunic and accompanied by a retinue of hundreds of courtiers and soldiers. But it also reflects the enduring importance of establishing good relations with the continental powers. It was part of a process. Just a few weeks earlier, Henry had met Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and ruler of half of Europe.
APR9	There is still time to change tack and secure a better deal from the EU	In an extension, we would be able to agree an exit mechanism from the Irish backstop As EU luminaries lament the fractured, disorderly state of British politics, and urge that we decide what kind of Brexit we want, it should be remembered that there is already a majority in the House of Commons for a substantive solution which takes us into phase 2 of negotiations. This is the Brady amendment which provides that there should be legally binding alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop. Although the PM’s withdrawal agreement was voted down as expected on December 12, the Brady amendment’s proposals were merged with the Malthouse Compromise, which brought warring factions of the Conservative Party together. Brady passed - largely because of progress in this area, and also because of commitments the government made about how phase 2 of the negotiations would be conducted with a new team and a new approach. The Prime Minister agreed to look seriously at the Malthouse Compromise, and extensive meetings were held in the Cabinet Office.
APR9	James Cracknell wasn't the hero of his marriage – his wife Beverley was	Behind every successful man, there’s a fed-up woman. When the double Olympic gold medallist James Cracknell was in the middle of one of his many heroic escapades – maybe it was rowing the Atlantic, all 2,937 miles of it, with Ben Fogle, or perhaps it was that race to the South Pole – his long-suffering wife Beverley commented drily on the lengths men would go to “to avoid Christmas shopping”. My, how we laughed! Wives and mothers everywhere, even ones not married to real-life superheroes, tautened a piece of tinsel into a ligature and chuckled bitterly at Beverley’s deceptively light-hearted jibe. We knew that the busy sports radio and TV presenter was seething. In that way women do seethe when the male of the species is out garnering plaudits while Her Indoors is left holding the baby.
APR9	Britain's enduring love for Fawlty Towers suggests our views of Europe haven't changed a bit	Yet again,  Fawlty Towers has been voted the nation’s best sitcom Basil Fawlty’s reputation as one of the great English barmpots can never be effaced. Created for the BBC in 1975 by John Cleese and Connie Booth, at a time when the corporation was less obsessed by “diversity”, and therefore capable of making programmes which appealed to a wider public that thought nothing of identity politics, Fawlty Towers made an instant splash, and we’re still happy to wallow in the puddles 44 years later. Yet again it has been voted the nation’s best sitcom, ahead of Dad’s Army, Porridge, and others that will tickle our funny bones until kingdom come. There were only 12 shows, six in 1975 and six more four years later, but it sometimes seems that everybody in our disunited kingdom knows Fawlty Towers inside out. They were short plays, really; brilliantly written, and acted by the superbly-assembled company with the kind of precision without which farce cannot work.
APR9	Better no deal or a long Article 50 extension than a customs union cooked up with Labour	With three days remaining before the UK is due to leave the EU, the urgent issue to be settled is the extension of the Article 50 Brexit process. Theresa May will travel to Paris and Berlin today for talks with Europe’s two most powerful leaders to sound them out ahead of tomorrow’s emergency summit in Brussels. President Macron and Chancellor Merkel are anxious to avoid a no-deal outcome if this can be avoided. It is not in their national interests for the UK to leave in a disorderly way. Short of an unexpected U-turn on the Irish backstop, a Brexit delay of a year or more must be the most likely way forward. Mrs May is asking for an extension only until the end of June, but with the British position still deadlocked will the EU27 leaders see any point in such a short hiatus? How long before Mrs May feels it necessary to request yet another delay? Even Brexiteers in the UK are now pressing for a lengthy extension during which time Mrs May can be replaced and the process reset.

APR9	Letters: The majority voted for Brexit to 'disrupt their lives', despite what Theresa May thinks	SIR – Theresa May said in her video recorded at Chequers that she wanted to deliver a Brexit that “protects jobs” and “doesn’t disrupt people’s lives”.  She has missed the point completely. People voted for Brexit to disrupt their lives by making them better, with freedom to make their own laws, control their own fish stocks, control migration (something she has failed to do with non-EU migration), have trade talks and not send vast sums of money  to the EU. They didn’t vote for the status quo.  A customs union will simply delete some of the upsides of Brexit. 
APR9	Letters: The Conservative Party now risks becoming a mere footnote in history	SIR – Your headline on the “existential threat” facing the Tories (April 6) understates the party’s position.

APR10	Will Indians buy into Mr Modi's brand of Hindu nationalism a second time?	Theresa May opened Prime Minister’s Questions by apologising on behalf of the nation for the massacre, 100 years ago on Saturday, at Jallianwala Bagh in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar. The deaths of hundreds of men, women and children taking part in a peaceful protest was one of the most shameful episodes of the Raj and radicalised many of the nationalist leaders such as Gandhi and Nehru, who had previously imagined they could negotiate independence with the UK after the First World War, in which many Indians fought. Before her visit to Amritsar in 1997, the Queen called it a “distressing example” of our history with India that to this day has not been expunged. A century on from the massacre, Mrs May said the bilateral relationship was one of collaboration, partnership, prosperity and security. The Indian diaspora, she added, “make an enormous contribution to British society”.  Even if the excesses of the Raj continue to cast a long shadow, India has emerged from its colonial past as a vibrant economic powerhouse.
APR10	With poll ratings as bad as John Major, the PM risks leading the Tories into electoral oblivion	It takes genuine skill to be this bad at politics, to simultaneously repel old and young, Remainers and Brexiteers, urbanites and rural dwellers, Left and Right. In years to come, political scientists will study Theresa May’s time in office with morbid fascination, dissecting her unique knack for alienating every group of voter bar none. They will reflect on her broken promises, her breathtakingly poor communication skills, her self-imposed isolation, her pointless micro-management, her abject inability to lead, her squandering of one of the greatest opportunities for political realignment in British history. Their conclusion, surely, will be that never before had such a mediocre apparatchik been so over-promoted, landing us with a prime minister entirely unsuited to the art of statecraft. They will wonder how she remained for so long in Downing Street at a time when somebody truly exceptional was required, and why her party failed to remove her, even after it had become clear that she was taking the Tories to the brink of annihilation.
APR10	Grovelling Britain has officially surrendered to a triumphant EU	So now, the begging. Theresa May has gone off to Brussels to say that Britain is very sorry, we know we have many faults and the EU has been quite right to be strict with us, but could we please stay? We’ll be good, honest we will! You’ll see! Apparently the French are sceptical and Emmanuel Macron is to tell us that we’ll only be allowed to stay if we promise to be a good little country, sitting still and being quiet, not making any fuss about the EU’s Budget or any other plans. I’m not sure what acts of self-mortification will be required of the British delegation to prove our good intentions. When Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV sought reconciliation with the Pope in 1077, he walked barefoot wearing a hair shirt, then waited for three days by the gate of Canossa Castle, on his knees, fasting, while a blizzard raged.
APR10	Obfuscating the true level of migration only encourages public mistrust	Public concern about rapid population growth could not be clearer. Indeed, 64 per cent of the public told YouGov last year that estimated future population growth (a projected rise of nearly seven million people by 2041) is too high. The public’s worries are justified. Roads, tubes and trains are getting ever more crowded and research has shown the UK is already one of the ten most gridlocked countries on the planet. Meanwhile, more than four-fifths of population growth between 2001 and 2016 was due to immigration. Indeed, immigration added one million to the UK population every three years – equivalent to the entire population of Birmingham or more than twice that of Liverpool. Immigration levels (net inflows averaged 250,000 over the past decade) are helping to make the UK much more congested, with a major impact on quality of life, especially in London and the South-East.
APR10	How can a nation of twitchers abandon its birds?	Every year I know when the season is about to change without even glancing at my calendar. That’s because, despite living 20 miles from the centre of London, I have a regular annual visitor who predicts it perfectly. As winter draws in, the peach-brown feathers of waxwings appear in the rowan trees, attracted by the abundance of berries which, at this time of year, become scant in their native Scandinavia. Just weeks ago they were replaced by the blue and white house martins, newly arrived from northern Africa and tropical Asia to nest in the eaves of my house. When I get up on a dreary morning and these feathered tourists begin to sing, everything suddenly feels a lot better. As countless studies show, just seeing and hearing nature boosts our mental health.
APR10	The institution of marriage will pay a price for liberalising divorce law	In his article in the Telegraph yesterday on the Government’s plans for a no blame divorce regime, David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, said they were designed to protect children from the “hostility and conflict” between parents. The sad reality of divorce is that the children will be hurt even by the most amicable of settlements, even if acrimonious ruptures are still best avoided. Mr Gauke has published proposals for what he called the biggest shake-up in the divorce laws for 50 years essentially to end the legal requirement to find a ‘guilty’ party when marriages founder. They have been universally welcomed by lawyers and relationship counsellors as “modern and progressive”. They appear to reflect the reality of 21st century relationships and are a response to a changed moral landscape. And yet the state should think carefully before further shaking the foundations of an institution which has been shown, by and large, to provide children with a stable and secure home. Not so long ago, governments were seeking to bolster marriage not to make its termination easier.
APR10	Rather than wait to be toppled, the PM should set out the timetable for her departure	Theresa May’s meeting with Emmanuel Macron in Paris yesterday took place on the 50th anniversary of Britain’s first Concorde flight. The development of the supersonic airliner was an Anglo-French venture that predated the UK’s membership of the Common Market. Britain’s departure from the EU need not, therefore, limit the opportunities for future projects with our neighbours provided Brexit does not sour relationships for years to come. To that end, the Prime Minister will today present herself before the other 27 heads of government to ask for an extension to the UK’s membership of the bloc having already missed the March 29 deadline and with another due to expire on Friday.
APR10	Better no deal or a long Article 50 extension than a customs union cooked up with Labour	With three days remaining before the UK is due to leave the EU, the urgent issue to be settled is the extension of the Article 50 Brexit process.

APR10	Letters: This tragic mess of Brexit stems from the EU’s contempt for Britain’s democratic decision	SIR – It is easy to blame MPs for the tragic mess that Brexit has become. But, as Ambrose Evans-Pritchard showed again this week (Business, April 8), the real responsibility lies with the EU Commission. The EU declared war on Britain’s referendum result and deliberately made the Withdrawal Agreement an almost impossible pill to swallow. It was intended, as President Macron has said, to make Britain suffer. Mr Macron was astonishingly hypocritical in saying last week that the EU “cannot be hostage to the political crisis in the UK”, when it is his and the Commission’s determination to humiliate Britain, especially with the backstop, that created this crisis.
APR10	Letters: The referendum has been betrayed by this Brexit in name only, and Theresa May is to blame	SIR – I can see it now. It’s actually pretty obvious. In the next few weeks, the softest of soft Brexits will be agreed (Brexit in name only). There will be another visit to the lectern and we’ll hear: “We have delivered what the British people voted for in 2016.” Of course, Leavers will know that this is yet another lie to add to Theresa May’s canon of lies. The voters in Britain’s largest-ever plebiscite will have been betrayed comprehensively. Democracy will have been damaged for generations to come, but with her lack of self-awareness and her hubris, Mrs May will step down believing she has achieved something to be proud of. Geoff Riley Saffron Walden, Essex
APR11	Nicola Sturgeon under pressure as Brexit fails to hasten Scottish independence	It was very much a case of the dog that didn’t bark in the night. Desperate to find a locus for her complaints that Scotland was being ignored in the protracted Brexit negotiations, Nicola Sturgeon demanded that "her" parliament be recalled from its two week holiday and sit yesterday and today. To do precisely what wasn’t at all clear, other than to again protest that Scotland was being dragged out of the EU against its will. But Brexit didn’t happen thanks to that Halloween extension being agreed in Brussels and so the First Minister was denied an opportunity to again voice her outrage and MSPs were able to continue their spring break when the Holyrood presiding officer Ken Mackintosh decided that there was no need for a recall … always assuming that such a need existed in the first place.
APR11	My Brexit Party will give people the chance to change politics for good	Three years after the British people voted decisively to take back their independence, they have a chance to speak again. The new Brexit Party will ask the electorate not only to support a clean break from the European Union, but also to begin a political revolution in the UK.  No Brexiteer – least of all me – wanted to contest the European elections on 23 May. But from disaster springs opportunity. Next month’s enforced ballot will allow us to bring about a far wider change in our broken political system. I attended the European Summit this week. Frankly, it was an embarrassment. European leaders dined in fine style while deciding Britain’s future. That it has come to this is nothing short of a national humiliation. That bullying triumvirate of unelected EU bureaucrats Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier know this only too well.
APR11	If anything, this horror show has strengthened my support for Brexit	Was I wrong to back Brexit? Those on my side of the debate have been laughing off the various disasters for quite a while now. Don’t worry, we have said, it was never going to be easy, but it will all come right in the last minute. Unfortunately, it didn’t. Which raises an awkward question: did I get it wrong? As a lifelong Europhile who voted Leave after much heartache and agonising, I like to think I’m open-minded about this. With another six months ahead of us, there is plenty of time to reflect. Does anyone seriously think an extra six months will make this Parliament vote for that deal? A general election may be the only way to break the deadlock – but polls suggest that, with things as they are, Nigel Farage’s new party (together with his old one) will decimate Conservative support. Brexit might end up meaning Jeremy Corbyn.
APR11	The pampered life of a British MEP is about to get even cushier	If you’re feeling the Brexit blues, why not stand as a MEP in this zombie ministry? We are trapped in a deranged Brexit vortex, while our can-kicking PM seems determined to extend this farcical state of limbo, whatever the cost. Each day of insecurity increases the likelihood of our one day being governed by a committed Marxist, still mentally wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt, whose economic policies are several marrows short of an allotment. Apart from that, Mrs Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play? For a lucky and resolutely idle few, however, Article 50’s delay could also be the start of a workers’ playtime of indeterminate length. If you’re feeling the Brexit blues, why not stand as a MEP in this zombie ministry?
APR11	Nothing stirs the spirit like the nostalgic glamour of travelling by steam	Oh, happy day! Waterloo Station have announced they’ll run scheduled steam train services this summer. I don’t care where they’re going (in fact, it’s Windsor and the Surrey Hills) because, forget planes and boats, it’s trains that I love and steam trains above all else. My steamy love affair began in the early 60s. My sister, Di, and I insisted the all-day family holiday car journey to Wales (in the days before motorways), crammed in the back, with our two other sisters, the dog on our laps and mum and dad smoking, made us car sick. It was finally decided we should go by train. At Paddington Station, we clutched our sandwiches and comics and stepped aboard the Red Dragon, bound for Swansea. The guard was instructed to "look after us". The whistle screamed, steam filled the station roof, causing panic amongst the pigeons. We unlatched the leather strap, the window dropped and we tried not to look too excited, as the rest of the family trudged back to the car.
APR11	It's not 'Theresa May's deal or no Brexit', the choice is now 'Brexit or Mrs May'	Theresa May says the choice facing the nation is between her deal and no Brexit, but increasingly it looks to be between Brexit and Mrs May. We lurch from one delay to another. Britain was hoping to leave on  March 29, then April 12. The Prime Minister went to Europe this week to seek a deferral until June 30 but the EU27 gave her until October 31 instead – not an act of generosity but proof that they don’t believe Mrs May can win Parliament’s support for the Withdrawal Agreement. What is Britain expected to do with these extra months? The agreement cannot be renegotiated, so that presumably rules out fresh support from the backbenches or the DUP.
APR11	Rather than wait to be toppled, the PM should set out the timetable for her departure	Theresa May’s meeting with Emmanuel Macron in Paris yesterday took place on the 50th anniversary of Britain’s first Concorde flight. The development of the supersonic airliner was an Anglo-French venture that predated the UK’s membership of the Common Market. Britain’s departure from the EU need not, therefore, limit the opportunities for future projects with our neighbours provided Brexit does not sour relationships for years to come. To that end, the Prime Minister will today present herself before the other 27 heads of government to ask for an extension to the UK’s membership of the bloc having already missed the March 29 deadline and with another due to expire on Friday.
APR11	Letters: Dump the Prime Minister – there is no point in another six months of Brexit indecision	SIR – The thought of six more months of Theresa May handling the Brexit process is as grim as it comes. The Conservative Party must be prepared to do whatever it takes to get rid of her – and soon – to give this country some hope that it will have a competent, forward-thinking leader to replace an abject failure in handling a pivotal point of the United Kingdom’s history. The party has a chance to recover if, as a start, Theresa May is removed before the local and EU elections. It’s up to its members from grass roots to Cabinet level to ensure this happens. Barry Gibbs Wimborne, Dorset
APR11	Letters: This tragic mess of Brexit stems from the EU’s contempt for Britain’s democratic decision	SIR – It is easy to blame MPs for the tragic mess that Brexit has become. But, as Ambrose Evans-Pritchard showed again this week (Business, April 8), the real responsibility lies with the EU Commission. The EU declared war on Britain’s referendum result and deliberately made the Withdrawal Agreement an almost impossible pill to swallow. It was intended, as President Macron has said, to make Britain suffer. Mr Macron was astonishingly hypocritical in saying last week that the EU “cannot be hostage to the political crisis in the UK”, when it is his and the Commission’s determination to humiliate Britain, especially with the backstop, that created this crisis.
APR12	Sacred Mysteries: The powerful right hand of God	That tireless collector of human foibles John Aubrey wrote a note to himself one day in the second half of the 17th century regarding the life of Elizabeth Danvers: “Smyth of Smythcotes – Naboth’s vineyard – digitus Dei.”  He never got round to expanding the memo, but he was fond of recording instances of misfortune that might show by evidence of the finger of God in events that God is not mocked. The idiom of finger, hand or arm is Hebrew. The Israelites are delivered from the hand of the Egyptians; Moses stretches out his hand at God’s command, and the Red Sea is parted. The hand of the Lord signifies God’s power. Of course the Jews did not think that God had hands, quite the reverse, but their poetic language spoke of the spiritual in bodily metaphors. When Moses questioned God’s promise to feed his people, God replied: “Is the Lord’s hand waxed short? Thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass.”
APR12	Nobody will listen to a word the Tories say until they deliver Brexit	Even the Brexiteers are getting sick of Brexit. Some of them are angry and tired of it. Some are just tired. They can sense what the country is feeling: it is time to move on. And yet we are stuck. Brexit, after all, was meant to be a means to an end. The end remains amorphously undefined, awaiting a leader with a bit of vision, charm and strategic skill, who could use Brexit as the catalyst for something inspiring and new. The current prime minister is forlornly incapable of this task, yet removing her provides no clear path out of the woods. Every path runs into a new obstacle. The current makeup of Parliament is both making it impossible to leave without a deal and acting as a block on passing the deal on offer.
APR12	For the sake of Brexit, the Government must make one last push to fix the backstop	One of the many provocative allegations made by the European Union – and faithfully repeated by British broadcasters – is that while the House of Commons has frequently voted against a number of proposed variations on Brexit, it has never told them what it actually wants. This is, of course, untrue. On January 29, the House passed the Brady Amendment to the Withdrawal Agreement. This supported Theresa May’s deal on condition that the backstop was replaced by alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Achieving this would not just win the support of Parliament but also create a coherent position around which a Conservative Party that appears dangerously disunited could begin to coalesce.
APR12	In an age of vaccine hesitancy, complacency over animal immunisation is a deadly mistake	Ranking alongside Ebola, HIV and antibiotic resistance is a major global health threat entirely of our own making known as “vaccine hesitancy”. This reluctance among a minority to immunise their children against preventable diseases has been named by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of the top 10 health threats of the year, already resulting in a 30 per cent rise in cases of measles. Yet it goes further: anti-vaccine attitudes are something we are also seeing in veterinary practices among some pet owners, and the repercussions are just as serious.
APR12	Abandoning no-deal planning proves Brexit was a stitch-up all along	The Government has wound up no-deal planning, having spent £4.2 bn so far Time and again, the Prime Minister told us that “no deal is better than a bad deal", and yet the House of Commons has now told her three times that the legally-binding Withdrawal Agreement is a bad deal. It will go on doing so. Unionist MPs from the DUP and Conservatives – myself included – will vote it down as many times as she brings that document unchanged to Parliament. The reason is simple. It does not deliver Brexit. It threatens the constitutional position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom in breach of the Belfast Agreement’s Principle of Consent and the requirement to consult the NI Assembly. Without giving the UK a unilateral right of exit, laws will be imposed on us without a say by 27 other countries. It means being subject to substantial fines for non-compliance. To cap it all, it means paying £39bn for the privilege.
APR12	It's not 'Theresa May's deal or no Brexit', the choice is now 'Brexit or Mrs May'	Theresa May says the choice facing the nation is between her deal and no Brexit, but increasingly it looks to be between Brexit and Mrs May. We lurch from one delay to another. Britain was hoping to leave on  March 29, then April 12.

What is Britain expected to do with these extra months? The agreement cannot be renegotiated, so that presumably rules out fresh support from the backbenches or the DUP.
APR12	The institution of marriage will pay a price for liberalising divorce law	In his article in the Telegraph yesterday on the Government’s plans for a no blame divorce regime, David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, said they were designed to protect children from the “hostility and conflict” between parents. The sad reality of divorce is that the children will be hurt even by the most amicable of settlements, even if acrimonious ruptures are still best avoided. Mr Gauke has published proposals for what he called the biggest shake-up in the divorce laws for 50 years essentially to end the legal requirement to find a ‘guilty’ party when marriages founder. They have been universally welcomed by lawyers and relationship counsellors as “modern and progressive”. They appear to reflect the reality of 21st century relationships and are a response to a changed moral landscape. And yet the state should think carefully before further shaking the foundations of an institution which has been shown, by and large, to provide children with a stable and secure home. Not so long ago, governments were seeking to bolster marriage not to make its termination easier.
APR12	Rather than wait to be toppled, the PM should set out the timetable for her departure	Theresa May’s meeting with Emmanuel Macron in Paris yesterday took place on the 50th anniversary of Britain’s first Concorde flight. The development of the supersonic airliner was an Anglo-French venture that predated the UK’s membership of the Common Market.

APR12	Letters: Volunteering to help Conservative Party campaigning is suspended until Theresa May resigns	SIR – Last week I received a request from the local Conservative Party asking me to volunteer to help distribute information for the coming local elections. I wondered what to do. In the end, I emailed the Prime Minister and informed her that I will not help until she resigns. Perhaps it is too much to expect that she will listen to the public when she is so busy spinning round that she does not hear anyone in Parliament.
APR12	Letters: Dump the Prime Minister – there is no point in another six months of Brexit indecision	SIR – The thought of six more months of Theresa May handling the Brexit process is as grim as it comes.

APR13	My plan to take on the vested interests and revive the dream of home ownership for all	A report by the think tank Onward last week highlighted the challenge for Conservatives at the next election. The average age when a voter is likely to vote Tory has risen from 34, before the last election, to 51. The good news is that there are three million voters under 35 who aren’t sold on Jeremy Corbyn’s snake-oil socialism. But they need to see an aspirational Conservative vision for the future – and that starts with housing. For many young people the dream of owning a home is a mirage. After the Second World War, the average home cost twice the average salary. When I bought my first flat with a friend, in 1997, the average home cost four times average earnings. That was a stretch. Today, the average home costs eight times average earnings. Saving for a deposit is beyond reach for many. Successive governments haven’t been radical enough in taking on the vested interests to get enough homes built to keep them affordable. Having served as housing minister, I saw that challenge first-hand – and understand the radical reforms a pioneering Tory government must deliver, to give working Britain a fairer deal.
APR13	Theresa May's Article 50 extension is illegal, and will be challenged in the courts	After hours of discussions with QCs and former judges, I believe the British Government’s extension of Article 50 is unlawful. It is a fundamental principle of UK constitutional law that the Government may not use its powers, including its powers to make international agreements, to frustrate the intention of Parliament. Parliament’s intention is to be found, and is only to be found, in the laws it makes. Resolutions of the House of Commons may sometimes be politically important, but they are of no legal effect unless an Act of Parliament expressly gives them legal effect. The intention of Parliament is, and remains still, that the UK must leave the EU. This is clear from the legislation to trigger Article 50 (the EU Notification of Withdrawal Act 2017), in which Parliament referred to and declared “the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the EU”. The EU Withdrawal Act 2018 gives effect to the decision to withdraw by repeatedly referring to “exit day”.
APR13	We must get rid of May, or the Tories and then this Kingdom will be destroyed by the neo Marxists	As they went home for their truncated Easter recess, the mood among Conservative MPs varied. On the record and in public view there was anger, frustration, rage and utter despair, even contempt for the Prime Minister, with the veteran Conservative backbencher Sir Bill Cash telling her to her face in the House of Commons that she should resign. In private, within the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories and the European Research Group, things were rather worse.   The Prime Minister persists in talking about her “Withdrawal agreement" even though it has been overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Commons no less than three times. Now a fortnight after Brexit Day on 29 March, and despite appealing for help from the neo-Marxist Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, we remain firmly within the EU and bound by all its laws and regulations. Determined at all costs to avoid the clean Brexit offered by a no-deal exit, which would end our payments to support the bloated EU budget and leave us free to negotiate trade deals with both the EU and the rest of the world, Mrs May went to Brussels to plead for a further postponement of another few weeks. Instead she was told that, like it or lump it, she would have to accept a delay until October which would require participation in the European Parliamentary elections in May.
APR13	Why I’m standing in the Euro elections that no one wanted – and urge you to vote Tory	Another European election? Seriously? Three years after we voted to leave the EU? Two years after a general election in which (let’s remind ourselves) fully 85 per cent of the winning MPs were elected on manifestos that promised to implement the referendum result? We’re supposed to be an advanced democracy, for heaven’s sake. Our fathers crossed the seven seas to plant the seed of representative government – that is, the idea that an elected assembly should be the guardian of the people. Yet we have lately watched our MPs siding with overseas interests against their own voters. Lots of people, not just those who voted Leave, see new elections as absurd, grotesque, insulting. They are right. Yet one more Euro-poll now looks inevitable. True, it could in theory be circumvented if Brexit terms are agreed this month. In practice, though, the EU’s insistence on the Irish backstop makes an accord impossible. Not that we can exactly blame Eurocrats for being intransigent. Ever since the 2017 election, our MPs have been signalling to them that, if they offer tough enough terms, Parliament will find a way of dropping Brexit altogether.
APR13	The 11 moments that mark Theresa May’s Brexit rise and fall in the public's esteem	Theresa May started out so promisingly as Prime Minister, with voters welcoming her desire to make Brexit mean Brexit. But she has suffered constant misfortunes in her efforts to do so, with her popularity undergoing its own rollercoaster ride in the polls. We have charted public opinion on Mrs May’s premiership since she first entered Downing Street, drawing out ten key moments that have defined how voters have come to judge her. Theresa May delighted Conservative members by indicating that her Brexit priorities were to take back control of the United Kingdom’s borders and end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. She also signalled that the withdrawal process would be formally kickstarted “soon” by triggering Article 50 before the end of the following March. The Prime Minister was so confident she even joked about her success in keeping Boris Johnson “just about” on message during the party conference.
APR13	Don't be naive about Shamima Begum	It is easy to be naive about the character and motivations of those Britons who joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil). Some have pleaded for mercy for Shamima Begum, the so-called jihadi bride, on the basis that she was 15 when she left the UK and must have been an ingénue. But well-placed sources tell us that far from being the quiet housewife she says she was, she worked for the “morality police” and tried to recruit young women, that she carried a Kalashnikov rifle and enjoyed an elevated status. The obvious point is that Ms Begum chose to travel to Isil territory at the height of publicity about its atrocities. She crossed the border in February 2015. In August 2014, Isil forced Yazidis to flee their advance and the West began an air campaign to protect them. Isil released a stream of videos showing the beheading of Westerners. In January 2015, the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo were stormed (12 dead), followed by a kosher supermarket (four dead). In early February, footage was released of a Jordanian pilot being burned alive, and on February 15-16, Libyan militants allied to Isil beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians. Ms Begum left for Syria that same month and later admitted that, yes, she had heard about beheadings. “I was OK with it,” she said. What was it like to live under Isil? “At first it was nice.” Only when the military situation deteriorated did she lose faith, but she had “no” regrets. Many readers will therefore conclude that the case against Ms Begum stems not just from witnesses but her own words and actions. That these alone aren’t enough to guarantee a hefty sentence shows the law needs revision.
APR13	The Conservatives face a reckoning at the polls if they stick with Theresa May	Nigel Farage was asked an interesting question at yesterday’s launch of the Brexit Party: will this movement be only about Brexit? For the moment, yes, said Mr Farage, because it is fighting the European elections and there’s only one issue on the agenda. But "thereafter" it will develop a fuller manifesto. The longer Britain’s withdrawal from the EU is delayed, and the better the Brexit Party does, the more likely we are to see the emergence of a new alternative to the Conservatives. It has nearly happened before. Ukip came first in the European elections in 2014, and the EU wasn’t the only issue: the party benefited from anger at David Cameron’s drift to the Left and the self-entitled air of his government.
APR13	Roger Scruton's sacking threatens free speech and intellectual life	Last year, James Brokenshire, Housing secretary, appointed Sir Roger Scruton as a government housing tsar, describing him as “a global authority on aesthetics” who had taken great personal risks “to champion freedom of speech and freedom of expression.” Yesterday, Mr Brokenshire sacked Sir Roger for something he said.  Sir Roger went “off message” in an interview with the New Statesman – he insists the magazine unfairly represented his views – which is exactly what one would imagine a philosopher would do. Isn’t that the point of them, to think the unthinkable? The Government must have known the professor’s views before it appointed him – he has written enough books – and thus ought to stand by its man. It says much about the Conservative Party’s crisis of identity that it won’t do the decent thing.  This happened before with Toby Young, a journalist and education campaigner appointed to the board of a new university regulator only to be hit with a barrage of highly personal criticism that forced him to resign. The Tories want to hire radicals who can shake things up, which is desperately needed, but they don’t have the bottle to defend them when they are criticised for the very things that make them a maverick. 
APR13	Letters: A Brexit that keeps Britain trapped in a customs union with the EU is no Brexit at all	SIR – This week the BBC wheeled out Ken Clarke – yet again – to assert that leaving the EU but remaining in the customs union would result in a situation similar to our membership of the Common Market when we joined in 1973. This cannot go unchallenged. When we were part of the Common Market, we participated fully in EEC policy-making. Brexit with a customs union would leave us without a voice in the EU. It is not Brexit. Barry Goldman Storrington, West Sussex
APR13	Letters: Volunteering to help Conservative Party campaigning is suspended until Theresa May resigns	SIR – Last week I received a request from the local Conservative Party asking me to volunteer to help distribute information for the coming local elections. I wondered what to do. In the end, I emailed the Prime Minister and informed her that I will not help until she resigns. Perhaps it is too much to expect that she will listen to the public when she is so busy spinning round that she does not hear anyone in Parliament.
APR14	Only a proper Brexit can spare us from this toxic polarisation	The sooner we leave the EU, the sooner the name-calling will end I know it may not feel much like it at the moment, but some day soon we are going to get out. Unless we MPs have taken leave of our senses, we will honour the wishes of the people. Unless the PM has some secret plan to stifle Brexit with a series of ever more ludicrous delays, it seems to me all but inevitable that we will eventually respect the result of the 2016 referendum and leave the European Union. So don’t despair. Don’t give up. It is going to happen, and at that wonderful moment it will be as though the lights have come on at some raucous party; or as if a turbulent sea has withdrawn to expose the creatures of the shore. We will suddenly see things differently, and in that moment of clarity – when we finally get this thing done – I hope and believe that one of the distortions of Brexit will come to an end.
APR14	Why I'm standing for the Brexit Party	The establishment's shameless suppression of Brexit demands a revolution in British politics A Trojan group of MPs are fighting stoically to deliver the will of the British people. Unfortunately the vast majority of our Parliamentarians have done everything possible to frustrate, delay and undermine the democratic process. They are playing a dangerous game, which strikes at the heart of the social contract. These same individuals voted to have a referendum, pledged to abide by its result, triggered Article 50 and set in law the date of leaving.
APR14	The horrors of eating in bed eclipse even the trials of a loathsome house-guest	Anyone who has cohabited for any length of time with a teenaged boy (or a millennial man) will understand the relief of the Ecuadorian embassy staff at Julian Assange’s recent departure. But it seems that the feral domestic habits of the grizzled man-boy may not have been the only reason why his hosts decided it was time for him to go. The President of Ecuador, Lenin Moreno, has accused Assange of being behind the leaking of private correspondence and photographs, including one of the President in bed in a hotel room, surveying with keen appetite a platter of lobster laid out on his bedside table. Being photographed in bed, cosying up to a whopping crustacean, is not a good look for a politician who has recently imposed a range of austerity measures. But there are reasons other than the political why the image is a shocker. There is a common belief that eating in bed is “indulgent”. Breakfast in bed, especially, is a “treat” traditionally inflicted on mothers by families keen to express their affection in edible form. The bed is a fine and private place, scene of those most delicious and necessary of human occupations - sex, sleep and reading. But eating in bed is another matter. The mechanics are so uncomfortable, for a start. Legs stuck out in front, or cocked into a wobbly perch for a tray? The semi-recumbent position adopted by the President looks appropriate for his Lucullan feast, but impractical for plying the fancy cutlery with which his table is laid. Then comes the squalid aftermath: the smear of butter on the pillowcase, the lurking shards of lobster shell. The hotel chambermaids will have ensured that Moreno was untroubled by these; but for the rest of us, the price of eating in bed is endless laundry.
APR14	The hate-fuelled hyperbole of David Lammy	 Left-wingers must stop their indiscriminate use of the term "Far Right" This morning, Andrew Marr had the treat of questioning the Labour MP, David Lammy, about recent comments he had made about the ERG. He played footage of Lammy speaking at an event where he equated the group with Hitler and Apartheid, to the delight of Anna Soubry, who clapped like a demented seal in the background. “That was an unacceptable comparison, wasn’t it?” Marr asked of the clip. But instead of taking the hint, or perhaps an opportunity to apologise, Lammy doubled down on his remarks, arguing they “weren’t strong enough”. He then launched into an extraordinary tirade, suggesting that the BBC had allowed “extreme hard right fascism to flourish”, before equating the Tories with “white supremacy”, “the KKK”, fascism and thugs.
APR14	Who will have the courage to scrap HS2, a wasteful product of our failed politics?	Incredibly, HS2 has run like a constant through a political system otherwise in ferment. First proposed under Gordon Brown, it survived the toppling of his wasteful government, was embraced by Osborne and Cameron, has shrugged off criticism of its obscene cost (now £56 billion officially, but ultimately likely to be £100 billion), and still has the support of the Government and Labour. It is apparently too big to cancel: a monument to the risks of cross-party consensus, and of letting politicians indulge their fantasies of “guiding” the economy using taxpayers’ money. Our leaders have too much at stake to change tack now, hence their lack of shame at the nebulous and ever‑shifting case for spending such vast sums on this white elephant. Thank goodness, then, for Liz Truss. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said in an interview with the Spectator last week that HS2 will feature in the “zero-based capital review” the Government will shortly conduct, and will be assessed for value for money. Let us hope that rigorous cost-benefit analysis will reveal (again) that the billions would be better spent on regional rail, roads or tax cuts. But would even that be enough to kill this scheme? Remember that Theresa May announced a review of the similarly wasteful nuclear power project, Hinkley Point, when she first became prime minister. It is still going ahead.
APR14	The Conservative collapse is now a national emergency	For months this newspaper has warned that the Tories are headed for an electoral reckoning, thanks to their appalling failure to deliver a meaningful Brexit. Every week, the reply has been the same from the leadership: no one cares, people just want Brexit to go away and when it does the Government can return to the tired old certainties of, say, bailing out the NHS or banning things. But it turns out that voters really do mind that Brexit has been dangerously compromised and delayed, and many core supporters do really resent the Prime Minister’s talks with Labour. Over the past few days, especially since March 29, the penny has dropped. There has been a precipitous and catastrophic collapse in Tory support. The result: the last five polls show Labour ahead, with a far greater fall in Conservative support among Leavers than Remainers, and the pro-Brexit parties coming up fast. Sir John Curtice writes that if these figures were extrapolated across a general election, the Conservatives would be reduced to 260 seats. Labour has lost ground in the past year, too, but not as much and it can probably count on an unholy alliance with the SNP. This could result in the triple whammy of a Jeremy Corbyn government cancelling Brexit and threatening the Union. This is a national emergency and there is only one imaginable escape. The paralysis in the Tory parliamentary party must end – Cabinet members and MPs need to remove Mrs May now and replace her fast. They should pay attention to the advice of Lord Spicer and Lord Hamilton of Epsom, two previous chairmen of the 1922 committee, who insist it is possible to change the rules to do so. Britain needs a new prime minister who is 100 per cent committed to Brexit. They need to recapture both the trust and the imagination of the British people by pushing through a radical programme of economic reform, including tax cuts and a sea change on issues such as crime, housing and HS2.

APR14	Letters: No wonder public opinion is turning against the tired, infighting Tories	SIR – The Tories have only themselves to blame for their poor showing in recent polls. The ugly scenes we have witnessed in Parliament, over the past few months in particular, have emphasised the splits within the party, and have demonstrated that they are not worthy of being in power. Bearing in mind what happened in 1997, is history repeating itself?
APR14	Letters: A Brexit that keeps Britain trapped in a customs union with the EU is no Brexit at all	SIR – This week the BBC wheeled out Ken Clarke – yet again – to assert that leaving the EU but remaining in the customs union would result in a situation similar to our membership of the Common Market when we joined in 1973. This cannot go unchallenged. When we were part of the Common Market, we participated fully in EEC policy-making. Brexit with a customs union would leave us without a voice in the EU. It is not Brexit. Barry Goldman Storrington, West Sussex
APR15	We urgently need a new legal process for returning Isil members like Shamima Begum	We can no longer prioritise the human rights of terrorists above the lives of innocent victims The government has little choice but to allow legal aid for Shamima Begum. Many are understandably outraged, yet it is right for the state to support those that can’t afford the costs of litigation in British courts. But this is where the government needs to radically change its policy for dealing with jihadists fighting overseas. We can no longer continue to treat returning combatants from war zones such as Syria using the same legal processes with which we treat criminals in London or Glasgow. Crimes committed in the UK can be thoroughly investigated, with reliable evidence that meets the tests of criminal prosecution. How can we do the same with horrific crimes committed in the chaos of Raqqa under Isil control? Immense efforts have been made by our military and intelligence services to collect evidence in battle areas that is usable in court, often at great risk to themselves. Even so, only rarely can such crimes be successfully prosecuted in our courts.
APR15	Keep quiet, Meghan: home births only make you a target for the Mothering Police	If I’d been one of the Duchess of Sussex’s advisers, I would have warned her as soon as she fell pregnant: “You think people troll you now? All this online hate is as nothing compared to the whirlwind of spite you’ll reap if you say you fancy a home birth.”  No single act – not even holding a baby shower that costs more than most people’s starter homes – enrages the world more than expressing a wish to push your baby out without hospital intervention. Add the term “water birth” (which insiders claim is part of Meghan’s plan) and vituperative harpies will strongly hint they hope you and your offspring will drown in the tub.  I think my favourite moment in any comedy series is when heavily pregnant Daphne tells Frasier’s acerbic radio producer Roz that she hopes to have a natural birth without pain relief. Roz plucks a single hair from Daphne’s head, who yelps in pain. Roz looks at her coldly and says: “Times a million.”
APR15	Politicians are missing their chance to turn Shamima Begum into a poster girl for the strength of British values	We should repatriate Begum, and put her through our judicial system, not banish her. Shamima Begum is an improbable poster girl for British values. She is thoroughly unlikeable and has shown a depraved indifference to the murderous impact of the Islamist death cult she freely joined. Frankly, she’s easy to hate – which is why this guilt-free, emotive reaction continues to cloud the political and security implications of her case. The latest example is the row over Begum’s eligibility for legal aid to fight a political decision to strip her of UK citizenship. Making someone stateless is effectively a civil death sentence: as close as we can come to capital retribution. In the case of this wretched and deluded young woman, it is using a political sledgehammer to crack a nut.
APR15	A message to David Lammy: disagreeing with you on Brexit does not allow you to compare me to a Nazi	I’ve always liked David Lammy. I first met him during the 2001 General Election when my mother, a local nurse, stood against him in Tottenham. He was then, and is now, an effective champion for his local community and I respect his determination: raised by his single mother in the seat he now represents and winning a scholarship to a good school which was his platform to Harvard University and then the Bar. I come from Wembley, but there is much we share in terms of background. So I was saddened to hear him repeat his shrill attacks on those of us who have campaigned for Brexit. As a former Chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) – which he described as being made up of the “far-right”, white supremacists, apartheid-supporters and even Nazis – I am stunned by his use of such vitriol. The ERG has one clear mission: to support the Government in honouring the 2016 Referendum and 2017 General Election pledges. His unjustified rhetoric is offensive to victims of such injustices. We strongly disagree on our politics and on Brexit. He fervently believes in stopping the latter. Despite it being wholly undemocratic, he is both entitled to his view and should be responded to respectfully. But maligning those who hold a different opinion to him on membership of the customs union and single market as extremists is not a mature way of debating, let alone persuading. Comparing my belief that the UK should self-govern outside the confines of the European Union to the despicable slaughter of 6 million Jews is devoid of rationality. How is my enthusiasm for free trade agreements with the United States or Australia in any way connected to the prejudicial treatment of black South Africans under Apartheid? I believe in UK courts, not the European Court of Justice, having the last say on our legal matters. What part of that constitutes “hard-right fascism”?
APR15	The forgotten sex: why is men's health ignored by policy makers?	British men have died at a younger age than British women since at least the time of Queen Victoria’s accession and they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. This is not some strange peculiarity of these islands: the pattern is repeated throughout every region of the world. There is not a single country where men outlive women. In both the UK and globally, there is currently a four-year difference in life expectancy between the sexes. It is a paradox that while we live in a society in which men mostly hold the key positions of power, health policymakers and service providers have not been directed to address this inequality.
APR15	Price rises are fuelling discontent	Few issues have greater capacity to mobilise popular discontent than fuel prices. They often become the focus for wider disgruntlement, as in France, where the gilets jaunes movement sprang from a tax increase intended to underpin environmental reforms (subsequently scrapped). Here in the UK, the fuel protests during Tony Blair’s first government almost 20 years ago remain a seminal political moment, when a direct challenge was thrown down by voters feeling the pinch. Subsequent governments have been anxious to avoid direct blame for price rises and have largely frozen duties to ameliorate the higher costs of oil. After a period of relatively cheap oil, the price of a barrel is on the rise again and, with the pound weak, the higher prices are being passed on by retailers, not least to take advantage of the Easter getaway. The cost of petrol is higher than at any time for six months, averaging £1.23 a litre. In parts of southern England, a litre of diesel costs more than £1.50.
APR15	The Conservative collapse is now a national emergency	For months this newspaper has warned that the Tories are headed for an electoral reckoning, thanks to their appalling failure to deliver a meaningful Brexit. Every week, the reply has been the same from the leadership: no one cares, people just want Brexit to go away and when it does the Government can return to the tired old certainties of, say, bailing out the NHS or banning things. But it turns out that voters really do mind that Brexit has been dangerously compromised and delayed, and many core supporters do really resent the Prime Minister’s talks with Labour. Over the past few days, especially since March 29, the penny has dropped. There has been a precipitous and catastrophic collapse in Tory support. The result: the last five polls show Labour ahead, with a far greater fall in Conservative support among Leavers than Remainers, and the pro-Brexit parties coming up fast. Sir John Curtice writes that if these figures were extrapolated across a general election, the Conservatives would be reduced to 260 seats. Labour has lost ground in the past year, too, but not as much and it can probably count on an unholy alliance with the SNP. This could result in the triple whammy of a Jeremy Corbyn government cancelling Brexit and threatening the Union. This is a national emergency and there is only one imaginable escape. The paralysis in the Tory parliamentary party must end – Cabinet members and MPs need to remove Mrs May now and replace her fast. They should pay attention to the advice of Lord Spicer and Lord Hamilton of Epsom, two previous chairmen of the 1922 committee, who insist it is possible to change the rules to do so. Britain needs a new prime minister who is 100 per cent committed to Brexit. They need to recapture both the trust and the imagination of the British people by pushing through a radical programme of economic reform, including tax cuts and a sea change on issues such as crime, housing and HS2.
APR15	Don't be naive about Shamima Begum	It is easy to be naive about the character and motivations of those Britons who joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil). Some have pleaded for mercy for Shamima Begum, the so-called jihadi bride, on the basis that she was 15 when she left the UK and must have been an ingénue. But well-placed sources tell us that far from being the quiet housewife she says she was, she worked for the “morality police” and tried to recruit young women, that she carried a Kalashnikov rifle and enjoyed an elevated status. The obvious point is that Ms Begum chose to travel to Isil territory at the height of publicity about its atrocities. She crossed the border in February 2015. In August 2014, Isil forced Yazidis to flee their advance and the West began an air campaign to protect them. Isil released a stream of videos showing the beheading of Westerners. In January 2015, the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo were stormed (12 dead), followed by a kosher supermarket (four dead). In early February, footage was released of a Jordanian pilot being burned alive, and on February 15-16, Libyan militants allied to Isil beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians. Ms Begum left for Syria that same month and later admitted that, yes, she had heard about beheadings. “I was OK with it,” she said. What was it like to live under Isil? “At first it was nice.” Only when the military situation deteriorated did she lose faith, but she had “no” regrets. Many readers will therefore conclude that the case against Ms Begum stems not just from witnesses but her own words and actions. That these alone aren’t enough to guarantee a hefty sentence shows the law needs revision.

APR16	Why are we still waiting for justice 35 years after the murder of Yvonne Fletcher?	A murder that took place in broad daylight in front of dozens of witnesses and with the perpetrator trapped inside a building remains unpunished to this day. This is not for want of detective work but because the culprit was allowed to leave and return to his home country. The victim was WPc Yvonne Fletcher, shot dead while on duty outside the Libyan embassy in London 35 years ago today. Her killer was suspected to have been a diplomat identified by witnesses as Abdulmagid Salah Ameri, who was among the Libyan diplomats and staff expelled from the UK after an 10-day siege but without anyone being arrested because they claimed immunity. He is thought to be dead. In 2015, however, the Met police arrested Dr Saleh Ibrahim Mabrouk, a former member of the Gaddafi government who had claimed asylum in the UK. Although it was never alleged he fired the shots, there were hopes that a charge of conspiracy could be brought against him.
APR16	Where would we be now if Remain had won the referendum?	What’s this? I awoke yesterday, turned on the radio and the first word to be heard was not Brexit, backstop or Jacob. In fact, partly because of the extensive coverage of the Notre-Dame fire, I am pretty certain that the entire 7am bulletin passed without a single mention of the B-word. I cannot remember when that last happened. It is like trying to recall life before the mobile phone or colour television. Has it all been a bad dream? We are in a Brexit interregnum. The morning fix of indignation, frustration and sheer bemusement at what is going on (or not going on) has been suspended for Easter and/or until our hapless politicians work out what to do next. It is like giving up smoking – you know you would be better off without it and might have an apoplexy if it carries on; but there are some comforting certainties about Theresa May’s hopelessness, the Cabinet’s abject spinelessness and Parliament’s paralysis that are hard to give up. Where would we be without Brexit? What if it had never happened and the referendum in June 2016 had voted the other way: 52-48 for Remain instead of Leave? How would our politics, and our friendships, look today?
APR16	It would be a travesty to rebuild Notre-Dame as a facsimile of the original	The French should be bold and attempt a visionary, modern restoration of the cathedral For those seeking symbolism, there was plenty to be found in Paris on April 15. It was atrocious, shocking, to see one of the great monuments of European civilization, built at a moment when artistic and moral values were shared across the continent, going up in smoke and crashing down in flames.   It is tempting to read the burning of Notre Dame at several different levels, none of them very edifying. Not least, there is the bizarre incompetence of the modern French. The people who actually established building conservation as a practical science in the nineteenth century have been woefully inept in the maintenance of this sacred property. Bits have been falling off for years.
APR16	My divided country has been united by the flames of Notre-Dame	Notre-Dame de Paris will always be associated in French minds with Victor Hugo, but the inferno raging on Monday night really evoked William Blake. We Parisians love our cathedral, but we’d taken it for granted. It was stone-built; carved by guild companions who worked for eternity, not the latest zoning plans. It could not fall. And so, as we heard of the great fire, we passed through the five stages of grief. Denial – Cathedrals don’t burn down, they are built like fortresses. Anger – was it terrorism? An attack against France? Unrealistic hope – surely the firefighters could do more? Depression – this hit around 8pm, when nightfall showed the 100-ft flames roaring unabated against the darkened sky, at the heart of the church that had sent Crusaders to the Holy Land, seen Napoleon crowned and Charles de Gaulle hear Mass at the Liberation of Paris.
APR16	Shamima Begum chose to leave the UK to join a murderous cult. Why should we pay to take her back?	The last time I wrote about the jihadi bride, Shamima Begum, I got the usual wearisome accusations of Islamophobia. Unfortunately, there are British people who despise our country so much, they will bend over backwards to extend sympathy and comfort to its sworn enemies. Remarkably, they include the current leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition and his shadow home secretary. Those of us who prefer to prioritise the safety of our own citizens are “racist”.  So be it. Let them call us whatever they like. We are right, and they are useful idiots for Islamist fanatics.
APR16	Notre-Dame cathedral can and must rise again	There are few more iconic buildings in the world than the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. The fire that has ripped through the great building is not just a tragedy for France but for the whole of Europe. The church, with its familiar double towers and spire, now sadly destroyed, is a masterpiece of European medieval Gothic architecture, though modified on many occasions down the centuries. It is also a centre for worship for the Catholic faith filled with priceless artefacts, paintings and holy relics, including a piece of the true cross. These past few years have been difficult for France. The spate of terror attacks two years ago in Paris, Nice and other cities left scores dead and plunged the country into a state of emergency.
APR16	Tackling crime means upholding what is right and decent	Politicians love to tell personal stories, especially if they have an eye on the ultimate prize but fear they are not especially well-known to the public. In particular they like to emphasise the ordinariness of their backgrounds so as not to look remote from voters. In the case of Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, his backstory is far from ordinary but nor is it privileged. The son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver, he told a conference yesterday that he grew up in a poor neighbourhood in Bristol on a street once dubbed “Britain’s most dangerous”. He added: “It’s not so difficult to see how, instead of being in Cabinet, I could have turned out to have a life of crime myself.” Well, it is fairly difficult to see because he clearly had a stable and secure family that gave him the moral grounding that ensured he resisted any such temptations. He has a brother who served in the Royal Navy and is now a senior police officer, suggesting the Javids were hardly susceptible to criminal inclinations.

APR16	Letters: Small landlords won’t rent out property if tenants need never leave	SIR – My husband and I have been landlords in a small way for 25 years. We are now both over 75 and rely on the income from our properties to supplement our pensions, having had jobs in the NHS and teaching.  We have had good and bad tenants. Some have been in residence for over 10 years and we rarely increase the rent. We know that they will not be able to pay increases and, as they look after the properties well, we are happy. However, we recently had a tenant who, despite financial checks and references, paid one month’s rent and no more. We waited until the six-month agreement was up and, as they refused to move out, we went to court. Eventually the bailiffs were called in.
APR16	Letters: No wonder public opinion is turning against the tired, infighting Tories	SIR – The Tories have only themselves to blame for their poor showing in recent polls. The ugly scenes we have witnessed in Parliament, over the past few months in particular, have emphasised the splits within the party, and have demonstrated that they are not worthy of being in power. Bearing in mind what happened in 1997, is history repeating itself?
APR17	With nothing to say on Brexit or the economy, the Tories now face annihilation	The scale of the Conservative Party's political, moral and intellectual failure has been mind-boggling What’s the point of the Tory party? It is failing miserably to take us out of the EU, lacks any distinct message on the economy, and even its own members cannot explain what, and for whom, it stands for any more. There is no narrative, no philosophy, no compelling retail offer, nothing meaningful on tax, crime or homeownership – just a gigantic, appalling failure to deliver Brexit, combined with a stream of anodyne, low-level, fashionable micro-policies that excite nobody and annoy many. So why bother voting Conservative, especially if you are a Leave voter, or a younger person desperate to earn more and live a better life? It is a question that millions can no longer answer, and the reason why the Tories are now in a full-blown crisis. Many of its activists will vote for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party in the Euro elections, or stay at home for the locals.
APR17	Non-disclosure agreements have their place, but they are being widely abused on British campuses	Universities consider themselves the guardians of free speech. The special protections afforded tenured academics are premised on the principle that they should be free to speak truth to power, for the benefit of us all. It is ironic then that universities should be so keen to smother allegations of harassment, discrimination and sexual assault through the widespread use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). By choosing to settle such allegations with an NDA, universities sidestep the task of investigating allegations of misconduct, issuing findings and imposing sanctions (or not) as appropriate.
APR17	Cast your eyes  up at night and enjoy the celestial light show	Looking at the night sky from a truly dark site is one of the great human experiences, bringing a sense of wonder and awe like little else can. Standing under the arch of the Milky Way as it stretches overhead it is impossible not to be impressed by the sight or to be reminded of our own planet’s humble place in the cosmos. It is a thrill as old as mankind and universal among our tiny planet’s myriad cultures. I’ve been lucky enough to see spectacular skies from some of the world’s great sites. At Paranal, deep in the Chilean Atacama Desert and home to the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope, the nearest street light is a few hundred miles away. I was there on a crisp clear night and as my eyes adapted to the darkness, I saw the glorious southern sky appear above me until the starlight alone was bright enough to read by. A passing local was less impressed. “Good skies are grey,” he told me – at this temple of astronomy, if you can see gaps between the stars, then it’s simply not a noteworthy night.
APR17	These hardened rabble-rousers are more interested in Marxism than climate change	Anyone caught up in the Extinction Rebellion protests of the past three days could be forgiven a bit of déjà vu. The tactics, the slogans and the general behaviour of the protesters exactly echoes that of the anti-globalisation protests of the early 2000s. It should not come as any surprise. Extinction Rebellion may profess to be all about climate change but really it is just the latest rebranding of Marxism. A manifesto which appeared on the Extinction Rebellion website when the group first started its protests last November rather gave the game away.  Among its demands was an end to interest-bearing loans. Yes, it really wanted to throw a spanner in the global banking system – and, as would be inevitable, bring down the global economy with it. Extinction Rebellion has worked out that raw Marxism is a pretty hard sell these days, nut dress it up as environmentalism and you can tempt useful idiots from the shires to lie down in front of the traffic, glue themselves to trains and so on. 
APR17	Champagne only, never on weeknights – why is everyone suddenly such an alco-bore?	Some conversational topics should be off limits on the basis that they are just too boring, eg. what I am currently watching on television (text us the list… move on). But now there is one subject that makes all previous boring ones look riveting by comparison: how much less we are drinking and where we sit on the new sobriety scale. Maybe you’re not drinking on three days each week? Or you’re only drinking every other day? Or you’re not drinking at all Monday to Friday, not including Friday? Perhaps you are in the ‘barely drink at all these days’ camp, or even ‘recently full time sober’? If you are any of the above – sober, part time sober, drinking more mindfully – you’ll certainly be letting people know about it, because there is now kudos in being aware of your intake and limiting it. You want to get it out there that you are not stuck in some Top Gear bubble – beer and meat and fags all day, don’t care – you’re moving with the times.
APR17	The only consistency about the climate change protesters is that they are completely wrong	Police have arrested more than 100 climate change protestors who have brought parts of London to a halt and vandalised dozens of buildings. They are part of an allegedly global movement demanding more action from governments to tackle global warming. The activists have deliberately set out to cause maximum disruption and to get themselves arrested for wanton damage and obstruction. The campaigners belong to an outfit called Extinction Rebellion, some of whose members stripped off in the public gallery of the House of Commons earlier this month. They are in the anti-capitalist tradition of the Occupy movement which grew to prominence around the time of the 2008 financial crash. Some claim a kindred spirit with the Greenham Common women who sought to block the deployment of US nuclear weapons to Britain in the mid-1980s.

APR17	Letters: Notre-Dame’s forest of roof beams had qualities concrete can’t supply	SIR – I beg that any proposal to replace the 800-year old timbered “forest” of the roof of Notre-Dame with “fireproof concrete” be dismissed out of hand. Not only did the timbers reinforce the majestic resonance of the organ, but the roof breathed to aerate the whole ecosystem. When the timber roof of the Protaton, the oldest church of Karyes on Mount Athos, was insensitively replaced by the Greek authorities with concrete, the damp rising in the building destroyed the irreplaceable early 14th-century Byzantine frescoes. The huge framework for the bells in the tower of Notre-Dame contains vertical elements three feet square. It will be hard to match these timbers. Perhaps we must look outside Europe.
APR17	Letters: Notre-Dame will one day see resurrection like Dresden’s Frauenkirche	SIR – Many years ago, I recall standing among the weed- and bramble-infested rubble that was once the Frauenkirche in Dresden. After the Berlin Wall came down it was decided to restore this awe-inspiring example of German Baroque.  The charred stones were rescued and identified. What had been destroyed, was replaced with freshly cut stone.  Today, the Frauenkirche is completely rebuilt and must rank among the most beautiful structures in the world. It is a symbol of redemption and resurrection. The folk of Dresden are rightly proud of their miraculous achievement. Within a decade, I am sure the Parisians will be equally proud.
APR18	Silence of the Nats 'almost deafening' after Kezia Dugdale wins defamation case	The bitter battle fought out in a Scottish court this week between a famous politician and an equally well-known and controversial blogger is certain to have implications for both Scotland’s distinctive legal system and its political battleground. The case, which has been hailed as a victory for free speech, ended with Stuart Campbell, who runs the outspoken separatist-supporting Wings Over Scotland blog, losing his defamation action against Kezia Dugdale, former leader of the Scottish Labour Party. But an angry Mr Campbell, who raised an action for £25,000 claiming that he’d been defamed by Ms Dugdale, Labour leader north of the border from 2015 to 2017, after she’d accused him of "homophobic tweets" is considering an appeal. The judge in the case said that although the politician had been wrong in implying he is homophobic, her remarks were protected by the defence of fair comment.
APR18	At Easter, it is inspiring to see how people can find light even in the midst of terrible darkness	Easter and Christmas are the two most important celebrations in the Christian calendar. I have always felt that the words we hear at Christmas come into their own at Easter especially those from St John’s Gospel, “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness does not overcome it”. On Sunday, Christians celebrate the resurrection of Christ, the Light of the World, and the triumph of life over death and light over darkness. Already this year we have seen some terrible deeds of darkness, from young people being knifed on our streets, to the slaughter of men, women and children while they were worshipping God. There are times when it can feel as if the light has gone out of the world and darkness reigns. But Easter gives us hope. The attempt to extinguish the life and light of our Lord failed. Darkness was defeated by His overcoming death. Through His resurrection, His light continues to shine. Throughout my own life, it has been a humbling experience to meet and to listen to people who have suffered the most terrible personal tragedies. The way they have grieved and turned their grief into action to help others in the most extraordinary way is an example of the light overcoming the darkness.
APR18	The Mueller report shows the West cannot be complacent about Russian interference	Donald Trump did not collude with Russia. That is the message many will take from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. It is the same message many took from US Attorney General William Barr’s summary of the Mueller Report, published in a letter to Congress in late March. Although the report “established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome” and that Donald Trump’s campaign “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts”, Mueller concluded that Trump had not colluded with Russia. This is, in part, because Mueller eschewed the use of the term “collusion”, preferring...
APR18	Forget a hardline Brexiteer, we need a PM who can focus on uniting our warring nation	Popular wisdom has it that the primary problem in the failure of our Brexit negotiations has been the Prime Minister, and the fact that she never really believed in leaving the EU in the first place. Replace Theresa May with a genuine Brexiteer, the thinking goes, and we would be able to negotiate a far better, tougher deal with the EU than we have managed so far.  Well, up to a point. Theresa May has certainly not covered herself in glory over the past two years, but as Sir Ivan Rogers, the former British ambassador to the EU, has just declared, electing a “true believer” – meaning a hardline, ERG type – to lead the country through the coming months would not necessarily solve all our problems.  Just for a moment, let’s imagine what such a leader might try and do, or promise to do. Reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, perhaps. Declare the Irish backstop utterly unacceptable and seek a technical solution to circumvent the problem. Take the £39 billion off the table in a bid to hold Brussels to ransom. Or go full nuclear – tell Mr Barnier and his unelected cronies that we’re leaving without a deal.  The problem is, at this stage of the game, with the timeframe we now have before us, none of these options can possibly work. The EU has repeatedly said it won’t countenance reopening the Withdrawal Agreement. Mrs May’s deal already commits both sides to finding the best alternative to the backstop, while removing it completely negates the whole thing. So why not ditch the deal entirely? Because the alternatives – to negotiate a new deal or leave without one – carry their own set of problems, namely that we’ve run out of time to do the first before the October deadline without putting Brexit itself in jeopardy, and the second option leads inexorably to a breakdown in any kind of future relationship with the EU. 
APR18	Britain is in the grips of a knife crime crisis. So why are our police boogying on the streets with eco-anarchists?	Just when it seemed that the Extinction Rebellion protests that have caused days of commuter chaos could not get more farcical, social media footage that appears to show uniformed officers dancing with activists in Oxford Circus has caused widespread public anger. The sight of police officers seemingly reveling with protesters rather than clamping down on the protesters’ illegal tactics of causing deliberate wide-scale disruption, has sparked outrage amongst the millions of hard-working people who have been directly put out by the fiasco. The optics of metropolitan police officers apparently boogying with eco-anarchists a time when the police apparently lack the manpower to deal with knife crime are also  cause for embarrassment, raising severe questions about the Metropolitan Police’s sense of priorities.
APR18	Is this the right way to tackle the porn problem?	The Government is absolutely right to worry about children accessing online pornography and some parents will be glad that it is facing up to the problem. But one should be wary of passing laws that people will openly flaunt and that the state cannot effectively enforce. This might be the outcome of the new online age verification checks. Asking for proof of age before pornography can be accessed sounds intuitive – people have to prove their age, for instance, before buying a packet of cigarettes. But it’s hard to imagine many Britons will brazenly pop into their newsagent to buy a so-called adult porn pass and so long as it is possible to use virtual private networks, which make it appear as if users are logging on from outside the UK, people will probably find such creative, private means to get around the block. Then there are the civil liberties concerns. Any rule that leads to the gathering of data is open to leak, scamming, even blackmail; with the effect that in trying to crack down on one kind of crime, the law increases to another. Philosophically, it all returns to the age-old tension between trying to maximise the general wellbeing while trying to minimise state intervention, on the understanding that the latter can often do more harm than good.
APR18	Londoners deserve better than their grandstanding Mayor	How has a great city like London ended up with a hapless mayor like Sadiq Khan? He is supposed to be a champion for the UK’s capital city yet manages to both charmless and ineffectual. On his watch knife crime has soared, though he denies any responsibility for this despite being the police authority for London. He has used his platform to grandstand against Donald Trump despite the importance of American financial business to London. He has campaigned for a second EU referendum which may be understandable in a city that voted Remain but extended to turning the New Year’s fireworks display into a pro-EU event. Mr Khan is fond of saying that whatever the Brexit vote “London is open”. Tell that to the businesses, commuters and tourists whose lives have been made infinitely more difficult these past few days by the antics of the climate change protestors who have flooded the capital. They included a pair of idiots who glued themselves to the roof of a Dockland Light Railway train, forcing the police to use special solvents to remove them.
APR18	Libya's power struggle is creating a global geopolitical crisis	The advance on the Libyan capital Tripoli masterminded by General Khalifa Haftar, head of the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), has so far claimed the lives of around 200 people. Missiles are being fired indiscriminately into residential areas of a city of three million people, the base for the Government of National Accord (GNA) which is supposedly under the ausipices of the UN.  Unlike in 2011, when Nato forces stopped Col Gaddafi’s advance on Benghazi, there is no public appetite for another military intervention.
APR18	Letters: Why are we bound by the law but protesters are allowed to flout it?	SIR – If I parked a pink yacht in the middle of the road and started knitting a yurt there, the police would arrest me and I would be charged with obstructing the highway. A spokesman for the climate change activists said yesterday that they had tried every other means to get their message across. May I suggest they join the Green Party and let everybody else get on with their lives? Rob Young Swanmore, Hampshire
APR18	Letters: Notre-Dame’s forest of roof beams had qualities concrete can’t supply	SIR – I beg that any proposal to replace the 800-year old timbered “forest” of the roof of Notre-Dame with “fireproof concrete” be dismissed out of hand. Not only did the timbers reinforce the majestic resonance of the organ, but the roof breathed to aerate the whole ecosystem. When the timber roof of the Protaton, the oldest church of Karyes on Mount Athos, was insensitively replaced by the Greek authorities with concrete, the damp rising in the building destroyed the irreplaceable early 14th-century Byzantine frescoes. The huge framework for the bells in the tower of Notre-Dame contains vertical elements three feet square. It will be hard to match these timbers. Perhaps we must look outside Europe.
APR19	After my own dark night, the importance of love, renewal and redemption have never been clearer	Fully to understand the Easter story it helps to be hounded by the mob, to know that nothing that you say or do can deflect the hostility, and that in any case the distinctions between true and false, just and unjust, good and evil have all been suspended. Some can undergo this experience in a spirit of charity, and one in particular rose above his suffering to forgive those who inflicted it. The Easter story tells us of the redemption that comes into the world, when such torment is willingly undergone for others’ sake. But it also tells us of the time of utter darkness, the time of nothingness, when the light of creation has gone out. St John of the Cross called this the dark night of the soul. The world lay in such a darkness on the first Easter Saturday; and at the end of this most terrible week a similar darkness fell on me. Reading the outrageous articles in the New Statesman, the Times, the Sun and elsewhere, in which things that I have never said and attitudes that I have never entertained are unscrupulously pinned on me, seeing all my work as a writer and philosopher scribbled over with ignorant and groundless accusations, I have had to take stock of my life, and for a moment it seemed that it amounted to nothing. It was as though I had been ceremonially stripped of all my assets, and shut away in a box.
APR19	We must leverage a state visit by Donald Trump to strengthen special relationship	Field Marshall Sir John Dill is not your average household name. As Churchill’s ‘guy’ in Washington during World War II, he is credited with establishing the so-called ‘special relationship’. President Roosevelt described him as "the most important figure …in the combined operations of our two countries”. I visited Dill’s grave in Arlington Cemetery last week. As a dual UK-US national I’m proud of how that special relationship has matured over the decades and keen to explore how we can deepen our mutual bonds.
APR19	The Government needs to target the online porn giants who've done so much damage to society	I was appearing on a radio discussion show with David Starkey this week when the conversation turned to online pornography. His response was unequivocal. Despite his long-winded sermons on previous topics, on this he offered succinctly that he was a libertarian and didn’t think society should be tailored to the weak, before adding “I should declare an interest - I quite enjoy pornography.” It was an honest answer, and one no doubt shared by millions of men. But here’s the challenge: it’s not solely the “weak” in our society who are suffering the consequences of the proliferation of online pornography, it's just that the abuse and objectification of women that feminists have been warning of for decades was not enough to get the attention of those in power. Now, however, it is clear that our culture of deregulated pornography has been a disaster for an enormous number of boys and men as well. Pornography has become a vast global industry. Almost 92 billion videos were viewed on Pornhub, the world’s largest free internet porn site, in 2016 by 64 million daily visitors. The online porn sector is estimated to be worth around 15 billion dollars and the UK is its third biggest consumer. Naked pics in Lad Mags are being replaced with violent porn, including a growth in rape and incest porn.
APR19	I lived through the Tory party's darkest days – the similarities with now are deeply troubling	Age may not always bring wisdom, but it does lend perspective. I was first elected to the House of Commons in 1987 and in the years since then I’ve lived through, and played a small part in, three events which have traumatised, damaged and nearly broken the Conservative Party. I was PPS to Margaret Thatcher’s closest friend and ally John Wakeham when our party ejected her from office. I learned then that when a party focuses on itself and not on the country, it loses both respect and trust. I was a Government Whip during the Maastricht Debates, when the Conservative Party turned in on itself while a bemused public looked on. Photographs at the time showed that the experience turned my brown hair grey. I learned then that when our Party cannot compromise on Europe, the country turns to others to resolve these issues. That led to the third trauma of my time as a Tory MP – the destruction of the Conservative Parliamentary Party by Tony Blair in 1997. On May 1 that year I was a Minister in Her Majesty’s Government. On May 2 I was unemployed – and about to discover that there is nothing so “ex” as an ex-MP (a feeling that added immensely to my gratitude when I was re-elected in 2001).
APR19	It's a very British Easter holiday heatwave – and nothing's changed since 1949	We have just got back from the Caribbean (don’t weep for me), where we were staying in a resort that was made up almost entirely of Americans. “Vacationing” Americans are very friendly, effusive even, not at all like the ones I have met in, say, New York, who walk quickly with their heads down, making me feel quite at home. No: these Americans really wanted to chat. We’d stand behind them in the queue at the breakfast buffet, minding our own business, and all they wanted to do was talk to us about a) the royals, and b) how excited we must be to see the sun.
APR19	Police and government need to stop dancing around nuisance protests	Protesters are going to protest: the police are there to enforce the law. They are not supposed to dance with the activists or go skateboarding, as some were caught on film doing in London. These officers should know that not only have they disgraced themselves, but they also contribute to their uniform’s slow loss of authority. In their desperate bid to win the approval of politically correct causes, the police force is losing the trust of the public – especially of anyone who has to travel this Easter weekend. Extinction Rebellion is a ridiculous movement that really ought to have no impact at all. In defence of the environment they have targeted Britain, which has reduced carbon emissions; Parliament just when MPs are on holiday; public transport, even though it is less polluting than the resulting traffic jam; and Jeremy Corbyn, despite being a vegetarian socialist who works an allotment. Nevertheless, they are undoubtedly having an impact because the authorities don’t know how to deal with them. One reason is that our political class either sympathises with the views of Extinction Rebellion or doesn’t want to be seen to disagree. Action is tempered by sympathy for their cause and fear of the voters. But can’t these public servants see that they are alienating public support just as fast as the daft protesters are? As we report today, councils are accused of using anti-social behaviour powers to hit residents with fines for activities such as dropping children off at school or feeding the birds: just under 10,000 fixed penalty notices were issued in 2018, up from 470 in 2015. So, while petty nuisances, even everyday activities, earn the average voter a lucrative clampdown, protesters who bring the capital city to a halt are handled with all the respect and delicacy shown towards a rare species of bird that has occupied a train roof and isn’t sure how to get down. Whatever happened to the priority of public order, especially when something as disruptive or even dangerous as targeting Heathrow airport is threatened?

APR19	Letters: Why did the police just mill around while Waterloo Bridge was put out of use for days?	SIR – I walked across Waterloo Bridge on Thursday while visiting London. I was stunned to find that 1) the bridge was completely closed to vehicular traffic; 2) there were more than 20 policemen milling around;

APR20	Without forgiveness, we will never be able to fix this divided country	‘A divided society”; “a broken country”. These twin diagnoses have been uttered so frequently about our country over recent years that they have become clichés. If they are accurate then the only consolation comes from the fact that the same can be said of almost any other country at the moment. And if there is a cause, it lies not only in the rise of new technology but also in the loss of an older virtue. Since outright victory in politics is rarely either achievable or desirable, we need to be able to practise and enact in politics the means not just of “winning” but of forgiving. Perhaps it is because of the arrival of Easter, but I have been thinking about forgiveness a lot lately, and have become convinced that we all need to do so. We live in an era in which political attack is commonplace. Not just in Parliament but in the online world – a world that makes the House of Commons sound like a Trappist monastery. In such places, the expectation that when an error meets the truth the error will concede the truth’s ground proves to be wildly inaccurate. A study at Harvard university a few years back showed that the more likely tendency is for people to double-down on their error. Though we probably didn’t need Harvard to tell us that: anybody who has been married could have told us. In politics, the temptation to double-down is especially strong. It requires a certain lack of ego, or at least a willingness to lose face, to admit that you have got something wrong. And the political world is far from being filled with humble people in possession of minimal self-regard. Thus people in politics are especially loth to admit errors. To err is human, but politicians are certainly not divine. So what would forgiveness in politics look like, and how and when should it be awarded?
APR20	Andrew Adonis running as an MEP perfectly sums up the nature of the Brussels gravy train	The year 2019 is already shaping up to be very strange indeed. A group of vegans has brought London to a shuddering halt. Politicians of all persuasions have ignored the largest democratic mandate in British history. Aston Villa has a serious chance of promotion. But perhaps the most astonishing development has been the sight of serial appointee Lord Adonis participating in the democratic process. This week the Labour peer, a former policy adviser to the Blair government, announced his attention to stand as an MEP in the South West, where he will face off against Ann Widdecombe (expect fireworks). Hedging his bets, perhaps, Adonis has agreed to “suspend”, rather than “resign”, his seat in the House of Lords while doing so. Adonis, a railway fanatic, well understands the charm of two gravy trains getting up to steam at the same time. It is depressing enough that nearly three years after the referendum, Britain has been drawn into the charade of European elections. But the sight of Lord Adonis sitting in Brussels would be a viscerally painful reminder of the crisis assailing our democracy; no one better embodies the disconnect between ordinary people and a remote, self-interested elite than this unelected peer.
APR20	Britons no longer just want to leave the EU - they want to change politics for good by smashing the two-party system	The rapid rise of the Brexit Party in the polls just days after we launched formally has sent a shiver down the spine of the Conservative Party. This sense of apprehension is well deserved, as far as I am concerned. The omens for Theresa May do not look good. Take Councillor Barry Lewis, the Conservative leader of Derbyshire county council. On Friday, he confirmed that his group recently supported a motion not to take part in the European elections on May 23.  Just think about that. The faithful servants of one of the oldest political parties in the world are on strike. They refuse to go out and canvass, such is their anger – and, no doubt, sheer embarrassment – at the appalling mess created by our dishonest prime minister.
APR20	From tenancies to marriage, the Tories have fundamentally misunderstood what a contract should mean	People who own houses will, we are told, be banned from evicting their tenants without good reason. James Brokenshire, the housing minister, promises “the biggest change to the private rental sector in a generation”, aimed at preventing “unethical” landlords reclaiming their properties. His proposal has been widely applauded by commentators and broadcasters. Landlords, at least in the abstract, are not popular. Our very vocabulary is loaded against them. They do not, in general, own much land, and they are very rarely lords. But, on some deep ancestral level, the word makes us think of absentee dukes curling their lips while their agents drive weeping children off their Irish estates rather than of struggling Londoners letting out their basements. The word “evict” is even more loaded. What it actually means here is “decline to extend a contract”. A tenancy can be long or short, depending on what the two parties agree, and there is generally an eight-week notice period, intended to protect both sides. A tenant might need to move unexpectedly. A property-owner might need to sell a property or inhabit it himself. Two months has emerged as standard because it is the time most people consider adequate.
APR20	Sacred Mysteries: A French king’s ransom for the crown of thorns	What, you might have wondered, was the crown of thorns doing in Notre-Dame? The reputed relic of the Passion of Jesus was rescued from danger during Monday’s fire by a human chain.  The first priority had been the Blessed Sacrament. “The Blessed Sacrament,” explained CBS News helpfully, “refers to items used during church services to represent the body and blood of Jesus Christ.”  Indeed Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is really present in the Blessed Sacrament: his body and blood with his soul and divinity. To rescue the Sacrament was an act of piety, for it is not as though people thought Jesus would have been hurt by the fire, any more than he is by communicants eating his body in the Sacrament. 
APR20	Easter is a time of death, rebirth and, with a little cooperation, rebuilding the broken	Last Monday was not the first time that Notre-Dame in Paris had come to terrible harm. On the facade, below the rose window that firemen worked to protect, used to be a larger than life size row of 28 kings of Judah under stone canopies, sculpted in the 13th century. In 1793, the revolutionary government ordered that “all signs of superstition and feudalism” should be destroyed. In October, from the facade of the cathedral, renamed the Temple of Reason, the statues of the biblical kings were sent crashing down, not by an angry mob, but by a hired contractor. He first struck off their heads, quite cleanly, at the neck. It had been assumed they were thrown into the Seine. In the 19th century new statues replaced them. Then in 1977, workmen investigating a leak found a trench in a domestic courtyard in the rue de la Chaussée-d’Antin (near the Galeries Lafayette). They found 21 stone heads carefully buried, face down, in soft plaster, all orientated southwards – towards Notre-Dame. They still bore traces of their medieval polychromy. It was later realised that they had been buried by a devout Parisian, Jean-Baptiste Lakanal, who had bought them in 1796 in an auction from a state grown tired of their lying in a pile of rubble in the street.

APR20	Letters: Climate protesters ignore the complex realities of reducing emissions	SIR – The disruptive climate protesters are calling for zero emissions by 2025. This is not a practical aim. If we wish to keep warm and mobile we need to produce energy. The protesters seem to believe, for example, that electric vehicles are a panacea. But these require batteries. To produce batteries, rare materials have to be mined, extracted and refined, producing carbon emissions. Then they have to be transported from distant sources, converted to batteries and, finally, disposed of. All of these processes result in pollution. Only constant winds and sunlight, or nuclear power, can provide zero-emission electricity. However, there are power losses in transmission, meaning that there needs to be a network, and this will nearly always utilise pylons – which spoil the landscape and are a danger to wildlife. We have to look beyond these options.

APR21	Dear Extinction Rebellion: your aims are worthy, but take your pink boat to China instead	Look, I share some of the irritation at these climate change protesters. I am not in favour of paralysing public transport in the greatest city on earth, and stopping people from getting to work. I don’t want some double-barrelled activist telling me that air travel is only to be used in emergencies – when his own Instagram account contains pictures of his recent skiing holiday. I admire some of these celebrity thesps, but when I see them mounted on a pink boat in Oxford Circus, blocking the traffic and telling the world how many trees they have planted to offset the carbon footprint of their flights in from Los Angeles, I slightly grind my teeth.  And I am utterly fed up with being told by nice young people that their opinions are more important than my own – because they will be around a lot longer than me, and therefore that they have a greater stake in the future of the planet.  With all due humility to my juniors, I intend to be alive for a very long time. Indeed, one of my few remaining ambitions is to be on the beach at Hastings to write a colour story, for the Telegraph, on the thousandth anniversary of the Norman landings in 2066 (complete with reflections, at this rate, on wherever the UK will have got to in the Brexit negotiations). And I am not sure why it is so glibly assumed that young people care more than anyone else about these issues. 
APR21	The Sri Lanka attacks shatter the country's new era of peace	The murderous attacks in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday seem principally designed to hit the island’s tourism, which has begun to flourish again after the civil war ended 10 years ago. Hotels popular with Westerners were among the targets – with British nationals among the dead – but so, too, were Catholic churches. To target a place of worship on its holiest day adds another dimension of wickedness to a series of already appalling atrocities. No one has claimed credit for the attack, but the use of suicide bombers in coordinated attacks is a tactic typically employed by Islamic extremists.  The perpetrators consider Christianity to be an alien creed and the churches likely to be attended by foreigners. But there are more than one million Christians, mostly Catholics, living in Sri Lanka; and as with fellow worshippers in other countries, they have been singled out for their faith. 
APR21	We adults have much to learn from Paddington and Mrs Tiggywinkle	In 2013, when Bloomsbury reissued J K Rowling’s Harry Potter books with covers designed for adult readers, the scoffing was unconfined. For an adult “to read a children’s book is not escapism - it’s evasion, it’s retreat, it’s surrender”, wrote a disgruntled author of grown-up fiction. But the lit-shaming had little effect: between 2015 and 2018 the UK book sales monitor, Nielsen, reported an increase of 42 per cent in sales of children’s fiction bought for readers of 17 or over, and this summer, Bloomsbury will publish a book by Dr Katherine Rundell of All Souls College, Oxford, with the snappy title, Why You Should Read Children’s Books, Even Though You Are So Old and Wise.  Dr Rundell, whose preferred comfort reading is Michael Bond’s Paddington books, argues that children’s literature offers adults a sense of hope. From the adolescent Rousseau, “forced to feed on fiction” as a substitute for friends, to modern accounts of childhood reading, such as Francis Spufford’s The Child That Books Built and Lucy Mangan’s Bookworm, there is overwhelming evidence for children’s literature as an enduring solace, enchantment and guide to the conundrum that is adult life.  Less often mentioned is the fact that the best children’s writers are formidable stylists. Twitted by a critic for her use of the word “goffering”, the novelist Candia McWilliam pointed out that it occurs in Beatrix Potter’s The Tale of Mrs Tiggywinkle.
APR21	Do any of these smug, protesting green activists actually work for a living?	Tomorrow is “Earth Day” – but after the Extinction Rebellion shenanigans this week, I would imagine that a good many harassed travellers feel like telling the Earth to stick it where the Sun doesn’t shine. It makes sense that these narcissists in activists clothing would have picked a workers’ Bank Holiday for their antics – I wonder how many of them have jobs? It’s always been the privileged who’ve gone gaga for green issues; they’re friends of the Earth because it’s been such a good friend to them. Prince Charles apparently saw no contradiction in flying to the USA to collect an award for services to the environment in 2007, and then making a 16,000-mile, private plane “environmental tour” of South America. The famous having taken over from the posh as the arbiters of don’t-do-as-I-do,-do-as-I-say virtue, it follows that Leonardo DiCaprio made an 8,000-mile round trip to collect an award for publicising climate change. And this week, Emma Thompson jetted in from Los Angeles to rally the troops – a single, 5,456‑mile transatlantic flight between LA and London stomping out a three-tonne carbon footprint. Extinction Rebellion, which is demanding that flights be used only in emergencies, simpered that Dame Emma’s jaunt was “an unfortunate cost in our bigger battle to save the planet”. Or rather, It’s OK for People Like Us. Scruffy though this lot are, I’d be very surprised if their leaders weren’t privately educated and appropriately entitled. Ecology is politics for people who don’t like people and are miffed that the masses are now free to travel cheaply, rather than being hooked up to a plough or doing laundry in a creek all through the Easter weekend. Just like the politicians they decry, there’s one rule for them and another for the rest of us – as when their leading light, Rupert Read, took a taxi to a radio interview because he was in “a terrible rush”. Meanwhile, his crusty comrade, one Robin Boardman-Pattison, flounced out of another interview after it was pointed out that the skiing trips he had posted on social media are hardly the “emergencies” that he wants flying to be confined to.
APR21	Sorry Remainers, you can mourn and ‘stand by’ Paris and still want to leave the EU	Over the past ten or so years, as tragedy after tragedy has afflicted Europe – terrorist atrocities in France and Belgium, the earthquake in Italy that killed 297 people – the Western response has been a mixture of the agonised, compassionate, shocked and so on. But at the front of the pack of collective responses is always “solidarity” – a word that rises immediately to the surface and makes itself heard again and again and again till I want to scream. When I hear “solidarity”, I hear a word that’s performative (look at me having a moral, compassionate response!), that makes all kinds assumptions (“we” stand with you because “we” are all good people like me), and one that implies you’re either with or against that moral “we”. What does “solidarity” actually mean? This remains unclear; but its function is clear. It’s word that can be hijacked to suit any political end at all.
APR21	Don't blame Leavers for the Tory poll crisis, blame Theresa May	If the Tories sink to new depths in the polls, no one can blame it on the Leavers. The Conservative Party is not being punished for failure to pass Theresa May’s appalling Withdrawal Agreement but for putting the Agreement forward in the first place – and now for conspiring with Jeremy Corbyn to try to ram it through. The issue is the Remain majority in Parliament and the fact that so many senior Tories simply refuse to accept that a large percentage of the country truly believes in a real Brexit and will vote accordingly. There are Remainers in the Conservative hierarchy who appear willing to sacrifice their own party – even put Labour in power – just to stop Brexit or water it down beyond recognition. They see Brexit as a one-off policy error that can be corrected by Parliament and will then disappear, which is totally wrong. The consequences of abandoning or undermining Brexit are enormous, as the rebellion of Conservative voters shows. Far from making Nigel Farage vanish, the Remainer stitch-up has revived his career and given him a second wind. The Brexit Party represents a rejuvenated Eurosceptic movement – and could do even better than Ukip at its electoral height.
APR21	Religion isn't cosy, it's about risk and witness	A religion can comfort its believers, certainly, but that doesn’t mean it is cosy. On the contrary, belief often carries risks – of ridicule, marginalisation, even persecution. Across the world, Christians are subject to harassment and violence; in Iran, “apostates” can face the death penalty. In China, the government is bulldozing mosques and putting thousands of Muslims in re‑education camps. Even in Britain, the horror of anti-Semitism has returned, while the memory of the Holocaust apparently recedes, which is why, more than ever, the full story must be taught in schools. Given its history, Western society ought to be incredibly sensitive to freedom of conscience. It is true that for centuries our religious establishments persecuted minorities, but now it feels as if the pendulum has swung the other way and Western culture has become so anti-religion that politicians are unwilling to speak out on behalf, in particular, of oppressed Christians. If religious people are an embarrassment to the modern elite, it’s worth remembering that they often were in the past, too. The religious conscience has historically put followers on the side of the anti-slavery movement, women’s rights, social reform and mercy for refugees, and because the faithful usually believe they are commanded to speak their minds, what makes them such effective critics of injustice is that they will not, cannot remain silent.
APR21	Easter is a time of death, rebirth and, with a little cooperation, rebuilding the broken	Last Monday was not the first time that Notre-Dame in Paris had come to terrible harm. On the facade, below the rose window that firemen worked to protect, used to be a larger than life size row of 28 kings of Judah under stone canopies, sculpted in the 13th century. In 1793, the revolutionary government ordered that “all signs of superstition and feudalism” should be destroyed. In October, from the facade of the cathedral, renamed the Temple of Reason, the statues of the biblical kings were sent crashing down, not by an angry mob, but by a hired contractor. He first struck off their heads, quite cleanly, at the neck. It had been assumed they were thrown into the Seine. In the 19th century new statues replaced them. Then in 1977, workmen investigating a leak found a trench in a domestic courtyard in the rue de la Chaussée-d’Antin (near the Galeries Lafayette). They found 21 stone heads carefully buried, face down, in soft plaster, all orientated southwards – towards Notre-Dame. They still bore traces of their medieval polychromy. It was later realised that they had been buried by a devout Parisian, Jean-Baptiste Lakanal, who had bought them in 1796 in an auction from a state grown tired of their lying in a pile of rubble in the street.
APR21	Letters: Triumph of the climate activists has exposed the Government’s failings	SIR – Parliament Square in London is a public space of global architectural and political significance. On Saturday night the roads were closed; there was rubbish everywhere, and the stench of urine as great buildings were used as urinals. Music was being played at high volume, despite the late hour. Police stood by watching this scene of lawlessness. Can the Conservatives ever claim to be the party of law and order again?
APR21	Letters: Climate protesters ignore the complex realities of reducing emissions	SIR – The disruptive climate protesters are calling for zero emissions by 2025. This is not a practical aim. If we wish to keep warm and mobile we need to produce energy. The protesters seem to believe, for example, that electric vehicles are a panacea. But these require batteries. To produce batteries, rare materials have to be mined, extracted and refined, producing carbon emissions. Then they have to be transported from distant sources, converted to batteries and, finally, disposed of. All of these processes result in pollution. Only constant winds and sunlight, or nuclear power, can provide zero-emission electricity. However, there are power losses in transmission, meaning that there needs to be a network, and this will nearly always utilise pylons – which spoil the landscape and are a danger to wildlife. We have to look beyond these options.
APR22	The time for denial is over. Conservatives have to take the climate crisis seriously	No one sits up to listen more than I do when a 16 year old activist takes the stage, in this case the climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg speaking on Sunday to Extinction Rebellion protestors in London. After all, I was that age when, 42 years ago, I caused a stir by telling the Conservative conference to roll back socialism. Like her, I was a teenager who believed I should get involved in a vital cause, and fight for something crucial for decades ahead. There, the similarities end. In my case, many of my contemporaries at school would have disagreed with me, and most would not have cared. In her case, huge numbers of young people support her message, and the issues she raises have become the prime political concern of activists of her generation. While I was concerned that left wing ideas were destroying opportunity, she and many more are motivated by the growing awareness that the whole of humanity is starting to devastate the planet. It is time to recognise that these young activists are indeed focused on the right issue. The solutions presented by protestors in London or by Green parties around the world may be ill thought-out, but the analysis is now hard to gainsay. The film presented by Sir David Attenborough last week was compelling in its argument that there is perhaps only a decade left to avert the greatest threat Earth has faced in thousands of years.
APR22	The Sri Lanka attacks reflect an era of global Christian persecution that surpasses Roman or Soviet times	The death and destruction in Sri Lanka was particularly shocking given that it took place on Easter Sunday, the holiest feast of the Christian year. However, it was also horribly familiar, for we are now living through an unprecedented era of Christian persecution.  Most people associate persecution of Christians with the Roman empire and martyrs facing the lions. Others may recall the Soviet regime and the repression of believers during the time of Stalin. But this century is fast becoming a rival to both of these eras. According to the respected Pew Research Centre, Christians are the most targeted body of believers in 144 countries, up from 128 in 2015. And there is barely a country from Saharan Africa to Pakistan where Christians worship freely without intimidation. 
APR22	In the smartphone era, it's worryingly easy to play at being Sherlock Holmes	Have you ever found a bag or wallet on a train? If so, did you hand it over to station staff immediately – or were you a little more ingenious in your efforts to return it? My guess is your decision might hinge on what you found inside the bag. Did the owner’s name speak to you? Did you feel some sort of talismanic kinship based on a pen or library card? Did you feel overwhelming sympathy for the bereft proprietor? This dilemma informs the plot of film director Neil Jordan’s new thriller Greta where an empathetic waitress (Chloe Grace Moretz) retrieves a smart green leather handbag from a subway train and returns it in person to the rich but lonely Greta Hidbeg (Isabelle Huppert), with alarming consequences. When I read reviews of the thriller I felt a pang of recognition. Six weeks ago I was on a train heading from Clapham Junction to Waterloo when I noticed a wallet on the floor. I asked the woman sitting near it if she’d dropped her purse, but she said it must have belonged to a passenger who’d just disembarked. So I picked it up, noting the soft black leather and Christian Dior logo.
APR22	How dare the keyboard theologists of Twitter question Jacob Rees-Mogg's faith	Twitter, you will be surprised to learn, is not the best place to debate and discuss religion. If you want self-indulgent sneering at others' beliefs, then it's right up there with the best of the social media platforms. But woe betide any Christian - especially any Christian politician - who dares express devotion to God using the micro-blogging site. Jacob Rees-Mogg knows this now. On Easter Sunday the Conservative MP Tweeted: “Christ is risen. He is risen indeed, Alleluia.” A short, sincerely intended expression of one’s faith on the most important date in the Christian calendar wouldn’t normally be an opportunity to launch a full-throated attack on him, but this is Britain and this is 2019. In response the broadcaster James O’Brien declared: “You ain’t no Christian, bruv.” The riposte was carefully worded and emulated the now famous riposte by a Muslim man to an Islamist terrorist in 2015: “You ain’t no Muslim, bruv.”
APR22	The best way to take education forward? Set the system back 75 years	Writing in the Telegraph, Nick Timothy warned that "Corbyn would set our schools back 30 years".  Probably so, after all Corbyn is a reactionary neo-Marxist. As a right-wing reformer I would like to set our whole education system back something more like 75 years and then take it forward on the sound foundations of our primary schools of those days when even pupils from poor backgrounds were taught in well-disciplined classes. They had the basic skills of reading, writing and mathematics by the time they were eleven  years old. Sadly in those days things then went badly wrong in the secondary and tertiary stages.  Only the academically brighter ones were  given a decent chance to progress, the others being dumped either into Secondary Modern  Schools or underfunded and under-valued Technical  Schools, before arriving onto the jobs market at sixteen.
APR22	Don't blame Leavers for the Tory poll crisis, blame Theresa May	If the Tories sink to new depths in the polls, no one can blame it on the Leavers. The Conservative Party is not being punished for failure to pass Theresa May’s appalling Withdrawal Agreement but for putting the Agreement forward in the first place – and now for conspiring with Jeremy Corbyn to try to ram it through. The issue is the Remain majority in Parliament and the fact that so many senior Tories simply refuse to accept that a large percentage of the country truly believes in a real Brexit and will vote accordingly. There are Remainers in the Conservative hierarchy who appear willing to sacrifice their own party – even put Labour in power – just to stop Brexit or water it down beyond recognition. They see Brexit as a one-off policy error that can be corrected by Parliament and will then disappear, which is totally wrong. The consequences of abandoning or undermining Brexit are enormous, as the rebellion of Conservative voters shows. Far from making Nigel Farage vanish, the Remainer stitch-up has revived his career and given him a second wind. The Brexit Party represents a rejuvenated Eurosceptic movement – and could do even better than Ukip at its electoral height.
APR22	Religion isn't cosy, it's about risk and witness	A religion can comfort its believers, certainly, but that doesn’t mean it is cosy. On the contrary, belief often carries risks – of ridicule, marginalisation, even persecution. Across the world, Christians are subject to harassment and violence; in Iran, “apostates” can face the death penalty. In China, the government is bulldozing mosques and putting thousands of Muslims in re‑education camps. Even in Britain, the horror of anti-Semitism has returned, while the memory of the Holocaust apparently recedes, which is why, more than ever, the full story must be taught in schools. Given its history, Western society ought to be incredibly sensitive to freedom of conscience. It is true that for centuries our religious establishments persecuted minorities, but now it feels as if the pendulum has swung the other way and Western culture has become so anti-religion that politicians are unwilling to speak out on behalf, in particular, of oppressed Christians. If religious people are an embarrassment to the modern elite, it’s worth remembering that they often were in the past, too. The religious conscience has historically put followers on the side of the anti-slavery movement, women’s rights, social reform and mercy for refugees, and because the faithful usually believe they are commanded to speak their minds, what makes them such effective critics of injustice is that they will not, cannot remain silent.

APR22	Letters: Asteroid Brexit is bringing extinction even to good Tory councillors	SIR – I am a member of an endangered species: a Conservative councillor standing for re-election on May 2.  I am in danger of extinction despite being part of a Conservative-led council for the last 12 years. During that time we have had one of the lowest increases in council tax in the country. We have invested in the best rural superfast broadband infrastructure in the UK, surpassing the performance of many metropolitan areas. We have kept our weekly bin collections and have some of the best maintained rural roads in England.   The asteroid threatening to wipe us out is Brexit. Our only hope for survival will be the recognition by the voters that local issues have a more direct impact on their lives and wallets than Brexit or anything an incompetent Prime Minister and Parliament can mismanage.

APR23	If the Tories want to survive, they only have one option: send for Boris	The ground is beginning to move beneath Theresa May’s feet. Just a few months after she survived one attempt by Tory MPs to kick her out, they are after her again. This time they are backed by the grass-roots membership, which must be a first for a Conservative leader. Traditionally the activists are ultra-loyal; but a majority now say they might support Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party ahead of their own in the European elections should they take place. The difficulty her detractors have is that under party rules Mrs May cannot be challenged again for a period of 12 months after the last unsuccessful bid to unseat her, which takes us to December. But such is the head of steam behind the desire for a new leader after her failure to deliver Brexit on time that some MPs want the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee to allow another motion of confidence to be tabled in Mrs May forthwith. In addition, 70 Tory associations are demanding an extraordinary meeting of the party’s National Conservative Convention (NCC) to consider her future.
APR23	Whether or not Isil was responsible for the atrocities in Sri Lanka, its threat remains undimmed	It is entirely predictable that the leaders of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) should, as they did in a belated statement yesterday, try to claim responsibility for the appalling Easter Sunday terror attacks in Sri Lanka. With the death toll from last weekend’s carefully coordinated series of attacks at churches and hotels standing at more than 300, with hundreds more suffering serious injury, the bombings constitute one of the worst terrorist atrocities commited in the post-September 11 era, with the casualty toll far higher than other major terrorist attacks, such as those carried out in Madrid, Paris, London and Manchester. So, with Isil and other like-minded Islamist groups desperate to maintain their profile following the destruction of their so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq, claiming responsibility for the Sri Lankan atrocities is an obvious ploy in their efforts to rebuild their standing.
APR23	Blaming Brexit for Northern Ireland killings takes pressure off the terrorists who commit them	"There are fears that if this Bill goes through as it is it will play into the hands of extremists in Ireland.” So declared the First Viscount Grey, debating the 1920 Government of Ireland Act. Home Rulers begged to differ, but there were always plenty of suspicious heads in England back then who felt that the Irish were too prone to “sentimentality, ineffectuality, [and] nervous excitability”, as one historian put it, to handle political change without losing their minds. A hundred years on, those condescending arguments are making a comeback, only this time the chorus is led by paternalistic Remainers, all asserting that Brexit will inevitably play into the hands of the familiar men of violence in Ireland.
APR23	One lesson from the EU referendum, Nicola: a marginal victory only leads to division and pain	The end of the Easter break spelled more despondency than usual this year. No one likes having to go back to work after a long weekend, especially after one on which the sun shone so unexpectedly and fiercely. But this year, there was, added to that mix, a sense of resignation, a depressed acceptance that, having enjoyed a few days’ rest from having to think about Brexit, it’s all about to kick off again. And it’s not just journalists and politicians who are sick to the back teeth with the whole damn thing: my few contacts in the real world suggest that ordinary people are just as keen to be able to switch on the evening news (or open their phone screens) and see reports that have nothing to do with Theresa May, her withdrawal deal or – God forbid! – European elections. In Scotland, however, not only do we have to refocus our minds on when or whether we will leave the EU and in what circumstances, we have to deal with the ever-present issue of independence. Extricating ourselves from a fairly loose form of union of which we’ve been a member for just over 40 years is the hard bit, according to Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister; removing Scotland from a much deeper union of which we’ve been an integral part – culturally, historically and economically – for more than 300 years will be a walk in the park. You read it here first, folks.
APR23	Let's roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump. He might just be the man to fix Brexit	It is hard to imagine ways of making British politics more rancorous than it already is, but a state visit from Donald Trump will certainly go some way to achieving this. His long-delayed honour, it has just been announced, will be granted to him in June.   Trump is sure to be rolled out the red carpet at Buckingham Palace, but will he be granted the honour, which would normally come with a state visit from a US President, of addressing both Houses of Parliament? The decision, it seems, rests with the Commons speaker, John Bercow, who has previously delighted the anti-Trump brigade by suggesting that he would deny the US President the privilege.     It would be foolish and hypocritical for the Speaker to carry out his threat, not least because he would inevitably be reminded of the oleaginous speech he made to Chinese President Xi Jinping before that leader was invited to address members of the Commons and Lords in October 2015. I don’t criticise Bercow for his toe-curling performance on that occasion. He was simply doing his job in welcoming a foreign leader whom the government had invited to Britain. Bercow was paying homage not to the individual but to the office he holds – as leader of the world’s second largest economy and a country with whom it is vital that we do business if we are to avoid global conflict.
APR23	The juvenile Left should refrain from disrupting Donald Trump's state visit to the UK	It is almost certainly too much to ask; but might it be possible to extend a welcome to the President of the United States when he comes in June without the usual suspects on the juvenile Left disrupting the occasion? The relationship with America is of critical importance to the UK. It is our closest and most reliable ally. Donald Trump will be in the country as a guest of the Queen. Arguably, the full pomp and circumstance of a state visit was too readily promised by Theresa May on her first visit to meet Mr Trump after his inauguration. Indeed, it had been planned originally for 2017 but was downgraded to an official visit last year following demands, including from the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, that the state element should be withdrawn.
APR23	No mainstream party is safe from the march of populism	The result of the elections in Ukraine is further evidence that no mainstream political party or leadership is safe from the march of populism across Europe. Of course there were issues peculiar to Ukraine that played a crucial role in the outcome: the unpopularity of the Poroshenko government; the rise in corruption that it was pledged to defeat; and the country’s continuing worries over Russian intentions. But that hardly explains the extraordinary triumph of Volodymyr Zelenskiy in taking more than 70 per cent of the vote in a landslide victory. In a bizarre example of life imitating fiction, Mr Zelenskiy is an actor and comedian who has recently starred in a television show about a teacher who is unexpectedly elected to the presidency after his students post his angry rant about corruption online. Did Ukrainians elect the TV character or the real Mr Zelenskiy, who has no political experience? It is likely, as we have seen elsewhere in the world, that they are simply heartily sick of being promised actions and outcomes by established politicians that are just never delivered.
APR23	The public expects proper scrutiny in hospitals	Two years on from Jeremy Hunt's promise to stop the NHS using non-disclosure agreements, Matt Hancock must now follow through Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has said the use of Non Disclosure Agreements (NDA) to gag staff in the NHS will be abolished. His pledge comes after a radiographer who blew the whistle on malpractice won a case against the NHS for forcing her to sign an NDA after she reported a string of missed cancer diagnoses and other concerns. Sue Allison said she was pressured in 2015 into signing two agreements without legal advice to prevent her from airing her concerns or bringing future claims against the Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust.
APR23	Letters: Tory members demand a chance to say yes or no to Boris Johnson	SIR – There is reported to be a movement among Conservative MPs to try to stop Boris Johnson being one of the two candidates presented to the membership in a leadership contest. Mr Johnson is the most popular potential candidate with Conservative members, and with the country in general. He could provide inspiration and vision, both in short supply in the Government in recent times. In their arrogance, some MPs continue to know better than us “little people”. Such a view erodes trust in politicians, continuing the decline of the Conservative membership and vote.
APR23	Letters: Asteroid Brexit is bringing extinction even to good Tory councillors	SIR – I am a member of an endangered species: a Conservative councillor standing for re-election on May 2.  I am in danger of extinction despite being part of a Conservative-led council for the last 12 years.

APR24	Huawei is a hard reminder of how far Britain is now lagging behind China	All eyes may be on the Five Eyes response to Britain's decision to let Chinese telecoms giant Huawei provide equipment to our 5G network build, but are we missing the bigger picture? Our country is falling behind, because we've moved from being a free-wheeling and permissive country to one that won't let companies innovate and create without government holding their hand. Mobile hardware is just the tip of the country's troubles. Not only is the UK nowhere to be seen in the development of this key new hardware, the rollout of this key future technology is already falling behind other comparable countries. If the Government wants the UK to be at the forefront of new technologies, they must entirely change their approach to innovation. 5G is a game-changing technology. It will mean download speeds at least ten times higher than existing 4G technology, enabling movie downloads in seconds, virtual reality live TV and the network backbone for self-driving cars. In the United States, Verizon introduced the first 5G commercial service last October, and AT&T has a service in 19 cities from San Francisco, California to Nashville, Tennessee.
APR24	Ships are 'she', not 'it' – and we will erode our history if we bow to the PC brigade on this	I’ve seen a lot of things in the more than five decades since I joined the Royal Navy but the idea that it’s politically incorrect to call a ship “she” is certainly a new one. Things have come to a sorry state in this country when a small number of agitators can upend centuries of tradition and force no less an institution than the Scottish Maritime Museum to abandon a convention that all sailors know makes perfect sense. To us, much of the time, a ship is best understood as being like a mother, holding us and keeping us safe from storms, the enemy and the ever-present peril of the depths. There’s a tongue-in-cheek suggestion that she’s often like a lover, too. In the Noel Coward film In Which We Serve, the captain spends so much time on board that his wife refers to the ship as his “grey mistress”, a remark which never fails to raise a knowing smile from the wives or husbands of serving officers. The upshot is that every ship’s company comes to love their vessel. “The old girl” isn’t just a floating home-from-home, she’s a thoroughly personal part of the onboard community. That’s true of whatever you’re sailing on, whether she’s a corporate container ship or the Royal Navy’s flagship.
APR24	Ignorant activists so often end up killing the animals they're trying to help	I am lucky enough to live near the Roches, the southern tip of the Pennines; an area of hills, rock and moorlands. This was one of the areas struck and damaged by the Moorland fires that threatened the countryside during last year’s long, dry summer. Just as heated as the fires then, is the debate about how to care for this environment, with even locals often disagreeing with how it is managed. Yet even more important than what happens to the moorland is what this debate demonstrates about the need to listen to those who know the countryside best. A local shooting man – who only shoots for the pot – told me at the time that the heather had to be burnt in a particular way to aid grouse and other game birds. He knew that they would suffer and become diseased if the management of the land ended up leaving them too wet. In the end he was proved right - and yet, like so many others who are genuinely immersed in wildlife and the countryside, his wisdom and advice were totally disregarded. I thought of him this week when I saw the news that animal rights protesters had broken in and "freed" 9,000 pheasant chicks.  They thought they were doing a nice thing, and yet these pheasants will be dreadfully equipped to survive in the wild. The activists may have saved them from the shotgun but they have most likely condemned them to a short and miserable life.
APR24	How hypocritical 'mainstream' politicians are fueling Left-wing populism	When the political history of the second decade of the 21st century is written, what words will be pepper the narrative of events we’re now witnessing? “Brexit” and “Trump” are a given. So is “populism”, but at the moment, it’s a word that, though important, is only half understood. Donald Trump’s election as US president in 2016 represented the ultimate victory of populism (so far), we are told, with the vote to leave the EU five months earlier coming in a close second. Both of these assertions happen to be true, although the claim negates neither of those results in the way that some may hope. What is remarkable about the use of the word “populist” is how it is almost exclusively used as a stick with which to beat the Right. In fact, you might almost say that “populism” is simply a shortened form of the term, “Right-wing populism”.
APR24	Trump's visit to the UK should be a wake-up call for Britain's declinist, complacent elite	Donald Trump’s state visit in June could not come at a better time. The US President may be just the man to break the Brexit deadlock. He offers an uncompromisingly positive outlook on Britain’s exit from the European Union at a moment when the UK could badly do with a confidence boost and a bit of direction.  As the leader of the free world, Trump’s views matter. When he sets foot in London he can outline exactly what Brexit offers the British people. A free trade deal with the world’s largest economy, even closer defence and intelligence ties with the United States, and the enthusiastic backing of the world’s superpower. He will also deliver the heartfelt support of the American people. From the President’s perspective, Brexit is a win win. The UK gets to leave the big government, declining EU and will be able to fully restore its status as a free, sovereign nation. It can strike its own free trade deals outside of the EU straitjacket, can control its own borders, and fully shape its own laws. 
APR24	Change UK's only policy is cancelling Brexit and maintaining the status quo	Change is a powerful word in politics. “It’s time for change” resonated with voters in 1997 when Tony Blair won a landslide victory at the polls. The Conservatives had been in office since 1979 and it was not an especially difficult slogan to justify. Barack Obama won the US presidency preaching “hope and change” only to discover that transformation was less easy than his supporters believed. Now the word has been incorporated into the name of a political party. Change UK yesterday launched its campaign for the European elections, unveiling 70 candidates for the May 23 contest which will take place if a Brexit deal has not been approved by then. Change UK has 11 MPs at Westminster who have left the Labour and Conservative parties, principally over their stand on Brexit. Heidi Allen, the former Tory MP, said they were not rebels. “We are the Remain alliance,” she added. In other words, they do not actually want to change anything since their main ambition is to stay in the EU. They are the status quo party.
APR24	The juvenile Left should refrain from disrupting Donald Trump's state visit to the UK	It is almost certainly too much to ask; but might it be possible to extend a welcome to the President of the United States when he comes in June without the usual suspects on the juvenile Left disrupting the occasion?

APR25	Internal rows mean SNP conference may not be the usual love-in for the leader	There will be none of the mocking laughter from political opponents over her supposed timetable for breaking up Britain, nor genuine anger over her failure to improve education standards, when Nicola Sturgeon welcomes delegates to the SNP spring conference in Edinburgh tomorrow. However, as well as the obligatory standing ovations that will greet most of what Scotland’s First Minister says this weekend, there is a definite undertow of unease amongst the party faithful at the direction in which she’s taking the party that’s formed the devolved government for 12 years. And to add fuel to the criticism a new poll – by Survation - on the eve of the conference showed that support for independence had dropped to only 39 per cent – down from the 45 per cent it notched up in the 2014 referendum.  
APR25	A phoney war between old and young is no way to secure the Conservatives' future	It’s rare, nowadays, to come across a Conservative who isn’t trying to be the next leader of the party. Theresa May has been an inspiration, insofar as most of her MPs think they could do a better job. So a mass audition has started, with speeches outlining grand visions for the future. Almost every time, we hear how the party’s biggest problem is winning back young voters. But how? This is where the ideas run out. It’s a bit of a problem. For most of the last 15 years, the Tories have been anxiously trying to look slick, modern and vigorous – only to see a pensioner, Jeremy Corbyn, waltz off with the youth vote. The over-60s are four times more likely to vote Conservative than the under-25s. Nothing the Tories do seems to work. Whether it’s posing as eco-crusaders or promising to review tuition fees, attempts to lure the young have left Conservatives looking panicked and insincere. Every attempted remedy for the party’s youth problem serves to make it worse.
APR25	Dear Leavers, Lord Adonis doesn't want your support, but my Brexit Party certainly does	If there is a more arrogant and dishonest national political figure at the moment than Lord Adonis of Camden Town, I am not aware of them.    This Labour peer and pro-EU obsessive (I do not use the term lightly) has spent the last 34 months lobbying for a second EU referendum because he doesn’t like the result of the first one. In Britain in 2019, there’s nothing unusual in that, you might think. But Adonis is no ordinary anti-democrat. His views when it comes to the EU are so extreme that he declared last September during an LBC phone-in: “If you’re a Brexiter, I hope that you won’t vote for the Labour Party because the Labour Party is moving increasingly against Brexit.” He then added for good measure: “I’m saying if what you want is Brexit delivered, you should vote for the party that is going to deliver Brexit.”
APR25	Note to Jared O'Mara: if you can't even keep your office open, you're not capable of being an MP	When Corbynista Jared O’Mara MP resigned from the Labour Party last July following an embarrassing and drawn out scandal, it was assumed that we’d heard the last of him. He had been a liability to Labour, but as an independent MP, it was thought that the opportunities to disgrace himself would be few and far between. To hold on to his circa £80,000 a year salary for the rest of the parliamentary term, all he had to do was keep his head down, delegate casework to his staff, and turn up once a fortnight to constituency surgeries. Sadly for the people of Sheffield Hallam, he hasn’t managed it. Yesterday, the Yorkshire Post revealed that O’Mara has shut down his office for a month after all of his staff either quit or were fired. The Yorkshire MP currently has no one working for him either in his constituency or in Westminster, and has thanked locals in advance for their “patience” as he scrambles to hire a brand new team. He will, as he explained in a chirpy statement to the Post, be unable to hold constituency surgeries or respond to phone calls or correspondence for around four weeks.
APR25	Brexit will be the death of romance, if we don't stop telling each other how we voted	I witnessed a conversation the other day, between a little girl and her grandmother, that felt like the last of its kind. “Granny,” said the girl, “how did you vote on Brexit?” “That,” said the grandmother kindly, “is a rather rude question. You must never ask anybody how they voted. It’s private.” So it is! I had almost forgotten – along with the rest of the country. The longstanding taboo against grilling other people about their voting habits has been shattered by Brexit. These days, you can barely ask someone to pass the salt without being expected to state your position on Europe. That’s if you haven’t already volunteered the information, to put yourself above suspicion. (“As a Remainer, might I please have the salt?”) Still, one would hope to at least get through a first date without having to produce your ballot paper. No such luck. A team of academics has just produced a list of questions that would-be lovers should ask each other, to test compatibility. Top of the list is: “How did you vote on Brexit?”
APR25	The Huawei leak inquiry must not endanger the freedom of the press	In the television sitcom Yes, Minister, the Cabinet Secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby reassures his underling about the risk of a leak inquiry after an unauthorised disclosure of information. They are only ever “set up”, he says, and rarely conclude with anything substantive. Over the years, given the propensity of Cabinet ministers to breach the confidentiality of their discussions, the Whitehall leak inquiry has fallen somewhat into abeyance. But one has now been instituted by Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, following the Telegraph’s story about the decision to give the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei access to the British 5G mobile market. Sir Mark is also the National Security Adviser and the matter was discussed at a meeting of the National Security Council. We knew this was up for debate because there had been press reports elsewhere documenting the concerns of security and intelligence practitioners at the prospect of Chinese involvement in the 5G network.
APR25	Change UK's only policy is cancelling Brexit and maintaining the status quo	Change is a powerful word in politics. “It’s time for change” resonated with voters in 1997 when Tony Blair won a landslide victory at the polls. The Conservatives had been in office since 1979 and it was not an especially difficult slogan to justify. Barack Obama won the US presidency preaching “hope and change” only to discover that transformation was less easy than his supporters believed. Now the word has been incorporated into the name of a political party. Change UK yesterday launched its campaign for the European elections, unveiling 70 candidates for the May 23 contest which will take place if a Brexit deal has not been approved by then. Change UK has 11 MPs at Westminster who have left the Labour and Conservative parties, principally over their stand on Brexit. Heidi Allen, the former Tory MP, said they were not rebels. “We are the Remain alliance,” she added. In other words, they do not actually want to change anything since their main ambition is to stay in the EU. They are the status quo party.
APR25	The juvenile Left should refrain from disrupting Donald Trump's state visit to the UK	It is almost certainly too much to ask; but might it be possible to extend a welcome to the President of the United States when he comes in June without the usual suspects on the juvenile Left disrupting the occasion? The relationship with America is of critical importance to the UK. It is our closest and most reliable ally. Donald Trump will be in the country as a guest of the Queen. Arguably, the full pomp and circumstance of a state visit was too readily promised by Theresa May on her first visit to meet Mr Trump after his inauguration. Indeed, it had been planned originally for 2017 but was downgraded to an official visit last year following demands, including from the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, that the state element should be withdrawn.
APR25	Letters: Rare farmland birds put at risk by ban on shooting crows and magpies	SIR – The BBC’s Chris Packham has scrambled down from atop his bus shelter to pronounce another great victory – the revocation of the general licence to control pest bird species (report, April 25). As a result of years of care, our farm holds some of the highest populations of red-listed farmland birds in the county –  possibly the country – for yellowhammers and linnets.  Controlling magpies in April and May makes a significant contribution to our successful strategy. It is not unusual for us to take over 100 individuals a year on less than 200 acres in those critical two months.
APR25	Letters: Decision to court Huawei is simply the latest of Theresa May’s mistakes	SIR – Theresa May’s decision to allow the Chinese company Huawei to help build our 5G network is the last straw (report, April 24). We should listen to the security warnings from our friends such as the Americans and Australians, who have barred Huawei from supplying key elements of their own telecoms infrastructure. Mrs May is simply a bad decision maker. She made bad decisions in the Home Office, resulting in the Windrush scandal. She had an election and lost her majority, and she went about negotiations with the EU in the wrong way: she should have had a strong Brexiteer leading the process and should have sought help from business people. Now she is risking our national security and relationships with the members of the Five Eyes intelligence group. Is she not aware that her decisions will affect us all?
APR26	Nicola Sturgeon's currency plan would unravel quickly and leave poor and pensioners worse off in long term	The issue of the appropriate currency and currency regime for an independent Scotland looks like dominating the SNP conference this weekend with two proposals coming before  it. That from the Sustainable Growth Commission (SGC), which proposes the use of sterling – sterlingisation - for a relatively long transition period, before moving to a separate currency after six key tests have been met. An alternative proposal, from the Campaign for an Independent Currency (CIC), also proposes the use of sterling in any transition period, although they envisage transitioning to a new currency, pegged one to one with sterling, in the first parliament of an independent Scotland.
APR26	It is madness to let China’s champion build our network	Surely all of us had the fantasy at some point? As soon as we left the room, part of us thought that maybe, just maybe, our lifeless Playmobil cowboys and My Little Ponies started communicating secretly with each other, only to look totally unchanged when we returned. One way of thinking about the impending era of 5G mobile networks is that it is a really dreary version of the same thing. In five or 10 years’ time, objects that are now “dumb” will become “smart”. By that, tech geeks unfortunately don’t mean that your doorknobs will conduct Socratic dialogues with your thermostat. They mean that everything from traffic grids to industrial robots is going to be loaded with sensors, connected up and managed efficiently by software. The row over the Chinese telecoms giant, Huawei, is essentially an argument about who should build this ultra-reliable, superfast network and how to manage the trade-offs between security, cost and economic policy. That our government has briefly managed to turn this important debate into a leak inquiry tells us more about its inept policy management than about the issues at stake. The basic question is whether the UK should agree to outsource the construction of its new, critical infrastructure to the national corporate champion of a mercantilist, totalitarian state. The obvious answer should be “no”.
APR26	The juvenile vanity of Corbyn's snub to Donald Trump is a national disgrace	The deluded vanity of our political class is plumbing new depths. Self-righteous virtue-signalling has replaced practical action in large parts of the Westminster establishment. Having miserably failed to implement the result of the 2016 EU referendum, too many MPs, especially on the left, now pompously declare that they will snub the state visit in early June of Donald Trump, the democratically elected President of our closest ally.    Their shameful behaviour is another milestone in the infantilisation of British civic life, where personal feelings and invented grievances count for more than our nation’s genuine needs. It is telling that, in the very week of the Trump rejection, so many of our senior politicians could be found pathetically fawning over Greta Thunberg, the unelected, unaccountable 16-year-old Swedish teenager who has become the global representative of the eco-doomsday cult. Leading the way in this orgy of self-regard is the Speaker John Bercow, who has announced that he will boycott the Royal Banquet for Trump at Buckingham Palace. As the holder of his ancient constitutional office, Bercow is meant to be impartial, but here he is, acting out a progressive fever dream. 
APR26	Chris Packham has gone too far in his war on the countryside. Time for the BBC to find a new wildlife presenter	Classic FM listeners regularly vote for Vaughan Williams’s masterpiece The Lark Ascending as their favourite piece of music. It touches us more than any other composition, perhaps because it mimics nature so closely, and the liquid exuberance of the lark’s singing, as he hovers above his nest, is for many of us the iconic sound of an English Spring. Perhaps that is why so many people – particularly rural people, as the songbird in question is no metropolitan – are so bloody livid right now, because the lark, already increasingly rare, has edged one step closer to extinction this week. Why? Because a highly-paid BBC presenter has misused the power he has been given by our state broadcaster, paid for by millions of licence fee payers, to bully the government agency responsible for saying which birds can be controlled (and which also seemingly has the power to change the law without recourse to Parliament.).
APR26	Search for the Huawei leaker by all means, but don't threaten a free press in the process	Last summer, Northern Irish journalist Barry McCaffrey had his home raided by armed police. As families readied their children for school, McCaffrey was escorted from his house on a quiet Belfast street by officers dressed in boiler suits. His colleague Trevor Birney was arrested the same morning – over allegations that a confidential document featured in their documentary No Stone Unturned, which examines claims of state collusion in the murders of six men, had been stolen.   As Amnesty's Northern Ireland programme director Patrick Corrigan said at the time: "When the police are arresting journalists who have investigated police collusion in the killing of civilians, rather than the killers and those who helped them get away with murder, people everywhere should be worried". Many of the most important exposés of our time rely on journalists receiving confidential information and having the courage to publish it – from Watergate to the Snowden revelations, from Thalidomide to the MPs’ expenses scandal. And it is a freedom that must be protected fiercely.
APR26	If the police aren't investigating crimes, is it any wonder that criminals are so emboldened?	We have become used to stories of soaring knife crime and rising violence. As the official crime statistics for 2018 have confirmed, the number of murders and injuries caused by stabbings is higher than for many years and is showing no sign of a decline, even though there has been a slow-down in the rate of growth. But as if this is not bad enough, a separate set of figures issued by the Home Office shows one of the causes of rising lawlessness: pitifully few people who commit crimes are ever brought to book. Last year, just 8.2 per cent of offences led to a suspect being charged or summonsed to appear in court. In 46 per cent of cases no suspect was even identified, while in around one fifth of cases a victim decided not to support further action. Three quarters of theft cases were closed without an arrest.

APR26	Letters: The shocking thing was the Huawei decision, not its disclosure	SIR – There should be a criminal inquiry not into the leak about Huawei (report, April 26), but into the criminal decision on its involvement in building the 5G network. Frank Jones Cheltenham, Gloucestershire  
APR26	Letters: Rare farmland birds put at risk by ban on shooting crows and magpies	SIR – The BBC’s Chris Packham has scrambled down from atop his bus shelter to pronounce another great victory – the revocation of the general licence to control pest bird species (report, April 25).

APR27	Britain can and must work with Huawei on 5G	Huawei is again making headlines in the UK. This week has seen the start of a heated debate over what decision to make with regard to the development of the UK’s 5G network and whether the company represents a security threat. But what seems like a simple choice between different 5G suppliers actually hinges on three, very important, binary decisions that face the UK. First, will the UK choose independent decision making or not? Countries of global influence, like the UK, make decisions independently and in accordance with their national interests. With regards to Britain’s relationship with China, this has been best illustrated by the UK’s decision to be the first to issue the Renminbi sovereign bond, the first major Western country to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the first to contribute to the AIIB special fund, the first to sign the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road, and the first to appoint a special envoy and set up an expert board for the Belt and Road Initiative. When it comes to the establishment of the new 5G network, the UK is  in the position to do the same again by resisting pressure, working to avoid interruptions and making the right decision independently based on its national interests and in line with its need for long-term development.
APR27	Give local government some real power and voters might take it seriously	Local government is broken. In elections this week, hundreds (possibly thousands) of parish council seats will go uncontested or will be left unfilled because too few people think it is worth the effort to seek a position on bodies that have little power and are regularly ignored. Meanwhile, the bizarre system of electing councillors by thirds in different years on some councils will continue to encourage short-termism in local parties that are essentially on a constant election footing. And everywhere local authorities, often covering geographical areas that nobody identifies with, will persist in the pretence that they are more than mere facilitators of the will of central government. It’s no wonder turnout at local elections is so pathetic. It hardly seems to matter who you vote for anyway. With some honourable exceptions, most authorities are committed to big increases in council tax, few appear willing to diverge from a general dislike of motorists through their obsessive installation of road calming schemes, and those that wish to experiment with policy are stymied by their obligations to the centre.
APR27	Britain will be worse off if punitive taxes force billionaires like me to leave the country	For over a decade now I have been one of the UK’s largest individual taxpayers, paying over £300 million into the public coffers. And I have been disappointed by those who have decided not to pay their fair share and give back to a society that has been so good to them. People throughout the country have a right to feel cheated by this. However, the result of the punitive tax rates being proposed by Jeremy Corbyn would be extreme capital flight not just from the super-wealthy, but also those with a little extra money in the bank. And it isn’t just Corbyn who is playing this fiscally irresponsible game. Chancellor Philip Hammond recently said that taxes will need to rise for years to cover social care costs. These tax increases will have a crippling effect on the public purse. It is a national security risk. How do politicians expect to fund these services if they further incentivise the 1 per cent, who contribute 28 per cent of all income tax, to simply move their money elsewhere?
APR27	What the dickens is Emma Thompson talking about?	What does the word “Dickensian” bring to your mind? The Victorian novelist used his books to caricature the social conditions of his time. His stories conjured a grotesque demi-monde of vicious workhouse overseers and underage pickpockets, a world where hungry children were forced into crime and prostitution.  Does that sound like modern Britain to you? It does to Emma Thompson. The star of Saving Mr Banks claimed in Westminster that our youngsters were growing up in “positively Dickensian” conditions. “Twenty to 30 per cent of children are living in poverty in the fifth richest economy in the world,” she said. “When I heard about it a year ago, I couldn’t really believe it. And I think one of the reasons for that is that hunger carries such a stigma.” Hang on. Twenty to 30 per cent of our kids are suffering from hunger? Look around you. Does that claim sound even remotely plausible? There comes a point in a country’s development when poverty starts to correlate with obesity rather than undernourishment. Britain passed that point half a century ago.
APR27	Populism, like climate change, is a product of today's mass prosperity	The greatest threat to the future of humanity does not arise from poverty but from the exponential growth of prosperity. That is what we must conclude from any rational reading of the facts as presented by climate change activists. On a remarkably similar note, the most serious challenge to civic order as we have come to understand it – the rise of anti-government populism – also comes from the spread of affluence. These are statements which would not have seemed remotely plausible a generation ago and they still sound alien to the conceptual vocabulary of our politics. And yet – there it is. The fear and loathing that is the prevailing mind set of the developed world leads inevitably to these strange conclusions. This sense of apocalyptic danger, in the face of the stupendous social and scientific progress that has occurred in the last half century, has an almost superstitious aura: a bizarre remnant of the Middle Ages, complete with national leaders gathering to touch the hem of a child prophet whose message, as it happens, is not just simplistic but wrong. It is not true, as Greta Thunberg and many of her followers claim, that the climate crisis is caused by a small number of people who are determined to become obscenely rich.
APR27	Local Tory candidates have been let down by hopeless leadership in Westminster	In the local elections this week, Conservative councillors across the country will be punished, unfairly, because of the terrible mistakes made by the party at the centre. It is no coincidence that the Tory grassroots – the hard-working members who serve at the coalface by delivering leaflets, knocking on doors, and canvassing support – have been at the forefront of the rebellion against Theresa May, unprecedented in a party long known for the loyalty of its activists. Closest to the voters, they can hardly have failed to notice the disillusion, disappointment and, yes, anger of people who had put their trust in the Conservatives to deliver a real Brexit on time. Still the Tory polling collapse continues apace, with some opinion polls putting the party on a lower level of support than in 1997 before Tony Blair’s landslide victory. And still, the leadership shows no sign of recognising the scale of the approaching calamity. The parliamentary party is paralysed, refusing last week to change the rules to enable a confidence vote in the Prime Minister before December. The Government makes unforgivable error after unforgivable error, and is now absorbed by a Whitehall leak inquiry that will leave many voters bemused. The case for Conservatism goes unmade, as ministers make overtures to climate activists who would merrily dismantle the capitalist system. And all the while Jeremy Corbyn creeps closer to power, possibly in alliance with a Scottish National Party which has just renewed its commitment to breaking up the Union by holding another independence referendum.
APR27	Corbyn's juvenile hypocrisy over Trump	Jeremy Corbyn is the worst kind of hypocrite. The Leader of the Opposition preaches a holier-than-thou politics of compassion, and never tires of attributing the basest of motives to his political opponents, while leading a party riven by anti-Semitic hate. He claims to be working for the many not the few, and yet surrounds himself with a narrow clique of far-Left activists and their children. Now, he has decided to boycott a banquet at Buckingham Palace for the occasion of Donald Trump’s state visit this June. It should go without saying that this is juvenile in the extreme. The banquet is to be a state occasion, with the president a guest of the Queen and the leaders of opposition parties invited as a matter of course. Mr Trump will be visiting the United Kingdom as president of the United States and should receive a welcome commensurate with the honour and dignity of that office. This principle Mr Corbyn appeared to understand when Chinese president Xi Jinping came to the UK on a state visit in 2015. Then, the Labour leader was happy to attend a banquet in honour of the leader of an oppressive communist dictatorship, which routinely imprisons its political opponents, without theatrical complaints about the pomp and ceremony accorded to Mr Xi. Why not the popularly-elected leader of one of the world’s greatest democracies?
APR27	The scandal of cancelled hospital appointments has to end	Few things are things more stressful than preparing for a hospital consultation; so to have an appointment cancelled at the last minute is bound to compound the anxiety. Yet the incidence of patients being informed shortly before a long-arranged meeting that they would have to reschedule has been growing inexorably. As we report today, the number of cancelled appointments has tripled in a decade, with more than nine million outpatients let down. In some trusts, one quarter are cancelled. This applies to serious procedures as well as consultations. The most recent statistics show that one in seven imminent operations is being called off, often without any explanation being given. This causes pain and distress, with the elderly in particular worst affected. Why is this happening in a modern health service which is seeing record sums invested, despite complaints that the extra money is never enough? Finding out precisely what is going on is not easy because of the extraordinary secrecy inside the NHS and its imperviousness to criticism.

APR28	Don't take out your Brexit frustrations on our hard-working Tory councillors	Once you get going you will find that canvassing in a British high street is as enjoyable as any other contact sport – and even more exciting, in the sense that you can never be entirely sure who is going to be on your side. As you weave from shop to shop in a kind of rolling maul, you develop an instinct about the members of the public who loom into your path. Sometimes you need to deploy the old side-step; sometimes you palm them off with another member of your team. But most times you will want to commit wholeheartedly to the tackle – thrusting out your garish campaign bumf, clasping their hand, and inquiring joyfully whether you can count on their support. That is how I have spent many happy hours in the past week, in the run-up to Thursday’s local elections. I have rung bells, patted dogs, admired wisteria, wolfed samosas – and in return I have been given some pretty frank opinions about the state of politics. I have come to a tentative conclusion. This may be too optimistic, and I may be proved wrong – but I am starting to think that people can make a crucial distinction at this election on May 2. Whatever they may think about what is going on at Westminster – and our current dismal failure to leave the EU – they can see that there is no point in taking out their frustrations on effective and hard-working Tory councillors. I think they know how much good they do, and how much we all rely on them. It’s not just a question of getting the bins emptied or fixing the streetlights. Ask any MP about the really tough problems they get in their surgeries – the truly heart-breaking frustrations of our constituents. Nine times out of 10 it is about some aspect of their immediate domestic circumstances.
APR28	Nicola Sturgeon tries to use Boris 'bogeyman' to bolster independence case after currency defeat	Boris Johnson and the fact that the UK has been turned into an “international laughing stock” are being lined up as Nicola Sturgeon’s trump cards in her bid to win Scottish independence. Needless to say the former Tory Foreign Secretary wasn’t present during the SNP’s two-day conference in Edinburgh but he is very much the bogeyman that the SNP leader believes will swing undecided Scots voters. His very name was enough to engender jeers and cat calls from delegates throughout the past 48 hours and Ms Sturgeon clearly thinks that he and the “ failed and broken Westminster system,” that voters had witnessed as Britain “sinks deeper into the Brexit mire” could tempt those who rejected independence in 2014.
APR28	China plays a contradictory role on world stage – we must be cautious about Huawei	During the Cold War the then US Defence Chief William Perry received a late night call saying 170 intercontinental ballistic missiles had been launched from Soviet territory. The President should be woken to confirm a protocol response. Thankfully a technician quickly realised a training simulation tape had accidentally been triggered. No actual missiles were incoming and no nuclear response would be required that day. One can only imagine the consequences had the error taken longer to come to light.
APR28	Major parties across Europe are dying. Unless we deliver Brexit, Tories and Labour could be next	The past two decades have brought a whirlwind of change to party politics on the European continent. The grip of the Christian Democrats and Social democrats in most countries has been thrown off and the pattern of the main centre-Left and centre-Right parties alternating in power has long gone. The destruction of the established parties has often been rapid. Take the case of Pasok, the centre-Left party of Greece. It was brought down by association with austerity policies which failed under the euro scheme. Today it commands just 8 per cent of the popular vote. In France, the swift ascent of Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche and the far-Right National Rally meant neither the Republicans nor the Socialists had a candidate in the last two for the Presidency in 2017. The electorate had tired of the old firms, disliking high taxes and a lack of growth in employment and living standards. In Italy, Lega and Cinque Stelle won the last general election, only to see a surge in support for Lega at the expense of the old Christian Democrats. This once-great party had long since rebranded as Forza to add a touch of populism and Euroscepticism to an old formula, yet Lega today is on 36.9 per cent to Forza’s 8.7 per cent.
APR28	To smash the two-party system the Brexit Party will have to learn from Ukip's mistakes	Britain’s two party system has seldom seemed more fragile. Opinion polls show that the combined support for Labour and the Conservatives is in freefall. It is perfectly possible that if elections to the European parliament go ahead, the two main parties might end up with less than half the vote. The opportunities for smaller start-up parties – like the recently founded Brexit Party and Change UK – have never been better. But are they up to the task? Technology could certainly help them. In my 2012 book about the birth of iDemocracy, I outlined how digital would soon enable insurgent parties to communicate directly with millions of supporters, eroding the inbuilt advantages of existing parties. Now iDemocracy has arrived – but whether any of the new parties are able to break the mould depends on them learning from what previous start-ups, such as Ukip, got wrong.  A start-up political party will – almost by definition – appeal to those disillusioned with the way things are. That means that they will attract support from some of those outside the political mainstream. Filtering out the misanthropes and misfits is essential. Ukip certainly had its fair share of colourful characters and already Change UK has had to sack a number of prospective candidates for injudicious things they are alleged to have said on social media.
APR28	Britain needs a solution to the social care crisis	The preoccupation of the Government with Brexit has seen the normal policy priorities sidelined, and none more so than how to deal with the rising costs of social care. This has proved to be a difficult enough issue down the years without the distraction of an unprecedented political crisis. But it remains a critical matter to be addressed and if possible resolved. A report from the King’s Fund last week warned that the system in England was at “crisis point”, with more people asking for social care but fewer receiving it. To a degree this is inevitable given the growing number of elderly people and a finite budget. Local government is responsible for finding the money and many of them say they have other priorities and cannot provide it. Council spending on social care is now £700 million below what it was in 2010/11 in real terms. But identifying that there is a problem is the easy bit; producing a solution is quite another order of difficulty. Various options have been proposed in the last 15 years, from capping overall costs to a so-called death tax, but none have been able to achieve a political consensus. A long-promised social care green paper shows no sign of emerging two years after it was announced.
APR28	Why is a Conservative Government giving such prominence to eco activists?	Chris Packham, the environmental campaigner and TV presenter, may consider himself a friend of the wild creatures of the countryside, but he is no friend to the people who live there. His successful lobbying of Natural England to ban farmers from freely shooting pest birds on their land is an insult to the thousands of men and women who not only provide us with our food but devote their lives to caring for nature. Many of these pest birds, such as magpies and crows, have seen their populations explode, posing a consequential risk to endangered song-bird species. As we reveal today, the decision has also thrown the game industry into crisis, threatening hundreds of jobs. Mr Packham and his ilk would apparently rather the countryside was a glorified wildlife park than a living, working place. But why was the Natural England quango so ready to fold to his entreaties? The decision to require farmers to apply for individual licences was announced on the first day in the job for Tony Juniper, head of Natural England. Appointed to the position by Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, he stood for Parliament as a Green Party candidate and is a self-described “eco-warrior” who once headed up Friends of the Earth.
APR28	Local Tory candidates have been let down by hopeless leadership in Westminster	In the local elections this week, Conservative councillors across the country will be punished, unfairly, because of the terrible mistakes made by the party at the centre. It is no coincidence that the Tory grassroots – the hard-working members who serve at the coalface by delivering leaflets, knocking on doors, and canvassing support – have been at the forefront of the rebellion against Theresa May, unprecedented in a party long known for the loyalty of its activists. Closest to the voters, they can hardly have failed to notice the disillusion, disappointment and, yes, anger of people who had put their trust in the Conservatives to deliver a real Brexit on time. Still the Tory polling collapse continues apace, with some opinion polls putting the party on a lower level of support than in 1997 before Tony Blair’s landslide victory. And still, the leadership shows no sign of recognising the scale of the approaching calamity. The parliamentary party is paralysed, refusing last week to change the rules to enable a confidence vote in the Prime Minister before December. The Government makes unforgivable error after unforgivable error, and is now absorbed by a Whitehall leak inquiry that will leave many voters bemused. The case for Conservatism goes unmade, as ministers make overtures to climate activists who would merrily dismantle the capitalist system. And all the while Jeremy Corbyn creeps closer to power, possibly in alliance with a Scottish National Party which has just renewed its commitment to breaking up the Union by holding another independence referendum.
APR28	Letters: Birdsong falls silent as the predators circle	SIR – I am fortunate enough to farm l00 acres in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, high on the Ridgeway Downs. After I came to the farm, all grassland, 25 years ago I converted it to organic status.  For a few years I had my private nightingale, cuckoo, a treasured pair of Montagu’s harriers, two pairs of lapwings, a lot of brown hares. In the past 10 years nearly all have vanished . The land is now patrolled by red kites which have proliferated. Ever since a bantam chick was taken from its free-range mother in the garden outside my window by a kite, I have realised the implication of protecting an omnivorous apex predator. 
APR28	Letters: Late and over budget, HS2 is a masterclass in project mismanagement	SIR – In the past 20 years I have applied for many grants, both public and private, to fund projects such as a village hall, a playing field and restoration work. In all cases I have had to fulfil many conditions, and ensure that the grant benefits as wide a range of people as possible. At the end of every application there has been a warning that it will not be possible to return for more money. It has often been a challenge to deliver on time and within budget. It is therefore particularly galling to see HS2’s professional consultants seeking more money, and allowing the delivery timeframe to move into the far yonder, for a project that will only serve an elite. And, as technology marches ahead, rail travel for business purposes may become archaic anyway. Maggie Down Paulerspury, Northamptonshire
APR29	Remainers have blown the EU elections, and increased the chance of a no-deal Brexit	Like most people who have been an MP, I will never forget the day I was elected to Parliament. For one thing, it was snowing in the Yorkshire Dales that cold February day in 1989, and the bleak landscape seemed to match the political fortunes of the Thatcher administration at the time. More significantly, I was able to win a by-election – the last Tory to do so while the party was in government for a quarter of a century – because my opponents could not agree on a joint candidate. Together, the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Democrats received many thousands more votes than I did, but they were so neatly divided that I beat both of them. This mattered: the SDP disintegrated soon after that. One might have thought that this disastrous experience of division among centrist parties would be etched into their memories as much as into mine, but evidently they have learnt nothing, even from such recent history. In no election in modern times has it been more appropriate, more convenient and more imperative for apparently moderate parties to put aside their differences than in the unloved but imminent European elections. Yet last week they each unveiled their separate lists of candidates, bearing a closer resemblance to a political version of Strictly Come Dancing than a serious effort to transform British politics.
APR29	Wave a flag for the nation state – it's a force for moral good	On Sunday morning, the Church of St George, Hanworth celebrated its patronal festival with a special service, the congregation waving little flags of St George and singing Land of Hope and Glory. A video clip of the service started something of a social media storm. “Faith and Fatherland?” someone tweeted in reply, with the depressingly inevitable reference to the Nazis. Another suggested that “all those racist flags on display goes against everything we value in a modern and progressive society”. The rhetorical elision of national pride and Nazism has become an increasingly prevalent feature of the Brexit debate, and not just within the cesspool of Twitter. With little awareness that our wartime defiance against the Nazis was stirred on by a sense of collective moral purpose – often expressed in terms of “land of hope and glory, mother of the free” – those who throw the Nazi insult around at any and every expression of nationalism disparage the sacrifice that so many made to defeat that particular evil.

APR29	Why should the wealthy old expect the young to fund their pensions, health and social care?	How to fund the services which old people need is becoming one of the big unavoidable issues in British politics. Last week, the House of Lords proposed raising the age of eligibility for winter fuel allowance and ending the triple lock on pensions. Yesterday, Damian Green proposed other ways to fund social care, including a higher rate of National Insurance for the over-50s. And the 2017 Tory manifesto notoriously proposed that older people contribute more towards their own care costs. All the proposals have drawn fierce criticism. But doing nothing and opting for the easy life is absolutely the wrong lesson to draw from the backlash. We need to get our teeth back into this debate. To get it right, we have to be clear what the problem is. It is not really, as Fraser Nelson wrote last week, that old people are living longer. That is good news for them, and good news for the many younger people they help in various ways. The real challenge is that it is such a big generation which is now growing older. A million babies were born in 1947 as the baby boom began, compared with about 750,000 in a typical year now. As the Boomers get older, that increases pressures on the NHS and the cost of social care just because there are so many of them. And the British state is being re-shaped around their needs – it is becoming a health and pensions state. This trend will continue, too – the increasing number of old people means that just keeping to current promises adds £36 billion to public spending by 2030. So, yes trimming back the triple lock and winter fuel payments will cut some spending. But it won’t come close to offsetting the massive increase in public spending on the welfare state for older people just to maintain existing provision. That is why, more in sorrow than in anger, one has to conclude that taxes are going to have to rise. Back in the 1980s we could cut taxes as we had a surge in the number of young workers, and relatively few pensioners or children. But that favourable trend has now turned. The 2017 election – the first for several decades in which neither of the main parties proposed tax cuts – was a taste of things to come.
APR29	As local elections loom, Tory activists like me simply cannot defend our party's chaos	“You’re brave!” is not usually the reaction I get when canvassing for the Conservatives as a grassroots activist. However I have heard the phrase again and again while campaigning for the party in recent weeks, in the run-up to local elections. Yet  contrary to many people’s expectations, voters on the doorstep have been more friendly than in previous elections - and more likely to share their views. Some Tory candidates have anticipated a great deal of anger coming their way on the doorstep and stuck to leafleting. This is a great mistake. I have had more interesting conversations than normal on the doorstep, and more productive - if painfully revealing - ones too.   Our local voters undoubtedly wanted  Brexit to be achieved by now. The popularity of no-deal with the general public is partly because it would seem to avoid the necessity for further tortuous talks with the EU - which even after Mrs May’s deal passing  would only by then be at the half time stage. All are fed up the Brexit debate dominating politics, and the inertia of the Government.
APR29	Suspects can be truthful and complainants can lie. Neither should be immune from proper scrutiny	Plans revealed by the National Police Chiefs Council and the Crown Prosecution Service for rape complainants to be asked to surrender their phones for examination have been criticised as requiring “victims to undergo a digital strip search.” This is emotive language, but the blunt fact is that there are some cases in which a fair investigation requires a complainant’s phone to be examined. There are others where such an investigation is a pointless waste of time. Nobody is suggesting that complainants’ phones should be examined in every investigation. Instead complainants, in some cases, are told:
APR29	The collapse of Spain's centre-Right could be a taste of things to come for the UK	Across Europe, the decline of the old centre-Left and centre-Right parties continues apace. Social democracy and conservatism, the twin pillars of the post-war European political settlement, are in retreat. In Spain, the hard-Right Vox party won 10 per cent of the vote in Sunday’s elections, taking 24 seats in the lower house. Support for Vox came mainly from voters deserting the traditional centre-right Popular Party, which has seen its backing almost halved from 33 per cent in 2016 to just 17 per cent. This has left the socialists as the largest party and likely to form a coalition with Podemos, a populist movement on the Left. Each EU country that has staged elections in the past few years has seen the centre under pressure, whether the battering inflicted on the social democrats in Germany; or the rise of the anti-immigration nationalists in Sweden; or the coalition government formed by La Liga and Five Star in Italy; or even Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche party in France: they all testify to a seismic shift in European politics. Here, a Brexit party that has sprung out of nowhere threatens to supplant the Conservatives at the European parliament elections if they are contested next month.
APR29	Loss of fracking tsar is another sign the Government is in thrall to the environmental lobby	The resignation of Natascha Engel as the Government’s so-called fracking “tsar” is the latest blow to a burgeoning industry that held out such promise just a few years ago. The former Labour MP had only been in the post for six months, tasked with pushing forward the stalled exploration of the country’s substantial shale gas reserves. Yet she has stepped down, frustrated and angry, blaming environmental campaigners who are opposed to any non-renewable energy and regulations that have made it almost impossible to carry out the necessary procedures. These rules mean that fracking companies have to stop drilling every time a tremor is measured at more than 0.5 on the earthquake scale. This was introduced to placate objectors but the level is ridiculously low. This Government seems in thrall to the environmental lobby in the mistaken belief that this will somehow attract the votes of young people. It should focus on what matters for the country. Shale offers potentially cheaper and more secure gas supplies than we have now and it should be a national priority to develop it, not thwart it. They should leave that to Jeremy Corbyn, who is against fracking even though lifecycle shale emissions are lower than those from imported gas.
APR29	Britain needs a solution to the social care crisis	The preoccupation of the Government with Brexit has seen the normal policy priorities sidelined, and none more so than how to deal with the rising costs of social care. This has proved to be a difficult enough issue down the years without the distraction of an unprecedented political crisis. But it remains a critical matter to be addressed and if possible resolved. A report from the King’s Fund last week warned that the system in England was at “crisis point”, with more people asking for social care but fewer receiving it. To a degree this is inevitable given the growing number of elderly people and a finite budget. Local government is responsible for finding the money and many of them say they have other priorities and cannot provide it. Council spending on social care is now £700 million below what it was in 2010/11 in real terms. But identifying that there is a problem is the easy bit; producing a solution is quite another order of difficulty. Various options have been proposed in the last 15 years, from capping overall costs to a so-called death tax, but none have been able to achieve a political consensus. A long-promised social care green paper shows no sign of emerging two years after it was announced.
APR29	Letters: Threatened lapwing and lark left to the predation of uncontrolled pests	SIR – I have every sympathy for Penelope Reid’s frustration (Letters, April 29) with the new Natural England licencing situation for controlling “pest” birds, but I fear it is only going to get worse.  Yesterday I went on to Natural England’s site to apply for a new general licence under one of the four allowable scenarios to control winged vermin. There is no provision on that form for the protection of threatened species such as lapwing, lark or turtle dove. We have these birds on our land in small numbers after 30 years of combining set-aside, the Countryside Stewardship Scheme and rewilding.  In my book, corvids and magpies plundering the nests of these intrepid birds constitute “serious damage” as much as harm to crops, which the form mentions. I applaud the National Farmers’ Union and other land-care organisations (Letters, April 29) in lobbying Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, to get this mess sorted out.

APR30	The Tories must wake up to the existential calamity about to engulf them	As I write I am staring with incredulity at my polling card for the European elections on May 23. The very idea that this contest is going ahead, barring some unlikely development at Westminster in the next three weeks, remains a source of amazement. We were supposed to have left the EU on March 29 – yet will now be sending 73 MEPs back to the parliament. To what purpose; and for how long? Does anyone really believe that having installed them in Strasbourg we will march them out again on October 31 having either reached a successful cross-party Brexit accommodation or having decided to leave without a deal? Since neither seems remotely probable now, the only alternatives are a general election and/or another referendum, both of which are unpalatable to the two major parties. For the Conservatives in particular, any appeal to the electorate in the current circumstances might prove to be an epochal, even existential, event. Tomorrow’s local council contests in more than 250 English authorities could begin a process that will ultimately destroy the party. Expectations have been lowered almost as far as they can be by Tory managers. Poll watchers predict losses of between 800 and 1,000 councillors, though this may not necessarily translate into a consequential loss of control, particularly where just one-third of seats are being contested.
APR30	Cambridge's virtue-signalling slavery probe should be greeted with heavy intellectual scepticism	The University of Cambridge has announced a two-year project “to uncover how the institution may have gained from slavery and the exploitation of labour”. What’s wrong with that? The history of slavery has been a major intellectual concern at least since the 1940s. Was slavery profitable, or was abolition simply the scrapping of a wasteful system? Were the slave trade and its associated industries a pillar of European economies or a minor element? I have even heard it claimed (absurdly) that the whole Industrial Revolution was based on the profits of slavery. We know the answers to these big questions. Without waiting for a two-year study, we can safely say that the University did profit from slavery. We can say the same of every great institution in Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, and so on. John Locke owned shares in a slaving company.
APR30	A ‘digital strip-search’ is not like ‘being raped again’ – it’s crucial to justice	A row has erupted because “rape victims” will be forced to hand over their mobile phones so police can check their texts and social media, or “risk their attacker walking free”. See what happened there? Much of yesterday’s coverage called a woman reporting a sexual assault a “rape victim” while the man whose guilt (or innocence…) police are still trying to establish is her “attacker”. I thought we had got away from this wholly unjust “always believe the accuser” approach after Alison Saunders ended her discredited tenure at the Crown Prosecution Service amid a blizzard of miscarriages of justice?
APR30	If we're serious about social mobility then it must be easier for the middle-classes to fail	Politicians may claim to value social mobility, but are they ready for its real implications? As a strong supporter of the Government’s Social Mobility Commission over several years, I had been pessimistic about its prospects of late. The previous commission, including Alan Milburn and Gillian Shephard, resigned in despair at the lack of Government engagement with the issue.  The new commission got off to a fairly quiet start last year, leaving some observers – me included – worrying that it would lack the same impact, not least because ministers decided to appoint no fewer than 13 commissioners. Any organisation overseen by so many people will struggle to focus on anything other the lowest common denominator.
APR30	Brussels beware: Vladimir Putin is plotting to take over the EU	No one is more looking forward to the forthcoming European elections than Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. One of the Russian leader’s defining characteristics is his unerring ability to identify an opportunity in the face of even the most extreme adversity. Thus, at a time when Moscow finds itself subject to international ostracism for its role in last year’s Novichok attack in Salisbury, Mr Putin views the EU elections as an opportune moment to restore Russia’s standing in Europe. The Kremlin’s desire to steer the course of European politics in a direction more favourable to Russian interests is not a new phenomenon. Concerns about Russian meddling have been raised in France, Italy, Austria, Greece, the Netherlands and Germany, while questions remain as to whether Moscow tried to interfere in Britain’s 2016 referendum on leaving the EU. Now there is mounting evidence that Moscow has embarked on a well-coordinated effort to establish a network of alliances in eastern and central Europe, with the aim of creating a pro-Russian bloc in the next European parliament. Moscow already enjoys good relations with Hungary and Bulgaria, two former Soviet satellites that appear to prefer maintaining good links with Russia over their support for the EU.
APR30	Anti-social behaviour makes life a misery – police and politicians must take it more seriously	Baroness Newlove is standing down as only the second Victims’ Commissioner for England and Wales with a heartfelt lament that little has changed since she took up the post. Her husband Garry was killed by a group of teenagers he confronted outside the family home in Warrington in 2007. Her demands to know why this gang had been allowed to terrorise the neighbourhood with impunity made her a national figure and led to her appointment as a champion of victims. As she writes today, the behaviour of the louts who attacked Mr Newlove had been dismissed as “low-level” anti-social behaviour. If the police lose control of the streets and allow lawlessness to flourish, the consequences can be disastrous, as they were for Lady Newlove and her family. Twelve years later and she still feels too little is being done to curb the yobbishness that can make the lives of residents a misery. Creating the role of commissioner was a response by politicians to a sense that the victims of crime were being let down by the system, as indeed they were. The police were not getting to grips with a burgeoning problem before it got out of hand. Had they done so there might have been fewer victims to represent.

APR30	Letters: The Conservative Party deserves to reap the whirlwind of voters’ anger	SIR – Boris Johnson (Comment, April 29) urges Conservative voters not to take out their Brexit frustrations on Tory councillors. Well, it’s a bit too late for that. The Conservative Party, which I have supported all my life, no longer represents Tory values. It now cannot be trusted. Failure to deliver Brexit was a shocking act of betrayal. Moreover, the inability of the party to ditch the worst prime minister in living memory beggars belief. The Conservative Party is staring into the abyss and deserves to be punished. It will be annihilated and not forgiven.

MAY1	The Tories should be allying with Nigel Farage on Brexit, not Jeremy Corbyn	It is a question that needs asking: does Theresa May actually think that Brexit voters are stupid?  She is certainly behaving that way, apparently convincing herself that the Eurosceptic electorate will welcome any deal she cooks up with Jeremy Corbyn, however appalling, as long as she labels it “Brexit”. The nonsensical, insulting implication is that those who want to leave the EU are as thick, uneducated, and prejudiced as their “progressive” opponents love to claim; gullible fools who only care about ending “free movement”. Fobbing off such half-wits should be easy: just sign a deal, any deal that can be spun as delivering on this one symbolic goal, and they will flock back gratefully. The reality is that it is hard to know for sure what the Prime Minister is thinking, if anything: she is the most evasive holder of that office in living memory, according to a University of York study. It is easier to gauge the dominant view in the bunker at No 10, now mired in deep, catastrophic denial about the imploding support for the Tories and establishment in general.
MAY1	The reason so many smartphone apps are blue – and why Facebook is changing its colours after 15 years	Blue was once the world's most expensive colour. Not the dull blue of woad, which British barbarians smeared on their faces to frighten Romans with, but the true blue of ultramarine, a deep, pure shade whose name literally means "beyond the sea".  For millennia, its only source was lapis lazuli found in the mountains of Afghanistan, which had to be carried elsewhere at great cost. "Here is found a high mountain," Marco Polo wrote, "from which they extract the most beautiful of blues." Some historians believe that Michaelangelo's famous unfinished painting The Entombment was abandoned because he could not afford enough ultramarine. Today the proliferation of smartphones with LCD screens has made blue common, even humdrum. (Incidentally, many smartphone components require cobalt, which was one of the other major historical sources of blue pigment.) Now we're even getting too much of it; scientists tell us to minimise blue light at bedtime, and many phones now come with a "sleep mode" that tints the screen orange. 
MAY1	From Percy Pigs to Irn Bru, manufacturers meddle with the tastes of our childhood at their peril	M&S recipe changes are a classic case of the tail wagging the pig. Oh Percy. How could you? Marks and Spencer, not content with selling a separate vegetarian version of their popular Percy Pig sweets, have now taken the gelatine out of the entire range to make them all meat-free. Such reformulations are not to be taken lightly – remember in January last year when Irn Bru cut its sugar content by more than half, to howls of complaint from its Scottish heartland? Or when Ribena followed suit, replacing much of the sugar with artificial sweetener and enraging its most loyal customers? When manufacturers meddle with the taste of our childhood, they do so at their peril. Jelly made out of vegan agar isn’t the same as Hartley’s finest. It’s harder and more crumbly. Putting sherry flavouring in a trifle won’t fool anyone after the real, tipsy thing. Ruining old recipes like these robs us of those precious nostalgic tastes that can instantly transport us back in time – and no food has the power to do that quite like sweets.
MAY1	As Venezuela shows so disastrously, socialism always ends in tyranny	Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom is playing out in the catastrophe engulfing Venezuela Writing in the midst of World War II, Friedrich Hayek warned, in his classic polemic The Road to Serfdom, that central planning and public ownership, the central tenets of a socialist economy, would, if left unchecked, descend slowly but inevitably into tyranny. He well understood the reality of life in a centrally planned system. His reluctance to return to his native Austria following the Anschluss with Nazi Germany in 1938 kept him a refugee in wartime Britain. And six decades on, his influential work is playing out, chapter-by-chapter, in the catastrophe engulfing Venezuela. Starting with Hugo Chávez’s revolution in 1999, Venezuela began its descent into tyranny by expropriating thousands of firms. Entrepreneurs fled overseas. Those who remained saw their businesses fall into disrepair under army mismanagement. Price controls, meanwhile, designed to make consumer goods affordable to the poor, have merely made it unprofitable for Venezuelan businesses to manufacture such products – with shortages the predictable result.
MAY1	As the Tories implode, only a new national party can stop the Corbyn juggernaut	It is already too late for the Conservatives. Theresa May's humiliating capitulation to Jeremy Corbyn on the customs union is set to play out in hideously vivid technicolor over the coming days. Rumours are already swirling that No 10 has hatched a damage-limitation plot to re-brand the May-Corbyn fudge with a different name, in the vain hope that voters are too stupid to tell the difference, or too disillusioned to care. The spin doctors have badly miscalculated. Such a move will alienate millions of loyal Tory supporters who voted for Brexit. It will render the party incapable of winning a majority for years ahead. But the PM is too entombed in her mental bunker, too mummified in layer upon layer of deluded piety, to grasp basic cause-and-effect. We are also witnessing the most spectacular dereliction of duty on the part of modern history's most dismal Cabinet. Several so-called leadership contenders have calculated that moving against Theresa May now could complicate their slow-and-steady strategies for political domination. Outnumbered and exhausted, Brexiteers are also in danger of fading into irrelevance. But implosion is only one side of the story in politics right now; the other is insurgency. 
MAY1	The Huawei leak was a story in the national interest	The dismissal of Gavin Williamson as defence secretary over the leak of information to this newspaper is the latest blow to Theresa May’s premiership and authority.  On the eve of local elections and ahead of possible European elections later this month, she could have done without fresh turmoil in her Cabinet. She moved quickly to fill the post by appointing Penny Mordaunt, who as a Royal Navy Reservist and a former minister in the department, will be a popular choice. Mr Williamson emphatically denies being the source of the story despite the Prime Minister’s assertion that there was “compelling evidence” of his culpability. Yet without knowing what that is, the finding of guilt by Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary and national security adviser, seems to be based on suspicion of the way Mr Williamson behaved towards the inquiry. Unlike other officials who attended the NSC meeting, Mr Williamson was reluctant to co-operate. While they had “all answered questions, engaged properly, provided as much information as possible to assist with the investigation, and encouraged their staff to do the same”, Mr Williamson’s conduct was deemed to have fallen short of these standards.
MAY1	A family meal and no snacks: The old ways are the best ways in the battle against obesity	It will come as no great surprise to Telegraph readers to discover that if families eat together there is less chance that their children will be obese. We are assailed by warnings about junk food, even to the preposterous point where an advertisement for strawberries and cream has been banned from the London Underground. Taxes are imposed on fizzy drinks; sweets are removed from check-out counters; and eating chips is accompanied by the nagging tut-tut of the food police. Yet it turns out that the best recipe for keeping children as lithe as they should be is for families to sit down to a meal together. This assumes, of course, that the household possesses a dining table since many no longer do. It should be the first item on the shopping list of any couple setting up home, to mitigate the temptations of a constant diet of pizzas and burgers in front of the television. Oxford University researchers have found that family meals put children on a path to healthy eating in later life. Eating together is invariably associated with consuming more fruits and vegetables and less fast food. But it also requires parents to enforce rules strictly, with regular mealtimes and no snacks in between. In Leeds, where routine parenting classes have enforced this message, there has been a marked fall in the number of children developing weight problems.
MAY1	Tom Watson's walkout exposes Labour's great Brexit divide	Did he “storm out” or politely make his excuses and leave? Whatever the spin placed on Tom Watson’s departure from a meeting of the shadow cabinet it demonstrates that while the current focus is on Conservative Brexit divisions, Labour is every bit as split over how to deliver on the 2016 referendum.  Mr Watson, the party deputy leader, is a supporter of a so-called “people’s vote” and is increasingly frustrated by the refusal of Jeremy Corbyn to commit to one. He has established a party within a party of Blairites and Labour moderates to counter the influence of the hard-Left. Since he was elected by the members to his post, Mr Watson has a mandate trumped only by the leader. They are now in a struggle for the party’s soul that could see one or other, or both, brought down. Mr Watson walked out of the shadow cabinet meeting after demanding to see the text of the party’s draft manifesto for the European parliamentary elections on May 23 ahead of the meeting of the party’s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) to agree a policy.
MAY1	Letters: The mainstream political parties have forsaken their supporters, who should show no mercy	SIR – Boris Johnson (Comment, April 29) is being remarkably naive suggesting that the electorate should not take out its frustrations over Brexit, or over the lack of progress, during today’s local elections.  On the contrary, I hope there will be a bullish turnout. The Liberal Democrats deserve a bashing for being illiberal and undemocratic with their hardline stance against the will of the electorate; Labour for being turncoats and abandoning their manifesto; the Conservatives for their contempt for the referendum and their utter incompetence as the governing party. If we leave them all in a ragged and dishevelled state we will have the opportunity to restore the status quo next time round, if they are all suitably contrite and atone for their respective shortcomings. Brexit, successful or not, will change nothing there. We the electorate also need a practice run for the EU elections, where I hope we will all be especially vindictive towards those three wretched parties. 
MAY1	Letters: The Conservative Party deserves to reap the whirlwind of voters’ anger	SIR – Boris Johnson (Comment, April 29) urges Conservative voters not to take out their Brexit frustrations on Tory councillors. Well, it’s a bit too late for that. The Conservative Party, which I have supported all my life, no longer represents Tory values. It now cannot be trusted. Failure to deliver Brexit was a shocking act of betrayal. Moreover, the inability of the party to ditch the worst prime minister in living memory beggars belief. The Conservative Party is staring into the abyss and deserves to be punished. It will be annihilated and not forgiven.
MAY2	SNP confusion over currency plans is an open goal Ruth Davidson will not miss	Comebacks, especially those of a political nature, are always difficult – even if yours has been hailed as overdue and is seen as some sort of instant remedy for all of your party’s ills. This has been Ruth Davidson’s fate as she prepares to return to front line politics after six months maternity leave following the birth of her son. And upon her shoulders today have been piled all the hopes not only of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, which she’s led for seven years, and which fears that a resurgent SNP is building up a head of steam for another vote on breaking up Britain. But she’s also the poster girl for Tories throughout Britain who live in hope that her moderate, commonsense views can rescue their party from the shambles of Brexit. Some moderate MPs also reckon that her known lack of enthusiasm for Boris Johnson might help them stop him becoming leader.
MAY2	Stuck with a leader who’s lost all her authority, the Tories are imploding	A new rule seems to govern life for the Conservatives: no matter how big the disaster, an even bigger one probably lies just around the corner. Party activists will be counting up lost council seats today, while trying to understand the debacle over the firing of the Defence Secretary. But they’ll also be bracing themselves for the European Parliament elections when Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party will force the Tories into third, perhaps even fourth place. And this would be just the first swing of his wrecking ball. If he has his eyes on the general election, the real pain may be to come. This is what it looks like when a government implodes. There is a bewildering succession of setback and scandal, with so many ministerial resignations that it’s hard to keep track. Ordinarily, a Prime Minister who loses control of Parliament would have to call an election, or be replaced as leader by someone more able to govern. But the Tories can’t bring themselves to face the voters, or get rid of Theresa May. They maimed her, trying to depose her and voting down her deal, but have still left her in place. So the chaos continues, and seems to take new forms every week.
MAY2	From leaks to talks with Labour, this Government is deeply disingenuous on Brexit	The Government’s Brexit policy is best summed up as: “any deal is better than no deal” We have become used to leaks from Cabinet, as well as ministers publicly disagreeing with Government Brexit policy by writing articles to that effect without being admonished. Now one minister has been sacked because the Prime Minister says he leaked a decision from the National Security Council. I wonder if this signals the pursuit of other ministers for their breaches over Brexit. Will a similar inquiry take place into who leaked the Cabinet Secretary’s peculiarly hysterical report on the effects of leaving the EU without a deal? Maybe not, as I note No 10 didn’t seem too bothered about that particular leak. And perhaps that’s because they are not being straightforward about their Brexit policy, but very disingenuous indeed.
MAY2	Climate change is forcing a cold front into my marriage	“Grandma, what did you do in the Eco War?” “Pipe down and eat your irradiated fungal protein…” “But Grandma, Grandma, did you woman the recycled barricades? Drive an electric tank? Jig for victory with the Extinction Rebellion’s elite zumba brigade?”
MAY2	Allowing our traditional hymns to die out would be a terrible act of cultural vandalism	When Notre Dame was burning, Parisians of all ages and races gathered in sight of the flames, and sang. The French hymns they sang were unfamiliar to me, but the sound was instantly recognisable. Nothing but a hymn could convey all the things that needed to be conveyed: grief, fear, love, reverence for history and beauty, and a cultural connectedness reaching back through centuries.  An Ed Sheeran song wouldn’t have cut it. Yet when it comes to burying the people we love – a more everyday trauma, perhaps, but one that requires even more spiritual succour – hymns have fallen right out of fashion. For the first time ever, there were no hymns among the top 10 musical choices for funerals last year. The list was entirely dominated by popular music, ranging from Frank Sinatra’s My Way (always hogging the number one spot), to Supermarket Flowers, Ed Sheeran’s touching, if tuneless, homage to his late grandmother. Why should this be? There’s no question that hymns are better suited to funerals than recorded pop songs. For a start, they require active engagement. Instead of sitting in your pew weeping disobediently while Eric Idle urges you to “Always look on the bright side of life”, you have to stand up, take a deep breath and sing. This communal act brings you closer not just to your fellow mourners, but to everyone who has grieved and sung before.
MAY2	In a sport rooted in extraordinary talent, why scapegoat Caster Semenya for her natural state?	In trying to be fair to all women athletes the IAAF has been especially unjust to one. Most champion athletes have physical attributes that give them an edge over their competitors. Usain Bolt is unusually tall for a sprinter and his stride in a race lasting just a few seconds is an advantage over shorter men. Some people were born with exceptional lung capacity, or are naturally heavily muscled or have abnormally low heart rates or are blessed with extraordinary hand/eye co-ordination - all characteristics beneficial at the elite level of sport. They can, indeed, be the difference between winning and coming second, between gold and silver medals. Caster Semenya, the Olympic champion 800m sprinter, was born with a different sexual make-up from most men and women. Classified as “intersex”, she was brought up as a girl but with higher levels of testosterone than is normal among females. This gave her greater strength and stamina. But to what extent are these advantages any different from Lennox Lewis’s great reach or Magic Johnson’s height? 
MAY2	The Huawei leak was a story in the national interest	The dismissal of Gavin Williamson as defence secretary over the leak of information to this newspaper is the latest blow to Theresa May’s premiership and authority.  On the eve of local elections and ahead of possible European elections later this month, she could have done without fresh turmoil in her Cabinet. She moved quickly to fill the post by appointing Penny Mordaunt, who as a Royal Navy Reservist and a former minister in the department, will be a popular choice. Mr Williamson emphatically denies being the source of the story despite the Prime Minister’s assertion that there was “compelling evidence” of his culpability. Yet without knowing what that is, the finding of guilt by Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary and national security adviser, seems to be based on suspicion of the way Mr Williamson behaved towards the inquiry. Unlike other officials who attended the NSC meeting, Mr Williamson was reluctant to co-operate. While they had “all answered questions, engaged properly, provided as much information as possible to assist with the investigation, and encouraged their staff to do the same”, Mr Williamson’s conduct was deemed to have fallen short of these standards.
MAY2	A family meal and no snacks: The old ways are the best ways in the battle against obesity	It will come as no great surprise to Telegraph readers to discover that if families eat together there is less chance that their children will be obese. We are assailed by warnings about junk food, even to the preposterous point where an advertisement for strawberries and cream has been banned from the London Underground. Taxes are imposed on fizzy drinks; sweets are removed from check-out counters; and eating chips is accompanied by the nagging tut-tut of the food police. Yet it turns out that the best recipe for keeping children as lithe as they should be is for families to sit down to a meal together. This assumes, of course, that the household possesses a dining table since many no longer do. It should be the first item on the shopping list of any couple setting up home, to mitigate the temptations of a constant diet of pizzas and burgers in front of the television. Oxford University researchers have found that family meals put children on a path to healthy eating in later life. Eating together is invariably associated with consuming more fruits and vegetables and less fast food. But it also requires parents to enforce rules strictly, with regular mealtimes and no snacks in between. In Leeds, where routine parenting classes have enforced this message, there has been a marked fall in the number of children developing weight problems.
MAY2	Letters: Whoever leaked the risky decision on Huawei performed a public service to Britain’s security	SIR – Whistleblowers should often be seen as assets, not liabilities, as the Health Secretary vigorously asserted last week. Revealing state secrets should not be condoned, but if the leak reported by The Daily Telegraph is true, it seems clear that it is not the whistleblower who has compromised national security, as no state secrets were revealed and no lives endangered. However, it has been known for years that Huawei presents a potential risk to our critical national infrastructure, as the Intelligence and Security Committee pointed out in its redacted report in 2013 under the chairmanship of Sir Malcolm Rifkind. Given those concerns, it could be argued that by overriding them and causing serious alarm in the vital Five Eyes intelligence community (Australia having banned Huawei from its networks a couple of years ago), it is the Prime Minister’s alleged decision to allow Huawei to participate in our 5G network which might well compromise our national security, putting all the Queen’s subjects at risk.
MAY2	Letters: The mainstream political parties have forsaken their supporters, who should show no mercy	SIR – Boris Johnson (Comment, April 29) is being remarkably naive suggesting that the electorate should not take out its frustrations over Brexit, or over the lack of progress, during today’s local elections.  On the contrary, I hope there will be a bullish turnout. The Liberal Democrats deserve a bashing for being illiberal and undemocratic with their hardline stance against the will of the electorate; Labour for being turncoats and abandoning their manifesto; the Conservatives for their contempt for the referendum and their utter incompetence as the governing party. If we leave them all in a ragged and dishevelled state we will have the opportunity to restore the status quo next time round, if they are all suitably contrite and atone for their respective shortcomings. Brexit, successful or not, will change nothing there. We the electorate also need a practice run for the EU elections, where I hope we will all be especially vindictive towards those three wretched parties. 
MAY3	These disastrous local elections could be a blessing in disguise for the Conservatives	"Never glad confident morning again” was the line quoted at Macmillan about the Profumo scandal, applied to John Major after the departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, and which now hangs over Theresa May as an epitaph as her time as Prime Minister ebbs away. Local election results, which have been especially weak in Somerset, are a symptom of a party that has forgotten how to govern, why it wants to govern and what it promised voters when offering its services to govern. The Huawei affair is a clear example of a party that has forgotten how to govern. The first duty of any administration is the defence of the realm. This comes above any commercial considerations, be they opening up trade routes or the desire to introduce new technologies. The nation’s security is a price worth paying even if it has a potential economic cost or a diplomatic one. It is an area where “safety first” must be the guiding principle. Hence, even if there were a small risk that Huawei could be used by the Chinese Government to gather secrets, its technology must be avoided. When our closest defence allies tell us not to buy services from this company, any prudent leadership would take notice and send courteous apologies to the Chinese.
MAY3	Voters can smell the arrogance of the Remain zealots	A few months ago, I found myself at a dinner populated by vehement people campaigning for a second Brexit referendum. London dinners of people not thrilled by Brexit are, of course, not uncommon. But this was different. This was a gathering of zealots. Since 2016, most of the country’s unhappy Remainers have mellowed. This group, by contrast, had radicalised. When, at some point,  I was asked for my thoughts, I suggested that although I voted Remain, I thought the referendum had actually been an electric moment for British democracy, bringing millions of people out to vote for the first time in decades. Overturning it, I said, would be a disaster. I knew the room would disagree, but I was still astonished when one man declared, in response, that in his experience, most of these former non-voters who had come out to support Brexit were “male convicts” with highly dubious views. Another argued that if stopping Brexit meant such disillusioned voters went back to not voting, this would be a good thing, because then we could go back to ignoring them. This is what the hardest of hard-line Remainers really think. It’s not a mainstream Remainer view. But it goes some way towards explaining why the second referendum crew have been so chronically incapable of taking on Nigel Farage. What stops the zealots is the towering impediment of their own arrogance. Just as they can’t believe they might be wrong about anything or that voters are worth hearing, they simply cannot believe that they need one another. Unfortunately, no political group exemplifies this more than “Change UK”, polling at 8 per cent for the EU elections, 19 points behind Mr Farage. I say “unfortunately” because I had hoped, when they sliced 10 points off Labour’s poll numbers back in March, that this ragbag of anti-Corbyn exiles and ex-Tory media luvvies might keep Labour out of power.
MAY3	If the local elections are any guide, we're heading for a Labour-SNP coalition	one Conservative voter out of every three has deserted the party The local election results appear to confirm received wisdom, as the Conservatives and Labour both lost votes and seats, often for Brexit-related reasons. Voters in the south punished the Conservatives for being too Leave and those in the north punished Labour for being too Remain. The result has been seen as a portent of the collapse of the two-party system and the dominance of the European issue in British politics. But let's look behind the words and hyperbole and see if reality lives up to it.
MAY3	Cervical screening without the need to take your clothes off? It's what women have been waiting for	There are so many different reasons why cervical screening is at a 20-year low. Two of the main barriers are convenience - busy women can find it hard to book an appointment - and embarrassment around a test that only takes a few minutes, but does involve showing your body to a health practioner.  Cervical screening is a prevention test; it spots changes before they become cancerous. So any new test that can do this while also overcoming barriers for women, such as convenience and embarrassment, is to be welcomed.  New research published this week by the University of Manchester, suggests that it might be possible to screen for the HPV virus, which is a high risk factor for the cancer, using a urine test. 
MAY3	When will my fellow MPs abandon the delusion that Leave voters can be sold a Remainers' Brexit?	The Conservative Party faces extinction unless we can leave the EU in a meaningful way  The most striking feature of the local elections has been seeing both main parties roundly punished in their heartlands: Conservatives in the South, and Labour in the North. This reflects universal exasperation about how MPs have utterly failed to resolve Brexit.   Astonishingly, however, many of my fellow MPs still cleave to the notion that for voters’ disillusion to dissipate, all we need to do is “get Brexit over the line” . Yet the PM's deal would extend this paralysis for years to come. It would cost £39 billion for nothing in return, leaving Britain under direct European rule indefinitely, with no say over new EU laws or court rulings (on, say, taxation, or regulation of the City of London). All with no possibility of escape, unless we are prepared to see Northern Ireland separated from Great Britain. The idea that this could be resolved by Remain-supporting Ministers teaming up with a Remain-dominated Labour Party to concoct proposals which tie the UK even more tightly to EU control is a lunacy, which would amount to electoral suicide for both major parties.
MAY3	Time for Britain to stand up for persecuted Christians	The Bishop of Truro’s interim report on the suffering of Christians abroad makes for grim reading. In some countries, the “level and nature” of persecution is approaching “the international definition of genocide”: in Iraq, the number of Christians has fallen from 1.5 million before the Iraq War to fewer than 120,000 today. The most dangerous place to be a Christian might well be Nigeria. In 2018, the country accounted for 3,731 of the 4,136 murders of believers, or 90 per cent of the total. Why doesn’t the West do or say more? The Bishop himself has said that post-colonial guilt and the belief that Christianity is the religion of the rich and powerful have coloured Western reaction, which, if true, betrays an ignorant and Eurocentric world view. In parts of South Asia, for instance, Christianity is widespread among the very poorest, while persecution also occurs in countries that gained independence centuries ago and have large Christian populations. In Mexico, 45 priests and one cardinal have been murdered since 1990. Jeremy Hunt put it pithily: inaction is down to “political correctness”. Hopefully the Foreign Office will consider the full report’s conclusions when released in the summer and, for a change, actually do something. Britain is a Christian country and thus has a particular responsibility to speak out on behalf of the faithful. They are not just numbers on the pages of a report, but flesh‑and-blood members of a worldwide family.
MAY3	The Tories must remake the case for popular capitalism	As the Government thrashes around looking for an agenda, it keeps settling on trendy social reforms: take the bars away from prison windows, save the environment, go to war on sugar. In fact, there’s an old fashioned, materialist problem in Britain that demands an old fashioned, conservative response: the middle-class is stagnating. Analysis by the Financial Conduct Authority finds that every age cohort under 60 is less wealthy than the previous one was ten years before. A decade ago, for instance, people in their early forties could hope to have assets worth over £100,000. Today that figure is closer to £80,000. Wealth is becoming defined more and more by generation, and this is reflected in voting patterns. From 2014 to 2016, the wealthiest people across average consumers were aged 60 to 69, and it is no coincidence that almost half of Conservative voters are 65 or over.
MAY3	In a sport rooted in extraordinary talent, why scapegoat Caster Semenya for her natural state?	In trying to be fair to all women athletes the IAAF has been especially unjust to one. Most champion athletes have physical attributes that give them an edge over their competitors. Usain Bolt is unusually tall for a sprinter and his stride in a race lasting just a few seconds is an advantage over shorter men.

But to what extent are these advantages any different from Lennox Lewis’s great reach or Magic Johnson’s height? 
MAY3	Letters: The writing is on the wall for MPs who have denied voters what they wanted on Brexit	SIR – Vicky Ford, the Conservative MP for Chelmsford, wept after the results of the local election were declared in her constituency. Perhaps now the irresponsible shower of MPs in Westminster have begun to grasp the outrage and betrayal resulting from their cynical conduct. Their only hope of some form of redemption is to remove this disastrous Prime Minister from office. They must then give the people what we voted for: Brexit, with trade with the EU along World Trade Organisation rules.
MAY3	Letters: Whoever leaked the risky decision on Huawei performed a public service to Britain’s security	SIR – Whistleblowers should often be seen as assets, not liabilities, as the Health Secretary vigorously asserted last week.

MAY4	This Government is sending a strong message to the Kremlin	My first engagement as Defence Secretary was particularly apt – a commemorative service to mark Operation Relentless, fifty years of continuous at sea deterrent (CASD). It was appropriate because it’s a metaphor for the whole of our defence. So much of the “silent service” is hidden from view, like the boat itself, beneath the waves. The public will never know the ground-breaking technical innovation or about the years - in some case decades - spent underwater by service personnel in the course of their duty.  While other areas of defence are less shrouded in secrecy than CASD, in every area, so much of what is done daily goes unseen. This is one of the privileges of being Defence Secretary. You get to see the 360 degrees of commitment, courage and compassion. It’s awesome and humbling. It’s why our people in defence, both in uniform and our civilians and their families, are my first priority. Around the world, Britain has not just 100 ambassadors in the civil and foreign service but over 100,000 informal ambassadors, the members of the armed forces.
MAY4	The Tories have only days left to boot out Theresa May - and save the party from obliteration	The problem is Theresa May. Not her policies. Not her Withdrawal Agreement. Her. Ask people who knocked on doors at the recent council elections, and they will all tell you the same thing. Unless the Conservatives switch leaders now, they face obliteration. The PM, naturally, doesn’t share this analysis. She should, after all, have stepped aside several times already according to all the usual conventions, but she seems genuinely not to recognise the rules by which everyone else plays. By every precedent and norm, she should have gone after losing her majority in 2017. She should have gone when the ministers carrying out her Brexit policy resigned. She should have gone when she suffered the worst Commons defeat in 750 years of parliamentary history. But, inert and monotonous, she trudges on. Like every Tory canvasser, I could see a disaster coming. But I had no idea it would be this bad. There had been talk of 500 losses, even 800 – though this latter figure was offered more in a spirit of expectation management than of forecasting. In the event, 1300 councillors lost their seats despite, in most cases, having run frugal and efficient local authorities
MAY4	These disastrous local elections could be a blessing in disguise for the Conservatives	"Never glad confident morning again” was the line quoted at Macmillan about the Profumo scandal, applied to John Major after the departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, and which now hangs over Theresa May as an epitaph as her time as Prime Minister ebbs away.

When our closest defence allies tell us not to buy services from this company, any prudent leadership would take notice and send courteous apologies to the Chinese.
MAY4	This growing voters' revolt just might change the course of British history	Nations are like people. Sometimes they just change. Does Britain encapsulate this truth, as it convulses over Brexit three years on? Middle England’s seismic revolt against the Conservatives has officially begun. After losing over 1,200 seats in local elections, the party will likely be obliterated in European elections later this month. The Tories seem irredeemably soiled by their grubby incompetence and dealings with Corbyn. Meanwhile, although it is early days, the popularity of a pristine new Brexit Party is surging. Even now there are Tories who complacently insist that their movement can bounce back. MPs believe the European elections will enable their usually loyal voters to get “a protest vote out of their system”. Some are optimistic that when Theresa May is replaced by a new leader in the summer, voters will drift back. This may turn out to be a severe miscalculation. The idea that the Tories can lure back loyal voters fails to take into account the least understood and most important thing about life post-Brexit: Britain is now a different country. The result could be permanent party realignment in Westminster.
MAY4	Shouting and screaming about your virtue is so dreadfully middle class	Is there any pastime more middle class than hand-wringing over how middle class you are? It’s surely the only state of being that is simultaneously desired and decried; one everybody wants, but is utterly loath to admit to possessing. Barnaby Lenon, former headmaster of Harrow School, this week declared that the “virtue” of being middle class “is now regarded as sin”. Which is true, to a degree. But the ones laying blame at the doors of the well-off-but-not-too-well-off? Other middle-class people. Lenon was criticising those who spend vast sums on other areas of life but who also lambast parents for paying private school fees – a concern that seems like a luxury in itself. Don’t people preoccupied with sniping about how others raise their children have real problems to worry about? I don’t, obviously, being a member of the pesky middle-class masses. Since 2000, we have become the biggest social swathe in Britain – a cohort comprising more than 50 per cent of the population. This one catch-all tag that now denotes the majority surely can’t say very much about us whatsoever. So what makes us so desperate to disassociate ourselves from it? Indeed, it is now at the root of an apparent identity crisis – how to be middle class but not too middle class – which many seek to deal with by turning to action (at least in appearance). As in so many cases, however, the cover-up has become messier than the crime. 
MAY4	Britain must act urgently to defend Christians around the world	As a Christian country, we have a particular responsibility to speak out on behalf of the faithful The Bishop of Truro’s interim report on the suffering of Christians abroad is grim. In some countries, the “level and nature” of persecution is approaching “the international definition of genocide”: in Iraq, Christian numbers have fallen from 1.5 million before the Iraq War to less than 120,000 today. The most dangerous place to be a Christian might well be Nigeria. In 2018, the country accounted for 3,731 of the 4,136 murders of believers, or 90 per cent of the total. Why doesn’t the West do or say more? The Bishop himself has said that post-colonial guilt and the belief that Christianity is the religion of the rich and powerful have coloured Western reaction, which, if true, betrays an ignorant and Eurocentric world view.
MAY4	Conservatives must change course, or die	Thursday night was the most catastrophic local election for the Tories since 1995, which was the prelude to the Labour landslide of 1997. Of course, Labour this year suffered too, although this doesn’t equate to a Remainer backlash. Yes, the Lib Dems surged, but they have always been a None of the Above vote; independents also flourished and there were stunning numbers of spoiled ballots. This was a protest against the Brexit chaos, both by those who want Brexit, those against it and those who just want to get on with their lives. Brexit is eroding the traditional support for the two main parties and it feels as if we are on the brink of a European-style realignment, that the frontline parties are battling not just for power but survival. What complicates matters is their limited capacity for change. Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May are ideological opposites but equally stubborn: they interpret every crisis as a challenge to go on doing what they already were, with a bit more grit. Their parties have tried to remove them and failed: politicians on both sides calculate they have more to lose than gain by having another go. In other circumstances sticking to your guns or playing for time might be wise, but when the parties are sinking in the polls, it’s really rather stupid – and there are worrying signs that things could be about to get a whole lot worse in the form of a grand bargain to push Brexit through the Commons with a customs union attached. Not only is a customs union a bad idea in itself – perpetual domination by a vengeful EU – but the public will interpret this for what it is: the political class coalescing not to save Brexit but to save itself. They can give this nonsense whatever name they wish – Common Market 2.0 or Danegeld 2019 – it amounts to MPs sacrificing Brexit on the altar of expediency, and growing evidence shows that the electorate is becoming more sophisticated about Brexit, not less. It is widely understood that Brexit demands independence in trade, which is why the Brexit Party – with its staunch opposition to Mrs May’s deal – is doing so well. Any Tory MP who thinks “pushing Brexit over the finishing line” will make Nigel Farage go away is deluded.
MAY4	Time for Britain to stand up for persecuted Christians	The Bishop of Truro’s interim report on the suffering of Christians abroad makes for grim reading. In some countries, the “level and nature” of persecution is approaching “the international definition of genocide”: in Iraq, the number of Christians has fallen from 1.5 million before the Iraq War to fewer than 120,000 today.

MAY4	Letters: The local elections sent a clear message to our undemocratic MPs	SIR – The local election results were a healthy reminder that we still live in a democracy. Remain MPs ranging from Yvette Cooper to Sir Oliver Letwin should be dusting down their CVs. They and their ilk have thwarted the will of the electorate and will be out at the next general election. A G Whitehead St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex
MAY4	Letters: The writing is on the wall for MPs who have denied voters what they wanted on Brexit	SIR – Vicky Ford, the Conservative MP for Chelmsford, wept after the results of the local election were declared in her constituency. Perhaps now the irresponsible shower of MPs in Westminster have begun to grasp the outrage and betrayal resulting from their cynical conduct.

They must then give the people what we voted for: Brexit, with trade with the EU along World Trade Organisation rules.
MAY5	Israel’s response to Hamas aggression is understandable, but it needs to strive for peace	The tragedy of Gaza shows no sign of ending. The Palestinian enclave, blockaded by Israel because of the murderous activities of Hamas, which rules the territory, is among the poorest and most densely populated areas on the planet. It could flourish and live in peace with its neighbour, were it not for the determination of Hamas to seek Israel’s destruction. The militants inflict misery on their own people in pursuit of an unattainable goal motivated by atavistic hatred. How else can they explain firing more than 500 rockets and mortars at Israel, knowing what the consequences of doing so would be with the counter-strikes that duly arrived? One theory is that it was timed to embarrass Israel ahead of the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv later this month. But there are other considerations. Hamas is losing support among Gaza’s population, because the economic situation continues to deteriorate and aid from Qatar is nowhere near enough to make up the shortfall.
MAY5	Far from facing Blair-era oblivion, a huge electoral triumph is in the Tories' grasp	Of all the nonsense talked since the local elections the biggest absurdity is that there is some comparison with the end of the last Tory period in office in 1997. That is bunkum. I know – I was there. I know what it was like to knock on doors, after 18 years of Tory government, and I remember how hard it was to fight against Tony Blair. With his flashing eyes, his floating hair, his glistering teeth, he seemed so obviously to incarnate new possibilities. He had torn up Clause Four; he claimed to be tough on crime; he was intensely relaxed about capitalist success; he had no problem with lefties sending their kids to fee-paying schools. He invited us to believe that he had invented something different, and better: New Labour, a Third Way. To a degree that we have now forgotten, he had accomplished that essential trick of all who are about to win an election: he owned the future. And in that respect the Blair of 1997 is a shining contrast with the current Labour leader. Which way does Corbyn face, chronologically? He is a hodge podge of bygone styles: 1970s Romanian economics; 1930s pacifism and appeasement; 1980s shellsuits; mediaeval indulgence of anti-Semitism. He plucks the worst from all kinds of epochs - but it is becoming ever clearer that the British public do not think he represents the future.
MAY5	A donor exodus over this Brexit chaos could kill off the Tories	How damaging is bad? Historically the Conservative Party is the great survivor, being the oldest political organisation in the democratic world, with a knack for achieving power and governing responsibly. However, it is undoubtedly in crisis. I am chairman of a group of businesses that was established in 1947 to argue against nationalisation and promote what was then referred to as Free Enterprise. We are not affiliated to the Conservatives but have always been close. Most particularly, at the last General Election our members donated to 78 marginal constituencies, returning 42 Conservative MPs. We might be considered part of the Party’s foundations, but this support must be earned. Each time Tory Treasurers return to their donors for any meaningful amount, their case has to be persuasive. Unlike Labour fundraising, with its constitutionally connected unions donating via their members’ subscriptions. Tory donations can’t be taken for granted and this year CCHQ has found significant fundraising nearly impossible.
MAY5	An anti-Brexit alliance between the PM and Corbyn will be a catastrophe for the country	Labour’s John McDonnell should be wary about a potential Brexit deal with the prime minister. Labour could seize the chance to nail down a Brexit which meets their key demands, exploiting the Government’s new weakness, as it appears ready to compromise anything and everything just to get Brexit “over the line”. However, while Labour will want to string out the talks, they will not want to join what Mr Farage has already branded “a coalition against the people” to help Mrs May’s deal through.   Both the main parties are paying the price for failing to deliver Brexit.  Don’t be fooled by voter defections to the Lib Dems or the Greens. They have always been vehicles for protest voters, and historically have attracted significant eurosceptic support. Such defections do not express a sudden enthusiasm for staying in the EU or for a second referendum, or (least of all) for Mrs May’s deal.  
MAY5	Why do liberal snobs have such an emotional need to talk down Britain?	I hugged myself with glee when I saw the new YouGov-Cambridge Globalism survey which establishes that the British are more convinced of the benefits of immigration than any other European nation. Only 37 per cent of us Britons are of the opinion that the cons outweigh the pros – less than any other people except the Poles. We showed the highest level of support of any country for qualified professionals coming to the UK with a job offer, with 80 per cent agreeing they were good for the country. In a further trouncing of the knee-jerk “gammon” stereotype, more British men than women are in favour of immigration. No doubt many Lefty liberals won’t be happy at all to discover that their countrymen aren’t the curtain‑twitching, finger-pointing, foreigner-fearing hobgoblins of their worst nightmares. They will be quite dismayed at this excellent news – which bold Brexiteers such as myself were cheerfully sure of all along – because there is a certain sort of strange soul who passionately wants to think the worst of their compatriots – and loves nothing better than to wallow in the notion that our own dynamic nation, which has rocked the world in everything from democracy to design, is a tiny island hellhole.
MAY5	The only way to save the Conservative Party: a new leader, Brexit, tax cuts and a war on crime	The Government’s response to the catastrophic local election results has been astonishingly tin-eared: rally around the leader, call for unity, threaten to do a deal with Labour over Brexit just to “get it finished”. This was an anti-establishment election in which Labour did badly, too – it has no legitimacy as a coalition partner – and how does the Tory leadership respond? By creating an establishment cartel with the very same Marxists they’ve spent four years denouncing. The Conservatives are not listening to the voters. They are trying to survive the only way they know how, by circling the wagons. They are too self-absorbed to see that in pursuing self-preservation in such a shameless, craven manner, they endanger not just themselves but the entire country. If they do cook up a compromise with Jeremy Corbyn that locks Britain into a customs union, they’ll destroy a true Brexit and hinder our economy. The voters will see straight through the deception and the Tory vote will collapse entirely, putting Mr Corbyn into No 10. This is a major crisis for our society. It can be avoided if the Conservatives are willing to change leader and to commit themselves to three essential principles.
MAY5	Britain must act urgently to defend Christians around the world	As a Christian country, we have a particular responsibility to speak out on behalf of the faithful The Bishop of Truro’s interim report on the suffering of Christians abroad is grim. In some countries, the “level and nature” of persecution is approaching “the international definition of genocide”: in Iraq, Christian numbers have fallen from 1.5 million before the Iraq War to less than 120,000 today. The most dangerous place to be a Christian might well be Nigeria. In 2018, the country accounted for 3,731 of the 4,136 murders of believers, or 90 per cent of the total. Why doesn’t the West do or say more? The Bishop himself has said that post-colonial guilt and the belief that Christianity is the religion of the rich and powerful have coloured Western reaction, which, if true, betrays an ignorant and Eurocentric world view.
MAY5	Conservatives must change course, or die	Thursday night was the most catastrophic local election for the Tories since 1995, which was the prelude to the Labour landslide of 1997. Of course, Labour this year suffered too, although this doesn’t equate to a Remainer backlash. Yes, the Lib Dems surged, but they have always been a None of the Above vote; independents also flourished and there were stunning numbers of spoiled ballots. This was a protest against the Brexit chaos, both by those who want Brexit, those against it and those who just want to get on with their lives. Brexit is eroding the traditional support for the two main parties and it feels as if we are on the brink of a European-style realignment, that the frontline parties are battling not just for power but survival. What complicates matters is their limited capacity for change. Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May are ideological opposites but equally stubborn: they interpret every crisis as a challenge to go on doing what they already were, with a bit more grit. Their parties have tried to remove them and failed: politicians on both sides calculate they have more to lose than gain by having another go. In other circumstances sticking to your guns or playing for time might be wise, but when the parties are sinking in the polls, it’s really rather stupid – and there are worrying signs that things could be about to get a whole lot worse in the form of a grand bargain to push Brexit through the Commons with a customs union attached. Not only is a customs union a bad idea in itself – perpetual domination by a vengeful EU – but the public will interpret this for what it is: the political class coalescing not to save Brexit but to save itself. They can give this nonsense whatever name they wish – Common Market 2.0 or Danegeld 2019 – it amounts to MPs sacrificing Brexit on the altar of expediency, and growing evidence shows that the electorate is becoming more sophisticated about Brexit, not less. It is widely understood that Brexit demands independence in trade, which is why the Brexit Party – with its staunch opposition to Mrs May’s deal – is doing so well. Any Tory MP who thinks “pushing Brexit over the finishing line” will make Nigel Farage go away is deluded.
MAY5	Letters: It is Michael Gove and the Government that seem unable to ‘face facts’	SIR – In observing that the arithmetic in the House of Commons is opposed to leaving without a deal” (report May 4) Michael Gove states: “We have to face facts.”  Well here are some facts Mr Gove would do well to face: that in a referendum, held by the Government precisely so that a definitive answer would be obtained, the electorate voted to leave; that the voting options, “Leave” or “Remain” were unequivocal; that the Government pledged that it would “implement what you decide”; that had the result been a majority vote to remain, the matter would have been considered to have been answered unequivocally; that both major parties in the 2017 election promised to honour the referendum result; that constant references to “hardline Brexiteers” is a political (that is dishonest) way of describing those honourable MPs who simply wish to respect the people’s decision; that, deal or no deal, the Government is both duty – and honour-bound – to see that Britain leaves the EU. It is Parliament’s wilful refusal to face these facts that has led directly to where we are today – not least to the coming destruction of the Conservative Party. It is both contemptible and beyond parody that Mr Gove should now exhort us all to “face facts” when these facts are the ones he and his like have wilfully brought into being by deliberately not facing those engendered by the referendum, and which the British people were given every assurance would be acted upon.
MAY5	Letters: The local elections sent a clear message to our undemocratic MPs	SIR – The local election results were a healthy reminder that we still live in a democracy. Remain MPs ranging from Yvette Cooper to Sir Oliver Letwin should be dusting down their CVs. They and their ilk have thwarted the will of the electorate and will be out at the next general election. A G Whitehead St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex
MAY6	Mrs Thatcher would agree that we need America now more than ever	American intellectual self-confidence has been the heartbeat of Western civilisation How do you become an icon? President Kennedy knew. In the speech he planned to deliver on that fateful day in Dallas, he would have told us in six words: “Neither conformity nor complacency will do.” Like so many of his great countrymen, this American icon had no interest in the status quo, and nor did Mrs Thatcher. Like Kennedy or Henry Ford, she believed that individuals, acting alone or almost single-handedly, can make even highly improbable things happen. To them, the whole point of being an icon, of being alive, is to change the world. Forty years ago this month, Mrs Thatcher won the first of her three historic election victories. As leader of the opposition, she had worked out that general elections are intellectual battles, with the winner the one with the best arguments.
MAY6	Both Labour and Conservatives are committing a fraud in these customs union talks	In politics it’s often stupid to try to be clever when you could just be honest. We keep going round and round in circles with Brexit. Why? Because we can’t escape the technical difficulties and the parties are avoiding the only real choices they have left for themselves: leave without a comprehensive deal or stay in the EU. Instead, they talk, grandstand and play the waiting game. A case in point is the anticipated pact between the Government and the Opposition to muster support in Parliament for a new withdrawal deal. There are three basic conditions. First, alignment on single market regulation of goods. Second, keep EU rules now and in the future on things that Labour likes, such as workers’ rights and the environment. Third, some kind kind of customs union arrangement.
MAY6	Forget a Labour deal, the Tories must reinvent themselves as the party of Brexit to survive electoral wipeout	Conservatives are horrified by the prospect of working with the most Left-wing leader in Labour's history Every once in a while, I will come across a trendy revisionist arguing that William Shakespeare should be removed from school curricula and replaced with a more contemporary author. But the more I see of the rotten state of British politics today, I can only see this as a deeply ironic aim. Who else, other than the Bard, could do justice to the tragedy currently engulfing the Conservative Party? Theresa May’s Premiership, which began with high hopes and huge support amongst the public, has given way to sympathy, disdain and now real anger. Her reputation has crashed as many in her own party and wider society realise she never intended to deliver any of her early Brexit promises and has indeed spent much of the past two years reneging on them. They believe - rightly - that Theresa May is still a Remainer at heart.
MAY6	As someone fondly familiar with infuriatingly late pregnancies, I have advice for Meghan Markle	I sprint for trains, miss planes, vex friends with my tardy ways, and ran 22 minutes late for my own wedding. No one was surprised when both my sons refused to leave the womb on time and arrived, four years apart, a full 10 days after their due dates. Wilful inertia, followed by blind panic, is a deep-rooted family trait. So I feel for the Duchess of Sussex as the days tick by and her baby stays stubborn. It’s not just the torturous pressure on the bladder, nor the sense that your belly will erupt like Vesuvius – it’s the ceaseless enquiries of “Have you had it yet?” and the unsolicited advice on what may best get contractions started. It’s also the doctors gathering like horsemen of the Apocalypse, reminding you that you’re an “elderly primigravida” (any first-time mum over the age of 35) and pressurising you to have a medical induction – but not mentioning this will raise your chance of further intervention and a C‑section. People tend to set the timer at 40 weeks, even though anything up to 42 weeks is considered a normal gestation period right round the globe.
MAY6	Why do American snobs take such delight in bashing Brexit?	One of the most remarkable phenomena of our age is the zeal with which the New York Times, the leading newspaper in a country that is friendly to Britain, has, since Brexit, sought to paint us black. The view from abroad is usually interesting, and may be instructive, but the glee that paper seems to take in portraying us as basket-cases is astounding.  There are other things going on in Europe, east and west, and some of them are alarming. Yet the view from Manhattan appears to be that Britain, having opted to leave the European Union, is uniquely bad, and therefore worthy of a unique level of opprobrium.  And how ironic that its chief executive officer of the The New York Times Company is Mark Thompson, the former director-general of the BBC. Some naughty folk might think the dots join.

MAY6	Letters: This month’s EU election will be the only three-way Brexit referendum that Theresa May needs	SIR – The Prime Minister is said to have held secret discussions over a three-way second referendum. Has she not realised that this is unnecessary, as we already have a three-way referendum arranged on May 23? A vote for the Brexit Party is for a Brexit on World Trade Organisation terms; a vote for the Lib Dems is for Remain; and for a withdrawal agreement with a customs union fudge you can vote Conservative or Labour. We will then at last know whether the British people have changed our minds or not.

MAY7	If Holyrood looks better after 20 years, it's only because Westminster is worse	There won’t be any demands to put out more flags this week, and I’m not talking here about the latest Royal birth, great news though it is for Harry and Meghan, but about the 20th anniversary of the Scottish Parliament. Although to be accurate, May 1999 was actually the first sitting of the recalled Scottish Parliament, which had been suspended thanks to the Act of Union in 1707, the question today is how much is there to celebrate in the devolved institution? The answer is difficult to pinpoint. For many, it’s something like that raincoat you bought in the sales 20 years ago, which you’ve never really loved all that much and which never felt quite right but that you’re loath to dispense with because, well, it’s there and it sort of does a job, even if you wish you’d got something better.
MAY7	The British system simply isn't suited to cross-party stitch-ups - building a Brexit consensus was doomed	Here, to brighten up your day, is what passed for a joke on the Left, circa 1984. “Kinnock, Kinnock. Who’s there? Ramsay MacDonald.” As one-liners go it is not quite in the Tommy Cooper class and you would have to be a keeper of the true socialist flame to fall about laughing. At the time, Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, was refusing to give his full-throated support to the miners’ strike and was, therefore, likened to the ultimate bogeyman of the People’s Party, the prime minister who “betrayed” the creed by forming a coalition government with the Tories in 1931. It says much about the entrenched tribalism of British politics that the alleged apostasy of a party leader 90 years ago should be invoked in order to prevent present-day politicians entering into an agreement with their opponents. But MacDonald’s name has been bandied about in recent weeks ever since talks were opened between the Government and the Labour front-bench to find an agreed position on Brexit. It was, in fact, a Tory MP Crispin Blunt who used the MacDonald comparison to warn Theresa May away from an accommodation with Labour. “She would find there were very few Conservatives behind her if she were to do that deal,” he said.
MAY7	Prince Charles's tour of Berlin is motivated by more than just Brexit	Away from the feverish royal baby watching in Windsor, the Prince of Wales is on a German charm offensive; a tour of the country designed to extend the hand of friendship. In these myopic times, it’s unsurprising that in some quarters the visit is being spun as a push for a softer Brexit. Yet the Royal family’s relationship with Germany goes much further than the vagaries of British politics, encompassing a shared history and deep family ties. In 1701, an extraordinary Act of Parliament, establishing that only Protestants could rule England, effectively made the Royal family German. With dozens of potential successors barred by their Catholicism, the choice settled on Electress Sophia of Hanover, the mother of George I. The Hanoverian dynasty was born. Over a century later, Princess Charlotte, daughter of the Prince Regent (later George IV), married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg before dying in childbirth in 1817. This precipitated a scramble amongst the lusty Hanoverian Dukes who dropped their mistresses and quickly sought German Protestant princesses to secure the future of the royal house. The winners in the race for succession were the Duke of Kent and his (German) wife, the parents of Queen Victoria.
MAY7	The astonishing crowds I have seen at Brexit Party rallies show how the grassroots are crying out for change	Last weekend I took part in two rallies as a Brexit Party candidate, speaking to thousands of people. Though I’ve been involved in politics and public speaking for decades, I’d never experienced anything quite like this. We walked on stage accompanied by rock anthems, Brexit Party adverts adorned big screens, crowds greeted Nigel Farage with cheers and chanting. Naysayers may disdain this as the Americanisation of our politics, but actually, I love it – not because of the performance, but because these rallies are extraordinary. This is a serious shakeup of politics as we know it, and it feels authentic and important. Despite the operational smoothness, we participants aren’t being stage-managed in the conventional political sense. All the candidates write their own speeches; no one checks what we say in advance. None of those running in my region (the North West of England) are career politicians - but we all have careers and reputations we have put on hold (and on the line) to stand. So it is good to be treated as grownups, and allowed to speak from the heart. But it’s the crowds of attendees who make these events really special. I have felt a depth of genuine camaraderie, often from unexpected groups of people. One Corbynista shook my hand and thanked me for speaking - she couldn't believe that Labour MPs are abandoning their traditional voters. A Liverpool trade unionist expressed the same experience of politics as a “disillusioned Tory activist from the Wirral”. A dapper older gentleman who insisted on carrying my bag said “we democrats must look after each other”.
MAY7	Graham Brady must do his duty and force the PM's long-overdue departure	The 1922 Committee has an important role in booting out unpopular leaders Historically, the 1922 Committee is one of the most revered and respected institutions within the Conservative Party establishment.  Why? Because in most circumstances it has done its duty admirably, both in supporting and advising previous Prime Ministers but also showing them the exit door if they have become an electoral burden to a party normally clinical when considering regicide. It has always been, and still is, a difficult balancing exercise as the Chairman and executive committee must weigh up the many and constantly changing views of its wider backbench membership. However, leaders of the Conservative Party take it for granted at their peril and many have been rightfully fearful of its influence. In 2010 Prime Minister David Cameron made the mistake of trying to neuter its influence by attempting to interfere in its internal elections, only to be hit by a very significant backlash that ended any further meddling. 
MAY7	Ten years on, MPs still haven't learned the lessons of the expenses scandal	On this day 10 years ago, the Telegraph began serialising the most explosive story of recent times. As we said in an editorial, “the systematic misappropriation by MPs of the allowance paid to defray the expense of keeping a second home is one of the great scandals of modern public life. Many honourable members have been complicit in what amounts to an officially sanctioned and sustained abuse of public funds perpetrated against their own constituents over many years.” There have been attempts ever since both to deny the enormity of what took place and to see the reporting of it as an undeserved and near-fatal blow to the integrity of parliament. Some have even traced Brexit to this moment in that it so undermined faith and trust in our politicians that the country was unwilling to listen to the Remain majority in the Commons. Since Euroscepticism long predates the expenses scandal, and other EU countries have seen a similar voter backlash against mainstream parties, this is a pretty fanciful theory. But there is some truth in the suggestion that public anger towards MPs contributed to a popular sense that politicians were out of touch with the people they represented. Inevitably this is reflected at the polls.
MAY7	Britain must not drop its guard and allow the peddlers of hatred to flourish	During the 1990s, this country, and London especially, became a hotbed of Islamist fundamentalism. The UK’s reputation as a safe haven for political dissidents attracted many who had fallen foul of authoritarian regimes in their native countries in the Middle East, North Africa or the Indian subcontinent. The situation became so bad that the French dubbed our capital “Londonistan” and regularly complained about the presence of militants fomenting trouble overseas. For a while they were tolerated because they did not seem to be a threat to us. But soon the attentions of the preachers of hate were turned on the country that had harboured them, or in which they were born. Prominent among them was Anjem Choudary, a founder of the group al-Muhajiroun. For years these self-styled imams were allowed to whip up the hatred of Muslims towards Britain and the West with impunity. Finally, Choudary was locked away in 2016 for voicing his support for the now defunct caliphate run by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, but he is now back on the streets. As we reported yesterday, MI5 is concerned that Choudary and his ilk continue to pose a threat, even though his organisation is banned. Dozens have been jailed over the past 20 years but are now free and retain their radical, anti-Western outlook.
MAY7	How can we bridge the gap between politics and the planet?	The disconnect between science and governance has rarely been more apparent than in recent weeks. Climate change activists have brought cities to a halt and experts in Paris are warning of a biodiversity calamity; yet the priority for politicians is to bring about further economic growth and prosperity. Can the two be reconciled? Much of the species depredation, especially of insects and birds, is the consequence of agricultural methods intended to boost crop production. Cheap and plentiful food and energy is what politicians feel they need to provide in order to survive. Yet their ambitions appear to conflict dramatically with what the planet needs to avoid catastrophe. Donald Trump, not a man to take these matters especially seriously, has threatened tough tariffs on Chinese goods before talks due to take place this week to avert a trade war. Arguably, however, the world’s two biggest economic powers might better consider how they might cooperate to meet growing concerns about the damage man is inflicting on the Earth and its other inhabitants.
MAY7	Letters: Unless MPs act swiftly, the Conservatives will go into terminal decline	SIR – Boris Johnson states (Comment, May 6) that “there is clearly now an opportunity for a sensible One-Nation Tory approach” and that “We [the Conservative Party] need to get Brexit done properly”. Neither of these things is possible while Theresa May is leader. Voting in the recent local council elections and the drubbing given to the Tories are symptoms of the party’s malaise, but they are not the disease. The disease is Theresa May and all the MPs backing her and the (non-Brexit) Withdrawal Agreement. Only when the disease is cured will the party begin to recover. Should the party die now, the blame will rest with those who wilfully failed to understand the problem. Andy Bebbington Ravenshead, Nottinghamshire
MAY7	Letters: This month’s EU election will be the only three-way Brexit referendum that Theresa May needs	SIR – The Prime Minister is said to have held secret discussions over a three-way second referendum. Has she not realised that this is unnecessary, as we already have a three-way referendum arranged on May 23? A vote for the Brexit Party is for a Brexit on World Trade Organisation terms; a vote for the Lib Dems is for Remain; and for a withdrawal agreement with a customs union fudge you can vote Conservative or Labour. We will then at last know whether the British people have changed our minds or not.
MAY8	Trump has changed the rules of diplomacy, and America's allies better get used to it	With the 2020 presidential election campaign in its embryonic stage, one might expect "the big issues" like jobs, the economy and immigration, rather than foreign policy to be dominating the debate agenda. So it was rather surprising to hear Julián Castro, one of the vast field of Democrat candidates, questioned about the issue when he spoke to around 50 supporters at a meeting in New Hampshire the other day. He rounded on the Trump administration for its treatment of allies and said one of his first acts, should he win the White House, would be to repair relations with countries which had traditionally been considered America’s friends. It is true that the Trump has ruffled the feathers of many allies. During the 2016 election there was considerable unease in Whitehall and Westminster at the prospect of a Trump administration. Boris Johnson, when Mayor of London, lest we forget, had been particularly scathing about Trump’s claim that parts of the capital were so radicalised that police were afraid for their own lives.
MAY8	Why can't the hapless Tories find it in themselves to rise up against Theresa May?	What is this woman thinking? I mean that literally. What exactly is she thinking? Is there any explanation for Theresa May’s absolute refusal to stand down imminently - or even to contemplate setting out a designated path to standing down - that is rational/justifiable/ unselfish? I’m really trying to make sense of this in a way that doesn’t involve the words “pig-headed, purblind obstinacy”. The famous “sense of duty” just won’t cut it. It has surely been made clear to her repeatedly that she has a responsibility to the country and to her party which must preclude carrying on in the face of repeated failure to achieve any of the intermediate goals, let alone the ultimate objective. Surely she must be affected  by the evidence (futility of “talks” with Labour, appalling defeat in local elections, etc) if not by the arguments being put to her - which she might dismiss as the personal ambition of rivals. What mighty forces must there be weighing against all this to persuade her that she is right to resist the calls for her to make a seemly departure?
MAY8	Politics is descending into farce as the intransigent Theresa May still refuses to go	It is now a month since the House of Commons has divided on a motion. To the justified derision of those outside, it has frequently risen in mid-afternoon for lack of anything to do.  On Tuesday, the Government trumpeted as an iconic Parliamentary moment the Second Reading of the Wild Animals in Circuses (No. 2) Bill. The ban will affect only two circuses and a grand total of 19 animals. This paralysis is the result of the barely believable intransigence of a Prime Minister consumed by the increasingly deluded aim of passing an Agreement which MPs have thrice told her in emphatic terms is a bad deal. Her response each time has been unmoved: “Pass my deal.” Her response to every Brexit question before the Liaison Committee last week amounted to: “pass my deal.” Her response to the local elections which saw 1,330 Conservative Councillors unseated and 44 Conservative Councils lost has been: “pass my deal.”
MAY8	Liverpool's plucky triumph was the victory against Europe our dispirited nation needed	
Follow your club now for first access to all our news, views and analysis
 On Sunday, record numbers of us hunkered down to enjoy the final part of Line of Duty. A series based on unexpected plot twists, it kept us gripped to the last with its ability to pull the rug from under our assumptions. Its writer, Jed Mercurio, however, would be the first to admit that when it comes to presenting us with the implausible, the ridiculous and the totally unexpected, he can never match what happened on Tuesday night. But then nothing imagined could ever compete with the magnificent drama of Liverpool’s 4-0 victory over Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final. This is what sport can do for us: completely overturn our expectations. There was me, a lifelong follower of Liverpool’s bitterest rivals Manchester United, someone who enjoys little more than watching the Anfield club falter, leaping from my sofa when the fourth goal was scored in delighted acknowledgement of the sheer absurdity of what was unfolding. Because nobody predicted the underdog would so comprehensively unseat the favourite.
MAY8	Arrogant Leftists have taken over as the new countryside establishment	It’s the insufferable arrogance of the rural establishment that gets me, their sense of entitlement, their out of touch complacency and their ruthless manipulation of power to get their own way. No, I'm not talking about the choleric Tory squires of the shires, though they can be bad enough. I mean  the new establishment,  the one that has real power in the countryside.  If there is one good thing that has come out of the shambles at Natural England – yes, Tony Juniper, that is what it is – then it is that it has shone on a light on this new establishment. With their changes to the rules on shooting birds they were so anxious to get one over on the hated Tory grouse moor owners that they completely overlooked the fact that their actions would cause devastating collateral damage to rare ground nesting birds like the curlew. The watermelons, a self-righteous shade of green on the outside and red right the way through, are only interested in conservation as a way of developing a narrative of "crisis" in the countryside in order to achieve the bigger prize of land reform.
MAY8	The families of the London Bridge victims are owed an answer	The horror of the terrorist attacks on London Bridge two years ago was recalled at the Old Bailey yesterday as the inquest into the eight people who died got under way. These were mostly young foreign nationals out on a warm June evening in a vibrant part of Europe’s biggest city. To have their lives cut short in this way during what the coroner called 10 minutes of “high and terrible drama” was truly appalling. It followed the bombing of a pop concert in Manchester and the attack on Westminster Bridge just weeks earlier. The inquest heard heart-wrenching tributes from the relatives of the dead and will be reminded of the heroism of people who confronted the knife-wielding terrorists and the police who acted before armed officers shot dead the three jihadists.
MAY8	Ten years on, MPs still haven't learned the lessons of the expenses scandal	On this day 10 years ago, the Telegraph began serialising the most explosive story of recent times. As we said in an editorial, “the systematic misappropriation by MPs of the allowance paid to defray the expense of keeping a second home is one of the great scandals of modern public life. Many honourable members have been complicit in what amounts to an officially sanctioned and sustained abuse of public funds perpetrated against their own constituents over many years.” There have been attempts ever since both to deny the enormity of what took place and to see the reporting of it as an undeserved and near-fatal blow to the integrity of parliament. Some have even traced Brexit to this moment in that it so undermined faith and trust in our politicians that the country was unwilling to listen to the Remain majority in the Commons. Since Euroscepticism long predates the expenses scandal, and other EU countries have seen a similar voter backlash against mainstream parties, this is a pretty fanciful theory. But there is some truth in the suggestion that public anger towards MPs contributed to a popular sense that politicians were out of touch with the people they represented. Inevitably this is reflected at the polls.
MAY8	Britain must not drop its guard and allow the peddlers of hatred to flourish	During the 1990s, this country, and London especially, became a hotbed of Islamist fundamentalism. The UK’s reputation as a safe haven for political dissidents attracted many who had fallen foul of authoritarian regimes in their native countries in the Middle East, North Africa or the Indian subcontinent. The situation became so bad that the French dubbed our capital “Londonistan” and regularly complained about the presence of militants fomenting trouble overseas. For a while they were tolerated because they did not seem to be a threat to us. But soon the attentions of the preachers of hate were turned on the country that had harboured them, or in which they were born. Prominent among them was Anjem Choudary, a founder of the group al-Muhajiroun. For years these self-styled imams were allowed to whip up the hatred of Muslims towards Britain and the West with impunity. Finally, Choudary was locked away in 2016 for voicing his support for the now defunct caliphate run by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, but he is now back on the streets. As we reported yesterday, MI5 is concerned that Choudary and his ilk continue to pose a threat, even though his organisation is banned. Dozens have been jailed over the past 20 years but are now free and retain their radical, anti-Western outlook.
MAY8	Letters: Unless MPs act swiftly, the Conservatives will go into terminal decline	SIR – Boris Johnson states (Comment, May 6) that “there is clearly now an opportunity for a sensible One-Nation Tory approach” and that “We [the Conservative Party] need to get Brexit done properly”. Neither of these things is possible while Theresa May is leader. Voting in the recent local council elections and the drubbing given to the Tories are symptoms of the party’s malaise, but they are not the disease. The disease is Theresa May and all the MPs backing her and the (non-Brexit) Withdrawal Agreement. Only when the disease is cured will the party begin to recover. Should the party die now, the blame will rest with those who wilfully failed to understand the problem. Andy Bebbington Ravenshead, Nottinghamshire
MAY8	Letters: This month’s EU election will be the only three-way Brexit referendum that Theresa May needs	SIR – The Prime Minister is said to have held secret discussions over a three-way second referendum. Has she not realised that this is unnecessary, as we already have a three-way referendum arranged on May 23? A vote for the Brexit Party is for a Brexit on World Trade Organisation terms; a vote for the Lib Dems is for Remain; and for a withdrawal agreement with a customs union fudge you can vote Conservative or Labour. We will then at last know whether the British people have changed our minds or not.
MAY9	Ruth Davidson's measured return to Holyrood proves she's no one trick pony	For those of us who like their politics, at least at the leadership end of it, red in tooth and claw, the return of Ruth Davidson to the parliamentary fray was something well worth looking forward to. Absent on maternity leave for the last six months, the Scottish Conservative leader had made quite a name for herself in roughing up First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at their weekly Question Time joust. Thus, it was something of a disappointment for those of us in the cheap seats to witness a different Ruth Davidson yesterday. The sharpness was still there, the research had been properly done but what we had was a determination to not only to take on the SNP leader on the subject Ms Sturgeon’s been determined to call her own – education - but also to prove that this Tory leader is no one-trick pony.
MAY9	The Tories can only survive now if they become the party of no deal	With every passing week, the depth of the Tories’ problem becomes clearer. Nigel Farage is hoovering up Conservative voters in their millions, with the aim of keeping hold of them long after the European Parliament elections. He hopes to pick up where Ukip left off, going after Labour in the north and the Tories in the south. “At this rate, we’ll be lucky to get 10 per cent of the vote,” says one Cabinet member. “He is asking why anyone would trust what the Tories say on Brexit. We need a leader with an answer.” There is no shortage of would-be candidates. The race has begun, wives are being paraded and wide-ranging speeches are being written. Theresa May is turning out to be an inspiration in that so many MPs think they could do a better job. The latest is Esther McVey, one of the many former work and pension secretaries, who declared yesterday. She didn’t offer much of a reason, but none is really needed nowadays. As a Brexiteer, she can promise to see off Mr Farage by delivering Brexit – but then again, they all say that. The question is how. There is only one plausible answer: the next Conservative leader will have to announce that Britain will leave the European Union on 31 October without a deal, unless the European Union makes a better offer.
MAY9	Cringe-worthy politicians like Vince Cable need to learn the art of swearing	As stirring calls-to-arms go, the Liberal Democrats’ latest effort lacks a certain subtle something. “Bollocks to Brexit” crows the manifesto for their EU elections campaign. I’ll say this for the flyer delivered by Nigel Farage last week (well ahead of the Lib Dem game): it had lovely manners. No four-letter words, no eight-letter words, no dirty doodles in the margins. There is something “trendy vicar” about a swearing politician. Yes, I’m down with the kids, they say, with my hashtag slang and my naughty words. In the pews or at the polling station, we cringe. A man may swear like a docker when he’s down The Dog and Duck, but he’d wince if the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said so much as an intemperate: “Oh, bum.” In an interview this week, Gabby Bertin, former press secretary to David Cameron, said she had had to reprimand the Prime Minister for saying “too many twits might make a t***.” That was in 2009, talking about Twitter, which in the intervening ten years has become a spittoon for every base thought, rude word and profane political outburst. Cameron was right in his instincts, but he might have put it more prettily.
MAY9	The Labour party can try and avoid talking about Brexit all it likes – it's still going to get a kicking on May 23	It was perfectly sensible for Jeremy Corbyn, at this morning’s launch of Labour’s European parliamentary elections campaign, to focus, not on Brexit itself, but on jobs, trade, workers’ rights and the environment. Just because few of his audience (at least, those beyond the hall) will base their votes on such issues doesn’t mean he should forget all about them. And politically speaking, it makes sense for the Labour leader to try to drag everyone’s focus away from his own party’s divisions over Brexit policy and towards stuff that everyone in Labour can agree on. Alas, it was a futile endeavour. As the question and answer session showed, journalists only want to focus on what a Labour vote will mean as far as the Brexit process goes. Is a cross against the Labour candidate a vote in support of Brexit? Or one in support of a second referendum? Or both?
MAY9	The deeply split 1922 Committee has given Theresa May one last chance	4pm on Wednesday 8th May was set by the influential 1922 Executive Committee as the deadline for Theresa May to provide a timetable for leaving No10 Downing Street. Like so many deadlines deemed to be significant, it came and went with only the faintest whimper. That whimper came when Sir Graham Brady fronted up to the waiting media to say that he had had a couple of good meetings with the Prime Minister and she would meet with his executive the following week. For a Prime Minster good at stalling and prevarication, it appeared to political commentators that another week was yet another short-lived triumph for a leader living a day to day existence. For the 1922, it superficially looked weak and unnecessary to give Theresa May - whose Brexit plans appear to be going nowhere -  yet more time and to do what?  Both passing her Withdrawal Agreement or a deal with the Labour Party would split the Conservative Party and the country for a generation at least. 
MAY9	Britain must stand with the United States against the ayatollahs of Iran	For America’s top emissary, Mike Pompeo has been carving a distinctly undiplomatic path through Europe these past few days. The US Secretary of State angered the Germans by cancelling a visit to Berlin at the last minute, leaving Chancellor Angela Merkel fuming and plunging relations between the two countries into the deep freeze. Mr Pompeo then moved on to London, where he reignited the row over the UK’s relationship with the Chinese communications giant Huawei, even as the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, was in Beijing trying to build bridges with the regime. For good measure, Mr Pompeo then laid into Jeremy Corbyn for supporting the continued presidency of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro. Without mincing his words, he called such an approach “disgusting”. Straight-talking is a characteristic of this US administration, taking its lead from the top; and the fact is Mr Pompeo was right in much of what he said. The UK does need to consider very carefully whether inviting Huawei to provide 5G mobile technology is worth losing crucial intelligence co-operation with its closest ally.
MAY9	How much longer can Theresa May ignore the fact that much of her party wants her to go?	It is almost surreal to watch Prime Minister’s question time take place in the midst of the greatest political crisis of modern times, with that crisis’s cause hardly meriting a mention during Commons exchanges lasting 50 minutes. Jeremy Corbyn chose to raise the NHS, a creditable enough issue but one that deliberately avoided pointing to the elephant in the chamber. Theresa May batted away questions about a second Brexit referendum from Ian Blackford of the SNP and two or three other MPs, as though she is no longer in any position to make definitive policy pronouncements. Only when Andrea Jenkyns, the Tory MP for Morley and Outwood, asked a question did the real concern among Conservatives finally surface: Mrs May’s leadership. She has tried her best but has failed, Ms Jenkyns said. The sweeping Tory losses in the local elections last week marked the end of the road, though Conservatives face an even bigger disaster in the European elections due to take place later this month. Is it not time for the Prime Minister to step aside, Miss Jenkins asked.
MAY9	The families of the London Bridge victims are owed an answer	The horror of the terrorist attacks on London Bridge two years ago was recalled at the Old Bailey yesterday as the inquest into the eight people who died got under way. These were mostly young foreign nationals out on a warm June evening in a vibrant part of Europe’s biggest city. To have their lives cut short in this way during what the coroner called 10 minutes of “high and terrible drama” was truly appalling. It followed the bombing of a pop concert in Manchester and the attack on Westminster Bridge just weeks earlier. The inquest heard heart-wrenching tributes from the relatives of the dead and will be reminded of the heroism of people who confronted the knife-wielding terrorists and the police who acted before armed officers shot dead the three jihadists.
MAY9	Letters: Even Brussels did not believe Theresa May could stay on after losing Conservative support	SIR – The revelations in BBC Four’s Brexit: Behind Closed Doors came thick and fast from Guy Verhofstadt. But, despite easily outmanoeuvring our incompetent team, the EU side got one thing wrong. They speculated that following Theresa May’s loss of her majority at the general election she would be gone within two hours as “the Tories are f---ing ruthless”. Since then she’s survived a no-confidence vote, lost 1,300 councillors at the local elections, will be trounced at EU elections that she only recently told us would not go ahead, and been given another week to provide the 1922 Committee with a departure date.
MAY9	Letters: The Conservatives have shelved their manifesto commitment on Brexit	SIR – On Tuesday morning I received a leaflet from the Conservative Party, which says that Theresa May is working tirelessly to pass a workable deal that takes back control of our borders; leaves the Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy; and protects jobs, security and our United Kingdom. I note that the deal will not allow us to leave the customs union, as promised in the 2017 Conservative election manifesto. Alan Cox Belper, Derbyshire
MAY10	Of course Simon Armitage will be a good poet laureate – he's been doing it for years	When Simon Armitage was announced on Friday night as our new poet laureate, for most people – including Armitage himself – it felt like business as usual. It’s easy to imagine him as “The English Astronaut” in his poem of that name, who shrugs off his triumphant homecoming to settle down with a Little Chef breakfast and a crossword. If the role of a laureate is to write poetry that aims to speak to the country as directly as possible, Armitage has been plugging away it for decades. On television, he has repeatedly given voice to the voiceless: Britain’s traumatised war veterans in The Not Dead, the murdered goth Sophie Lancaster in Black Roses; a decrepit Rochdale housing estate in Xanadu. But if you were looking for a future laureate among the Britpoppy “New Generation” of poets grouped together 25 years ago, Armitage was by no means the obvious choice – and not just because that line-up also included Carol Ann Duffy. He didn’t have the debonair style of the late Michael Donaghy, or the effortless lyricism of Don Paterson.
MAY10	These are the first European elections in history to feel enthusiastic about	My apologies for recent absence from this space: I have been attempting to finish my late Thatcher studies. As a result of this temporary detachment, it has been easier to discern a deeper pattern in the repetitious deadlock in Parliament and the astonishing fact that we are now about to take part in elections for a European Parliament in which we do not intend to sit. This pattern first became visible 30 years ago. But before I explain this, did you see Brexit: Behind Closed Doors on Wednesday and Thursday nights? Probably not, since it was on BBC 4, and your idea of fun may not involve being trapped in the colourless offices of the European Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg for two hours. As theatre, the programme resembled the famous line and stage direction of Waiting for Godot, “ ‘Let’s go.’ They do not move.” The film was a fly-on-the-wall documentary following Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit Coordinator, from the start of the Brexit negotiations until now. Despite his august title, M Verhofstadt is not coordinating Brexit. If the documentary had a fault, it was that the fly was on the wrong wall. The European Parliament – thank goodness – has only a secondary role. The right walls to be on are those of the European Commission, watching Michel Barnier, Jean-Claude Juncker etc, those of Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron and those of 10 Downing Street. M Verhofstadt may seek the coveted crown of best-known Belgian since Tintin, but he is little more than a noisy spectator.
MAY10	The only thing that can save the wretched Tory party now is a grassroots guerrilla war	The pathetic recent performance of that affable but anaemic band of agitators, the Brexiteers in Parliament, may have left many of us Leavers infuriated. But, contrary to popular view, their moment has not "passed". It is "now". As Theresa May threatens to go out in a fireball of burnt-up red lines and purse-lipped arrogance, the Tories’ credibility is being incinerated. Meanwhile, an insurgent Brexit Party has snatched the mantle of the “people’s voice”. As Nigel Farage gnashes his teeth, ready to rip fatal chunks out of our ailing two-party system, the damage could be permanent. But at the moment when their country and party need them more than ever, Brexiteer MPs have bottled it. Now the heat is really on, most have been struck down with the most bizarre, self-indulgent bout of fatalism. With a luxuriating sigh, they lament that there is “nothing to be done” about stubborn Mrs May. They are irrationally terror-stricken by cunning but bluffing Remainers like Amber Rudd who threaten to bring down the Government if a Brexiteer takes over. Worst of all, they have allowed themselves to be bullied into flogging the booby-trapped Withdrawal Agreement. The noble ideologues of Middle England have become disillusioned, suburban estate agents, slimily reconciled to scamming the public.
MAY10	The French are welcome to Land Rover – ever since it got rid of the Defender, the wheels have fallen off	The Range Rover has long inspired the French, being the first car ever exhibited as a work of art at the Louvre. Soon, though, they might own the brand. Jaguar Land Rover, part of Tata Motors since 2008, has announced a tie-up with, and possible sale to, the French PSA Group, makers of Peugeot and Citroen. It is tempting to go all weepy-eyed over an event many will see as a nail in the coffin of a great British industrial icon. But then I think of all those poor Land Rover drivers reading this as they await a breakdown truck. If the outside lane is often nicknamed the “BMW lane”, the hard shoulder should be named the “Land Rover lane”. What PSA will be picking up is a sad remnant of a once-great automotive icon. Last year’s What Car? reliability survey, which follows the experiences of 18,000 motorists, told us yet again what numerous other questionnaires have revealed over the years. The Range Rover, Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Discovery filled respectively places two, four and five on the list of least-reliable cars, with the Range Rover only beaten into second place by Tesla.
MAY10	Sacred Mysteries: Stairs worn to a sea of rounded marble waves	No pilgrim has come to Rome without wanting to visit the Holy Stairs. So, on their website, say the custodians of this strange staircase, better known as the Scala Sancta. I’m afraid it had never crossed my mind to visit them, though now I am filled with curiosity to do so. What has changed my mind is the accidental beauty of these 28 marble steps up to a chapel in what used to be the papal palace at St John Lateran in Rome. I think most people like the appearance of old steps worn down by generations of feet. A beautiful example is at Wells Cathedral, where stone steps curve off from the main flight into the door of the Chapter House. A celebrated view was caught in a photograph from 1903 by Frederick Evans, called by him A Sea of Steps.
MAY10	101 calls should be free for everyone	In a victory for this newspaper, Vodafone has announced that it will no longer charge for 101 calls made on pay-as-you-go contracts - and the Home Office has said it will hold a review. This is an excellent start and we can tell Sajid Javid now what his report ought to conclude, namely that there is no reason why anyone on any contract with any company should have to pay to report a crime. At present these calls cost 15p and the Treasury takes 20 per cent VAT from them. By contrast, 111 calls for non‑emergency health advice are free, as is a 105 call to report a power cut. So why should anyone be hit by a flat‑rate fee for reporting a crime?
MAY10	Labour and the Tories are ignoring the warning signs of profound electoral change	Labour now pledges a customs union Brexit if it can get it, a general election if it can’t, or a second referendum if that doesn’t work either. One would imagine that offering something to everyone would make them very popular. The polls, however, don’t look good. The country can see through Labour’s demand for a permanent customs union, which the Tories probably won’t give them, MPs might not even endorse and the EU is likely to reject. Jeremy Corbyn’s real strategy is to talk and talk and let the Government take the blame for inaction, but it’s not winning many votes.
MAY10	Britain must stand with the United States against the ayatollahs of Iran	For America’s top emissary, Mike Pompeo has been carving a distinctly undiplomatic path through Europe these past few days. The US Secretary of State angered the Germans by cancelling a visit to Berlin at the last minute, leaving Chancellor Angela Merkel fuming and plunging relations between the two countries into the deep freeze. Mr Pompeo then moved on to London, where he reignited the row over the UK’s relationship with the Chinese communications giant Huawei, even as the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, was in Beijing trying to build bridges with the regime.

Straight-talking is a characteristic of this US administration, taking its lead from the top; and the fact is Mr Pompeo was right in much of what he said. The UK does need to consider very carefully whether inviting Huawei to provide 5G mobile technology is worth losing crucial intelligence co-operation with its closest ally.

MAY10	Letters: The Conservatives have shelved their manifesto commitment on Brexit	SIR – On Tuesday morning I received a leaflet from the Conservative Party, which says that Theresa May is working tirelessly to pass a workable deal that takes back control of our borders; leaves the Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy; and protects jobs, security and our United Kingdom. I note that the deal will not allow us to leave the customs union, as promised in the 2017 Conservative election manifesto. Alan Cox Belper, Derbyshire
MAY11	No, Amber Rudd. The next PM must recognise HS2 for the wasteful vanity project it really is	The past year has seen a number of hammer blows to the public’s perception of HS2. Despite this, last week both George Osborne and Amber Rudd threw their support behind pushing ahead with the project. Rudd even went so far as to say that any new PM must fully commit to HS2, saying it was a “very good example of thinking long term”. Turning that into non-emotive language: they must believe the return on investment will be beneficial to the UK. Really? In 2010, the original forecast cost of HS2 was £32.7 billion. Since then we have seen costs rise in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The official price tag is now a staggering £56 billion. From my five years as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, and after seeing costs overrun on project after project, this is hardly surprising. Big government schemes invariably massively overspend – one economist characterised this as the “iron law of megaprojects: over budget, over time, over and over again”.
MAY11	Theresa May must go now if the Conservative Party is to survive	What is Jeremy Corbyn’s single most idiotic statement? It’s a crowded field, but his claim on Thursday that a second referendum could be “a healing process” is surely a strong contender. Since the 2016 vote, positions have tragically hardened on both sides. What began as a civil conversation has ended as something closer to a civil war. Reasonable arguments about trade, sovereignty and budgets have descended into a ghastly kulturkampf. Leavers are dismissed as dim-witted oiks led astray by demagogues. Remainers are caricatured as self-satisfied snobs who despise their own country. Language that used to be considered beyond the pale – “traitors”, “Nazis”, “saboteurs” – is now habitually employed by MPs. The coarsening of our public discourse has been so sudden and so total that when, on Thursday, the Liberal Democrats made “B------- to Brexit” their official slogan, hardly anyone batted an eyelid. Does Jezza truly think we should go through the whole process again? Despite all the promises made in the run-up to the 2016 vote – made especially aggressively by Remainers – that there would never be a second referendum? Despite Labour’s manifesto commitment in 2017 to implement the result? Does he want to rerun all the arguments that divided families and sundered friendships? Is that his idea of “healing”?
MAY11	We'll be stuck with only career politicians if we object to MPs taking second jobs	Dr Lotay Tshering – reportedly one of Bhutan’s most highly regarded doctors – can only work as a surgeon on Saturdays. The rest of the week he is busy running the Himalayan country, which held its first general election a decade ago. Dr Tshering is the prime minister of Bhutan. This story, which emerged last week, left me a little bit jealous. Here we are, stuck with a Prime Minister who barely seems able to do her day job, while Dr Tshering appears to be successfully juggling two rather important ones, if the reports are to be believed. There comes a stage in every dysfunctional relationship – and the British public’s current relationship with its elected representatives is nothing if not dysfunctional – where one asks oneself: is it me? Do I attract the wrong kind of people by sending out mixed messages?
MAY11	Voters are now powerless in the face of our post-democratic Remain elites	You read it here first. Some weeks ago (or maybe it was months, I’ve lost track of time), this column presented a step-by-step trajectory for Remain forces to deliver the stop-Brexit plan that so many of them had been confidently predicting (“This is never going to happen…”) since June 2016. First would come an admission from Downing Street that the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement would never get parliamentary approval. Thus, the only available recourse would be another series of indicative votes, which was to come this time with a promise that the result would be binding: the final decision on our exit from the European Union would be handed to Parliament itself. The last time we held indicative votes, the option that came closest (indeed, breathlessly close) to gaining a majority was a “deal” that involved a permanent customs union. So it seemed most likely that, this time, such a proposition would be the winner.
MAY11	Cambridge has become the epicentre of the 'wokeness' epidemic plaguing our universities	From outside their gates, all institutions look monolithic. The Foreign Office, large multinationals, universities - all conjure up ideas of slow, endlessly resisted change. In fact all institutions are in flux. And never more so than today, when the whole underpinnings of our societies and morality are up for grabs. In recent years the ideology known as “wokeness” has ridden through public and private institutions. Government departments are duty bound to pursue “diversity” as an objective in itself, which in practice means a pursuit of quotas that prioritise a person’s characteristics over their ability. Heads of major corporations and departments talk about “intersectionality” and other creations of the ideological far-Left as though they will enrich their companies, rather than impoverish them.  Even the most hallowed institutions have shown themselves eager to be seen courting this disastrously ill-thought through ideology. Anyone in any doubt over that fact need only look behind the hallowed gates of Cambridge University. In recent months it has taken a set of decisions which make one of our foremost seats of learning look not just woke but weak.
MAY11	MPs' expenses: when will politicians learn?	This generation of politicians really should have studied the expenses scandal closely: many of them were elected in the wake of it, filling the empty shoes of men and women who stepped down or even went to prison. And yet the political class never seems to learn. Today we report that some MPs have been claiming thousands in taxpayers’ money for “dependent” children who are adults, do not regularly stay with them or otherwise should not qualify for extra cash.  This comes on the back of our reporting that 377 MPs have had their official credit cards suspended for breaking the rules on expenses – a number that includes nine Cabinet ministers and Jeremy Corbyn.  Claire Perry, to give one example, wrongly used her parliamentary credit card to pay for her Amazon Prime subscription. Today, we report that Ms Perry also claims an uplift to her accommodation budget for the cost of her children, even though one of them is 22. The expenses rules may have changed, but MPs are still being accused of breaking them and efforts are still being made to try to limit the information available to the public. It is clearly going to take a long time to remake the culture in Westminster. This newspaper will steadfastly publish whatever it discovers without fear or favour – because that is our job and our responsibility to our readers. Politicians are elected to represent; journalists are there to scrutinise. 
MAY11	China is riding a tiger	The West isn’t certain how to handle China. Some say what’s good for Beijing is good for everyone: its pro-market reforms have lifted millions of Chinese out of dire poverty and reduced prices across the globe. Donald Trump’s trade war is based upon a fundamental misunderstanding. Yes, Western jobs have gone to China; yes, China has flooded our markets with cheap imports. But China also provides a massive market for our services and industries – and, precisely because they are so cheap, Chinese imports lower costs for Western manufacturers. American car makers, for instance, rely heavily on steel and thus oppose tariffs. Mr Trump – the supreme deal maker – sees the world in clear-cut terms of winners and losers, but when it comes to trade, that’s not always how things work. Some industries, however, are strategic, which is where a serious problem emerges. China’s products are increasingly high quality and sophisticated, hence Huawei’s interest in helping Britain build its 5G network. It has the technology; it can probably underbid anyone else. But even if China is now an innovative capitalist economy, it remains a communist dictatorship in which the political and business elite are aligned. This is why some of our Five Eyes security partners have banned Huawei from parts of their communication networks: America, which is just as worried about security as jobs, doesn’t want its partners exposed to theft, espionage or even extortion by its Pacific rival. One could argue that everything China is accused of doing to the West, the West once did to China, that this is payback. It could also be said that China is simply returning to its historical position as the largest market in the world; some urge the West to swallow its pride and encourage, not challenge, this resurgent power. But how much longer can China’s authoritarian experiment really continue? It relies on growth, which has been fast, but at the cost of enormous disparities in wealth and the continued suppression of free speech. To quell dissatisfaction, the state has fallen back on Maoist rhetoric twinned with nationalism, along with locking up minority groups, all of which alienates the very Western partners necessary for economic progress.
MAY11	101 calls should be free for everyone	In a victory for this newspaper, Vodafone has announced that it will no longer charge for 101 calls made on pay-as-you-go contracts - and the Home Office has said it will hold a review. This is an excellent start and we can tell Sajid Javid now what his report ought to conclude, namely that there is no reason why anyone on any contract with any company should have to pay to report a crime. At present these calls cost 15p and the Treasury takes 20 per cent VAT from them. By contrast, 111 calls for non‑emergency health advice are free, as is a 105 call to report a power cut. So why should anyone be hit by a flat‑rate fee for reporting a crime?
MAY11	Letters: Theresa May is pursuing a Brexit policy that runs directly against the wishes of the electorate	SIR – We saw losses in the local elections that exceeded the worst fears of Conservative leaders. These were predictable. So, sadly, was the response from Theresa May and her advisers. It has been to stick their fingers in their ears, ignore the message from voters and her own party, and carry on attempting to fudge, compromise, and postpone Brexit until the opportunity to leave the EU at all is entirely eaten away. The policy Theresa May is pursuing runs directly against the wishes of the electorate as expressed in the biggest public vote in history and in the backing for our manifesto commitments at the last election. Voters could not be clearer in saying how angry and betrayed they feel – Conservative voters most of all. The damage that this is doing to party and country is incalculable.
MAY11	Letters: It may be rude to ask, but we must know when Theresa May will go	SIR – He might have been impolite, but I salute Stuart Davies (Comment, May 10) for his courage in heckling Theresa May at the Welsh Conservatives’ recent conference in Llangollen. What was jaw-dropping for me were the other incidents at that meeting: the Prime Minster’s reaction to the welcoming polite applause (a faux-modest gesture, “No, no, you mustn’t applaud me just because I deserve it”), followed by a standing ovation at the end. In the name of sanity, what for? Colin Drury Dinas Powys, Glamorgan
MAY12	Corbyn-style socialism will never provide the resources our precious NHS needs	I wish you could have been with me the other day when they showed me round the mental health facilities in my constituency in Uxbridge. You would have found it impossible not to have been moved. There was a toddler, a little girl, who had been born with a complex neurological condition – not unlike cerebral palsy – which was so severe that at first the doctors had held out little hope of improvement.  She was sitting on the floor of a warm, bright room, decorated with colourful prints. She wore special spectacles, and a brace on her arm to help her co-ordination. On one side of her on the mat was her mother, and on the other was a young man – a therapist trained in dealing with exactly this kind of syndrome. In front of the toddler was a kind of Fisher-Price toy.  Slowly, painstakingly, she was picking up an orange ball and putting it on a plastic slide so that it could run down through a tunnel and out again. Her mother was beaming with absolute delight because she was starting to get it right. With every session, the little girl was gaining accuracy and strength in her limbs. She couldn’t do it last week, her mother explained, and now she could. 
MAY12	If the NHS truly cared it would do something about the awful quality of hospital car parks	For the last month, my father has been seriously ill in a hospital near us. Between us, my sister, my brother and I have visited more than once every day. I have therefore become an expert on the hospital car park. I have no wish to single the hospital out by naming it. It is a general hospital in a fairly poor south-eastern town. Its overall reputation is neither very high nor very low. My father is receiving good medical and nursing attention. I just want to talk about the car park. From the anecdotes of others, I suspect it is typical of hospitals everywhere. First, it is fairly expensive. In a town where parking is often free, it charges £1.70 for the first full hour and £1.50 thereafter, night and day, nearly a fifth of the minimum wage. 
MAY12	Technology is our only hope of escaping the rising tide of eco totalitarianism	Here is a prediction for you: a British government will one day try to ban meat. Not content with entreaties to cut down for health reasons (the “meat is the new tobacco” argument), forces are massing to declare the rearing of animals for eating an environmental catastrophe. This isn’t about animal welfare: if meat were banned, there would be no point to these animals existing. It is the logical conclusion of a strand of thinking that says tradition, livelihoods and pleasure should always be sacrificed if the result can somehow be construed as “saving the planet”. If you think this far-fetched, consider what is happening to cars, where all new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned by 2040. Or farming in general, where useful tools for managing the land, like killing pests, are forbidden because someone influential had a primitive fantasy of returning the country to the wild. Eco-campaigners have no respect for contrary arguments, and politicians are desperate for their approval. Aside from their obsession with abstract virtue, what they betray is a lack of optimism. For slowly but surely, old rationales for such heavy-handed moves are being destroyed by advances in technology. This is most obvious in the case of cars. The rise of the electric vehicle has been extraordinary, albeit partly spurred by punishing other drivers. They require enormous improvement – not least a proper network of charging stations and an assurance that the grid can handle the new demand – but the promise is as much intellectual as environmental. How could anyone object to driving if cars produce none of the direct pollution, are quieter, and the electric alternatives reach a point where they match the performance of petrol and diesel? The only reason there is not widespread disquiet at the 2040 ban is because of consumer optimism that a competitive market will come up with a solution by then.
MAY12	Critics mock Roger Scruton, but he wrote a literary masterpiece	Rarely is an overtly political book also a literary masterpiece. Bagehot’s The English Constitution, famous for defining the functions of the monarch, is one. James Fitzjames Stephen’s Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, remarkable for its wit and its reasoned defence of Pontius Pilate, is another. Both were published around 150 years ago. A far more recent example, from 2000, is Roger Scruton’s England: An Elegy. “What follows is a memorial address,” he begins. “I speak of England as I knew it, not as the country might appear to the historian.” The book is about “the civilisation that made me and is now passing from the world”. Scruton makes “an attempt to understand, from a philosophical perspective, what we are losing as our form of life decays”. In the first 10 of its 11 chapters, he tries to define what England and Englishness actually are, laced with fragments of autobiography, devoting chapters to facets of the national idea: the English character, religion, law, society, government, culture and countryside. The autobiographical elements underpin his method, because much of what he writes about he witnessed, growing up in Buckinghamshire in the Fifties, and he laments the speed at which the values and way of life he prized have disappeared, usually without the consultation of the English people.
MAY12	It's no good companies being 'woke' when their customers are all Brexiteer Tories	Marks & Spencer’s recent launch of a lettuce, guacamole, bacon and tomato sandwich – an “LGBT” sandwich – to celebrate Gay Pride met with widespread derision. Despite committing revenue raised from the sandwich’s sales to LGBT charities, some criticised M&S for exploiting the Pride brand for profits, while others said it amounted to pointless virtue signalling. Like the sandwich itself, the launch was messy. A large proportion of M&S’s customers will have seen the controversy, but tiny numbers will have been genuinely irritated. It’s not the Fifties; the overwhelming majority of the public is rightly supportive of gay rights. But while few will have been annoyed, it is hard to imagine M&S’s older, suburban, small-c conservative customers racing to their local store to support the cause and buy one. It will have passed them by. A similarly misplaced campaign was launched by frozen food retailer Iceland last autumn. Teaming up with Greenpeace to call for a restriction on the use of palm oil to protect the habitat of endangered orang-utans, they secured a blaze of positive coverage. But the campaign failed to turn publicity into sales and Iceland’s performance in the all-important Christmas period was flat. Its customers – urban, poorer, working class – will not have reacted with hostility; like M&S shoppers, they will likely have been indifferent.
MAY12	The Conservative Party faces a Canada-style death-blow	The Conservative Party faces electoral annihilation. According to our bombshell poll, if there were a general election tomorrow, they would get just 19 per cent of the vote – their worst result in history, far worse than the 29 per cent they received in 1832, hitherto the lowest. They would lose 139 seats, including those held by many household names. The Brexit Party would do remarkably well with 20 per cent, an astonishing second place that secures them 49 seats – but, thanks to our first-past-the-post system, not enough to form an anti-Labour coalition. Jeremy Corbyn would become leader of a minority government or a far-Left coalition with the SNP. The centre-Right electorate would be almost perfectly divided. The Tories would wave goodbye to the economy, goodbye to Brexit and goodbye to the Union. The incredible thing is that the Conservative leadership seems oblivious. Theresa May refuses to resign despite her unpopularity. She has asked Mr Corbyn to help save her deal; she is willing to sign off on a temporary customs union, despite its economic insanity and the opposition of any Eurosceptic worth their salt. And most of the Tories vying to replace her are still reaching out to a centre ground that doesn’t exist any more, especially when it comes to leaving the EU, because a country is either in or out of it. Brexit has changed everything except the Conservatives. Too many of them are still working from the Blairite playbook, convinced they can only win the country by repudiating the values of their most loyal supporters, all the while convinced, with the arrogance of centuries, that here in Britain things never change that much and a great party like theirs can never die. But of course it can. Take the 1993 election in Canada, when the centre-Right coalition of the Progressive Conservatives shattered. The party was hit by the early Nineties global recession, of course, but they made matters worse by endorsing an unpopular goods and services tax, wrecking further their reputation on the economy. A new, more Right-wing party arose in Western Canada that more or less split their vote in half. The PC tried to save things by changing leader, but the damage was done: on election night they collapsed from 156 seats to just two. The rival Liberal Party held power for 13 years, and Canada’s centre-Right only clawed its way back by forging a new, more dynamically Conservative political bloc.
MAY12	MPs' expenses: when will politicians learn?	This generation of politicians really should have studied the expenses scandal closely: many of them were elected in the wake of it, filling the empty shoes of men and women who stepped down or even went to prison. And yet the political class never seems to learn. Today we report that some MPs have been claiming thousands in taxpayers’ money for “dependent” children who are adults, do not regularly stay with them or otherwise should not qualify for extra cash.  This comes on the back of our reporting that 377 MPs have had their official credit cards suspended for breaking the rules on expenses – a number that includes nine Cabinet ministers and Jeremy Corbyn.  Claire Perry, to give one example, wrongly used her parliamentary credit card to pay for her Amazon Prime subscription. Today, we report that Ms Perry also claims an uplift to her accommodation budget for the cost of her children, even though one of them is 22. The expenses rules may have changed, but MPs are still being accused of breaking them and efforts are still being made to try to limit the information available to the public. It is clearly going to take a long time to remake the culture in Westminster. This newspaper will steadfastly publish whatever it discovers without fear or favour – because that is our job and our responsibility to our readers. Politicians are elected to represent; journalists are there to scrutinise. 
MAY12	China is riding a tiger	The West isn’t certain how to handle China. Some say what’s good for Beijing is good for everyone: its pro-market reforms have lifted millions of Chinese out of dire poverty and reduced prices across the globe. Donald Trump’s trade war is based upon a fundamental misunderstanding. Yes, Western jobs have gone to China; yes, China has flooded our markets with cheap imports. But China also provides a massive market for our services and industries – and, precisely because they are so cheap, Chinese imports lower costs for Western manufacturers. American car makers, for instance, rely heavily on steel and thus oppose tariffs. Mr Trump – the supreme deal maker – sees the world in clear-cut terms of winners and losers, but when it comes to trade, that’s not always how things work. Some industries, however, are strategic, which is where a serious problem emerges. China’s products are increasingly high quality and sophisticated, hence Huawei’s interest in helping Britain build its 5G network. It has the technology; it can probably underbid anyone else. But even if China is now an innovative capitalist economy, it remains a communist dictatorship in which the political and business elite are aligned. This is why some of our Five Eyes security partners have banned Huawei from parts of their communication networks: America, which is just as worried about security as jobs, doesn’t want its partners exposed to theft, espionage or even extortion by its Pacific rival. One could argue that everything China is accused of doing to the West, the West once did to China, that this is payback. It could also be said that China is simply returning to its historical position as the largest market in the world; some urge the West to swallow its pride and encourage, not challenge, this resurgent power. But how much longer can China’s authoritarian experiment really continue? It relies on growth, which has been fast, but at the cost of enormous disparities in wealth and the continued suppression of free speech. To quell dissatisfaction, the state has fallen back on Maoist rhetoric twinned with nationalism, along with locking up minority groups, all of which alienates the very Western partners necessary for economic progress.
MAY12	Letters: Our complacent MPs should be prepared for a political earthquake	SIR – It is evident that Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party is on course to muck out the foul stables of Parliament – and jolly good luck to him. It is vital that we are rid of those politicians who have, at considerable cost to the country, contrived over three years to stall the delivery of what the EU referendum result demanded. We need fresh faces – people who are able and willing public servants. Lance Warrington Northleach, Gloucestershire

MAY13	Row over allegations of bullying exposes the cracks in a disunited SNP	The bitter row between Nicola Sturgeon and Joanna Cherry has taken the lid off the seething resentment that exists between the two distinct wings of the SNP – those who back the present First Minister and those, like Ms Cherry and many of the Westminster parliamentary group of 37 MPs, who are still avid supporters of former leader Alex Salmond.   The mask of a united party all pulling together to win independence for Scotland has well and truly slipped. The first blow in this civil war came when Ms Cherry, MP for Edinburgh South, who is also a QC and seen as an accomplished Commons performer, told the world how furious she is that accusations that she’d bullied staff were the result of “politically motivated smears arising from SNP infighting ”.
MAY13	Brian Walden's death reminds us of the lost art of the proper TV interview	His lengthy inquisitions of politicians performed a vital public service that is missing today The death of Brian Walden is a moment to  remember a man who was an eloquent parliamentarian, a brilliant broadcaster and always a fascinating person to meet. But his passing is also a time to lament the art of the lengthy, searching, forensic and ultimately revealing television interview, which disappeared as his career came  to an end. Instead we have an avalanche of tweets, an unending flow of “breaking news”, more channels than we can keep track of, and interviews of between three and eight minutes that move breathlessly from one slogan or soundbite to another. We can hear the same person give the same answer dozens of times but rarely find out what they say when cornered. We  find out in seconds when something happens but don’t learn why. We   have more news but less understanding; more noise but less clarity; more assertions but less explanation; more fleeting impressions of leaders but less chance to see them as they really are.
MAY13	Andrew Marr's obsession with my past betrays the bias at the heart of the BBC	I’m not the first person to have been on the receiving end of BBC bias, and I won’t be the last. But with an election campaign under way, I had expected our state broadcaster to behave responsibly in its coverage of this pivotal moment for democracy in Britain. Not a bit of it. On Sunday  I was on The Andrew Marr Show. I anticipated a tough and free-flowing interview about the Brexit Party, our candidates, their strikingly different backgrounds, our campaign, and the merits of MEPs and the EU elections. Instead, shortly after the interview began, Marr produced a piece of paper and started reading scripted questions relating to things I allegedly said or thought years ago – questions, by  the way, which I am certain I have been asked by others on many previous occasions. I am well aware of the saying “For a politician to complain about the press is like a ship’s captain complaining about the sea”. But I genuinely thought Marr wanted to learn more on behalf of BBC viewers about what is happening now rather than focusing on positions I reportedly took a long time ago. I am not scared to discuss the past; I just happen to believe that the present and future are more urgent. Britain is politically paralysed. The stakes could not be higher.
MAY13	Thanks to the Brexit Party, the Conservatives can expect their worst ever result next week	The Brexit Party looks set to drain the Tories' Eurosceptic base, though Labour are struggling too There have been plenty of previous challenges to the electoral grip of the Conservatives and Labour. The Liberal Democrats have long been snapping at their heels, regularly winning around a fifth of the vote until they entered the 2010-15 Coalition. In the last Euro-election in 2014 Ukip shocked the political establishment by coming first. Scotland is now a SNP fiefdom. However, until now these challenges have occurred separately, not in combination. Ukip’s challenge coincided with a collapse in the Liberal Democrat vote. The SNP does not threaten the two main parties south of the border. Now, though, with the Brexit impasse still unresolved, the two big parties find themselves under challenge from all sides at once.
MAY13	Sorry Boris, we can't keep throwing money at an unreformed NHS	It's time we had a rational conversation about this sacred cow In the age of populist uprisings, stark political divides and Brexit madness, there is still one thing that unites virtually all MPs across the spectrum – their utter denial about the state of the National Health Service. Our politicians are happy to debate welfare policy, weigh up the results of free schools, and duke it out over the top tax rate. They are willing to resign from the Cabinet or even their party over whether and in what form the UK should leave the European Union. But when it comes to the NHS, there is no debate to be had, nothing critical to say, not even a targeted area that can be highlighted for meaningful reform...
MAY13	Until the health service's structural problems are addressed it will lurch from crisis to crisis	Our report showing that claims for negligence against the NHS have risen dramatically is further evidence that simply pouring more cash into the system is not good enough. Politicians are always seeking to outbid each other with how much they are prepared to commit to the health service as though it is their money rather than that of the people who actually use it. We pay not for a nebulous idea that can be extolled as the “envy of the world”, but for something that works properly and helps us when we need it. As it is currently constituted, the NHS does not do this and has not done so for years. Access to the acute care system is jealously guarded by GPs, who effectively act as gatekeepers to weed out people who do not need to go into the expensive bit of the NHS. But getting to see them is becoming more difficult and puts off people who might actually have something wrong with them.
MAY13	Political parties who fail to respect democracy will suffer the consequences	Nigel Farage asked during a dyspeptic exchange with the BBC's Andrew Marr: "What about democracy?” It was a good question and one that is dominating the run-up to the election that was never meant to happen – next week’s contest for the European parliament. Or at least it is in the world beyond Westminster. Our MPs, by contrast, continue to obsess about customs unions, cross-party talks that are going nowhere, further votes on deals already rejected three times and a second referendum before the outcome of the first has been honoured. It is about democracy; and the Brexit issue has settled in the minds of many people on that very straightforward concept. Mr Farage’s party is   ahead in the polls because it has that central point at its core.
MAY13	The Conservative Party faces a Canada-style death-blow	The Conservative Party faces electoral annihilation. According to our bombshell poll, if there were a general election tomorrow, they would get just 19 per cent of the vote – their worst result in history, far worse than the 29 per cent they received in 1832, hitherto the lowest.

MAY14	Nigel Farage is now Britain's most influential politician - and Theresa May's worst nightmare	If you were asked to name, as I was recently, the most influential politician of the past 40 years, who would it be? My immediate response was Margaret Thatcher since she changed so much that had previously been taken for granted. But coming in second must be Nigel Farage, given the shattering impact Brexit has had on our national politics. It is a different sort of influence, of course. While Mrs T brought about far-reaching reforms that have affected the lives of millions – from presiding over City deregulation and the privatisation of the utilities to removing the power of the trade unions to hold the nation to ransom – Farage has been disruptive. He has become a lightning rod for the grievances of millions of voters fed up with mainstream politicians, just as Donald Trump is in America. Few politicians of the past 100 years have had such an impact without being in the government or having the support of a mainstream party. Pre-war Churchill arguing, almost alone, for rearmament or Joseph Chamberlain pushing his imperial preference prospectus are among the handful that come close. But it is hard to think of anyone in British political history who has wielded such influence from outside the system.
MAY14	Provoking a fresh confrontation with the West is a dangerous strategy for a weakened Iran	It should hardly come as a surprise that, the moment Iran’s clerical regime finds itself under pressure at home, it tries to divert the attention of the country’s restless populace by raising the prospect of a fresh confrontation with the West. It is a tactic that has been used many times before since the ayatollahs came to power in 1979. The US Embassy crisis in the early 1980s, for example, when Tehran held 52 American diplomats and civilians hostage for a total of 444 days, was a classic example of the ayatollahs using an international incident to divert attention away from concerns closer to home which, in that particular case, were related to the regime’s brutal repression of its political opponents. It was a similar scenario at the end of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s when it became clear Tehran was going to end up on the losing side, and the Revolutionary Guard began mining the shipping lanes of the Strait of Hormuz. The prospect of the world’s energy supplies facing serious interruption prompted the intervention of the US Fifth fleet, supported by the Royal Navy, thereby enabling the ayatollahs to blame their defeat on the infidel West, rather than their own military ineptitude.
MAY14	The PM is wreaking irreparable damage on her party - so why are Tory MPs still reluctant to oust her?	Paralysed by Brexit and unable to replace the hapless PM, the Conservative Party must act soon The country is being led by a leader and Cabinet who would make even Nero blush. As the Brexit paralysis continues and the Tory poll rating collapses, ministers are busying themselves taking snipes at one another and positioning themselves for a job that may soon turn out to be a poisoned chalice. They are all too content to take a tip from the Roman emperor and fiddle while the party burns. As of last weekend, the Brexit Party have overtaken the Tories not only on European Parliament voting intention but – in a poll for this newspaper – general election polling. Not that anyone walking around the Palace of Westminster would get a sense of the peril the Tory party now finds itself in.
MAY14	Jeremy Kyle was trashy, embarrassing and exploitative – but he was only giving audiences what they wanted	The Jeremy Kyle show – where addiction, infidelity and unhappiness collide with the cameras – now faces an uncertain future. After a guest on the programme recently took his own life, ITV suspended filming and, tellingly, wiped all existing episodes from its online player. The treatment of Steve Dymond, a 63-year-old digger driver, had followed a well-worn format. Mr Dymond had taken a lie detector test – a staple of the show – in order to convince his girlfriend that he hadn’t been unfaithful. He failed the test, however, and they split up. There, sadly, things departed from the script: shortly afterwards he was found dead. Yet this is not the first time in which ITV "reality television" has been linked to tragedy. In March, Mike Thalassitis, 26, who appeared on the hugely popular show Love Island, was found hanged in a London park, while another former contestant, Sophie Gradon, 32, an ex-Miss Great Britain, hanged herself last June following heavy use of drugs and alcohol. Yet Love Island – an enormous ratings hit – seems set to continue undented. The fifth season begins next month, with some promise of improved psychological “aftercare” for contestants. For many young people growing up today, confessional chat shows and "reality television" are part of a wider culture that revels in watching ordinary people in situations likely to cause them embarrassment, anxiety and pain. I can remember, however, back when this approach to programme-making was in its infancy. The first "Big Brother," for example, in 2000 – with its revolutionary idea of filming contestants 24-hours a day – featured a relatively normal, intelligent group of housemates in low-level domestic power struggles. With time, the producers sought ever higher concentrations of drama, sex and fights, and structured the show (and choice of contestants) accordingly. By the third series, the late Jade Goody – a housemate with a difficult upbringing – had been gleefully dubbed “The Pig” by the tabloid press. The fifth series was sold with the pre-publicity “Big Brother Gets Evil”. By the time the lucrative experiment was wound up in 2018, it had become one long, unwatchable screech.
MAY14	Theresa May and her ministers still want to deliver Brexit, but do not know how	Despair is reportedly mounting in Cabinet about what is the point of Theresa May's talks with Labour. So after a longer-than-expected two-hour discussion this morning, what do they have to show for it? No plug has been pulled, despite Mrs May's past attempts to force a decisive result to the talks by last week. Instead, ministers have agreed that talks can carry on "to see what was possible", as the Prime Minister's spokesman put it.  Even if nothing proves possible in these talks, ministers want to show the Government is getting on with Brexit by trying to get a deal through in the only way still open to them in this parliament: passing the withdrawal agreement bill. They agreed it was "imperative" to do so in time so it could be in law by the summer parliamentary recess.
MAY14	Jeremy Hunt needs to spell out where he would find the extra money for defence	No senior Conservative can make a policy pronouncement nowadays without it being seen as a contribution to an undeclared leadership bid. With Theresa May’s days clearly numbered, her colleagues are anxious to catch the attention of MPs and party activists for the battle to come. Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary and one of the favourites to succeed, was happy to use the annual Mansion House speech to set out his stall. The speech is traditionally a tour d’horizon of global politics and a review of the UK’s place in the world. To a great extent this is currently defined by Brexit and the uncertainty over Britain’s priorities when we leave the EU. Mr Hunt, a Remain supporter who has become a Brexiteer, foresaw a continued pivotal role for the UK in global affairs post-Brexit, and said: “If we want a central position on the world stage, we must earn it.” But we must also pay for it. Mr Hunt was right to identify spending on defence as a priority in order to strengthen our “hard power”. Much emphasis has recently been placed on so-called soft power, whereby a country’s influence is exerted principally through diplomacy and aid spending.
MAY14	We can all do something to help our nation's flora and fauna thrive	For many readers who love the countryside, or live in towns and encourage birds and other wildlife into their gardens, the decline in some species is unarguable and troubling. How many of us remember animals, insects and flowers that we simply no longer see in the same numbers, if at all? The hedgehog, once a common visitor, has vanished from many areas. Changes to the way people manage their gardens, with artificial lawns and no wild areas, may be to blame; so might the liberal use of slug pellets. Certain butterflies, birds, amphibians and reptiles, especially lizards, have all but disappeared from places where they were once commonplace. Who has failed to notice how the insects that would once have accumulated on the car windscreen during a long drive are no longer there? We begin a short series today charting this decline but with some advice on how it might be arrested or reversed.
MAY14	Until the health service's structural problems are addressed it will lurch from crisis to crisis	Our report showing that claims for negligence against the NHS have risen dramatically is further evidence that simply pouring more cash into the system is not good enough. Politicians are always seeking to outbid each other with how much they are prepared to commit to the health service as though it is their money rather than that of the people who actually use it. We pay not for a nebulous idea that can be extolled as the “envy of the world”, but for something that works properly and helps us when we need it. As it is currently constituted, the NHS does not do this and has not done so for years. Access to the acute care system is jealously guarded by GPs, who effectively act as gatekeepers to weed out people who do not need to go into the expensive bit of the NHS. But getting to see them is becoming more difficult and puts off people who might actually have something wrong with them.
MAY14	Letters: The search for a leader to bring the Conservatives back from the brink	  SIR – Tim Stanley  is spot-on: we have a potential prime minister. He is someone who has hands-on experience of running London government in an otherwise Labour city, and of leading the Foreign Office; who has personal experience of the Brussels labyrinth, and who is optimistic, globalist, free-enterprise, liberal, with confidence in the future of a free Britain. He is Boris Johnson.
MAY14	Letters: Why frustrated Conservatives are going to vote for the Brexit Party	SIR – I have better things to do on Sunday mornings than watch Andrew Marr, but I gather Damian Hinds said on Sunday’s programme that the EU elections were likely to be a gigantic protest vote and that they would be difficult for the Government. If he and his colleagues simply regard their thrashing next week as a protest vote, the Conservative Party is finished. I don’t like Nigel Farage and I have never been tempted to vote for Ukip, but I am certainly going to vote for the Brexit Party on Thursday week. And unless there is a major change at the top of the Tory party (not just Theresa May but the Lidingtons, Gaukes and Rudds and the rest), I shall never vote Conservative in a Westminster election again.
MAY15	Jeremy Corbyn, not Brexit, is the true threat to our economic prosperity	After years of flirting with the idea, we’ve finally seen Labour’s plans to renationalise the energy industry. As always, far from being a panacea, this shiny, expensive policy would turn out to be a disaster. We can rehearse the arguments about why privatisation works and nationalisation doesn’t. From supermarkets to mobile phone providers, having more choice is good. It forces firms to take their customers’ views seriously, punishes those who take them for granted, and creates openings for upstarts to come through with a better product at a lower price. Just like all companies, energy firms compete with each other to offer the best price and service. There is more to do, but our reforms mean it has never been easier to switch supplier.
MAY15	The Tories are deluded if they think the Brexit Party can't supplant them	Leadership contenders are still obsessed with appealing to the centre – but politics has changed Nothing to see here: risibly, that remains how many senior Tories view the remarkable rise of the Brexit Party. To them, Nigel Farage’s return is a spectacular but ultimately meaningless final act, a last howl of rage by an angry minority exercising its right to protest at an irrelevant election. But a real, serious, game-changing threat to the political duopoly that has governed the UK for so long? Don’t be ridiculous. There is something in the Conservative psyche that breeds this kind of deranged complacency: the conceit that theirs is the “natural party of government” is especially toxic. Many of the candidates for the party leadership, and not just the Remainers, genuinely believe that the ongoing political earthquake is in fact nothing more than a minor tremor.
MAY15	The PM's legacy could soon be the Conservative Party's destruction	History is littered with the remnants of long-established political parties having been annihilated at the ballot box. Anyone thinking it could never happen to them does so at their peril. Yet that smug, complacent attitude is, astonishingly, exactly what has been adopted by the Conservative Party leadership. Assuming that the old order will carry on, come what may, is a fatal mistake. One need only look at the long litany of electoral disasters across the world to see that. Christian Democracy in Italy, which supplied 26 of the 28 Italian Prime Ministers between 1946 and 1992, holding office for 40 of those 45 years, has disappeared.
MAY15	Why should Jeremy Corbyn bail out Theresa May? He can force an election by holding back	Theresa May is constantly accused of playing for time, a charge that often rings true, but what about her Labour rival? Jeremy Corbyn can't be accused of being any more decisive. Take his choice at Prime Minister's Questions today not to talk about Brexit, instead focusing his six questions on issues like inequality and poverty. Is that because he did not want to derail any spirit of compromise ahead of a potential cross-party deal, or because he knew it was doomed so wanted to whip up Labour voters ahead of an imminent election by bashing the Tories over some familiar areas? Only he will know for sure. That leaves everyone else to consider how the next steps of the Brexit process will play out, with Labour's eventual decision on how palatable the Government's deal could be playing a critical role.
MAY15	How did it all go so terribly wrong for Change UK?	The new party has ignored the important matter of timing Whether it’s the announcement of a new policy or even a resignation - politics, like comedy, is all about timing. And founding a new political party is such a haphazard and difficult venture that timing becomes even more important. Many were surprised when Chuka Umunna defected from the Labour Party along with six of his colleagues back in February. No one seriously doubted that such a move was on the cards and many considered it the right thing to do, given the reported unhappiness of most Labour MPs with a leadership that simply cannot be ousted or changed. But I doubt if I was alone in feeling that the occasion lacked a certain punch, like waiting eagerly for the last season of “Game of Thrones” and then… watching the last season of “Game of Thrones”.
MAY15	The Government child abuse inquiry must apply proper scrutiny to internet behemoths	The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse set up five years by Theresa May when she was Home Secretary is holding its second session of substantive hearings. The first in January 2018 considered the response of law enforcement agencies to abuse facilitated by the internet. The latest will examine whether the internet companies themselves have responded adequately to the exploitation of social media by those who prey on children. However, what was supposed to be a transparent process designed to learn lessons and expose cover-ups has become shrouded in secrecy. Facebook, Google, Apple, BT and Microsoft are being allowed to give evidence in camera because of the “sensitive nature” of the evidence. But it is not apparent whether it is to protect the victims or the corporate secrets of the companies. If there is to be an inquiry of this sort it is ridiculous to hold sessions behind closed doors. While the identities of victims should be covered by restriction orders, why should the internet behemoths not explain themselves in public, as newspapers were required to do in the Leveson inquiry? As one MP asked: have they got something to hide?
MAY15	The Conservative Party is trapped in a political vacuum of its own making	Ordinary Commons business has halted, while the Tories blithely ignore next week's Euro elections The House of Commons Library has unearthed a startling statistic: the current parliamentary session is the longest since the English Civil War. It is also unusual in having lasted over three different calendar years, coming into existence after the June 2017 general election. As of yesterday it has run for 300 days.  And yet it is doing nothing. There has not been a contested vote for a month. Domestic business set out in the last Queen’s Speech is concluded. On Monday, proceedings ended four hours earlier than usual at 6pm and as of next Thursday MPs are off on another recess.
MAY15	Jeremy Hunt needs to spell out where he would find the extra money for defence	No senior Conservative can make a policy pronouncement nowadays without it being seen as a contribution to an undeclared leadership bid. With Theresa May’s days clearly numbered, her colleagues are anxious to catch the attention of MPs and party activists for the battle to come. Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary and one of the favourites to succeed, was happy to use the annual Mansion House speech to set out his stall. The speech is traditionally a tour d’horizon of global politics and a review of the UK’s place in the world. To a great extent this is currently defined by Brexit and the uncertainty over Britain’s priorities when we leave the EU. Mr Hunt, a Remain supporter who has become a Brexiteer, foresaw a continued pivotal role for the UK in global affairs post-Brexit, and said: “If we want a central position on the world stage, we must earn it.” But we must also pay for it. Mr Hunt was right to identify spending on defence as a priority in order to strengthen our “hard power”. Much emphasis has recently been placed on so-called soft power, whereby a country’s influence is exerted principally through diplomacy and aid spending.

MAY16	European elections look tailor made for an SNP triumph	"No blatant electioneering, please …" With those words Ken Mackintosh, the otherwise laissez-faire presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament, silenced First Minister Nicola Sturgeon yesterday, at least in any thoughts she may have had to influence next Thursday’s elections to the European Parliament. And all she was seeking to do was repeat that the SNP supported Scotland staying in the EU – hardly a blatant, or outrageous, statement. Parliaments where electioneering is banned, even for an assembly like Holyrood which used to imagine it could take partisan politics out of its deliberations ( by the way, it failed), is quite a departure. But with less than a week to go before we’re due to vote for members of a parliament we should have left weeks ago and which we may, or may not, still leave in a few weeks time and which we’re definitely supposed to leave, but may not, on October 31, Mr Mackintosh was determined to preserve the good name – such as it is – of his parliament.
MAY16	Banning Islamophobia would suppress debate - just ask a liberal Muslim	Polarising rhetoric risks drowning out the overwhelmingly positive story of Islam in Britain If you heard that a friend or colleague had been reprimanded for Islamophobia, what would you think? Probably that he’d said something undiplomatic, but certainly not bigoted. That he had, perhaps, suffered the same fate as the philosopher Sir Roger Scruton, sacked by the Government after his words on the recent migrant crisis were twisted, with malign intent. In other words, you’d think it was a trumped-up charge – with no real crime. But anti-Muslim bigotry in Britain is all too real, with the number of attacks rising at an alarming rate. The broadcaster Maajid Nawaz was beaten while standing outside a London theatre a few weeks ago – he said he’d be okay because this was “the life that forged us”. To grow up Muslim in Britain has always meant facing such headwinds: they might not blow as strongly here as in other countries, but they’re gathering strength now.
MAY16	I hadn't thought it was possible to make this situation any worse - but Mrs May has managed it	For some time we have all got used to switching on the radio in the morning, to listen to the political version of the weather forecast. “The government will continue further talks with the Labour Party; so far they have been constructive… coming together… making progress… exploring options.” This whilst everyone listening can see the huge storm brewing outside their windows as the public line up in droves to reject Westminster’s lowest common denominator political stitch up and vote instead for the Brexit Party. As the government keeps up this ridiculous mantra that what the public wants is for them to do a deal with a Marxist Labour party, which would include membership of a Customs Union, the public instead are voting with their feet. Worse, the daily parade of the political elite with their banal commentary on the machinations of these sham talks have confirmed the public’s worst view of politics. I have lost count of the number of Conservative political activists and councillors who have told me that they are going to vote for the Brexit Party at the European elections. I had thought it wasn’t possible to make this situation any worse, yet this week the Government has managed it. First came the bizarre announcement of a chaotic multiple choice vote in Parliament. Then, 24 hours later, they changed their minds and decided to hold a fourth vote on Theresa May’s deal - a vote, incidentally, that the Government will almost certainly lose.
MAY16	Remainers are terrified to admit that Leavers aren't all working class, white, and poor	Before I went to a dinner party in Kensington last week, I got a message from the hostess: “Don’t mention the B word!” In the posh parts of London now, it is perfectly fine to discuss sex and religion. But the subject that must be avoided at all costs is Brexit. London is the second most pro-Remain region in the UK after Scotland. We London Leavers swap stories about friends who, on discovering our views, have dropped us or been angry with us. Many of us have decided to keep quiet about our true opinions to avoid confrontation or scorn. We are the hidden Leavers. We quietly know and recognise each other like members of a persecuted sect. But there are more us than you might think. The proportion of Leavers in London in the referendum was 40 per cent. Even Scotland had a big minority of Leave voters – 38 per cent – though you wouldn’t think so to listen to Nicola Sturgeon. Remarkably, for the European elections, a YouGov opinion poll puts the Brexit Party in joint first place with the Lib Dems in our “Remain” capital. That should give Sadiq Khan a shock.
MAY16	I voted Remain – but don’t know which party to support in the European elections	Ooh, it’s the European elections next week, and I for one can’t wait. There are lots of reasons: no more leaflets through the door, no more dreary discussions on the Today programme, no more arguing with my husband about discriminatory Slovak retail taxes… But, above all, I can’t wait to find out who I should vote for. Right now, I have no idea.  None. I am officially a floating voter. And the thing about us floating voters is that, unless one party or another throws us a lifeline, we sink.
MAY16	If the PM will not face reality and resign, the Party must force her hand	In the Commons recently, when urged by one of her own MPs to resign, Theresa May said this was “not about me”. But it has become about her. The Brexit stasis, the zombie parliament, the vertiginous rise of Nigel Farage's new party from nothing to opinion poll leader in the space of a month – all these are functions of a dearth of leadership and of strategic confusion. In the Commons yesterday the Prime Minister voiced her determination to see Brexit through; yet it is her continued presence in Number 10 that is making it impossible to break the impasse.  The latest proposal, which is to bring forward the Withdrawal Agreement Bill after the Whitsun Recess and invite MPs to vote on the legislation even if there is still no consensus about the future relationship with the EU, feels like a final throw of the dice. 
MAY16	New protection for soldiers is welcome - but it must stretch to include Northern Ireland	Penny Mordaunt, the newly-appointed Defence Secretary, deserves credit for finally grasping the nettle on the vexed issue of military veterans being hounded over their alleged involvement in historical offences. A number of her predecessors promised to end the unacceptable practice of service personnel and veterans being subjected to investigations relating to decades-old military operations, but they failed to do anything about it. Now Ms Mordaunt says she intends to introduce legislation that will apply a limit of 10 years on the ability of prosecutors to investigate allegations of criminal conduct committed during overseas combat operations. There will be concerns, however, that Ms Mordaunt’s plans to introduce a statutory presumption against prosecution do not apply to veterans who served in Northern Ireland. The reason for this, or so it has been suggested, is that Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, is keen that British soldiers accused of wrongdoing during the Troubles 40 years ago are held to account for their actions.
MAY16	Letters: Mrs May’s bizarre lack of decision meant that she had to be asked to go, and without delay	SIR – I do not blame Theresa May for splitting the Conservative Party into two over Europe. I would no doubt have done so myself had I been leader. The decision about Europe is binary in my view. It was always inevitable that the split would take place. You are either in Europe or you are not. What has surprised me is the style Mrs May has adopted in her leadership. Looking back, it was ever thus. She failed to take decisions when she was chairwoman of the party under Iain Duncan Smith’s leadership. I was on the board and she had not changed her ways by the time I was chairman of the political honours committee under her leadership.
MAY16	Letters: Managers expect hospital car parks to fail patients and visitors	SIR – I endorse Charles Moore’s views contrasting the bad way in which car parking works at NHS hospitals and the great care provided by staff. I travelled 21 miles to Queen’s Hospital, Burton-on-Trent, with my granddaughter and spent 15 minutes trying to park before accepting defeat and leaving. There are no barriers in or out so motorists keep entering an already full car park, causing gridlock. The appointment letter advised allowing an hour for parking. Talk about planning for failure.
MAY17	Now ‘Right-wing’ has been twisted to mean ‘racist’, we need a new political language	When I recorded an interview for “Triggernometry” this week, it arose in our discussion that the podcast, the creation of two comedians, had been summarily labelled on Twitter as “Right-wing”. Yet the pair’s guests have included distinguished, thoughtful intellectuals like the political scientist Sir John Curtice and the evolutionary psychologist Dr Diana Fleischman, who would hardly qualify as hardliners. On the other hand, the Left has gone, as one of my interlocutors put it, “bat-s---”, and the two comedians are especially concerned with the protection of free speech, a cause the Left has all but abandoned. So you couldn’t call this podcast “Left-wing”. By the process of elimination, doesn’t that put the duo on the Right? If so, what’s wrong with that?
MAY17	The fraudulent Labour movement will be the first shock victim of the Brexit Party	As the Tory party rots in its own narcissistic juices, bogged down in the vanities of a leadership contest and imperiously complacent about the Farage threat, one would be forgiven for wondering whether the party that wrecked Brexit is approaching certain death. But are we overlooking something obvious here? This week, a bombshell ComRes poll suggested the Brexit Party could rob the Tories of power in the next general election, seizing 49 seats. But the “natural” party of government may not, for all its disgraceful inadequacies, turn out to be Nigel Farage’s first victim. That would be the Labour Party, instead.  The Brexit Party has exploded in the dying light of the Labour heartlands. Former Tory grandee Ann Widdecombe was given a standing ovation during a recent rally, held at the working men’s club in the old mining town of Pontefract. At an event in Wolverhampton this week, the audience whooped and whistled at  Farage as if he was a Black Country rock god. 
MAY17	Labour has left Theresa May at sea by concluding no deal is better than a bad Brexit deal	Theresa May was blindsided today, after infuriating her Tory colleagues by talking with Labour for several weeks about what Brexit they could both support, when Jeremy Corbyn decided that no deal was better than a bad deal. That has prompted a predictable blame game, with the Opposition leader and the Prime Minister both blaming it on their counterparts not knowing what they want out of Brexit. They have unwittingly highlighted how party politics stopped them both from being able to do a deal, as Mrs May was trapped in her efforts to compromise without upsetting her colleagues over the customs union, with Mr Corbyn in the same situation over referendums. Without the talks delivering Labour support, the withdrawal agreement bill has little hope of survival on contact with the House of Commons, although Mrs May was adamant to reporters that “these talks have been constructive and we have made progress”.
MAY17	It's not too late to stop HS2 in its tracks	This costly juggernaut is over-budget, behind schedule and makes a mockery of Conservative principles In a recent Telegraph article, my colleague David Davis highlighted the spiralling costs of HS2. Several Tory leadership contenders have already said they would knife the project if they were Prime Minister. And a further blow to this costly juggernaut came yesterday, in a damning report from the House of Lords Economics Affairs Committee questioning not only the overall costs of HS2, which could exceed £100 billion, but its very raison d‘être.  Anyone still doubting the inevitably of HS2's overspend need look no further than Crossrail – a far smaller project. Only a few months ago, the Transport Secretary was citing Crossrail as a project which is ‘on time and in budget’. Yet it has now been delayed by at least two years, with an overspend of £3 billion. And when Crossrail is finally delivered, there will be far fewer trains per hour than planned because of signalling and braking issues.
MAY17	The real crime is making swashbuckling sea captains put up with school run cars	What to make of Commodore Nick Cooke-Priest, forced to walk the career plank for crimes against – well, that’s the sticking point. A popular naval officer who took charge of HMS Queen Elizabeth last October, Captain Cooke-Priest has been stripped of his command for “misusing” the vessel’s official car at weekends. There is no suggestion of fraud. He paid for his own petrol. He claims nobody told him driving the car off duty was a sackable offence. And boy, does his defence hold water. Why? Because in this instance the Royal Navy’s official car was a Ford Galaxy. You heard. We know in recent years the defence budget has been squeezed until the pips squeak. But surely a fellow sporting the Commodore’s insignia could have been treated to something a little more glamorous than a seven-seater people carrier with 17 inch alloys?
MAY17	Theresa May leaves No 10 the way she ran it: in a cloud of mystery	Theresa May bows out of British politics the way she has run things: with little explanation. Yesterday, a statement mutually agreed with the 1922 Committee revealed that the Prime Minister will meet with Sir Graham Brady in June, after the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, and decide a timetable for a leadership election. Why didn’t Mrs May announce this herself? Where was the compelling message of duty and sacrifice? She has always eschewed storytelling, perhaps believing that actions speak louder than words. But politics requires communication. Mrs May couldn’t explain why she stayed in the job after the 2017 election. She refused to say if she would vote for Brexit given a second chance. And it is in keeping with her character to talk in terms of timetables rather than a definitive exit. As to whether or not to go, she has little choice. There is no point in Labour giving her too much in the Brexit talks, and every concession she hands Jeremy Corbyn loses more Tory votes for the Agreement in the Commons. The Leave coalition has turned against her. The Conservatives might well be humiliated in the Euro elections, which is presumably why she cannot step down this minute – the Tories don’t want to start their leadership contest on Monday, just days before a hammering at the polls – but she should have resigned months ago in any case. The history books will record with astonishment that her Agreement suffered the largest defeat of a Government in history, back in January, and yet she clung on for another six months.
MAY17	Labour's energy plans are illegal and wrong	Labour’s energy policy is essentially theft: seize control of the transmission structure and pay compensation at below the market rate. This is illegal under international law and would sting pension funds, while destroying the UK’s reputation as a good place to invest. The move is also completely unnecessary. The goals of generating more from renewable sources and keeping prices down may be laudable, but the green transition is already happening and if a Labour government did want to, say, cover social housing in solar panels there is no reason why it cannot subsidise that without nationalising the energy sector. National Grid has said nationalisation will in fact delay the “progress and investment that is already helping to make this country a leader in the move to green energy”. Prices in the UK have been relatively low by European standards, too – and if anyone is stuck on an unreasonable tariff, the answer is greater competition, not less. It is an odd contradiction that this is a thriving capitalist country and yet so many British consumers still do not shop around: Ofgem says that an astonishing 61 per cent of customers have only switched supplier once or not at all. A government that really cared about consumer rights would focus on fixing that, rather than creating a monopoly that history tells us would only result in a worse service.
MAY17	If the PM will not face reality and resign, the Party must force her hand	In the Commons recently, when urged by one of her own MPs to resign, Theresa May said this was “not about me”.

MAY17	Letters: Parliament is drifting in the doldrums while voters itch for a political life after Theresa May	SIR – As this parliamentary session drags on in the dog days of Theresa May’s premiership, at what stage will the Speaker tell MPs that they can bring games in? Simon Baumgartner East Molesey, Surrey  
MAY17	Letters: Mrs May’s bizarre lack of decision meant that she had to be asked to go, and without delay	SIR – I do not blame Theresa May for splitting the Conservative Party into two over Europe.

MAY18	Labour's money printing schemes will bankrupt us all	The biggest threat to our prosperity, to your pension and to the prospects of your children and grandchildren is in all likelihood something that you’ve never heard of. Yet Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), which ironically is neither modern nor a monetary theory, has been setting alight debate on the Left and looks set to form a substantial role in Labour’s interventionist power grab over the economy. MMT is utopian in the extreme. It provides justification for policies like Jeremy Corbyn’s “People’s Quantitative Easing”, which would require the Bank of England to print money to fund infrastructure and apprenticeships. An important basis of the “Green New Deal” being demanded by socialists in the American Democrat party, MMT has also been used to justify the Bank of England channelling billions into green investment – that is, to use the capacity of the bank to create cash for explicitly ideological investment purposes. American proponents of the idea say that in this way they could slash greenhouse emissions, create cushy taxpayer-funded jobs and offer free healthcare for all without bothering about who would pick up the bill. They claim that since the US government is the issuer of the nation’s currency, it cannot go bankrupt, but instead just keep creating and printing money. For the adherents of MMT, all public expenditure can thus be financed by public debt – because the bonds of the government are as good as the money that the sovereign state issues. Public debt is no problem because it has its balance in financial wealth in the private sector.
MAY18	Could the BBC please shut up about the menopause?	I’m a broad-minded broad, but after this past week of enduring BBC Breakfast’s “conversation” about the menopause, I never ever want to hear the word again. It’s not even official – October 18 is World Menopause Day while September is Menopause Awareness Month – but obviously the malady has become something of a movable feast. As if it wasn’t enough to film a floor manager having a hot flush while a presenter boasts that her night-sweats feel like she’s “run a marathon in a jungle”, we were treated on the final day to the spectacle of ex-rock wife Meg Mathews sharing her thoughts on this uninteresting condition with us as an extension of her blog, MegsMenopause.com. There’s something jarring about the BBC, on the other hand – whose crimes against females range from their pandering protection of Jimmy Savile to the gender pay gap – pretending to care about the well-being of women. Try paying them equally and not sacking them for ageing – that might cheer them up. Do we pay our licence fee in order to hear weather girls congratulating themselves on being “brave” and “strong” for “surviving” an experience which adult human females have been living through as a matter of course since the year dot? Lord Reith would turn in his urn. The menopause is just one item in the unappetising finger-buffet of clammy complaints that used to be swept under the carpet but now are flung about like fungoid Frisbees. Forsake the BBC for the commercial channels and you’ll be offered solutions to incontinence, piles and prostate woes. Men’s sensibilities are not spared either, although it’s hard to imagine the BBC having a week-long “conversation” about erectile dysfunction, lest the collective male ego take a knocking.
MAY18	The Jeremy Kyle show was grubby and horrible, but there was one thing it did for society	Lie detector tests, jaw-dropping accusations, screaming, tearful abuse and, finally, awfully, suicide. Guests being boozed up, geed up, baited and poked in advance of appearing, ready to let rip at the person who betrayed them, all in the name of entertainment. The writhing, seething mass of ugliness revealed when the dank brick was finally lifted on the grubby world of The Jeremy Kyle Show this week had us all recoiling in horror. Sure, we might have been aware of it; might even have watched it occasionally, but we’d never really paid attention until now. How could people think like that? Do that? Live thus? But as the dust starts to settle, something else emerges that is, perhaps, equally shameful – the realisation that, trash TV aside, we don’t really talk publicly about how we interact with our wider families. Spouses, partners and children, yes. But these are relationships that are, to an extent, about self-fulfilment; personal choice. That unit we’re born into – the one we have no say over and yet are bound to irrevocably? Not so much.
MAY18	Tories and Labour are despised over Brexit – but there is a path out of this democratic crisis	Jeremy Corbyn blamed the breakdown of the cross-party Brexit talks on the “weakness and instability” of Mrs May’s government. To which Mrs May responded that the talks had failed because “…there is not a common position in Labour about whether they want to deliver Brexit or hold a second referendum which could reverse it.”  They were both right. Which is to say, the leadership of both major parties is utterly discredited. What satisfaction they may gain from trashing one another is neither here nor there. Their credibility in the country is gone. The leaders themselves are in a race to the bottom in opinion polls. And the minor parties are simply serving the purpose of protest vehicles for a furious electorate: none of them, at this point, offers anything that could count as a plausible prospectus for government. Voters would be within their rights to ask, quite seriously, whether anyone in this game is seriously interested in governing at all, or even in conducting a sensible discussion about what the business of running a national government consists of now. We have grown so accustomed to this chaos that it threatens to become normalised but it is very important to appreciate how very startling it is. I certainly cannot recall a time in British political life when both main parties were almost universally regarded as useless. Generally the prevailing disenchantment is with the party in power while (at least some) hope and optimism is attached to the Opposition – especially if it has been out of office for a long period. But for both parties to be pretty much equally despised is, I think, quite unprecedented in modern times.
MAY18	The attitudes driving Alabama's abortion laws are alive and well in the UK	Women do not exist solely to be chattels, or vessels, or adornments. In the year 2019 this should hardly need to be said, but here we are, looking back on a week where two American states voted to outlaw almost all abortion, and so I feel compelled to write it again and again and again: women do not exist solely to be chattels, or vessels, or adornments. Women do not exist to be chattels, or vessels, or adornments. WOMEN DO NOT EXIST TO BE CHATTELS, OR VESSELS, OR ADORNMENTS. And so on and so on and so on. It is time to say this. It is time to shout this. It is time to scream this, without fear of being labelled hysterical, or hormonal, or whatever other insult we like to throw at women who dare to try and live a life full of the freedoms that men have long taken for granted. And while we are on the subject of hormones, please can we stop dismissing women when they are affected by them.
MAY18	The Tories are heading towards the cliff edge	Theresa May launched the Tory Euro campaign yesterday in a near-empty room. She fluffed her lines and almost said that the Tories “will” deliver Brexit when she meant to say “can”. Even the word “can” is a stretch under her leadership, which is finished bar the resignation. The negotiations with Labour over a customs union Brexit have come undone; the 1922 executive committee has forced the Prime Minister to agree to timetable her departure in June.
MAY18	Theresa May leaves No 10 the way she ran it: in a cloud of mystery	Theresa May bows out of British politics the way she has run things: with little explanation. Yesterday, a statement mutually agreed with the 1922 Committee revealed that the Prime Minister will meet with Sir Graham Brady in June, after the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, and decide a timetable for a leadership election. Why didn’t Mrs May announce this herself? Where was the compelling message of duty and sacrifice? She has always eschewed storytelling, perhaps believing that actions speak louder than words. But politics requires communication. Mrs May couldn’t explain why she stayed in the job after the 2017 election. She refused to say if she would vote for Brexit given a second chance. And it is in keeping with her character to talk in terms of timetables rather than a definitive exit. As to whether or not to go, she has little choice. There is no point in Labour giving her too much in the Brexit talks, and every concession she hands Jeremy Corbyn loses more Tory votes for the Agreement in the Commons. The Leave coalition has turned against her. The Conservatives might well be humiliated in the Euro elections, which is presumably why she cannot step down this minute – the Tories don’t want to start their leadership contest on Monday, just days before a hammering at the polls – but she should have resigned months ago in any case. The history books will record with astonishment that her Agreement suffered the largest defeat of a Government in history, back in January, and yet she clung on for another six months.
MAY18	Labour's energy plans are illegal and wrong	Labour’s energy policy is essentially theft: seize control of the transmission structure and pay compensation at below the market rate. This is illegal under international law and would sting pension funds, while destroying the UK’s reputation as a good place to invest. The move is also completely unnecessary. The goals of generating more from renewable sources and keeping prices down may be laudable, but the green transition is already happening and if a Labour government did want to, say, cover social housing in solar panels there is no reason why it cannot subsidise that without nationalising the energy sector. National Grid has said nationalisation will in fact delay the “progress and investment that is already helping to make this country a leader in the move to green energy”. Prices in the UK have been relatively low by European standards, too – and if anyone is stuck on an unreasonable tariff, the answer is greater competition, not less. It is an odd contradiction that this is a thriving capitalist country and yet so many British consumers still do not shop around: Ofgem says that an astonishing 61 per cent of customers have only switched supplier once or not at all. A government that really cared about consumer rights would focus on fixing that, rather than creating a monopoly that history tells us would only result in a worse service.

MAY18	Letters: Parliament is drifting in the doldrums while voters itch for a political life after Theresa May	SIR – As this parliamentary session drags on in the dog days of Theresa May’s premiership, at what stage will the Speaker tell MPs that they can bring games in?

MAY19	Letting drug dealers out of prison to go on spa breaks is criminally stupid	The case of convicted criminal Luke Jewitt, allowed out to undergo pamperings and visit aquariums, is an example of a justice system gone wrong You may have been tempted to bleep over the story of Luke Jewitt, 33, pictured enjoying a delightful day at a health spa with his mum while he was theoretically in prison. You may have decided it was yet another example of our cock-eyed crook-coddling criminal justice system – and succumbed to the apathy of despair. You may have gazed blearily at the infuriating photos of this shaven-skulled ganglord wallowing in his £140-a-day pampering session, and sprawling like Nero in his whirlpool bath – and then you perhaps sighed and turned the page. If so, then I urge you to blink, focus, look at that photo again – and fill yourself with righteous anger. This man was a kingpin of a sophisticated drugs importation and distribution network. He was convicted of conspiracy to supply 3kg of cocaine and has only served four years of a nine-year sentence.
MAY19	Whatever lessons you take from D-Day, it was a triumph of will and endurance	What does the “D” in D-Day stand for? The answer is surely the greatest tautology ever. Plans to liberate Europe by smashing through Normandy had been drawn up as early as July 1943. As the moment drew near, defence chiefs began counting down to the day itself: “D Minus 24”, “D Minus 23” and so on. That’s right: the “D” stands simply for “Day”. Seventy-five years ago, it was D Minus 18. Southern England had been turned into the largest armed camp in the history of the world. Two million soldiers were thronging the flush May Hampshire hedgerows, chiefly North Americans, but also men from almost every allied nation: Australians, Belgians, Czechs, Dutchmen, Frenchmen, Greeks, Norwegians, Poles, Rhodesians, South Africans. The sheer magnitude of the enterprise is, at this distance in time, hard to take in. An opposed amphibious landing is every military planner’s nightmare, and Britain’s top brass were still scarred by the memory of the Gallipoli debacle. The Germans had had years to dig in: their so-called Atlantic Wall ran from Norway to Spain, with  especially strong defences in northern France – mines, booby traps, barbed wire, machine-gun emplacements.
MAY19	Australia's election shock shows how the Tories can seize victory	Australia this weekend rejected the most Left-wing Labor Party in a generation, led by the low-energy Bill Shorten, and re-elected the Liberal-National coalition, led by the good friend of Britain, Scott Morrison. This is a shock to the pollster and pundit class – every poll for years, even the exit polls on election night, pointed to a Labor victory. The Australian people had a different idea. The Shy Liberal Voter came out in droves. There was simply no mood for change. “In 2007, when Labor took power, we felt a massive mood for change at Australia House in London [the largest voting booth in the world]. Turnout was down [this year], showing a lack of enthusiasm for a Shorten Labor government,” says Jason Groves, of Australian Liberals Abroad in the UK.
MAY19	We are heading for a hammer blow and the Tory party stretched out cold on the canvas	Let’s suppose the opinion polls are right. If they are, we are headed, not just for an extraordinary European election this week, but for the biggest revolution in our political system since the universal franchise. And revolutions, I’m afraid, rarely end well. The most detailed survey of opinion, a YouGov mega-poll with more than 7,000 respondents, has the Conservatives in fifth place behind the Brexit Party, Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens. I know that it’s conventional, in the run-up to polling day, to talk up your chances, but I see no point in insulting people’s intelligence. My party is heading, not just for defeat, but for annihilation. To see the scale of the catastrophe, look at what have until now been considered the Conservative Party’s worst results. The general election defeats of 1906, 1945 and 1997 are often cited as historic lows. The Tory share of the vote in those elections was, respectively, 43 per cent, 36 per cent and 30 per cent. In the 2014 European elections, it sank to 27 per cent. In the 1995 local elections, at the height of John Major’s unpopularity, to 25 per cent – its nadir to date. But on Thursday, if YouGov is right, it will plummet to 9 per cent. Yes, you read that correctly – 9 per cent.
MAY19	The rollout of facial recognition technology has terrifying implications for us all	Our MPs have some front. Quite rightly, they have lined up to criticise Beijing’s sophisticated surveillance state. The aim is for every Chinese citizen to be on a giant facial recognition database, their biometric data stored so that they can be identified in seconds when they are captured by a vast network of cameras. Such terrible scrutiny cannot help but condition behaviour, especially when combined with a social credit system under which minor transgressions can destroy your official “reputation” and affect your ability to access services. And yet few British politicians seem bothered that Britain appears to be creating an embryonic surveillance state of its own. We already have more surveillance cameras per capita than any country apart from China, according to the campaign group Big Brother Watch. Now facial recognition is being trialled in parts of the UK, with particularly egregious consequences. Earlier this year, a man was given a £90 fine for disorderly behaviour, after he covered his face as he walked past a surveillance van being used in a trial. Why did the police stop him? Apparently a refusal to identify yourself to a machine is grounds for suspicion. I can’t believe what I’m seeing! While running a facial recognition pilot, one man (understandably imho) covered himself up. The police forced him to show his face (& then fined him for disorderly conduct). This is dangerous & terrifying. pic.twitter.com/QdG2VPGyfE
MAY19	The Prime Minister's Brexit 'offer' is neither new nor bold	Downing Street's attempts to paper over the cracks in the Withdrawal Agreement are sure to fail The Prime Minister has said she will make a “new, bold offer” to MPs who have already rejected her Brexit deal three times. However, the plan – which, in reality, contains nothing either new or bold – is unlikely to make it “fourth time lucky” if she does indeed put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament in the next few weeks. Talks with Labour have collapsed, and Jeremy Corbyn has little political interest in rescuing a deal negotiated by a Conservative Prime Minister who will soon be leaving office in any case. Tory Brexiteers are unlikely to be convinced by commitments to change the Northern Irish backstop when it has been obvious for months that this is a necessary condition for passing the deal and yet the Government has made no progress. And all the while the greatest momentum in politics today is behind a new party, led by Nigel Farage, that deems Mrs May’s agreement a betrayal and wants a no-deal exit from the EU back on the table instead.
MAY19	Theresa May has abandoned Northern Ireland veterans and  Conservative voters	Today we present damning, incontrovertible proof that Theresa May personally intervened to stop ministers proposing a new law to protect veterans of the Northern Ireland conflict from facing murder charges. A private letter on her behalf dictated the parameters of a government consultation, forcing it to take a statute of limitations off the table. Separately she instructed the Ministry of Defence to offer “equal, rather than preferential, treatment” to veterans who served in the province – putting them on the same level as terrorists.

MAY20	Old age should not have to cost a lifetime of savings	Every MP is aware of the deep unfairness inherent in this country’s health and social care provision. Those with cancer, for example, are well looked after by the National Health Service. Medical care, from GP appointments to the operating theatre, is free at the point of use and usually of a high standard. Constituents with more long-term conditions, however, are not so fortunate. An elderly person with dementia, for instance, who requires long-term complex social care, may have to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds, from their own capital and retirement income, until they are down to their last £23,250. The fruits of a lifetime of hard work and careful saving can be wiped out. The powerful bequest motive that guides behaviour among all conservative-minded people is effectively demolished. No matter how good the subsequent level of care, the financial impact on a person and their family can be devastating. It can involve the forced sale of the family home. The effects can be even more severe when a much younger person requires long-term care and finds the welfare state has turned its back. Politically, it is by no means easy to fix this problem. We saw this in the 2017 general election, when an untested and frankly disastrous policy was launched in the Conservative manifesto – the so-called “dementia tax”. It protected some assets, admittedly, but it highlighted and confirmed the huge sums people might be forced to spend on social care. There was no sense of pooled risk, and a lottery remained for people requiring care, which depended entirely on the sort of illness or condition they faced. The public was not impressed. Worryingly, it seemed as if social care had become a “third rail” in British politics: too dangerous to touch, which perhaps explains why the Government’s long-awaited green paper on the subject has yet to surface.
MAY20	In our bitterly divided nation, democracy must not become a fight to the death	I am fortunate enough to be able to divide my time between contrasting but wonderful places in the United Kingdom. Most weeks, I spend a few days in the heart of London, and the rest deep in our rural hinterlands – at my home in mid Wales or sometimes back in my old constituency in North Yorkshire. To me, the combination of these places provides a fundamental advantage of being British: that in a medium sized island we can enjoy one of the greatest global concentrations of culture, wealth and round-the-clock excitement in an extraordinary city and yet also disappear in a few hours into some of the finest countryside to be found anywhere on Earth. The proximity of these two worlds is one of the causes of our prosperous history: the development of agriculture in a country with easy access to its coastline brought the growth of trade and finance on which the City was built. In turn, that brought the credit and capital to fuel the rest of the economy. This is a country where the banker and the farmer, the merchant and the manufacturer, have, over the centuries, done well together. Today, however, the political attitudes expressed by the majority in each of these worlds are seriously divergent, and increasingly intolerant of each other. Back in Yorkshire or rural Wales, most people voted for Brexit and they meant it. They live in places that engender feelings of self-reliance and patriotism. They hate nit-picking rules being imposed from remote capitals and they are suspicious of rapid migration and cultural change. Now they are furious that what they voted for has not been delivered, and are part of the bow wave of outrage in this week’s elections. Somehow, they believe, an out-of-touch establishment in London made up of civil servants, MPs, the BBC and financial institutions, has frustrated their democratic verdict.
MAY20	The hypocrisy of the Left over the milkshake attack on Nigel Farage is appalling	Attacks on politicians are always wrong, no matter how minor the weapon If there was ever an indictment of the wretched state of British politics, it’s the scene of Nigel Farage being drenched with milkshake. The Brexit Party leader had been out campaigning in Newcastle when he was accosted by 32-year-old Paul Crowther, who certainly looks like he could do with fewer trips to Five Guys where he bought the offending beverage. Even in spite of Farage being arguably the UK’s most thick-skinned politician, he looked visibly shaken as he walked away from the site. Cameras followed and others could be heard laughing in the background before someone shouted “fascist!”
MAY20	There's nothing we charity volunteers dislike more than pettifogging rules and regulations	One of my most precious possessions is my police check – or Enhanced Disclosure, to give it its formal title – which I was awarded in 2006, when I started out on my volunteering “journey”. I take it with me everywhere and proudly proffer it whenever needed. I’ve heard of other putative volunteers who balk at being checked out, but I am an exhibitionist and love to give too much information. So I wasn’t altogether favourably disposed towards the “exodus of volunteers” who have recently resigned from, or been sacked by, Britain’s most famous anti-suicide charity the Samaritans “amid a row over sweeping changes made in recent years”. These changes concern disclosure, though of those who use the charity rather than those who work for it; specifically, for the details of under-age or “vulnerable” callers to be passed on to the police and/or the NHS if they are deemed to be “at significant risk”. Speaking not as a volunteer but as someone whose son killed himself, surely the more people who are given the necessary information to prevent suicides the better? But when a former spokesman for the charity suggested that the resignations had been sparked by the rise of “a safe, corporate culture” that has contradicted the Samaritan promise “to keep what you say between us”, I changed my mind.
MAY20	The Tory grassroots have no right to be angry if Boris doesn't get on the leadership ballot	There is no denying that Boris Johnson’s putative campaign for the Conservative Party leadership was given fresh momentum recently. Even former opponents of the former London Mayor and Foreign Secretary are looking nervously at the European parliament polls showing a healthy lead for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, and concluding that their own tribe’s anaemic performance can only be improved through the application of radical measures they once wholly rejected. Whether such calculations are correct remains a question that can only be resolved by events yet unseen. The more immediate conundrum facing those Conservative MPs who maintain a visceral antipathy towards Johnson is: what will they do about it? The leadership election system bequeathed to the party by former leader Lord Hague allows MPs the right to decide on the final two names that will go before the membership for a final decision. In theory, then, it would be quite possible for Tory MPs to “carve up” the shortlist and make sure that members don’t even get the chance to vote for the man considered to be the activists’ favourite.
MAY20	The Prime Minister's Brexit 'offer' is neither new nor bold	Downing Street's attempts to paper over the cracks in the Withdrawal Agreement are sure to fail The Prime Minister has said she will make a “new, bold offer” to MPs who have already rejected her Brexit deal three times.

MAY20	Letters: If those on the political Right can’t speak out, there is no proper debate	SIR – Lionel Shriver (Comment, May 18) is correct that “Right wing” has now become synonymous with "racist". As a university student, I am aware of the political virtue one can signal by announcing that one is “Left wing”, without understanding the true meaning of such a label. However, I disagree that we need a new political language. While Ms Shriver posits various alternative ways of placing yourself on the political spectrum – “libertarian”, “classical liberal” – I have decided to adopt the label “Right wing” with pride. The only way to normalise the phrase and allow for proper debate is for people like me to explain to others how one can be on the Right and not a bigot, racist or fascist. Boycotting the term only emboldens the mob-Left to tighten their control of the conversation. Freddie Phillips New Milton, Hampshire
MAY20	Letters: The Tories should not have allowed Theresa May to stay on any longer	SIR – The Conservative Party is going to allow Theresa May to leave with dignity – giving her another three weeks to continue shafting the electorate.

MAY21	Extreme Remainers are driven by a misguided pessimism about Britain's future	The mental processes of extreme Remainers, I find hard to fathom. It is possible to think that the economic benefits of EU membership outweigh those of leaving, but the arguments are balanced, and depend ultimately on what post-Brexit governments do.  It is similarly possible to think that Britain’s international influence would be enhanced by leaving the EU, or safeguarded by staying in, but again, that depends on how future governments conduct themselves. One can equally debate the advantages of EU immigration. But rational analysis like this cannot explain the verbal violence and political recklessness of those determined to thwart a legal democratic vote.   Why is behaving like this the Remainer lobby way? The main reason why people said they voted Remain in 2016 was fear of the economic consequences. I admit, I was worried myself until reassured by a Nobel laureate that no disaster loomed. But now we all can see that the alarmist predictions were false. We know too that preparations have been made to keep trade flowing, and that the Irish border is manageable. Many Remain voters have accepted this. Yet diehards are still repeating slogans about “falling over a cliff”.
MAY21	Our once great Royal Navy needs to get its priorities right	Irrespective of the rights or wrongs of any misdemeanours Commodore Nick Cooke-Priest, hitherto the commander of Britain’s new 65,000-tonne Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier, may or may not have committed, his treatment at the hands of his Royal Navy superiors is nothing less than a monumental public relations disaster. At a time when our Senior Service is struggling to cope with a number of major challenges, from chronic undermanning to severe budgetary constraints, one would have thought that the top brass would have far more pressing issues to occupy their time than subjecting one of their most distinguished officers to public humiliation. But no. Rather than devoting their energies to recruiting sufficient numbers of sailors to operate the small number of warships they still have at their disposal, they have instead decided to throw the book at Cdre Cooke-Priest on the most spurious of pretexts. The Royal Navy’s official line is that he has been “reassigned” – navy speak for being stripped of his command – over allegations that he “misused” the ship’s official car. They reached this conclusion after investigating a more serious charge that the officer had used the vehicle to take his family on holiday, an accusation that was subsequently found to be false.
MAY21	Philip Hammond is determined to assassinate Brexit, as he reaches the climax of his career	It was unwise to underestimate him For someone not renowned for their witty repartee, sparkling Commons chamber oratory or indeed having any discernible political personality, Philip Hammond can always surprise us with his shameless chutzpah and brass neck. His speech to the CBI tonight is but one more conspicuous example. However, like the Prime Minister, he’s nearing the very end of the road, and will probably be fired by whoever succeeds Theresa May. He doesn’t care what most Tories think of him now, and is not holding back his opinions.
MAY21	The PM's shock People's Vote gamble will blow apart the Tory party	In 1997 Tony Blair ran a campaign with the slogan "24 hours to save the NHS" and romped home to a spectacular general election victory. Listening to Theresa May's speech and her self-proclaimed "bold offer to the nation", I was minded to conclude that we now need a new slogan for the likely 2019 General Election: "24 hours to save our country". I'm sure Nigel Farage is already on that one.  The potential for a second referendum is in effect the starting pistol for the unravelling of our democracy and democratic institutions. Theresa May is well aware of this but her legacy of passing a Withdrawal Agreement is now more important to her than playing fast and loose with the fabric of our constitution. There will be no restoration of unity or normality in this country for decades to come if this plays out as it might. The Prime Minister could get lucky and see Parliament vote against a second referendum, as it has previously, but she might not, as there may be enough in these proposals for the Labour Party to agree to their broad thrust and still stick to forcing a general election while agreeing to its second referendum backstop. 
MAY21	The truth about why Jamie Oliver's restaurant empire went under	It must have felt like such a good idea at the time. Jamie Oliver was the lively lad spotted by a TV producer in the kitchens of the River Café. His early TV series made cooking cool, he went on to passionately argue for healthy school meals. He wanted Britain to catch the food bug that he had and to cook and eat better. And if they didn’t want to cook, he put his money where his mouth was and let them eat the food that he loved. Italian dishes; simple, accessible, delicious and affordable. Jamie’s Italian opened in cities and towns across the country, as well as in airports and shopping centres. But eventually, sadly and catastrophically for those involved in the business, his empire has now collapsed. His restaurant chains have gone into administration, with the loss of some 1,000 jobs.
MAY21	How refreshing to hear Conservatives talking about ideas	Esther McVey says she wants to slash the foreign aid budget and put the money into schools and the police. Amber Rudd has launched a “One Nation caucus”. Jacob Rees-Mogg, working with the think tank Policy Exchange, writes in these pages that social care contributions should be capped at £5,000 a year. And at a Telegraph event yesterday, prominent Tories debated the future of their party – concluding that it needs to promote democratic capitalism. Among them, Liz Truss spoke about increasing house ownership and Matt Hancock of raising wages. Dominic Raab floated a 5p cut in the basic rate of income tax over the course of a parliament. Some readers might see the recent “beauty parade” of potential candidates and Cabinet members as a distraction from Brexit – and the speakers at the event appeared to agree that unless they deliver an EU exit, the voters will never trust them again. But the problems that bedevil Brexit are, in part, the result of not having had a serious leadership contest back in 2016. Because Theresa May didn’t have to win the votes of grassroots Conservatives, her views were not laid out or analysed, and she didn’t have to make any promises to which she might be held. This time around, it is vital that Tory members know exactly where the rivals stand. The public deserves a proper debate over policy: the popularity of our event highlights the widespread enthusiasm for new ideas. At present there is little sense of direction from the Government, just reaction to events; and its instincts don’t always seem right (in every sense of the word). Is the solution to every health problem a ban? Is the answer to every economic issue a bit of government intervention? “Our top rate of tax now,” Ms Truss told our event, “is higher than it was for virtually the entire period of the Labour government.” Mr Raab pointed out that “dynamic tax cuts” – like cutting stamp duty – can help the individual, address social problems by stimulating the market and “raise you more revenue”.
MAY21	Prison is necessary both to punish criminals and protect the public	The solution to the anarchic state of many institutions is not to release prisoners but to restore order The previous prisons minister, Rory Stewart, argued for scrapping many shorter sentences on the grounds that they are “long enough to damage you and not long enough to heal you”. The Government is pushing on with the idea, but a report by Dame Glenys Stacey, the chief inspector of probation, raises an important question: can the system effectively supervise so many offenders running loose in the community without the resources and reforms necessary? The report points out that there are already major flaws in the handling of offenders jailed for under one year: two thirds of them reoffend upon release. Dame Glenys puts the tab for the crimes they commit at up to £10 billion a year.
MAY21	We deserve to know the truth about links between the British Left and our Cold War enemies	Geoffrey Robinson is merely the latest Labour MP to deny claims of collusion with Communist regimes Agents of the Statni bezpecnost, or StB, were among the most brutal enforcers of Communist tyranny in the Eastern bloc during the Cold War. The Czechoslovak secret police agency used every reprehensible tool at its disposal – from torture to blackmail – against anyone who was deemed to pose a threat to the regime. It also operated abroad, spying on behalf  of the Warsaw Pact. In other words the StB was the enemy, both of the West and of freedom in general. One of the StB’s methods was to recruit or groom people in positions of political influence, to mine them for information or worse. Was Geoffrey Robinson, the Labour MP, one of these useful idiots? The allegations, which the former paymaster general and Gordon Brown ally denies, are extraordinary. He is accused of passing intelligence regarding the UK’s nuclear deterrent to Czechoslovakia across 51 meetings between 1966 and 1969.
MAY21	Letters: How can Theresa May think her terrible deal deserves another chance?	SIR – Yesterday afternoon, Theresa May made the case for her fourth attempt to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the Commons, presenting it as if it would deliver all a committed Brexiteer could ask for. However, now that she has spent three years making statements only to renege on them, the question is: can she be believed? As a long-term supporter of Mrs May, and a resident in her constituency, I’m afraid my answer is no. Her deal needs to be killed off to allow for a fresh start. Dr Peter Grey Hurley, Berkshire
MAY21	Letters: Sham parliamentary democracy, not division over Brexit, is the problem	SIR – Brexit is blamed for splitting the country in two. Other than by people making mischief, I don’t understand why this creates a problem. In a healthy suffrage the nation is always divided, but what’s bad about division? Isn’t that what the two sides of Parliament are about? (It even has a division bell.) A governing party and an effective opposition each represent a large chunk of the electorate. Isn’t our democracy protected and enhanced by an adversarial environment?  The current threat to our democracy is that Parliament has forgotten the rules – especially that, after a vote, the majority decision is implemented. 
MAY22	This is a sorry end for a Prime Minister who never believed in Brexit	“All political lives,” said Enoch Powell, “end in failure.” For Theresa May, the agony of the ending, and the failure, has been drawn out for longer than usual. But in the coming days, it is certain that her premiership will draw to a close. The Cabinet’s patience has been finally snapped by the Prime Minister’s latest tone-deaf Brexit proposal. Andrea Leadsom has resigned. MPs say there isn’t a single colleague who thinks the PM should continue. Any Conservative made nervous by the prospect of regicide will find their minds made up by the European elections. The Government’s failure to deliver Brexit – and its continued attempts to deliver a Brexit deal seen by many Leavers as a betrayal – has unleashed Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party. They will top the polls today, and the Tories will be lucky to win 10 per cent of the vote. It will be their worst-ever performance in a national election.
MAY22	In the name of God, Prime Minister – just go	When Theresa May became Prime Minister in the summer of 2016, many Conservatives were hoping she would have been the one to deliver Brexit. A difficult challenge, but one that would imprint her name in British History. Now, over 1045 days later, the situation is dire. No one can doubt the good intentions and the capacity of resistance of May, but her decisions and her actions have left the country and the Conservative party in an appalling state: Brexit was not delivered on time, her Withdrawal Agreement has been rejected multiple times, Parliament is paralysed, our international credibility is at its lowest and loyal Conservative members and voters are shifting to the Brexit Party in numbers.  I and other colleagues in the party were the first to come forward, calling for her resignation. We were ostracised by colleagues, labelled as extremists, threatened to lose support in marginal seats, just for standing up for Brexit. But we were right, and now even May’s Praetorians are recognising that her time in Number 10 is up. When Ministers were glaring angrily at their party colleagues that didn’t support the PM, she was subcontracting Brexit to Corbyn, after she told the public not to trust him in the disastrous 2017 general election. Another mistake that has cost the party seats and votes.
MAY22	Theresa May is the epitome of all that is wrong with British politics	The rise of the Brexit Party has changed everything, and the PM must be forced out of office immediately If she had even a shred of dignity left, Theresa May would have resigned. She has ruined the Conservative Party, turbocharged the return of Nigel Farage and her disgraceful Withdrawal Agreement stands no chance of getting through Parliament. Her temperament, character and interpersonal skills have been cruelly exposed as not up to the standard required for the job. Her record is one of unmitigated failure, and a Prime Minister with more self-respect would have stepped down of her own accord, if only to put a stop to this horrific, never-ending humiliation. Instead, she chose to lock herself away in her bunker, surrounded by her coterie, refusing to meet hostile ministers, pretending not to hear calls for her to quit, better to convince herself that nothing had changed. Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement is a veritable booby trap, designed to blow up her successor, and her party is in open, angry revolt. Rarely has such a senior figure been so deluded; even Gordon Brown, who sought to cling on in Downing Street after his time had gone, had more self-awareness. Andrea Leadsom rightly chose to quit the Government rather than continue to play along with this farce.
MAY22	After Theresa May, the Tories could benefit from Andrea Leadsom's Maggie-esque steel	In the latest part of our new series on the leadership contest awaiting the Conservatives, Brian Binley explains why the Tories need a tough Brexiteer in charge like Andrea Leadsom Andrea Leadsom is a tough lady. Make no mistake about that, but she is also quite feminine. Shades of Margaret Thatcher come to mind and that's no bad thing. I first came across Andrea shortly after she had been selected following the imposition of new boundaries which meant I would lose 40 per cent of my rural electorate, and I was not best pleased. I would still be the local MP in the bit that went to Northamptonshire South, but Andrea would be the candidate. In other words, we had to work quite closely together, and the situation could have been difficult. In truth, it worked quite well, although there were moments when I felt it necessary to stand up to Andrea. But to be fair, she never held a grudge.
MAY22	What on earth has possessed  the PM to cling on for so long?	Every conversation I have had with political friends in recent months (and I do mean every single conversation) has been reduced to amateur psychoanalysis of Theresa May. Why? How? What strange configuration of personal experience/temperamental peculiarity/psychological aberration could possibly account for this bizarre capacity for obtuseness/deceitfulness/purblind insensitivity, blah-blah-blah? You know all this. I expect you’ve been engaged in the same sort of speculation yourself. Is she incorrigibly arrogant, or maniacally committed to the righteousness of her own mission, or just absurdly unable to understand the arguments against her? Well compellingly fascinating as all this may be, it is nearly over, whatever Mrs May might think. Very soon, no more time will need to be wasted on her deeply puzzling personality.
MAY22	Theresa May must go - now. This is a national emergency	What can the Prime Minister be thinking? It’s over. She can no longer pass critical legislation; the latest draft of her Withdrawal Agreement is dead in the water; her backbenchers are up in arms; Cabinet members would like to meet to discuss her future. Andrea Leadsom has resigned as Leader of the House, saying Britain will not be “truly sovereign” under the agreement and that “government processes” have broken down. And yet, Theresa May clings on. Why? What does she think she has left to achieve? What political face is there left to save? Today the country votes in the European elections and with every minute Mrs May stays in power, one can almost visualise the Conservative vote disappearing like dust in the wind. Her resistance to facts is absurd. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is actually refusing to meet government ministers, presumably in case they ask her to resign.
MAY22	This latest deal is a disaster. If any Tory had doubts about voting for the Brexit Party, Mrs May has laid them to rest	Tomorrow is the European election, and if anyone leaning towards the Brexit Party still had doubts, the Prime Minister will have laid them to rest. Her last-ditch offer to save her Withdrawal Agreement is a complete sell-out. It is everything Labour says it wants (but will probably vote against). Customs-union-in-all-but-name, a new environmental agency and a commitment to match Europe on workers’ rights – all locked in with legal obligations. To sweeten the deal, there’s even a guarantee that if the Commons nods the agreement through, it can also vote on whether or not to hold a second referendum.
MAY22	How refreshing to hear Conservatives talking about ideas	Esther McVey says she wants to slash the foreign aid budget and put the money into schools and the police. Amber Rudd has launched a “One Nation caucus”. Jacob Rees-Mogg, working with the think tank Policy Exchange, writes in these pages that social care contributions should be capped at £5,000 a year. And at a Telegraph event yesterday, prominent Tories debated the future of their party – concluding that it needs to promote democratic capitalism. Among them, Liz Truss spoke about increasing house ownership and Matt Hancock of raising wages. Dominic Raab floated a 5p cut in the basic rate of income tax over the course of a parliament. Some readers might see the recent “beauty parade” of potential candidates and Cabinet members as a distraction from Brexit – and the speakers at the event appeared to agree that unless they deliver an EU exit, the voters will never trust them again. But the problems that bedevil Brexit are, in part, the result of not having had a serious leadership contest back in 2016. Because Theresa May didn’t have to win the votes of grassroots Conservatives, her views were not laid out or analysed, and she didn’t have to make any promises to which she might be held. This time around, it is vital that Tory members know exactly where the rivals stand. The public deserves a proper debate over policy: the popularity of our event highlights the widespread enthusiasm for new ideas. At present there is little sense of direction from the Government, just reaction to events; and its instincts don’t always seem right (in every sense of the word). Is the solution to every health problem a ban? Is the answer to every economic issue a bit of government intervention? “Our top rate of tax now,” Ms Truss told our event, “is higher than it was for virtually the entire period of the Labour government.” Mr Raab pointed out that “dynamic tax cuts” – like cutting stamp duty – can help the individual, address social problems by stimulating the market and “raise you more revenue”.
MAY22	Letters: How can Theresa May think her terrible deal deserves another chance?	SIR – Yesterday afternoon, Theresa May made the case for her fourth attempt to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the Commons, presenting it as if it would deliver all a committed Brexiteer could ask for. However, now that she has spent three years making statements only to renege on them, the question is: can she be believed? As a long-term supporter of Mrs May, and a resident in her constituency, I’m afraid my answer is no. Her deal needs to be killed off to allow for a fresh start. Dr Peter Grey Hurley, Berkshire
MAY22	Letters: Sham parliamentary democracy, not division over Brexit, is the problem	SIR – Brexit is blamed for splitting the country in two. Other than by people making mischief, I don’t understand why this creates a problem. In a healthy suffrage the nation is always divided, but what’s bad about division? Isn’t that what the two sides of Parliament are about? (It even has a division bell.) A governing party and an effective opposition each represent a large chunk of the electorate. Isn’t our democracy protected and enhanced by an adversarial environment?  The current threat to our democracy is that Parliament has forgotten the rules – especially that, after a vote, the majority decision is implemented. 
MAY23	Boris Johnson could be in Number 10 by the summer – if he doesn't mess up the next few weeks	It has never been hard to make the case for Boris Johnson as Tory leader. He’s a proven winner who was twice elected mayor of London, a Labour city. He supplied energy and optimism to the Vote Leave campaign – qualities that the Tories need rather badly now. In an era when exasperated voters seek mould-breaking politicians, he is the best candidate to present the Conservatives as force for change. In fact, he might be the only candidate able to do so. The case against him is just as easily made. That he’s a showman, exposed as such when he last ran to be Prime Minister three years ago. That he lacks the organisational ability needed to operate at such a high level, which is why he disappointed as Foreign Secretary. That he is suited to being an entertainer – who excels on the page, on the stage and on the screen. But that he is, fundamentally, unsuited to No 10. Until recently, most Conservatives took the uncharitable view of Boris Johnson – but Nigel Farage’s sensational comeback has now denied them this luxury. The Brexit Party now intends to march on Westminster, and the Tories are terrified. “Our problem is now existential,” one minister says. “A lot of people who hate Boris now see him as their only hope of dealing with Farage and keeping their seat.” Even Ruth Davidson, who is known to loathe Boris, is now ready to disarm and says she’d “work with” him. He could be in No 10 by summer, if he doesn’t mess up the next few weeks.
MAY23	Thatcher didn't cling on like this. We need a Brexiteer to lead us out of this paralysis	The PM should learn the lessons of Margaret Thatcher's dignified departure  It’s nearly 30 years ago now but none of us who were there will ever forget the quiet dignity of Margaret Thatcher’s final days in office. From the moment she won – won! – the first leadership ballot, through that dreadful Wednesday, and on to her triumphant final speech as Prime Minister in the confidence debate the following day, it was impossible not to be moved by her grace and poise. She had to go, not because she fell a few votes short of the ballot threshold, but because in the end she had lost the confidence of her colleagues. When your own Cabinet tells you that your time is up, it is.
MAY23	Where are you in the Five Stages of Brexit Grief?	Sorry to intrude on personal grief, but now we’ve all dutifully trudged off to exercise our suffrage in the European elections – life-affirming as root canal work in a powercut – I feel I ought to reach out. How are you, in yourself? Or, more accurately, where are you? You might not be at the same point as I am on the Kübler-Ross spectrum, but I reckon the five stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression and resignation just about cover the entire country’s emotional response to Mrs May.
MAY23	If we start to link terrorism and domestic violence, we might just stop the next attack	Home can be a dangerous place. Every week, two women are killed by current or former partners, and the number of domestic homicides in London tripled last year to 29. But there’s another connection between domestic violence and murder that doesn’t appear in official figures. Most terrorists – and indeed most of the men responsible for mass shootings in the US – have a history of abusing women and children. I’ve spent a year researching the backgrounds of the perpetrators of fatal attacks on strangers in the UK, France, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Australia and the US. Some claimed to be acting on behalf of Islamist organisations such as Isil or al-Qaeda, while others were followers of right-wing ideologies.
MAY23	If David Cameron was the 'heir to Blair', then our stubborn PM is the spawn of Brown	A futile resignation and a refusal to budge – history is repeating itself in Theresa May's doomed premiership Time will tell if Andrea Leadsom’s calculated resignation will have the desired effect of forcing Theresa May’s long-awaited departure from Number 10. But for an example of a fruitless attempt to depose a sitting prime minister in remarkably similar circumstances, we need go no further back than a decade. At precisely ten o’clock on the evening of the European Parliament elections in June 2009, as polling stations throughout the land drew down their shutters, news bulletins carried the breaking news that culture secretary James Purnell had quit the government. His resignation letter implored the prime minister, Gordon Brown, to step aside and give the Labour Party a better chance at the next general election, which could not be more than 11 months away.
MAY23	The Cabinet must tell Theresa May to resign	Jeremy Hunt has told the Prime Minister to drop her deal. Given that the PM has said she is only staying in charge to get the agreement through, this is the equivalent of suggesting she resigns: a strong move and the right move but, one suspects, not quite enough. It’s obvious that a lot of Cabinet members are acting with an eye on how their behaviour will be judged in a leadership contest. The memory of Margaret Thatcher’s fall has been invoked, along with the saying “he who wields the knife shall never wear the crown”. But that cliché is wrong. Mrs Thatcher became leader in 1975 because she was the only Tory MP with the courage to take on Edward Heath and tell him directly to go. Fortune often does reward the brave. It certainly doesn’t look favourably upon the timid. The sooner the Tories are free of Theresa May, the quicker they can regain some control of the narrative in light of the European election results. The longer they drag their heels, the greater the damage to everyone involved – and none of Mrs May’s colleagues will get to be Prime Minister, or at least won’t be PM for very long, because the Conservative Party will be kicked out at the next general election. A Labour government, led by a Marxist, would be disastrous for this country, which is why the air of paralysis in Westminster isn’t just embarrassing – it is downright irresponsible. Those MPs who think they can just muddle through the next few weeks, or allow events to come to a natural conclusion, have underestimated Mrs May’s stubbornness and over-estimated the public’s patience. The Conservatives have to ask themselves what they are actually for. Some seem to think their job is to keep the show on the road, but managerialism only works if a party is a good manager – and this government is a shambles. No, effective government needs an organising principle, which ought to be the values for which the Conservative Party has, at its best, stood for: liberty, patriotism, democracy, the free market and public service. Mrs May is said to be driven by duty. Fine, in that case the most useful thing would be for her to announce her resignation – preferably today, or at least by Monday. Meanwhile, Cabinet members must ruminate (quickly) on what they entered politics for. If they could only rediscover their principles, they would realise they have a moral duty to do something – to sack Mrs May or, failing that, resign in protest.
MAY23	Theresa May must go - now. This is a national emergency	What can the Prime Minister be thinking? It’s over. She can no longer pass critical legislation; the latest draft of her Withdrawal Agreement is dead in the water; her backbenchers are up in arms; Cabinet members would like to meet to discuss her future.

MAY23	Letters: The Prime Minister had her chance to step down with dignity – but that time has long passed	SIR – Your report states that those loyal to Theresa May want her to quit with dignity. I’m afraid the time for that has long gone. Mrs May is destroying the Conservative Party, and indeed democracy itself, while continuing to deny that she is in any way at fault. Adrian Waller Woodsetts, South Yorkshire  
MAY23	Letters: Our participation in European elections shows up MPs’ incompetence	SIR – Today the country goes to the polls to vote in elections that shouldn’t be happening, for MEPs who may only represent us for a few months.  As a result, many schools have been closed to act as polling stations for the day and many parents have had to take time off work to look after their children. The Electoral Commission has printed numerous ballot sheets, as well as hiring people to count the votes cast and to work in the polling stations.  This represents a huge expense to the country and it is due to our elected MPs’ inability to get their act together and deliver the will of the people, as expressed almost three years ago. 
MAY24	The next Tory leader must learn from Mrs May's mistakes – beginning with an honest conversation about Brexit	I kept saying to myself, “beware of pity”. It was sad to watch someone who has tried so hard being forced to admit defeat, and painful to see the tears start into her eyes. But I still say “Beware of pity” because, if Theresa May’s account of what went wrong is accepted, the same mistakes will be repeated. Mrs May quoted the late, great rescuer of children from the Nazis, Sir Nicholas Winton, “Never forget that compromise is not a dirty word”.
MAY24	Theresa May was harder to get out than chewing gum	Has she really gone? Are we quite sure she’s gone? Can someone please check behind the sofa, just in case? Theresa May was harder to get out than chewing gum. The Prime Minister’s turbulent final weeks in office were marked by obduracy, duplicity, secrecy, a bunker mentality and an unwillingness to listen, all hallmarks of her leadership style. She had infuriated absolutely everyone, even Andrea Leadsom, a staunch Brexiteer who had remained loyal, trusting and good-natured as a Golden Retriever throughout. And yet, yesterday morning, as she stood outside Number 10 concluding her words of resignation – in both senses – you had to feel for Mrs May.
MAY24	In the annals of history, Theresa May will rank as a uniquely bad PM	Mrs May achieved nothing of any value, while humiliating the country she says she “loves” What matters is how prime ministers conduct themselves in office, not how they depart from it. But in the case of Theresa May, the weepy histrionics do provide a useful starting point to understanding what has gone wrong. Mrs May’s valedictory statement was a thinly coded attack on the values and policies of her own party. The call for “consensus” (that Thatcher no-no word) and “compromise” (naturally, with the Remainers and Jeremy Corbyn), attacks on “the privileged few” (people who succeed), exaltation of her (pointless) “industrial strategy”, culminating in the bathos of “eliminating plastic waste” – all show why Mrs May’s prime ministership was destined for failure, even before the bungling of Brexit.
MAY24	Theresa May's disastrous premiership was always going to end in tears	Theresa May’s tear-stained final speech in Downing Street exuded self-pity. But sympathy for her will have been in short supply, especially from Leave voters and Tory activists. For she was undoubtedly one of the worst prime ministers in British history, hopelessly out of her depth in the top job. Abrasive and reserved, she had none of the qualities expected in a national leader, lacking any natural authority or political convictions of gifts of communication. Indeed, she was not a political heavyweight at all. It was unfairly said of Clement Attlee that he would have been suited to the role of “an official at the East Ham Corporation.” But it could be justly said of May that she should have been a middle manager at the Department of Work and Pensions. It is fashionable now to say that she inherited from David Cameron an impossible job, but that is more nonsense designed to deflect the blame for her dismal performance. In fact, she came to power in 2016 with a huge amount of goodwill, a workable Commons majority, and united Cabinet. Widely seen as a “safe pair of hands”, she won such an overwhelming majority among MPs in the first stage of the leadership contest that the formality of putting the decision to association members was abandoned.
MAY24	I don't feel sorry for Theresa May - her obstinacy made her the architect of her own destruction	Abandon any shred of sympathy you might harbour for this stubborn and incompetent PM  As her voice cracked, Theresa May’s emotion felt raw and palpable. So much so that pundits and politicians rushed to find something nice to say about our soon to be ex-Prime Minister. It’s a temptation the rest of us should resist. Theresa May has proved to be the worst PM this country has had in living memory.
MAY24	Theresa May's premiership sank without trace	After three years of remarkable self-control, Theresa May crumbled at the finish. As she expressed her “gratitude” for “the opportunity to serve the country I love”, her voice broke and she walked back quickly into No 10. Of this there is no doubt: the Prime Minister loves her country and has tried to serve it to the best of her ability. But that unwavering dedication to what Mrs May perceives as her duty became a terrible flaw. She would not listen to criticism. She could not judge when the game was over. Mrs May will step down from office far too late, having wasted precious time.
MAY24	Why don't the police speak to Sir Philip Green?	Yesterday the House of Lords debated whether or not the rules of parliamentary privilege should be tightened – and, proving that they most certainly should not be, Lord Hain raised his decision last year to name Sir Philip Green as the man at the centre of harassment allegations investigated by this newspaper. Sir Philip gagged us with a court injunction. Some in the legal establishment seemed to think that Sir Philip was defending a point of principle, namely that if someone signs a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), they should stick to it. However, NDAs were never intended to be used in this manner – to suppress allegations of sexual harassment and racist abuse. Furthermore, the injunction was a perverse, outdated assault on free speech, and thank goodness Lord Hain defied it. Yesterday, he also answered a commonplace question: why did Sir Philip’s accusers sign an NDA at all?  According to one complainant quoted by Lord Hain, they went to an employment tribunal but “were told it would not get anywhere so settled”. Others were “worn down with spiralling legal costs”. Lord Hain quoted yet more disturbing stories, that Sir Philip: “was touching and repeatedly slapping women staff’s bottoms, grabbing thighs and touching legs.”
MAY24	The Cabinet must tell Theresa May to resign	Jeremy Hunt has told the Prime Minister to drop her deal. Given that the PM has said she is only staying in charge to get the agreement through, this is the equivalent of suggesting she resigns: a strong move and the right move but, one suspects, not quite enough.

MAY24	Letters: It will be up to the next inhabitant of 10 Downing Street to pull the Tories back from the brink	SIR – The next leader of the Conservative Party has an unenviable task ahead. Bringing the party together will be as difficult as the Brexit negotiations, and the outcome just as unpredictable. Philip Everall Crewe, Cheshire  
MAY24	Letters: The Prime Minister had her chance to step down with dignity – but that time has long passed	SIR – Your report states that those loyal to Theresa May want her to quit with dignity.

MAY25	Picking a new Prime Minister is an important task – and the Tory membership has grown by 36,000	I first met Theresa May over a decade ago on a sunny weekend in Great Yarmouth. I was a year into my role as the parliamentary candidate, tasked with overturning Labour’s 3000-strong majority. We were lucky enough to have been inundated with ministerial visits, though I soon learnt they tended to whisk in for a photo and a quick media interview before heading to their next destination. Not Theresa May. Her team asked what would be most useful, and we cheekily suggested canvassing, not dreaming for a moment that she would want to do that. But she jumped at the chance, and spent the afternoon battling it out in our toughest Labour ward. On the doorstep, and in private, I am often struck by her down-to-earth normality and good humour, and her care for others – whether dancing around a piano on a rare evening off or helping young women take their first steps into politics. I am thankful to Theresa May for the many years she has devoted to the party. She was a party activist and a councillor before she became an MP, and as Prime Minister found time to knock on doors and campaign most weekends. Her deep commitment to the party and its values of patriotism and public service are an example to us all.
MAY25	Why do we care about British Steel any more than Blockbuster Video?	What makes steel different? As technological change accelerates, industries become redundant all the time. Deirdre McCloskey, arguably the world’s leading economic historian, reckons that 13 per cent of jobs are made obsolete every year because of advances in automation and artificial intelligence. In general, we accept that this process, while nasty for those involved, pushes up living standards. The spread of telephones in the early twentieth century put telegraphists out of work. The changes in quarantine law in 2001 did for many boarding kennels. These things, we recognise with a tinge of melancholy, are necessary. But when it comes to steel, we feel differently. It’s not just about the loss of jobs. Yes, being thrown out of work is a horrible, unpleasant thing. But we don’t, as a rule, devote wistful articles to the disappearance of video rental shops or travel agents or local newspapers. No, something else is tugging at our sentiment.
MAY25	Want to know why Theresa May failed? Take a look at her Chancellor	Theresa May was the author of her own misfortune. But spare a thought for the man who designed the disastrous approach to Brexit that put her career on the rocks: Philip Hammond. The moment the Chancellor of the Exchequer told Mrs May to take no-deal off the table, she ceased to have a serious negotiating position with the European Union, and ensured she would go down to defeat. Mr Hammond was not alone in encouraging her in this lethal stratagem, though he shrewdly kept his head below the parapet while other pro-European fanatics helped hole Mrs May below the waterline: notably Amber Rudd, the Work and Pensions Secretary, and David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, whose own careers should be terminated for the outrageous contempt they show for democracy. They have also wrecked the collective responsibility of the cabinet, on which a successful government depends. But no-one has sinned in these respects quite so much as Mr Hammond. Before the 2017 election he and Mrs May had a deteriorating relationship, and there were rumours she would sack him after the party’s pitiful result. He survived, but his conduct of office since then has been abominable, and any prime minister with a shred of power would have removed him.
MAY25	What the country needs now is a grown-up who believes in Brexit	We desperately need grown-ups now. Whoever is to fill this immediate vacuum – and all those who even declare themselves willing to make the attempt – will have to meet this absolutely indispensable requirement. Every word they utter and every move they make will have to be judicious, responsible and generous. Assuming that the next leader has been – because this must be the case – committed absolutely to leaving the EU, the generosity is particularly crucial: it will have to extend even to implacable critics, and to the irreconcilable Remain contingent in Parliament and in the country.
MAY25	After Theresa May, my party must reconnect with its low tax, freedom-loving roots	Our future cannot revolve around following Jeremy Corbyn further to the left No-one can deny the Prime Minister’s commitment to public service. Her statement yesterday was both dignified and moving. Such is the callousness of political life that, even before she had announced her departure date, so the commentaries on her legacy had begun. As someone who was privileged to serve in her Government as a Brexit Minister, I am grateful for the opportunity that she afforded me. Just as Mrs Thatcher inspired me as a young girl, for millions of girls growing up today around the country, a woman reaching the top echelon of politics will be a powerful symbol of the meritocracy of our nation and that, with hard work, dedication and a bit of luck, there are no insurmountable barrier in the way of their dreams.  
MAY25	Tories must choose a leader with a credible plan for a proper Brexit	Now that Theresa May has announced her resignation – and we wish her the very best for the future – the Tories need to pick a successor who has a credible, detailed pan for a genuine departure from the EU. They must not repeat Mrs May’s catastrophic errors of judgement, management, strategy and tactics: on their very first day in office, the next prime minister will need to bring in a team of advisers that can help grab control of the machinery of government. They will need to put all of its resources and brainpower behind no-deal planning, in a “shock and awe” approach at odds with everything we’ve seen so far.
MAY25	Theresa May's premiership sank without trace	After three years of remarkable self-control, Theresa May crumbled at the finish. As she expressed her “gratitude” for “the opportunity to serve the country I love”, her voice broke and she walked back quickly into No 10.

MAY25	Letters: The Conservatives must seize the opportunity to elect a leader who truly believes in Brexit	SIR – Theresa May should have stepped down in 2017, after losing a catastrophically timed and badly run general election. By hanging on she has delayed Brexit and, furthermore, handed all the best negotiating cards to the EU. She has left her replacement with an extremely difficult job. Whoever that person turns out to be, if they are to honour what the majority voted for in the 2016 referendum, they must truly believe in Brexit. Anthony Snook Petworth, West Sussex
MAY25	Letters: It will be up to the next inhabitant of 10 Downing Street to pull the Tories back from the brink	SIR – The next leader of the Conservative Party has an unenviable task ahead. Bringing the party together will be as difficult as the Brexit negotiations, and the outcome just as unpredictable. Philip Everall Crewe, Cheshire  
MAY26	The message of the European election results is clear. If we go on like this, we will be dismissed	After these dismal elections, we need a proper Brexit and a fresh agenda to reunite the country I predict a rout. In this miserable election that should never have taken place, for a Euro-parliament that should no longer represent us, the voters are delivering a crushing rebuke to the Government – in fact, to both major parties. I cannot find it in my heart to blame them. They gave us one chief task: to deliver Brexit. They have so far given us almost three years to do it. We have flagrantly failed to carry out their instructions. We have missed deadline after deadline, broken promise after promise; and today our employers – the people – have figuratively summoned us to the Human Resources department for a final warning about our performance.
MAY26	Sacred Mysteries: The very first picture  of Canterbury pilgrims	A remarkable discovery about pilgrims to the shrine of St Thomas at Canterbury has been made, hiding in plain sight. I was thinking about Becket (as he wasn’t known in his time, Becket being a sort of nickname) last weekend because I spent a couple of hours sitting in the very atmospheric Eastern Crypt of the Cathedral, where his body was revered in the years after his martydom in 1170. The two hours were spent enjoyably listening to a wonderful recital for flute and piano by Patrick Williams and the conductor Stephen Barlow. One item they played was a surprisingly approachable transcription of part of Messiaen’s Meditations on the Mystery of the Holy Trinity.
MAY26	The leadership race has turned into a clash of personalities when it should be about ideas	True leadership isn’t show, but hard work, ideas and substance In the race to be the next Conservative leader, there is a danger that we end up in a personality psychodrama and forget the real issues facing Britain. That would let down our country and damage the party. True leadership isn’t about show, but hard work, ideas and substance. Without it you can’t change outcomes. That’s why, with sadness, I called for Theresa May to resign last week. Now we must look beyond Brexit and decide what kind of nation we want to become. That means confronting pressing national issues like weak productivity.  
MAY26	Do you want to escape to a remote and wild place? Join the queue…	Our most remote landscapes have become as populous as shopping malls In his 2007 book, The Wild Places, Robert Macfarlane observed that “time and again, wildness has been declared dead in Britain and Ireland”, noting that the novelists E M Forster and John Fowles, and the travel writer Jonathan Raban, had written elegies for Britain’s defunct wilderness. As National Map Reading Week begins, Ordnance Survey confirmed that nowhere on the mainland is further than six miles from a road. “I don’t think there is any genuine wilderness left in Britain,” said the broadcaster Nicholas Crane.
MAY26	We must exploit the EU's growing divisions to push for a better deal	This is not a continent at peace with itself As Theresa May delivered her resignation speech outside Downing Street, headline writers and commentators were already lining up to eulogise her as “the Prime Minister brought down by Brexit”. For decades Europe has been my party’s battleground, and the complex and at times tortuous process of negotiating our departure certainly proved an insuperable hurdle to the PM. Yet failure here is not inevitable. I suspect that future historians will look back in amazement on the issues that proved the breaking point of any deal - the Irish border and the Taoiseach’s veto over Britain’s trading policy - as the “tail wagging the dog”. And what of the changing face of the European Union itself? The Parliamentary elections underway throughout Europe may well give May’s successor the chance to bring Britain back to the negotiating table under more favourable conditions.
MAY26	Tories must choose a leader with a credible plan for a proper Brexit	Now that Theresa May has announced her resignation – and we wish her the very best for the future – the Tories need to pick a successor who has a credible, detailed pan for a genuine departure from the EU. They must not repeat Mrs May’s catastrophic errors of judgement, management, strategy and tactics: on their very first day in office, the next prime minister will need to bring in a team of advisers that can help grab control of the machinery of government. They will need to put all of its resources and brainpower behind no-deal planning, in a “shock and awe” approach at odds with everything we’ve seen so far.
MAY26	Theresa May's premiership sank without trace	After three years of remarkable self-control, Theresa May crumbled at the finish. As she expressed her “gratitude” for “the opportunity to serve the country I love”, her voice broke and she walked back quickly into No 10. Of this there is no doubt: the Prime Minister loves her country and has tried to serve it to the best of her ability. But that unwavering dedication to what Mrs May perceives as her duty became a terrible flaw. She would not listen to criticism. She could not judge when the game was over. Mrs May will step down from office far too late, having wasted precious time.
MAY26	Why don't the police speak to Sir Philip Green?	Yesterday the House of Lords debated whether or not the rules of parliamentary privilege should be tightened – and, proving that they most certainly should not be, Lord Hain raised his decision last year to name Sir Philip Green as the man at the centre of harassment allegations investigated by this newspaper. Sir Philip gagged us with a court injunction. Some in the legal establishment seemed to think that Sir Philip was defending a point of principle, namely that if someone signs a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), they should stick to it. However, NDAs were never intended to be used in this manner – to suppress allegations of sexual harassment and racist abuse. Furthermore, the injunction was a perverse, outdated assault on free speech, and thank goodness Lord Hain defied it. Yesterday, he also answered a commonplace question: why did Sir Philip’s accusers sign an NDA at all?  According to one complainant quoted by Lord Hain, they went to an employment tribunal but “were told it would not get anywhere so settled”. Others were “worn down with spiralling legal costs”. Lord Hain quoted yet more disturbing stories, that Sir Philip: “was touching and repeatedly slapping women staff’s bottoms, grabbing thighs and touching legs.”
MAY26	Letters: An Oxbridge education should be a matter of merit not preference	SIR – Like Allison Pearson (Features, May 22), I went to a state school and won a place at Oxbridge. My husband and I have worked hard so we could send our children to private school. So it strikes me as deeply ironic that they may now be discriminated against in their own attempts at Oxbridge entry. Surely this is the way to cancel out social mobility in a generation. Jo Senior  Bedale, North Yorkshire   
MAY26	Letters: The Conservatives must seize the opportunity to elect a leader who truly believes in Brexit	SIR – Theresa May should have stepped down in 2017, after losing a catastrophically timed and badly run general election. By hanging on she has delayed Brexit and, furthermore, handed all the best negotiating cards to the EU. She has left her replacement with an extremely difficult job. Whoever that person turns out to be, if they are to honour what the majority voted for in the 2016 referendum, they must truly believe in Brexit. Anthony Snook Petworth, West Sussex
MAY27	Both parties face an existential threat, but Labour's goes deeper than the Tories'	Corbyn is as alien to the working class as Blair was  The Tories had a dreadful Euro election, but at least they know what to do. Elect a Leaver as leader, rethink the Withdrawal Agreement, win back the Brexit Party defectors. Easy-peasy-Farage-squeezy. For Labour, it’s much harder. They obviously lost a lot of votes to the Greens and Lib Dems, which pulls them in a Remain direction. But that wasn’t the whole picture. In the Welsh ex-mining seat of Blaenau Gwent, Labour’s share of the vote fell by 23 points, but the Lib Dems only rose by five: the bulk of the Labour exodus must have gone to the Brexit Party, which won an impressive 37 per cent (compared to Ukip’s 30 per cent in 2014). In Wigan, Greater Manchester, the Labour percentage fell by nearly 20 points and the Brexiteers hit 41 per cent.
MAY27	Even if there had been a shift against Brexit, shambolic Remainers would fail to capitalise on it	Now that the EU election results are in, in normal times we would expect debates and arguments about which parties are the winners and which are the losers. But that has largely been settled: the Brexit Party were victorious, the Liberal Democrats did very well, the Greens were much improved, while both Labour and the Conservatives had dismal nights – with the Conservatives taking the wooden spoon. Ukip and Change UK each suffered as close to an electoral death as it is possible to experience. The new contested ground is the extent to which the result shows that more people now want to remain in the EU than to leave, whether sentiment has clearly moved since the 2016 referendum. Those who want us to stay in the EU have been relentlessly seeking this evidence for the past three years. To date it has largely proved illusory, as other than the odd opinion poll, not much appears to have changed and, if anything, views have become more entrenched. But Remainers see fresh hope from these elections. The Guardian has produced a graphic showing that parties supporting Remain stand at around 38 per cent while those supporting a hard Brexit are on less. Conservative and Labour votes are lumped together as representing nobody can be quite sure what. There are similar calculations floating around on social media, suggesting Remain is in the ascendancy. 
MAY27	The European elections were a victory for ordinary Britons - and, boy, did we enjoy shaking things up	Forgive me if I borrow from the great Frankie Valli, but, Oh, what a night! It was pure joy to watch the coverage of the European elections. For weeks, the BBC had been doing its best to avoid saying the dreaded name aloud, but on Sunday they really didn’t have a lot of choice. Try as they might to make the results about the success of the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, one astounding fact strobed out in turquoise from the top of every single count in England and Wales. The Brexit Party had wellied the lot of them. How uplifting to see both main parties (and their dismal leaders) humbled. How unbelievably gratifying to see millions of decent Conservative and Labour voters - dismissed as “extremists” by the Condescendi - exact their revenge. It wasn’t just a punishment beating, although there was a great big smack of satisfaction in knowing that not a single politician in England and Wales has a safe seat any more. Be afraid, Yvette Cooper, be very afraid! This was an intoxicating display of democracy; a heady blast of pure oxygen down the fusty corridors of obfuscation. A Remainer Parliament had colluded for almost three years to thwart the biggest vote in our history with insulting talk of a second referendum. OK, so you want a People’s Vote? Well, here’s the people voting – how do you like it now?
MAY27	Remain or Leave, who holds the balance of power after the Euros?	Both sides are weaponising the results to suit their preferences Almost inevitably, politicians of all persuasions have attempted to argue that the European election results show that most voters back their side of the Brexit debate. The result has given all of them plenty of material they can use. Those in favour of leaving without a deal can point out that the Brexit Party came first and this shows that leaving without a deal is the single most popular option among voters. However, proponents of a second referendum respond that whereas 35 per cent voted for parties that back leaving without a deal, rather more, 40 per cent, supported those who argue for another ballot.
MAY27	The Brexit Party's stunning victory is just the beginning. Prepare for a revolution in British politics	We are here to stay and to change politics for good The Brexit Party has made history. We have won the elections to the European parliament within six weeks of being launched. British politics has never seen anything like it. It took the Labour Party 45 years to win the popular vote in a national election. The Brexit Party has achieved it within 45 days, despite the major parties massively outspending us. 
MAY27	A Tory leader must face up to Farage	In normal circumstances, the favourite candidate to succeed Theresa May as Conservative party leader would be the most experienced member of the Cabinet. Yet Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, a former Foreign and Defence Secretary, and a member of the Tory top team for almost 15 years, is not even standing. While MPs who have not even been in the House of Commons for half that time consider themselves to have the skills and expertise to lead the country through one of its greatest crises, Mr Hammond is taking a back seat. More than that, he might soon be on the backbenches since a new leader from the Leave wing is unlikely to retain his services, certainly not at the Treasury. The Chancellor is seen as the éminence grise behind the failed strategy that forced Mrs May from office; and he makes little attempt to hide the fact. Interviewed by Andrew Marr on the BBC yesterday, Mr Hammond reaffirmed his absolute opposition to the idea of the UK leaving the EU with no deal on October 31, which is becoming the default policy of many Brexit-supporting would-be leaders. He even indicated that were a choice to be made in favour of such a proposition or bringing down the Tory Government, he could conceivably be found in the division lobbies, voting against the new leader. Yet Mr Hammond also pointed to the reason behind what must rank alongside some of the greatest domestic policy disasters of modern times. He said the EU had set out from the very beginning the negotiating template it intended to follow and had not deviated from it. Candidates now seeking support on the basis that they could secure a better deal were deluding themselves and the voters, since their real agenda was to leave without a deal. The alternative of a new agreement did not exist. But the question to be asked is why the Government did not early on in the talks make it clear they would reject the EU’s terms. At no stage was a threat made to walk away because, as the Chancellor said, the aim was to secure a compromise that in the event satisfied no one.
MAY27	Tories must choose a leader with a credible plan for a proper Brexit	Now that Theresa May has announced her resignation – and we wish her the very best for the future – the Tories need to pick a successor who has a credible, detailed pan for a genuine departure from the EU.

MAY28	Nicola Sturgeon isn't the first SNP leader who felt the need to 'show off' to the Irish	Something strange happens to them when our SNP leaders go across the sea to Ireland. Mixing with the descendants of those who had genuinely cast off what they saw as the British yoke, Scotland’s separatists have for years now been boasting to their hosts that they’re about to catch up and do the self-same thing. However, as the world – and especially Ireland – knows, it hasn’t happened and still looks unlikely, no matter how often the likes of Alex Salmond and, now, Nicola Sturgeon says it’s just round the corner. It can only have been a pretty pathetic determination to show off that lay behind First Minister Sturgeon’s decision to swank before an Irish audience, rather than her own parliament and people, this week, about when she plans to hold a vote to further help in the break-up of Britain. That, she grandly announced to the Royal Irish Academy, would be held next year instead, as previously intimated, in the run-up to the Holyrood elections in 2021.
MAY28	The Tories need to recognise that the Brexit Party are their friends, not their enemies	Any list of the greatest novels of the past 100 years would have to include Catch-22. A television adaptation directed by and starring George Clooney is about to hit our screens; and listening to Jeremy Hunt on the radio yesterday, I wondered if there might be a part for him. The Foreign Secretary set out the dilemma facing the Conservatives much in the way Yossarian, the tortured Second World War US airman, does in Joseph Heller’s book when he tries to get out of flying any more missions.  “There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one’s safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn’t, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn’t have to, but if he didn’t want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.” I let out a similarly respectful whistle while reading Mr Hunt's article for the Telegraph yesterday. To paraphrase: “The Conservatives need to deliver Brexit because our voters have made that as clear as they can. However, the current Parliament won’t agree to the deal on the table, but if we go for no deal, the Government will fall and we will end up with a general election in which we will be annihilated. So we need to keep negotiating changes to the deal that nobody wants and which has been rejected by both Parliament and the electorate.”
MAY28	The only way to deliver the referendum result is to embrace leaving without a deal	No government that I lead will ever seek an extension beyond October 31. It’s time for the Conservative Party to wake up, listen to the voters and embrace Brexit as a magnificent opportunity, not as a problem to be managed, mitigated and ultimately reversed. Otherwise Jeremy Corbyn will become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. As we deliver Brexit, there’s another vital ingredient we’ve got to bring back into the way we do politics: trust. Trust in politics has been stretched to breaking point by our failure to deliver Brexit and it will irretrievably shatter if we do not manage it soon. Political suicide lies in failing to secure a clean break from the EU on October 31, not in anything else. This is the only viable and acceptable Brexit option now left on the table. The public’s view has hardened, the Prime Minister’s attempts at negotiating a deal with the EU have ended in three humiliating defeats in Parliament and Brussels has made it abundantly clear that the deal cannot be re-opened. We need to stop wasting time having artificial debates about renegotiating backstops or resurrecting botched deals. The only way to deliver the referendum result is to actively embrace leaving the EU without a deal.
MAY28	A 'Citizens' Assembly' on Brexit is an idea so stupid only a clever person could dream it up	Sometimes it takes an intellectual to champion a truly ludicrous idea. Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of literature’s most famous rationalist, visited dodgy mediums in his spare time. Or take the procedural boffin Oliver Letwin, whose “cunning plan” to put multiple Brexit scenarios before Parliament solved little beyond tying the process up in knots. Now Rory Stewart, the swashbuckling ex-diplomat, multilingual Harvard lecturer, and Parliament’s answer to Lawrence of Arabia, has joined calls for a “Citizens’ Assembly” to solve the Brexit impasse. I admire Stewart, a thoughtful politician with an extraordinary career behind him. We could use more fresh ideas in Parliament. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Like Universal Basic Income, the idea of citizens’ assemblies is a wonkish gimmick, which resurfaces every so often but nearly always proves ineffective and impractical in real life. Stewart and several Labour MPs have proposed the scheme as a way of putting Brexit back to “the people”, while avoiding the acrimony of a second referendum. Yet so divided is our country that any assembly would doubtless replicate the stalemate in Parliament. How would you ensure proportionality, and avoid the inevitable squabbles about representation of each demographic, age group, gender, race, political affiliation, and so on? And why should the Government take notice of their recommendations anyway?
MAY28	If the Brexit Party is serious about a general election, this is what its manifesto should be	With the Brexit Party’s stunning success in the European elections and the continuing unlikelihood that the current Parliament will permit a true Brexit (now called “no deal”), attention now turns to what platform and policies the Brexit Party should adopt for a general election. Clearly the central policy will be to truly leave the EU. But the coalition of interests favouring doing that is very wide, with very different opinions on economic management, public services and many other issues. How can these divergent objectives be married into a single general election platform that the Brexit Party could sustain? Here’s what I propose. The central principle of everything that follows is that it flows from pursuing a true Brexit, rather than being some extra policy on the side.
MAY28	The Tories have been dealt an existential blow	The fate of Britain's oldest and most successful political movement hinges on the next two months In one way, nothing has changed. Brexit is no nearer to being delivered, the Conservative government is holed below the waterline, Labour is in a mess, and the country remains split down the middle on the central issue of our times. Yet in reality, everything has changed. The elections to the European Parliament that were never supposed to happen delivered an outcome many had expected and, indeed, predicted; but it was no less a traumatic moment for all that.
MAY28	A Tory leader must face up to Farage	In normal circumstances, the favourite candidate to succeed Theresa May as Conservative party leader would be the most experienced member of the Cabinet. Yet Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, a former Foreign and Defence Secretary, and a member of the Tory top team for almost 15 years, is not even standing. While MPs who have not even been in the House of Commons for half that time consider themselves to have the skills and expertise to lead the country through one of its greatest crises, Mr Hammond is taking a back seat. More than that, he might soon be on the backbenches since a new leader from the Leave wing is unlikely to retain his services, certainly not at the Treasury.

MAY28	Letters: Jeremy Hunt has failed to understand what the election result meant	SIR – Jeremy Hunt states that the Conservatives will be annihilated in an election if a no-deal Brexit is carried through. Did he not notice his party’s total annihilation in last week’s vote? Geoff Morton March, Cambridgeshire  
MAY28	Letters: Only a foolhardy Conservative could fail to learn from these devastating election results	SIR – The rise of the Brexit Party, and its success in the European elections, should send a clear message to the undemocratic Tory Remainers. They must accept the referendum result and get behind a leadership candidate who both supported the 2016 vote and believes in Brexit. Peter Lewis Rayleigh, Essex
MAY29	The Remainer legal stunt against Boris Johnson is damaging to democracy	The decision to summons Boris Johnson to a court hearing to explain comments he made during the EU referendum campaign three years ago is an extraordinary and ill-advised incursion by the judiciary into the political arena. Mr Johnson, the front runner in the contest to become Conservative Party leader, has been arraigned for “misconduct in public office” over the claim that £350 million was sent by the UK each week to the EU. At the time, Mr Johnson was both an MP and Mayor of London, and it is in these capacities that he is said to have broken the law. The case was brought not by the police but through a private prosecution mounted by a Remain campaigner, Marcus Ball. It is so evidently a political stunt intended to damage Mr Johnson’s leadership ambitions that it should have been dismissed. But district judge Margot Coleman has ruled that there is a prima facie case to answer and Mr Johnson has been summonsed to a hearing in the middle of the leadership election. The offence of misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life and is triable only in a Crown Court on indictment. The Court of Appeal has made it clear that the offence should be strictly confined because it can raise complex and sensitive issues. Guidelines from the Crown Prosecution Service state that advice should be sought “to resolve any uncertainty as to whether it would be appropriate to bring a prosecution for such an offence”.
MAY29	There can never be One Nation if liberal Conservatives betray Brexit	There is a strange and false dichotomy in the Conservative leadership contest. The Tories must decide, we are told, whether to elect a Brexiteer or a “One Nation” Prime Minister. Framing the leadership election thus, the choice will end up between a candidate determined to take Britain out of Europe, whatever it takes, and a candidate who wants to make the country a fairer place, through social and economic reform. But like a lot of political framing, it is total nonsense. All the candidates say they are committed to delivering Brexit – with varying degrees of credibility – and all have begun to articulate their views on domestic policy. Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock, for example, are keen to emphasise their business credentials. Hunt has promised cuts in corporation tax, while Hancock has proposed an economic stimulus to support new tech firms and small businesses. Neither is prepared to risk a no-deal outcome, but both insist they will get Brexit done.
MAY29	It's time to make the Conservative Party Conservative again	The Conservative Party is in danger of tearing itself apart and taking the country with it. Divisions on Brexit, the disintegration of collective Cabinet responsibility and the failure to advance a strong Conservative agenda have combined to leave us in a dire state. We are in government but not governing. While all of this is going on, the public are becoming disillusioned with our democratic political institutions and our party risks becoming irrelevant. The EU election results were not just a warning shot or a wake-up call, but a profound turning point in the political crisis we have found ourselves in. Everything has changed and the Conservative Party must change too or face a generation or more out of government. The stakes couldn’t be higher: we need a renaissance in our democracy and inspiring new leadership, not a reboot of the soulless managed decline of our country and party that we have endured over the past few years.
MAY29	Democrats still refuse to drop their impossible fantasy of impeaching Trump	It is hard to disagree with Donald Trump's succinct tweet on the Mueller report. Legally the case is closed. For all the skulduggery which emerged during the investigation and in the 448-page report, it now emerges that charging Trump was not even an option. My first instinct when the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller came out in April was to compare its conclusions to the Scottish criminal court verdict of not proven. Trump, of course, went further, claiming that the report was a complete exoneration. This was not Mueller's view, as he made clear in his brief remarks. In a rare and rather extraordinary statement today, Mueller declined to even even reach a conclusion on the matter, arguing that it would have been unfair and unconstitutional to bring an indictment against a sitting president. The purpose of his investigation was to gather evidence while facts were still fresh in people's minds.
MAY29	How can Labour be so tough on Alastair Campbell and yet so soft on anti-Semitism?	It's hard to believe Alastair Campbell didn't know what he was doing when he publicly divulged how he had voted at the European Elections. Surely Tony Blair's former master of spin would have realised that an admission of siding with the Lib Dems wouldn't go down well with the Party rule book. Indeed, as Shadow minister Dawn Butler explained after Campbell was ignominiously jettisoned from Labour,    members who admit voting for another party are "automatically excluded". As a political tactician, Campbell was swift to reclaim the narrative. Having declared that he would "always be Labour” the father of three went on to explain that in voting Lib Dem he acted "in the best interests of what the Labour Party should be doing” – by supporting a pro-Remain party.
MAY29	No 10 must take radical action against tyrant Bercow, before he wrecks Brexit for good	Right from the start, the Speaker's tenure has been all about him and his ego John Bercow's announcement that he will stay on as Speaker of the House of Commons until the UK leaves the European Union is concluded will have been received with the enthusiasm of a visit to the dentist for root canal surgery by Brexiteers.  It has become apparent to all sides in Parliament that this Speaker has little or no interest in impartiality on this issue or indeed many others.  Veteran Labour MP, Margaret Beckett, let the cat out of the bag some time ago when she said, after Bercow was accused of bullying Commons staff, that "Brexit trumps poor behaviour".  She, like many of the 400-plus MPs in a Remain-dominated Commons, have decided that they will help Bercow stay in place come what may in order to have his support in their efforts to stop Brexit.
MAY29	Betrayed Brexiteers are a bigger threat than revolting Remainers in battleground marginals	The "Remainers' revolt" is one of the most influential concepts in the number-crunching world of British politics.  After being trounced by the Lib Dems in the EU elections, Labour is under tremendous pressure from its members to back a second referendum, lest they face a Remain backlash at the ballot box in a general election. Some Conservative MPs are also terrified that moving towards a hard Brexit could lose them key constituencies in the south of England. Headline figures suggest, both camps have reason to be anxious. In the local elections, the Liberal Democrats won 704 councillors, and the Greens doubled their councillors across the country. In the EU elections, the Brexit Party were the clear winners, but the combination of votes for the Greens, Lib Dems, and Change UK roughly matched those of the Brexit Party and UKIP. The Labour Party's loss of Islington to the Lib Dems and Bristol to the Greens in the EU elections have also reinforced fears around this perceived phenomenon. But has the looming risk of a Remainer earthquake been overstated? It is undeniable that in the past few months there has been a surge in support for pro-Second Referendum parties like the Liberal Democrats and Greens. But it's worth evaluating the phenomenon with a longer lense: after all, in the 2017 general election, both of these parties were ardently pro-Remain and performed disastrously.
MAY29	The legal harassment of Boris Johnson reeks of Remainer despotism	How happy, innocent and naïve we all were! We thought - we fools - it worked liked this: you have a campaign; people vote; someone wins; the thing people voted for happens; life and politics move on to the next debate. But no. Instead, the way it works is: if you vote the wrong way, the thing you voted for doesn’t happen and the people who campaigned for that wrong thing get hounded through the courts. Since the EU referendum, Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, Darren Grimes, head of the youth campaign BeLeave, and Dominic Cummings, Campaign Director of Vote Leave, have all been repeatedly harassed through legal processes. Now Boris Johnson has been ordered to appear before the courts to face a criminal charge related to his repeating the claim that the UK sends £350 million each week to Brussels.
MAY29	Isolated and vilified, Speaker John Bercow is clinging on to get the Brexit he wants	John Bercow may not be Brexiteers' favourite as Speaker as the House of Commons, but he has sought to live up to the spirit of Brexit by constantly letting the expected deadline for his departure slip. Expectations that he might go last summer, in line with his 2009 promise to serve nine years, were dashed. Some thought he might leave this summer, but the delay to Brexit gave him an ideal excuse to stay on. Mr Bercow has now confirmed as such, saying in Washington DC that it would not be "sensible" to vacate the role while Parliament is debating such "great issues". Watch the video above to find out why he insists on staying on despite the many knocks he has had during his rollercoaster career in the chair. 
MAY29	Expelling Alastair Campbell is a superbly Machiavellian move by the ruthless hard Left	Outmanoeuvred 'moderates' must learn to play dirty too Of course Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is applying double standards to, among much else, the party’s disciplinary regime. Alastair Campbell, a hate figure among Corbyn’s Left-wing supporters, has been expelled (or “auto-excluded”, to use a spokesman’s appropriately Orwellian term) after he publicly admitted voting for the Liberal Democrats in last week’s European elections.
MAY30	There's no clamour for indyref2, despite what Nicola Sturgeon would have us believe	Nicola Sturgeon kept the independence kettle boiling this week, not just on the back of the SNP comfortably winning the European Parliament election, but also with a bill that, she says, paves the way for another referendum on breaking up Britain. However, unless she plans to hold a wholly illegal vote, the Referendums (Scotland) Bill does nothing of the kind and is merely a bone that she’s thrown to her activists who have been baying for what’s called indyref2 ever since they were defeated in the first such vote five years ago. In their wilder moments most of the latter claim they would, indeed, stage a Catalan-style vote in defiance of the legal requirement which states that only the Commons can sanction a referendum on such a major constitutional change through granting what’s known as a Section 30 order to the Scottish Parliament.
MAY30	As Boris well knows, the law has developed a worrying influence on politics	Ever since Tony Blair upended the British legal system the courts have only gained in power To Boris Johnson’s army of enemies, the timing is perfect. As the Tory leadership contest draws to a close, its most likely winner will be summoned to court to face criminal charges. He stands accused of saying that Britain sent £350 million a week to the European Union, when he should have said £250 million. The figure, of course, doesn’t much matter: this is lawfare, a form of combat where the process is the punishment. To put him in the dock is, itself, victory. The whole episode may seem ridiculous, but then again, so did the Gina Miller case when the Supreme Court was asked to tell Theresa May how she should go about enacting Brexit. This seepage of law into politics has been under way for some time, and Boris in court would be just the latest manifestation of a worrying trend. Foreign policy, military interventions and other government ideas have systematically yielded to the power of judges: a point made not by any Brexiteer but former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption, now midway through his brilliant Reith Lectures. So what has gone wrong?
MAY30	Tinkering round the edges won't do, we need a revolution in university finance	The Government's latest report on post-18 education funding is a very good piece of work. Dr Philip Augar and his panel make some important recommendations, and they could not come soon enough. The current system of student fees and loans is broken. It has led to grotesque increases in vice-chancellors’ salaries at the weakest universities, a proliferation of courses delivering poor graduate salaries, and students left with enormous unpayable loans. It also imposes a hidden burden on the taxpayer big enough to bend the national accounts out of shape. In the last seven years, vice-chancellors’ salaries have increased by almost £50,000. Now 124 earn more than £150,000 as a basic salary. Annual extra payments, such as awards and pension contributions, can reach an additional £350,000. Frankly, I do not object to them being paid more than the PM... providing they do the job properly. But high pay does not deliver high performance. Graduates from institutions awarding vice-chancellors the biggest pay rises have earnings more than £4,000 less than students from more fiscally responsible universities. This is madness. Worse is the behaviour of some of the weaker universities. As it stands, tuition fees for most are £9,250 per annum. Some courses cost much more than that to deliver, notably medicine, engineering and natural sciences. On the other hand, courses such as creative arts or social media studies can be cheaply provided with as little as four hours contact time a week. Since students still pay £9,250, they are very profitable for the universities.
MAY30	I know from personal experience that treating depression is a terrifying lottery	Not so long ago in these pages, I urged “Feeble Britain” to buck up its ideas and stop wallowing in an imaginary mental health malaise. I was inundated with emails from readers endorsing a tough-love approach to “snowflakes” who lacked the resilience to cope with the minor bumps and potholes on life’s journey. A lost bank card does not warrant a duvet day and counselling. Functioning adults should, generally speaking, not require statutory pet bereavement leave (as discussed on Good Morning Britain earlier this week). Fear of Missing Out is not an affliction recognised by the World Health Organisation.
MAY30	Sorry, vegans, olive oil is now off the menu – but nobody said being a virtue-signalling gourmet is easy	Speaking as a lapsed vegan – I only stuck at it for a month, but it’s like being a lapsed Catholic, the guilt and self-flagellation remain – I am at sixes and sevens over the horrendous news that tiny songbirds are being slaughtered while they sleep to make olive oil. Not to actually make it – olives and extra virgins are slaughtered to do that – warblers and wagtails are merely collateral damage because industrial harvesting machines in Spain, France and Italy typically strip the branches at night, when the birds are roosting and resting. The reason is because the cool temperature after dark means the olives retain their aroma. Well, that stinks, doesn’t it?
MAY30	Village greens are the very essence of English life. We must fight to protect them	Last year, furiously homesick in Paris, I used to stomp the Tuileries on my morning walk. As I kicked the gravel, two poems – Edward Thomas’s “Adlestrop” and Rupert Brooke’s “The Old Vicarage, Grantchester” – would run in my head until they become one elegiac choral round. “And for that minute a blackbird sang/Close by, and/ Stands the Church clock at ten to three? And is there honey still for tea?” In my fantasy, home was always a thatched cottage with wisteria over the eaves and a bay window over the village green. It was a symbol of home gleaned from poetry and a hundred hamlet-and-harvest-festival novels. Friends who had lived abroad confided that they too had nursed themselves through stints in Singapore, Nanjing and Islamabad with Mapp and Lucia, Jane and Prudence, Lark Rise to Candleford and enough Hardy to topple a haywain.
MAY30	Hypocritical Remainers are disturbingly obsessed with crushing Boris Johnson	Yesterday, it was farcically announced that prime ministerial frontrunner Boris Johnson is being summonsed to a court hearing that has levelled against him for saying that we send the EU £350 million a week. Seriously. The case is the brainchild of a man called Marcus Ball who, if you’re trying to imagine him, looks precisely like the opposite of the kind of person you would trust to sell you a second-hand car. Somehow this 29-year-old militant Remain activist managed to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds from people via tha internet in order to bring about his case. Along the way he argued against his own legal advice and spent a sizeable chunk of donated cash on a luxury flat complete with a private gym, self defence classes and branded cupcakes. Originally marketed as a way to reverse the referendum result by way of a movement that will 'end lying in politics', Ball’s case has morphed into a personal attack on Boris as a figurehead of Brexit. 
MAY30	I've watched Dominic Raab negotiate with Brussels. It's no wonder they're so scared of him	In only a few short weeks, Britain will have a new prime minister. Regardless of who wins the leadership election, there will be one pressing priority for whomever walks through the door of No10 - the need to negotiate changes to the Brexit deal if it is to secure parliamentary support. It’s therefore no surprise that Brussels is watching the contest very closely and will take a view of who they might "prefer". After all, I have watched Dominic Raab look Michel Barnier in the eye and it wasn’t Dominic who blinked first. It was a rare moment of tension in the negotiating room when an exchange between the two took place on the question of an Irish hard border. Michel always sought to leverage the matter of Northern Ireland as a means to try and deliver negotiating advantage in the meetings of principles that, at Dominic’s insistence, took place almost weekly from the moment he became Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union in July 2019. I had a privileged seat at that table following my appointment as his Chief of Staff.
MAY30	Scare tactics won't beat the Brexit Party in the Peterborough by-election	In order to be truly successful, Nigel Farage needs to make everything about him. As his party’s greatest asset and as one of the country’s best known politicians, he knows he needs to be front and centre of every major political debate between now and the general election. It is therefore in the interests of the establishment parties to ensure that he is marginalised and, as far as possible, ignored. For any direct criticism of Farage has often been seen as an attack on the substantial numbers of voters who might be considering supporting him. “Handle with care” might be the watch words for anyone considering taking the newly re-elected MEP on. So anyway, what’s Gordon Brown up to today?
MAY30	Why shouldn't Tory leader contenders play dirty against their rivals?	We promise not to be mean to each other – see what nice guys we are? That, in essence, is the message of the Conservative leadership candidates who have backed a self-described “Clean Campaign Pledge”. Initially signed only by past and present Cabinet ministers Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock, the pledge forswears personal attacks, overspending, online trolling, and Chinese burns. (OK, they didn’t ban Chinese burns; they are still allowed). Following in the footsteps of the big three, ministers Kit Malthouse and Rory Stewart were next to sign, the latter saying he was “delighted” to do so. Yup, that’s Rory Stewart who has made repeated references to “liars” and “Pinocchio”.
MAY31	Our ruling elite is destroying itself with grief over the death of Blairism	If Theresa May spent this week silently grieving for the gaping chasm that is her legacy, the political movement that created her has been luridly flailing against its own terminal irrelevance. Centrism is finished, but it refuses to go quietly, not least in the Tory party. And it is testament to just how Blairite the party has become that the contest to find its next leader has so seamlessly morphed into the final convulsing death throes of the 1990s anti-ideology. This is most painfully embodied in Jeremy Hunt’s spectacular car crash of a leadership bid. On Tuesday, the Foreign Secretary made the mistake of forgetting that politicians regard flip-flopping as “tactics” if used on the public, but “treachery” if deployed against fellow colleagues. His cunning plan to court Tory MPs terrified of a general election by attacking no deal as “suicide”, despite the fact he had previously insisted we would “flourish and prosper” in such a scenario, has alienated potential backers. The meticulous plotting betrays a middle-of-the-roadish lack of vision. Voters are demanding to know the point of the Conservative Party. On this fundamental question the Foreign Secretary is conscientiously unforthcoming.
MAY31	My advice to the next Tory leader is this – ditch the deal, and pursue a free trade agreement to unite our party	The EU is terrified of a free-trading, global Britain that they cannot control with stultifying regulations In the European elections, the Conservative Party suffered its worst defeat since 1832. Against this unhappy backdrop, we now face the challenge of picking a new leader who can lead us both out of this mess and out of the European Union (and if we don’t achieve the latter, we will surely never achieve the former). Given the overwhelmingly Eurosceptic nature of our party’s membership, it is almost inconceivable that they will support a candidate who voted Remain in 2016. The results from the European elections only reinforce this trend. But if we are overwhelmingly likely to pick a Brexiteer, what should that new Prime Minister then do?
MAY31	Labour must act to save itself from the clutches of Corbynism before it is too late	The bunker mentality in the leader’s office has led to the party’s collapse in credibility among voters No one should have been surprised at the results of the European Parliamentary elections. A clear and simple message is bound, forgive the pun, to trump complexity or muddle. A third of a  37 per cent turnout should not result in the display of headless chickens which Nigel Farage’s tally provoked, but both main political parties do have a real crisis on their hands. You have to be truly blinkered not to take notice of today's YouGov poll, which put the Tories and Labour on 19 per cent behind both the Lib Dems and the Brexit Party. At any other time, in a “normal” political environment, the Labour Party would be up in arms at the failure of collective leadership and horrified that a government in total turmoil was being let off the hook. But we don’t live in normal times.
MAY31	Three cheers for Dominic Raab - politics would be better off without virtue-signalling fauxminism	Rather than monster Raab, we should applaud his honesty Kissing babies, putting on a silly hat to join a factory production line, or having a sing-along at a old people’s home: this was how politicians once tried to garner electoral support. Sadly, however, such rituals have been supplanted by something far scarier: the practice of candidates burnishing their PC credentials to net support. And while I can live with the vegan champs and breast-feeding enthusiasts, what I really can’t stomach are men crooning that they’re feminists. So I’m with Tory leadership contender Dominic Raab, who caused “outrage” when he admitted this week that he was “probably not” a feminist. It’s not that the wannabe PM doesn’t believe in equality or opportunity. He was at pains to stress that does. He just doesn’t feel the need to badge his opinions with this fashionable term.
MAY31	How dare Shamima Begum and her lawyers blame the Home Office for her radicalisation?	Her total absence of contrition and personal responsibility are grotesque Shamima Begum, the British-born teenager who travelled from east London to Syria to join Islamic State and subsequently had her citizenship revoked, is in the news again – this time blaming us for her conversion to extremism. The lawyer representing the Begum family has written to the home office, accusing British authorities of failing to protect the girl from being “groomed.” Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s decision was a "politically-driven abuse of power" to try further his "own personal political objective,” Tasnime Akunjee charged in his letter.
MAY31	Embracing the tech revolution could solve many of the NHS's current woes	We're all acutely aware of the challenges facing the NHS. An ageing population and the rising cost of medicine and medical advancements are putting the health service under more strain than ever before. GP surgeries are closing in worrying numbers. Though hard-working doctors are doing their best to serve their patients and communities, recent figures suggest they face an uphill battle. Yet using technology more effectively, as other countries have done, can help ease the burden on family doctors, allowing patients to access the care they need. Companies like mine, LIVI, which provides online and video consultations, are part of the solution. Where we work in partnership with the NHS, patients can consult a trusted GP on their smartphone within minutes - anywhere and at any time through an app. This service is proving very popular, and not just with patients. A growing number of GPs are keen to embrace technology to help them deliver treatment and reassurance to patients. We've been operating in Sweden for three years and have seen significant uptake in the number of people using our service. Of course, not everyone can be treated in this way, but NHS GPs are specially-trained to make the right assessment. Both NHS England and the Health Secretary Matt Hancock are - rightly - keen to harness the power of technology to improve the health service. It is an exciting time with numerous innovations entering the market. In Sweden, we have pioneered a digital delivery of care model to help ease the pressure on GPs and support the wider healthcare ecosystem. 
MAY31	Brexit myopia will engulf the two main parties, just as independence killed Scottish Labour	When only one issue affects voting intentions, any party that tries to avoid it will be punished Maybe it’s a political earthquake, maybe another fleeting tremor which will fade as others have done, leaving the landscape unscathed. But the latest YouGov poll on Westminster voting intentions is the first one in polling history not to put one of the (formerly) big parties – Labour and the Conservatives – in the top two. The Conservatives sit back and tell themselves everything will be fine once they have a new leader in place, one who can somehow (the details are elusive so don’t even ask) get a passable Brexit deal through the Commons or even take us out without a deal. Then a nation will breathe a sigh of relief and flock to the polls in gratitude.
MAY31	There's no clamour for indyref2, despite what Nicola Sturgeon would have us believe	Nicola Sturgeon kept the independence kettle boiling this week, not just on the back of the SNP comfortably winning the European Parliament election, but also with a bill that, she says, paves the way for another referendum on breaking up Britain. However, unless she plans to hold a wholly illegal vote, the Referendums (Scotland) Bill does nothing of the kind and is merely a bone that she’s thrown to her activists who have been baying for what’s called indyref2 ever since they were defeated in the first such vote five years ago.

JUN1	Brexit Britain's destiny is to walk tall in the world	Tomorrow, the President of the United States lands on our soil. Life can come at you fast: this time last year, I was locked in negotiations with the Treasury over a 70th anniversary funding boost for the NHS. Tomorrow morning, I’ll stand on the tarmac representing our country when I welcome President Trump and his family off the plane. Some on the Left will see this as an opportunity for virtue-signalling and indulge in the usual ridiculous anti‑American rhetoric, but Conservatives understand the simple truth at the heart of the special relationship: no two nations have ever done more together in the defence of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. So this week we will honour our friendship by pulling out the stops to give America’s elected leader the warmest of welcomes. I’ve been, effectively, Britain’s chief diplomat for almost a year now, travelling to nearly 30 countries. What strikes you is that other countries always seem to have a lot more respect for Britain than we appear to have for ourselves. That’s because – with the extraordinary connections we have developed through organisations like Nato and the Commonwealth – our role has always been to defend democratic values, a global mission that I want us to continue as we embark on the post‑Brexit chapter of our history.
JUN1	Any Tory who won't take us out of the EU by October 31st doesn't deserve to be PM	Hardly a day seems to go by without another candidate entering the “race” to be leader of the Conservative Party. We say race but this is beginning to look more like the Charge of the Light Brigade. One can only hope that it will have a better outcome, but that will depend on whether the contenders charge in the right direction and at the right target. As this list has grown and grown, what has gone missing is the important point that this leadership election is about picking the next Prime Minister. Those who have thrown their hats into the ring, with minimum support but imbued with an enormous sense of self-worth, need to think a little more carefully. After all, whoever gets selected won’t have the space that a leader of the opposition has to develop into the job, to become known to the public, or to learn the ropes of government. Instead, the new Prime Minister will not only face the onerous task of resolving Brexit but also of running a Cabinet that has looked depressingly and dangerously dysfunctional in recent weeks. They will need to give new energy and direction to a government that seems to have lost its way across a range of crucial areas. It is genuinely questionable whether some of those who have declared have done so with any real understanding of any of this or they recognise the difference between leadership in opposition and becoming Prime Minister.
JUN1	The Boris prosecution marks the moment at which British politics went Latin American	For the first time in my life, I fear for the stability and legitimacy of our parliamentary system. Observing the response to the idiotic prosecution against Boris Johnson for supposedly misleading people during the referendum campaign, I wonder whether we are heading for a Latin American style of politics, where the rules are treated as contingent and politicians are threatened with jail. The case itself is so obviously frivolous and vexatious that it shouldn’t need refutation. For what it’s worth, I stand absolutely by the £350 million a week claim. Remainers argued at the time – and have argued especially vehemently since – that that number was misleading because it did not count the money returned by Brussels to the UK. But it is standard in politics to use gross rather than net figures. If I were to ask you what the basic rate of income tax is, you’d say 20 pence in the pound. You wouldn’t say: “Well, actually, it’s zero, because it’s all ‘given back’ in roads, schools and hospitals.” Whatever view you take, the arguments were endlessly picked over during the referendum campaign. People heard from the two sides and made up their minds. That is how a democracy works.
JUN1	How has Britain got to the point where even the Army is suspicious of patriots?	Do you describe yourself as a patriot? If so, you’d be wise to keep it to yourself if you’d like to join the Army. According to a Ministry of Defence leaflet leaked last week, describing oneself as a patriot is one of the behavioural signs which might mark you out as a Right-wing extremist. It’s the second time in a fortnight that I have stumbled over the condemnation of patriotism – the first being when Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the EU Commission, lashed out at those “who are in love with their own countries” in a CNN interview. Mr Juncker’s judgment has never inspired much confidence in me but I found the MoD leaflet harder to shake off. Has the department in charge of keeping us safe really thought this guideline – and the reasoning behind it – through? If the Army isn’t looking to recruit those who are motivated by patriotism, what sort of people is it after? What else is meant to stir prospective candidates into pledging themselves to the service of the country, actively risking their lives in some cases? Money or the lure of glory and adventure? Instead of patriotic young men and women, does the Army really think the nation’s welfare and its own reputation would be in better hands by recruiting John Hawkwood-like mercenaries, training them up, providing them with access to weapons and giving them the discretion to use them under intense pressure in lawless war zones? Whatever the British Army’s current troubles are, they surely cannot compare to the disaster of inadvertently turning into a twenty-first century White Company.
JUN1	This grotesque Tory leadership race is only feeding the contenders’ egos	It’s a bad sign when too many people are fighting to be leader of a political party. That might seem counter-intuitive: after all, if the job is so sought after, it must be worth having. Ergo, the party in question must be thought to be in robust health. In fact, the absurd, ever-expanding number of candidates for the Tory leadership is a sign of a party in utter, undisciplined chaos with no sense of orderly accession or agreement on a coherent message. The lack of humility and decorum has gone beyond embarrassing to comic. (Much the same circumstance prevails in the US where the Democratic Party, at the latest count, has over 20 active presidential hopefuls.) This is positively silly, not to mention grossly undignified and seriously damaging to the party’s credibility. The people are not fooled. They see this plethora of candidates not as an over-abundance of talent but rather a dearth of modesty and self-knowledge.

JUN1	Like opium-smoking Rory Stewart, we're all too polite for our own good	I doubt this is what Rory Stewart’s detractors had in mind when they called his Tory leadership bid a “pipe dream”. But with the nervous jitters of someone just waiting to be found out, the Old Etonian has offered up the information that he once tried opium at a wedding in Iran. “Somebody passed this pipe around the room and I smoked it — I shouldn’t have done, I was wrong,” he said this week, full of contrition. Although he didn’t, I noticed, miss the opportunity to add that it “had no effect” on him, as he was walking 25-30 miles a day at the time. Or, you know, because he’s just really seriously double hard and definitely the man to lead us through Brexit. Forget tutting at people who push into queues or leering at women out of van windows, this really is peak Britishness, isn’t it? Smoking a Class A drug because you didn’t want to offend anyone? And then apologising for something you only did out of politeness, 15 years ago, when nobody back home even knew that you’d done it in the first place? Give that man an OBE and name a steamed pudding after him, pronto.
JUN1	Sacred Mysteries: A short walk across the river from Segovia	One of the most amiable and wise saints of the 16th century, St John of the Cross (1542-91), worked with St Teresa of Avila reforming the Carmelite order to make it a sort of power station of prayer. Since their sole aim was to form voluntary communities of poor friars or of nuns praying for the good of everyone, it might be surprising that they ran into such trouble. John even had to escape from a dark cell after months of imprisonment; it says something of the good sense of the nuns of St Teresa that the first thing they gave him when he arrived emaciated and exhausted was a dish of poached pears. Anyway I’ve just been to visit St John to seek his help and advice, as it were. He is buried in the Carmelite church outside the walls of Segovia. A pleasant walk there and back follows the route over the river Eresma that he regularly took on his ministrations.
JUN1	The Tory leadership race is chaos - but at least Westminster is finally showing signs of life	How many Conservative MPs does it take to make a leadership contest? Historically five, ever since they were given the ability to vote on the party premiership in 1965: double that and add a few and, by the time you read this, probably an extra couple on top of that, and you’ll have a picture closer to the 2019 race. That there can be 12 candidates already is, according to Iain Duncan Smith, a sign of “meandering and chaos”. So bloated has this ballot become that, next week, the 1922 Committee will meet to discuss revising the rules. Which I understand, of course, given that the glut of toe-curling social media posts and sniping and outlandish promises it has produced resemble the vote-seeking machinations of reality-show contestants more closely than people looking to lead the country.
JUN1	The intellectually barren Tories are losing the battle of ideas against the Left	What is wrong with the Right? Why do Conservatives find it so hard to stand for anything? The vacant space where Conservative ideology used to be was evident during the Cameron years and became glaring under the May government. Now, with scores of Tory MPs running for the leadership with the same weak and reheated pronouncements, it appears that the whole Conservative tank is running on empty. It is worth reflecting. We are nearing the end of a decade of Conservative-led governments. Yet today it is almost impossible to identify a positive Conservative policy which could galvanise the voting public. Ask most Tory MPs to defend any identifiably Conservative policy in public and their response will resemble so much Left-wing pabulum. Even on the economy – the one area on which Conservatives used to be trusted – there is a sense that (contra the old, conceited mantra) the Right has not only lost the culture war but is also losing the economic argument. On “poverty”, food banks and more, they appease the arguments of the radical Left. As it is with Conservative words, so it is with their actions. Whereas the Labour Party whenever it is in power pushes every Left-wing bag carrier into every government appointment available, what exactly do we have to show for almost a decade of Conservative rule? The appointment of the distinguished author William Shawcross to the Charity Commission at the start of this decade has often been pointed to as a victory. But apart from that? Six months ago Sir Roger Scruton was appointed to an unpaid position leading a government advisory committee. And everybody knows how well the Conservative Party made that work out. Can anybody point to any other identifiable Conservative in any other position in public life? Things only appear to be going in the opposite direction. This week Philip Hammond appointed TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady to be a non-executive director of the Bank of England. When exactly will a Labour government return that favour?

JUN2	Conservatives must address our country's shocking educational disparities	One move could radically transform the life-chances of a generation It is an extraordinary fact that this country is forecast in our lifetimes to become the largest and most prosperous economy in Europe. We lead the world, not just in financial and business services of all kinds; but in bioscience, tech, academia, to say nothing of culture and the arts. London and the South East is already by some measures the most productive region in the whole of Europe. And yet that achievement masks the disturbing reality – that there is now a growing gulf between that region and the rest of the country: in GDP, and in some cases, even ambition. If there is one lesson from the Brexit vote of 2016, it is that there are towns and communities around this amazing country that feel left behind – shut out from those opportunities and that success. I saw it and felt it myself.
JUN2	Sajid Javid can deliver Brexit - and fuse 'white-van Conservatism' with metropolitan Tories	My Party is in a desperate state. The public are angry with us about our failure to deliver Brexit; confused as to our values and our membership; and our infrastructure is tired and ever-ageing.   Other parties have a simple message, readily understood by voters; Labour - for the underdog; the Brexit Party - leave the EU, as promised; and the Liberal Democrats - Remain. By contrast,  Conservatives are only known for ‘austerity’, for being on the side of the better off - not those who are struggling - and, of course, disunity over EU withdrawal. Is it any wonder that the latest opinion poll has Tories at rock bottom at 17 per cent? We have alienated one coalition of voter after another: women, BME, younger voters and even pensioners over problems like WASPI (women against state pension inequality) - and the seemingly indifferent and callous way we handle these issues.   It is incredible to think that not since 1987 has the Conservative Party been able to gain a significant Parliamentary majority.
JUN2	It’s never too  late for Michael Caine to play an ageing criminal	Sir Michael Caine’s guide to life, Blowing the Bloody Doors Off, is now in paperback so he’s been out and about, talking about himself and MeToo and the end of the casting couch. But while the book is full of good stuff – “make bloody sure you know your lines” – I really think he should be doing something more useful. And that is, of course, a sequel to The Italian Job. We know, because he told us, that there was always a sequel planned to the actual cliffhanger – the ending with half the van hanging over the side of a precipice with $4 million worth of stolen gold on board. His genius idea, as gang leader, was to run the engine, meaning the van “ran out of petrol so the balance went all right. We got out of the coach and then the weight of the gold once we were out pushed it over the edge. Waiting at the bottom of the cliff was the French mafia, and they ran off with it and the sequel was: we chased them through the Riviera”. Terrific, but it won’t do now he’s 86. There will have to be a different sequel, involving the lot of them getting banged up in prison for 50 years, only to emerge in old age, still after the gold. Michael Caine was, alas, wasted in the Hatton Garden heist movie, King of Thieves, but the moral of that episode is that it’s never too late to engage in a life of crime – the gang were, if you recall, pensioners – or to play a superannuated criminal.
JUN2	The pollsters' blatant dishonesty on Brexit is ruining the public trust	My party has just won a national election, yet pollsters are still omitting it from their surveys I am the first to admit that political polls must be taken with a pinch of salt. Their main purpose is to provide a snapshot of public opinion. They often do this perfectly adequately, but only the most complacent political party would ever rely on them wholeheartedly. With that said, history was made at the weekend. For the first time, the Brexit Party topped a national opinion poll. The survey, carried out by polling company Opinium on behalf of The Observer, asked people how they would vote in the next general election.
JUN2	Jacinda Ardern's trendy "wellbeing" metrics are no way to assess an economy	GDP certainly isn’t perfect, but ignoring growth altogether would set us back Gross Domestic Product is a strange statistic. Hardly any politician or economist has a polite word to say about it, and yet it remains, by some margin, the economic measure that everyone pays the most attention to. GDP certainly isn’t perfect. Its industrial-era origins make it better suited to measuring the value of stuff made in factories and bought in shops – not our increasingly digital economy. For example, according to GDP, swapping CDs for Spotify subscriptions has made us all poorer when, of course, the opposite is true. We are paying less for unlimited choice of what we want to listen to, wherever and whenever we want. Online services like Google search are clearly valuable but never make it onto the GDP ledger because they are free.
JUN2	Donald Trump is absolutely right about Huawei, and anyone interested in being PM should listen	Continued dithering over the issue highlights our lack of leadership and strategic thinking Next week, Donald Trump will read the riot act to our Government over the Chinese tech giant Huawei. We – and especially the main Conservative leadership contenders – would be well advised to listen. Huawei is a remarkably fast-growing Chinese tech company which has taken centre stage as the point of tension between China and the United States. It is the subject of a US investigation for fraud and commercial espionage. Despite this, judging by leaks from our own National Security Council, Huawei is likely to be part of the roll-out of the UK’s 5G networks.
JUN2	We've had quite enough of the law-breaking environmental fanatics of Extinction Rebellion	There is no point in beating about the bush. The Extinction Rebellion eco “protesters”, who are reportedly planning to shut down Heathrow airport for a day in mid-June and then for another 10 days in July, if their ludicrous demands aren’t met, are threatening what amounts to economic terrorism. They plan to fly drones above the airport if Heathrow’s third runway project is not scrapped. It is blackmail, pure and simple: if the result is that planes are grounded, as at Gatwick last year, thousands of people will have their holidays ruined and the economic cost will run into the millions; if they are not, their crime could become mass murder. No one sane can support such “activism”. Whatever your views on climate change, and the measures necessary to stop or mitigate it, this is not cost-free or even non-violent protest. If I were to threaten to cut the power to the Treasury building, because I consider the tax burden to be an “emergency” and I deem the Government to be insufficiently serious about addressing the scandalous way our money is wasted, I would expect to be stopped from doing so. For some reason, however, Extinction Rebellion believe they should be allowed to use precisely the same arguments to shut down one of the world’s busiest airports. Why is this the case? To be fair, the police did eventually take a hard line against these people when they blocked roads across London this year. More than 1,000 were arrested, and police chiefs called for the law to be reviewed to ensure that the right to protest does not become a cover for criminal activity. But when I asked an officer at an earlier protest why they did not clear the streets of the Swampy wannabes who were holding up traffic, he said that they had orders not to do so.
JUN2	Our ‘hot or not’ dating culture is turning men into basket cases	One night last week, exhausted from a long day working far from London, I lay in bed. Rather than turn immediately to Call the Midwife’s interminable series five, as I normally do to wind down after a busy day, I found myself on Facebook Messenger, the instant messaging app, where two male friends and I had been discussing incels. Incels are involuntary celibates, a group of sexually desperate men who hate women. Women, in their diseased view, wantonly dole out their bodies to other, better-looking men (who they refer to as “Chads”), meanly and cruelly withholding it from the incels. In some cases, incels set out to get revenge on women and the world through mass murder, successfully in the case of Elliot Rodger, who killed six in 2014 in Isla Vista, California and Alek Minassian, who went on a spree killing 10 in Toronto in 2018.
JUN2	No, poverty isn't rising – but I can't persuade anyone to believe it	The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. It is a truism, a banality, the tritest of observations. And it is utter nonsense. I can’t think of any field of policy where there is a greater distance between perception and reality. When Jeremy Corbyn rails against “rising poverty” at the Despatch Box, we nod along: two thirds of us accept his premise, according to the polls. Yet there is no credible measure by which poverty is getting worse. This is obviously true if we define poverty in absolute terms. Today’s luxuries become tomorrow’s necessities. In the Seventies, poverty meant lack of access to indoor plumbing or a television. Today, those things are near universal. What is the earliest kind of heating you can remember from childhood? There you go.
JUN2	It's pure snobbery that says the young must go to university. They'd be better off as plumbers	Think of the children! The overgrown, daytime-TV-viewing ones, that is. Now that old people are pariahs, picked on by the layabouts in the Lords for having free TV licences and pilloried by Remoaners for making the referendum go the “wrong” way, it makes sense that politicians would suck up to students. After all, with so many years ahead of them and so little experience of the real world, you’ll get a damn sight more bang in the ballot box for your bucks than from some stubborn senior citizen who’s been around long enough to see right through your empty promises. But they’re delicate little flowers and can easily be provoked into staying in bed till the polling stations close. The Lib Dems have already felt their wrath, which must be akin to being slapped around the chops with a twice-used tea bag. Before the 2010 election, Clegg and Co promised to oppose any rise in fees, but once tucked up tidy with their Tory chums they voted to allow universities to charge tuition fees of up to £9,000. This caused student voters to rush into the arms of Magic Grandpa Corbyn in the heady days before the 2017 election, when he claimed that: “Labour will lift this cloud of debt and make education free for all as part of our plan for a richer Britain for the many, not the few.” Sadly, MG mislaid the memory of existing debt to the Student Loans Company, which stands in the tens of billions; asked about the unfairness of leaving those who went to university in the past decade burdened with debt, he doddered: “We never said we would completely abolish it, because we were unaware of the size of it at the time.” That’ll learn him to let Diane do the sums! And now Theresa May has completed her triumphant term of office by revealing the results of the review she commissioned into tuition fees and student debt – a right royal audience-pleaser of the kind we’ve come to expect from her. Fees should be cut – but graduates should pay back more, saddling many with debts well into their 60s.
JUN3	Love Donald Trump or hate him, Britain is in some ways responsible for creating this president	Waiting on the Mall for Donald Trump to arrive at Buckingham Palace, I stood next to an odd sight: a small man sitting on a large man’s shoulders. The one up top was in a Make America Great Again hat; the chap underneath, a flat cap. A journalist tried to get them to talk but the Trump fan refused. His friend, on the other hand, who turned out to be from Yorkshire, was happy to oblige.
JUN3	Only the Queen has the grace to navigate this age of insults	Donald Trump branded the Mayor of London “a stone cold loser” as he landed in the UK yesterday – only to be greeted by a very literal schoolboy taunt himself. In a field near Stansted airport, an 18-year-old eco-activist named Ollie Nancarrow had mown a massive phallus into the grass alongside the words: “Oi, Trump.” Meanwhile, Nigel Farage was busy hurling his own insults at Theresa May, and chanting: “Trump would have got Brexit done by now!” All this as Glastonbury – belatedly remembering Jo Cox – finally axed a band urging people to “Kill Tory Scum” from their line-up, and viewers of ITV’s controversial Love Island – which only started last night – were warned to stop the online trolling that was believed to have contributed to former contestant Sophie Gradon’s suicide.
JUN3	Only conviction politicians can survive in this personality-obsessed era	From Trump to Farage, ideologies are no longer the metrics of success, but bravado and authenticity As Donald Trump touched down at Stansted today, you could almost sense the tears of Twitter-based Lefties spilling onto their computer keyboards. Many are outraged at his visit and will protest against him today at what has been called a “Carnival of Resistance”. Three years after Trump’s victory, they still haven’t come to terms with the fact that he’s president, let alone understood why he won. But it’s not just Trump who has invited this sort of hysterical response. The Brexit Party attracts similar vitriol, from the same demographic, equally perplexed by its mass appeal. Progressives have no answer to Nigel Farage’s political success, and believe that the harder they insult him, the harder he will fall.
JUN3	Boris Johnson has promised to make Brexit mean Brexit — he can't wriggle out of it now	The blond bombshells came thick and fast this morning, with Donald Trump landing in the United Kingdom just before Boris Johnson's Tory leadership campaign hit social media in earnest. Alongside a string of fresh endorsements from fellow MPs, the Back Boris campaign released its first video for Mr Johnson's social media followers. This marks the liveliest level of activity from his camp yet. The most attention Mr Johnson has been getting until now has been due to the attacks from other candidates, such as Rory Stewart. His relative silence, the eminent exception of his Telegraph columns, has been understandable. As the frontrunner, he has a lot to lose by firing back at his junior rivals, as David Cameron found to his cost in 2010 when he agreed to share the same debate stage with Nick Clegg.
JUN3	Yes, private school is still worth it. We are not all slaves to some genetically-determined fate	A cottage in the country. Luxury travel for ever. Early retirement! Give me a moment and I’ll come up with some others. Because I’m just dreaming about what to do with all the money. Have I won the lottery? Yes indeed. And if you’ve got school-age children, you have too. We are, according to Robert Plomin, Professor of Behavioural Genetics at King’s, all winners. Because if you’ve ever considered sending your children to private school, and gnashed your teeth at the hundreds of thousands it will cost you, your troubles are over. Elite schools make no difference, Plomin said at the weekend. Educational attainment is baked into our DNA. Thinking about sending your kids to Eton for the grades? His answer is unequivocal: “Don’t.” At current fees, with two boys, such advice saves you £81,400 a year. Before tax that’s £134,241. And 65p.
JUN3	For Labour's would-be leaders, anti-American grandstanding trumps statesmanship	Politicians like Sadiq Khan are staggeringly unprofessional in their dealings with the President Pity the poor professional protester. No sooner has he put his feet up after a week camping on Westminster Bridge to protest the government not doing his bidding on climate change, but he’s called back to action a few short weeks later to yell into a megaphone in response to President Donald Trump’s state visit. You wonder how he ever gets time to go to work! The visit by Trump is, of course, a first-class opportunity to signal any previously unnoticed virtue. Time was that only the unelected and the fringes of professional politics would grandstand their dislike of the leaders of our closest allies. Harold Wilson, who famously (and rightly) rejected pleas by President Lyndon Johnson to enter the Vietnam War, would never have dreamed of insulting the president publicly, whatever he thought privately.
JUN3	Stop trying to meddle in our affairs, Mr Johnson – the NHS is not for sale	So the NHS is on the table when the US sits down to negotiate a trade deal with the UK. I suppose I should thank the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, for confirming a story I wrote more than a year ago. Alex Azar, the US Health and Human Services Secretary, had made it clear that Washington believed it could bring down the exorbitant cost of drugs paid by American patients by forcing them up elsewhere. His comments were rather interesting. "The reason why they [Britain] are getting better net prices than we get is their socialised system." It is worth reflecting on this.

JUN3	For Ireland's sake, Tory leadership hopefuls need a no-deal Brexit reality check	An increasingly prevalent assumption amongst Brexiteers is that a no deal would be no problem. That the UK can triumph on WTO terms and that once the UK crashes out from the EU without any deal, the EU will be queuing up to quickly agree a free trade deal with the UK, at any price. This line of argument has been well voiced by the most extreme of Brexiteers from the ERG and certain think tanks ever since the referendum result. However, it has worryingly crept into the arguments of the more reasonable Brexiteers or indeed the former remainers who now feel they must deliver any Brexit at this stage to meet the desires of a very small majority of the British population. The gaping holes in the argument that WTO rules are perfectly fine trading rules to go by have been exposed repeatedly and correctly by anyone with a basic level of economic literacy and there is no need for me to add to this not just because it has been done at length already but it would simply be dismissed, incorrectly, by too many as more “project fear”.
JUN3	Brexit will reshape the UK economy for the good and usher in a new social contract	We now know that New Labour ended up practising the worst form of free-market principles. They started (we hope) with good intentions. Making the Bank of England independent of government, for example, was a necessary reform. It was possibly the best financial move Tony Blair and Gordon Brown ever made in office, but that was all the way back in 1997. Thereafter the Blair and Brown project became increasingly enamoured by capitalism and the trappings of comfort, which their association with money afforded them. Brown is famous for championing light touch regulation. In the end, they presided over the creation of mammoth banks, systemically critical but fundamentally flawed. By the time the credit crunch hit in 2008, the UK was bound to take a beating – and the beating we took was nothing short of brutal. Our banking system was bust, the economy went into a nose dive and the number of people unemployed nearly doubled. When the Conservative/ Liberal Democrat Coalition Government took over in 2010, Liam Byrne, the exiting Chief Secretary to The Treasury, left a now infamous note for his successor: “I’m afraid to tell you there is no money left”.
JUN5	Remainer MPs can't stop a new Tory PM determined to complete Brexit	The Conservatives now have a simple choice - leave by hook, or by crook, or face annihilation  Boris Johnson is right: the Tories face extinction if Britain doesn’t leave the EU by Hallowe’en. Trust has evaporated: the Conservative Party’s only hope of survival is some sort of real, meaningful and visible Brexit by the end of October. If our departure from the EU is delayed again, or if Eurosceptic voters believe that they are being fobbed off with a Brexit in Name Only, they won’t return to the party, and it will be toast. The rise of Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party has changed everything.
JUN5	The Left's trendy anti-Americanism reeks of hypocrisy	Hysteria about our most important ally is harmful and ignores other offenders like Germany  America is beastly, isn’t it? Refusing to join the fight against climate change. Using its economic might to bully its allies. Fighting weird culture wars about gay marriage and abortion. Electing a leader with questionable connections to Russia. Now they want to dismember our precious NHS. This caricature of Britain’s most important ally is as stupid as it is dangerous. The United States is our biggest export market, trading partner and source of investment. More of our pensions and savings are invested there than in any other country. Its intelligence agencies work with ours to keep us safe. And – as D-Day's anniversary reminds us – its military strength is the cornerstone of our security.
JUN5	Who'll champion no-deal Brexiteer Tory MPs? Esther McVey is leading the pack	In a field dominated by Brexiteers who want to seek a better deal than what Theresa May agreed, Esther McVey is one of the only Tory leadership candidates who does not want to bother with renegotiation and "embrace" a no-deal exit.  But the former Work and Pensions secretary risks falling at the first hurdle, as the tighter rules around the leadership contest mean that she will need at least 8 MPs to back her campaign in order for it to get off the ground next week. Given that she has not reached that number in public endorsements from MPs, the tighter rule looks "problematic" - as one of her parliamentary supporters acknowledged to me - but I was assured that she "should be okay".
JUN5	It's no wonder people need scepticism training in this era of lazy groupthink	I was put in a bad mood recently after hearing the Turner Prize-winning artist Lubaina Himid on Desert Island Discs. She said she was glad that artists often no longer worked alone, preferring to be members of groups. The word “group” makes grumps like me shudder, being one of those rarely invited to join them. I am wedded to the image of the lonely genius toiling in the attic rather than a culture where the individual counts for less than the group and its inclusivity.  Perhaps I would have been less irritated if individual thought, cherished in the West since the Enlightenment, were not so obviously and everywhere under attack. Or if the resulting lack of ability to think independently were not having such a desultory effect on many areas of our national life. We often hear sad stories about older people being duped by phone fraudsters, but it seems that even extremely bright younger people are credulous, too. Nobody appears to be immune from this plague of uncritical thinking. PwC, the massive accountancy firm, has decided to send its highly paid staff on compulsory classes to “foster scepticism”. They need to be deliberately enabled to challenge their clients. At the moment, apparently, they believe everything they’re told, and the problem has been linked to a string of failures by the company’s employees.
JUN5	Whether Brexit, Trump or strawberry milkshakes, there can be no end to the politics of grievance	The term "fascist" has been devalued to the point of meaninglessness How did we end up here? We’ve become worryingly accustomed to the videos circulating on social media, documenting the hatred and division that has engulfed parts of our country. The latest is a scene in which hysterical, puce-faced anti-Trump demonstrators scream “Nazi” and “fascist” into the face of one of the US president’s supporters, who is then splattered with the inevitable milkshake. When did this kind of behaviour become acceptable? This is Britain, for crying out loud - a country that used to wallow in our reputation for calm, dignified debate. When the tired old question is raised about the qualities that define Britishness, "tolerance" is usually near the top of the list. This is very far from being the case today. Now, we only show respect to those we agree with – the antithesis of tolerance.
JUN5	Right from the start Change UK has been a slapstick party run by clowns. Voters deserve better	As the contestants on Love Island might put it, the launch of the Independent Group all looked good on paper. Yet already, only four months later, this supposedly vibrant new party – since rebadged as Change UK – is limping towards extinction. Six of its 11 MPs have just bailed out following the party's dismal performance in last month's EU elections, when it failed to get a single MEP elected. Now, with Anna Soubry – a Primark Boudicca – at the helm, the prospect of political oblivion can't be far away. They had a chance to pursue a noble mission: to create a credible alternative to a Labour party riven with anti-Semitism. Instead the Remainers in charge turned their collective backs on this goal to parade themselves as a pale, yellowing Lib Dem spin off. In the process they took what should have been a spirited moment in British politics and turned it into the largest collective guffaw since Neil Kinnock fell over on Brighton seafront. The decision to set themselves up not as a new party for Labour supporters sick of racism, anti-Semitism and hard-Left bile but instead as a centrist alternative to the Lib Dems backfired catastrophically. The happy warriors of Change UK, having rolled their tanks onto Vince Cable's lawn, couldn't even engineer a split in the "pro-Remain centrist" wing of British politics. The Strictly Come Dancing alumnus with the puerile "Bollocks to Brexit" slogan annihilated them. 
JUN5	Sorry Boris but even if you pursue no deal now it will be too little, too late to save the Tories	Boris Johnson has warned Tory MPs that a failure to leave the EU on October 31, if necessary with no deal, would mean “extinction” for the Tory Party. He’s right about that, but unfortunately for him and his party it’s very implausible that they will choose to leave by then. According to YouGov, Boris is the only potential leader that would make a material difference to voting intention for the Conservative Party – 29 per cent say they would back the Conservatives with him as leader (and 13 per cent would stick with the Brexit Party) versus 20-22 per cent support for the Conservatives (and 20-21 per cent for the Brexit Party) with any of his main rivals, Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt or Michael Gove. Thus, around one third of Brexit Party voters appear willing to give Boris the benefit of the doubt, at least in the short-term. His problem is that he has no realistic way to get to no deal. Hunt is correct that Parliament will not accept it. Even setting aside the likelihood that Parliament would vote to legislate against no deal, a Boris government that pressed ahead would find itself voted down in a no confidence motion.
JUN5	Project Fear is back – this time with an anti-American twist	Opponents of a US/UK trade deal are grossly exaggerating the risks A trade deal with America, the world’s largest economy and our strongest ally, would be one of the great prizes of leaving the European Union. Only the defeatism and grandstanding of our politicians is standing in our way. President Trump is openly enthusiastic about Brexit, which he reportedly views as a reflection of his own political rise – and he counts Anglophiles like John Bolton among his closest advisers. He has repeatedly voiced his desire to agree a bilateral trade deal with Britain. Yet the old forces of Project Fear have regrouped, following their half-term break, reignited by that favourite pursuit of the chattering classes – anti-American sentiment. Just look at the fallout from remarks made by Donald Trump and the US Ambassador Woody Johnson, who have both suggested that the health service might be "on the table" in the post-Brexit talks. Soon, commentators were warning of Britain “becoming Trump’s prey”, the health service pawned off to our American overlords in a seedy race to the bottom.
JUN5	The D-Day anniversary is a powerful reminder of the importance of keeping our friends close	There are a great many remarkable aspects to the D-Day landings that commenced 75 years ago tomorrow, and the crucial role they played in the liberation of Europe and – ultimately – the defeat of Nazi Germany. First and foremost is the courage and fortitude of those who contributed to the success of the largest amphibious-led invasion the world has ever seen. Then there is the sheer scale of the logistical challenge Operation Overlord involved. Not only did the Allies seek to disembark a force in excess of 150,000 men on the shores of northern France.
JUN5	Patriotic Labour voters will be appalled by Corbyn's anti-Trump agitprop campaigning	Donald Trump heads for Portsmouth at the end of his state visit to begin the formal commemorations of the D-Day landings 75 years ago tomorrow. From now on, the focus of attention should be less on the opinions of the president and more on the solemn events associated with the anniversary. But Mr Trump has a habit of attracting controversy wherever he is and whatever the occasion. His dismissal of the protests against his visit as “fake news” when they could be seen on television, if not from the presidential limousine, was a bit ridiculous. But so, too, were the protests themselves, the offended sensibilities of the demonstrators dampened somewhat by the London rain. Jeremy Corbyn showed once again that he is not a political leader, but an agitprop campaigner, happier on the fringes of politics, denouncing the enemies of the Left, while consorting with the enemies of his own country.
JUN6	The next Tory leader will owe far more to Cameron than Thatcher	Away from Brexit, all the main contenders are united in their support for liberal conservatism It’s still unclear who will win the Tory leadership but it is, by now, becoming clear what will win. Liberal Conservatism is back in the ascendancy, proclaimed not just by Boris Johnson but almost anyone who hopes to beat him. “The L-word is not a dirty word,” Michael Gove proclaimed to a sell-out crowd in Westminster on Wednesday night. As prime minister, he said, he would make Britain the country that liberal-minded people the world over will admire the most. To this race we can add Sajid Javid, an avowed globalist, and Andrea Leadsom, who says she would declare a “climate emergency” on day one. They are all quite serious.
JUN6	The roaring success of Trump's state visit proves the Special Relationship is alive and well	this was one of the most effective overseas visits of the Trump presidency Donald Trump will be pleased with his state visit to the UK this week. And with good reason: from his reception at Buckingham Palace to his trip to Portsmouth to commemorate the D-Day landings, it was a powerful demonstration of the enduring strength of the Anglo-American special relationship, both in optics and real policy impact. What became very clear was that no other country in Europe, let alone the world, can match the UK in terms of historic and strategic importance to the world’s superpower.  Watching on television, tens of millions of Americans will have seen their president hosted in spectacular fashion by the Queen, projecting an image of his statesmanship and gravitas on the world stage. Mr Trump clearly relished the ceremonial aspects of his trip, and his unbridled enthusiasm was apparent for all to see. 
JUN6	Question Time's anti-Brexit bias is getting beyond a joke	A crucial week for the Brexit Party has yielded an exclusively Remain panel One day, I’d like to turn on the TV to watch Question Time, and be greeted by a panel completely devoid of politicians. I know that slightly defeats the point — the show is meant to be a way of holding the powerful to account, after all. But when was the last time it did so? 
JUN6	What would D-Day heroes make of today’s snowflake generation?	When my children were little and attempted to run through traffic or step heedlessly between parked cars into the road, I would invariably grab them and scold: “Girls, some things are worth dying for. Freedom, democracy, human rights, that sort of thing; catching a bus is definitely not one of them.” This week's D-Day commemorations have thrown into sharp relief the servicemen slain in battle 75 years ago in the cause of freedom. Selflessness, courage, a belief that justice must prevail were the forces that drove a generation of young men to lay down their lives so we might live ours in freedom. Our gaze has necessarily been focussed on the past, the pomp, circumstance and pride of victory shot through with grief over fallen comrades and the senseless slaughter that continued even as the Second World War drew to its only possible conclusion.
JUN6	D-Day reminds us that we do not need the EU to pull off great military operations	The 75th anniversary of D-Day has been a humbling reminder of the price of freedom. The First World War was supposed to have been the war to end all wars, yet just two decades later, Britain was forced to stand against Hitler’s war machine. As we reflect on the huge sacrifice made by the generation of World War 2, it is important to remember the lessons from history and not be complacent about the future. Operation Neptune, the combined allied assault on Normandy was the biggest and most complex coordination or air, land and naval forces in military history. It was a truly joint coalition operation between British and American forces, which cemented the special relationship and provided a framework of military cooperation for the formation of Nato. The success of D-Day was the result of unprecedented military joint planning and cooperation. 75 years on, we in the western world have become complacent towards a range of emerging threats to our cherished freedoms and liberal democracy. In the 1930s, there was a general consensus that appeasement was the pragmatic approach towards Nazi Germany. Quite rightly the British public wanted to avoid war, yet failure to prepare for conflict gave Germany the freedom to re-arm and prepare for expansion. Lack of preparation meant that Britain came very close to defeat by Nazi Germany in the early part of the war.
JUN6	Spare me the crocodile tears of the constitutional Johnny-come-latelies and their 'outrage' over prorogation	Never in the history of this country have its people been so ill-served by its elected representatives Brexit has been a learning curve for all of us. Who would have predicted, four years ago, how knowledgeable the average citizen would be about international trade rules? I’m pretty sure we’ve reached an all-time high for the proportion of our countrymen who know what WTO stands for. Nowhere is this more evident than in constitutional matters, where public interest has yielded answers to previously obscure questions, like when and in what circumstances an early general election can be held, or what does a vote of no-confidence in the government actually achieve? Who is Dominic Grieve? Oh, what a time to be a General Studies A-level student!
JUN6	The Miners may have lost their strike, but they won the culture war hands down	The woke Left suffers an extraordinary cognitive dissonance when it comes to fossil fuels  The miners may have lost their last strike 34 years ago, and coalmining may now be a distant memory. But they have unquestionably won the culture war; no other industrial dispute has ever been mythologised and romanticised to such a degree. A lost play about the Battle of Orgreave, the infamous clash between policemen and mine-workers in 1984, is to be staged over three decades after it was written. When I saw the headline (in the Guardian, naturally), my first reaction was: "Oh no, not another one! Please not yet another piece of miners’ strike kitsch." From Billy Elliot to Pride, there are dozens of films, musicals, plays, novels and songs with references to the miners’ strike.
JUN6	D-Day still stands as one of our nation's greatest triumphs	Heroism and courage never go out of fashion and there was plenty of both on display during the Allied invasion of France, probably the most celebrated episode of the Second World War for the Western allies and best-known as D-Day, 6 June 1944. Winston Churchill described Operation Overlord, to give it its official title, as “the most difficult and complicated operation that has ever taken place”; 75 years later it probably still is, representing a triumph of industrial organisation, logistics, coordination and multinational planning. Yet beyond the mechanics of warfare it was also a triumph of ingenuity, improvisation and leadership; and a brutal human drama which is why the story of Normandy continues to inspire. Overlord was an Allied endeavour of unprecedented scope, scale and ambition combining among other elements British, American and Canadian armies and de Gaulle’s Free French. It remains an astonishing example of international military cooperation, the product of lessons learned earlier in North Africa, Sicily and Italy in the orchestration of air, land and maritime forces; but which on D-Day were brought together at a scale never previously or subsequently attempted.
JUN6	Michael Gove is too good to be our next Prime Minister	Leadership contests are exhausting. They’re exhausting for everyone; from political journalists to the general public. With the Tory leadership contest, it’s even more exhausting as it’s a bit like the hokey-pokey. It’s difficult to know who is in and who is out; it feels like it changes daily. It looks like Boris is the frontrunner right now with Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove scrambling at his heels. I have genuine fears that Boris will turn the PM’s job into a farce, and watching Jeremy Hunt cosy up with Donald Trump makes me feel quite uncomfortable.
JUN6	Forget the fall of Standard Oil, antitrust probes into big tech will be far more complicated	After years of slumber, US regulators woke up with a start this week to the antitrust threat posed by Big Tech. In a brief statement issued late on Monday, the House Judiciary Committee sounded the alarm with the announcement that it was launching a “top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms”. For many in Europe, where the fight to defang Big Tech has been underway for years, the US move feels overdue.
JUN7	Shame on the Labour 'moderates' who ditched their lofty stance on anti-Semitism at the first hint of power	The Peterborough by-election proves the Corbynites have total control of the Labour Party According to the 2011 Census, there are just 131 Jews in Peterborough. Today, Labour has had one clear message for them: go to hell. When I say Labour, I don't just mean the party leadership. It wouldn't exactly be hot news to discover that Jeremy Corbyn and his allies treated the Jewish community, whether in Peterborough or anywhere else, with contempt.
JUN7	Why are working-class voters flocking to Farage? Because the Tories have forgotten what they stand for	This week, it was the turn of the people of Peterborough to throw light on the radical transformation of British politics. Coming less than two weeks after the Brexit Party’s victory in the tumultuous European elections to the European Parliament, the Peterborough by-election almost delivered another upset. Labour, whose disgraced MP was convicted for perverting the course of justice and then removed by voters through recall, narrowly clung to power with 31 per cent of the vote. Just 638 votes behind them was the Brexit Party, launched only eight weeks ago and with no data on local voters. Nigel Farage and his party should still have won this pro-Leave seat and their failure to do so reveals his greatest enemy once again: first past the post.
JUN7	Why am I backing Boris? Because he's a real feminist	I first met Boris Johnson eight years ago on Putney High Street. He was out campaigning as mayor of London and I approached him and asked him for a meeting to discuss the issue of female genital mutilation (FGM). I wasn’t a frontline activist on the issue then; I was still too scared to speak publicly about it. I didn’t expect much from him but, having seen the issue of FGM affect the lives of so many girls and women in London, I thought I couldn’t miss this opportunity to talk to the mayor.  I braced myself to be dismissed by one of his henchmen but went ahead and walked up to him, shouting: “Hey Boris, can I please talk to you about helping to end FGM?” To my surprise, he stopped what he was doing and spoke to me. We talked and talked. He asked me questions, wanting to know my experience, and how he could help. He didn’t know much about FGM. It wasn’t the front-page issue it is now – at the time only those of us fighting it or living with its horrific consequences really knew about it.
JUN7	The Brexit Party's mission to remake politics has only just begun - there's plenty to come yet	We are witnessing a dramatic, rapid and undeniable shift in the terrain of British politics – whether the establishment parties want to admit it or not. Take Peterborough as a case in point. In the 2017 general election, the Labour Party won 48 per cent of the vote there, just beating the Tories on 47. Between them they piled up a mighty 95 per cent of Peterborough votes – the embodiment of the old two-party system. By the time of Thursday’s Peterborough by- election, however, everything had changed. The Labour Party clung on to the seat with 31 per cent, while the Tories finished a distant third with 21 per cent. This time the combined total for the two parties barely topped half of the total vote. And coming up between them, just 683 votes behind Labour on 29 per cent, was the Brexit Party. Peterborough, by the way, was Number 201 on the Brexit Party’s list of winnable seats at Westminster. If we can get so close to winning there, then no Tory or Labour seat is safe any longer.
JUN7	The British legal system is criminally underfunded – no wonder we're having to pay judges emergency money	"The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers." What Dick the Butcher meant was killing the lawyers makes for a lawless society – and successive governments have been killing the lawyers and the criminal justice system for some time. Dick the Butcher would have been proud of their method, death by a thousand cuts. The news that top judges are to receive an emergency 25 per cent pay rise because there simply aren't enough of them is the latest nail in the coffin. In my first full year of practice at the criminal bar, 1990, I received around £40,000. That sounds reasonable, but it was the gross figure.
JUN7	Pensions freedom hasn't created a generation of spendthrifts - the real crisis is for future generations	We must help the young workers of today build up meaningful savings When Chancellors stand up to talk about pensions it is rarely good news. But when George Osborne delivered the 2014 Budget and told a stunned House of Commons that people would be set free from the need to buy an annuity, the cheers could be heard around the country. Instead of having to convert their pension pot into a modest fixed income for life, savers would have new choices including drawing as much or as little from their pot as they wanted, when they wanted. To this day, a minority have expressed concern that this new-found freedom would lead to people running out of money prematurely, a view thoughtfully expressed in the Telegraph this week by Paul Johnson, Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Mr Johnson is perfectly right to point out that individuals now have to take more responsibility for managing their money, and that some will under-estimate how long their money will need to last. But I would passionately defend the principle of pension freedoms and think that the doom-mongers overstate their case.
JUN7	Sally Challen's case is a wake-up call for the courts to finally recognise the true severity of coercive control	The long-term impact of domestic abuse is still poorly understood, both by the public and the criminal justice system. For decades, the courts have tended to deal harshly with women who kill their partners, which is why the case of Sally Challen is being hailed as a ground-breaking legal decision. Mrs Challen was convicted of the murder of her husband Richard at the family home in Surrey in August 2010, and given a life sentence. Earlier this year, her conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal but she faced a retrial for murder at the beginning of next month. Now, after months of uncertainty, prosecutors have accepted her plea of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility, avoiding the need for a another trial. It is a victory for her sons, David and James, who have long campaigned for their mother’s release. They say she endured decades of humiliating psychological abuse before she attacked her husband at the former marital home in Claygate.
JUN7	No, Peterborough doesn't mean 'business as usual' for the Labour Party	The by-election simply revealed the political fragmentation caused by Brexit  So that’s it, then. From remarkable victory in the European elections to devastating defeat in Peterborough just a fortnight later. The Brexit Party is little more than a seven-day wonder. Hardly. Winning 29 per cent of the vote, the party’s performance outshone all but the very best of Ukip’s performances at the height of their popularity before the 2015 election. Apart from the two seats, Clacton and Rochester, where local Conservative MPs resigned in order to stand again in Ukip’s colours, only in one instance – in Heywood and Middleton in October 2014 – did Ukip ever win more than the 29 per cent the Brexit Party secured in Peterborough.
JUN7	Rory Stewart has what it takes to lead us through this great Brexit crisis	When the British people voted to leave the EU, they presented us with two challenges. To leave our largest export market and bloc, without harming our economy, to which we were integrated in so many ways for over four decades and secondly to protect the integrity of the UK whilst doing so. We now have one last chance to deliver that. Once again, the hand of history lies on the shoulders of the Conservative Party. This is a serious task, which needs a serious individual. Gimmicks and showmanship have their place, but this is not the time. Honesty, brinkmanship, and delivery are the only qualities in a leader that can save the party and country today. To my mind, one candidate stands out. Rory Stewart.
JUN7	How do you talk to a child about knife crime without making them too scared to leave the house?	I’m worried about how to keep my 11-year-old safe on the streets of London Coming home from the theatre last night, I ran into a traffic jam near the bottom of my road. Blue lights spinning, a thin barrier of police tape. “Another stabbing I expect,” tutted the cab driver. “I don’t know how you can stand to live round here.”  You get used to it, sort of. Two months ago, a teenage boy was stabbed about 60 feet from the desk where I am writing this article. If I crane sidewise, I can see from my window the spot where two grown men rushed at him with knives. But I prefer not to look.
JUN9	Europe has not faced up to the threat of Hizbollah	Iran's primary terrorist proxy group, Lebanese Hizbollah, has been deploying operatives to Europe for many years.  In July 2013, after the group was blamed for the 2012 bombing of a tour bus in Bulgaria, the European Union finally made its move.  The EU designated Hizbollah’s military and terrorist wings, copying a model adopted by the UK. But, critically, it did not designate the entire organisation. 
JUN9	Economic innovation will turn the UK into a clean, green powerhouse	The market, rather than the state, will find the solutions we need for a sustainable future It was a beautiful evening on Saturday, and as I drove through Herefordshire I felt a surging hope for our promethean British ability to tackle the problems of humanity. There in field after field I could see an exotic crop – a cultivable species that I never believed could be made to take root in this country. I thought they needed heat. I thought they needed constant sunshine. It would have seemed unimaginable, 20 years ago, that you could have planted serried ranks of solar panels in this famously temperate and cloud-covered land. And yet here they are today, helping to power our homes and to cut our emissions of CO2 – and with every year they are getting more efficient at harvesting the rays of the sun and turning those golden photons into clean power. 
JUN9	It would be madness to force original thinker Michael Gove out of leadership race	If hypocrisy is the wheel, rather than cocaine snorting, on which Michael Gove is being broken then it’s high time that his critics had a long hard look at themselves. British society is becoming engulfed in one of its "holier than thou" spasms and is determined to drive the Environment Secretary out of the race to be the next leader of the Conservative Party and, thus, Prime Minister. His most serious crime, which he admits and regrets, is that he took the Class A drug on several occasions 20 years ago. But taking on greater importance in the court of public opinion is what is deemed to be a much more heinous offence. This consisted of, having sampled cocaine, writing a thunderer of an article denouncing the use of Class A drugs like cocaine by middle and upper class professionals, saying that their use  added to the misery endured in poorer parts of the country.
JUN9	A curse on our public figures who think it’s cool to swear	Matt Hancock does it. Rory Stewart does it. Even Boris Johnson does it. I refer not to the historical ingestion by Conservative leadership candidates of minute quantities of classified drugs, but to their flamboyant way with a curse word. A year ago, BoJo allegedly dismissed business (or possibly business lobbyists) with a monosyllabic expletive. Hancock recently excoriated his rival’s excoriation, doubling down the same terse Anglo-Saxon imperative. Meanwhile Stewart embarked on a bold excursion into bisyllabic profanity, announcing, “I don’t believe it’s Conservative to b------t”. Andrea Leadsom, keen as always to take her own line across the stiff fences of political debate, doesn’t think it’s Conservative to swear. In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph she admitted to occasional dabbling, “in jest or in frustration”, with swearing, but claimed that “in public discourse I want to set a good example.”
JUN9	The tragedy of Chernobyl sums up the cruel failures of communism	In April 1986, the V.I. Lenin Reactor in Pripyat went into meltdown after a failed safety test. For the last five weeks, HBO’s smash-hit drama Chernobyl has been reliving the disaster at the Ukrainian power plant 33 years ago, recounting the events of that fateful night and the weeks following as the Soviet Union sought to restrict the fallout. What’s most striking is how the disaster acts as a lesson in the wider ecological, social and political catastrophe that was communism in the 20th Century. Those in charge of the plant, the town council and the emergency response, were no more evil than anyone else is anywhere else in the world. To understand the disaster and the reaction of the individuals involved, we have to understand the perverse incentives to which they were responding and the rigours of a Soviet system that brooked no dissent. Anatoly Dyatlov, the Soviet ideologue-cum-scientist who was in charge of the reactor, was convinced that the billowing fallout from Reactor 4 was impossible. The centralised system had instructed him that it was impossible. The KGB’s redactions and imprisonments had ensured that managers knew it was impossible. During his training, rudimentary by Western standards, he’d not been told of the cost-cutting measures which meant the failsafe at the heart of the reactor was actually a catalyst to creating a nuclear meltdown.
JUN9	The idea that Oxbridge is a bastion of white privilege is simply not true	Latest figures show the proportion of BME youngsters at Oxford broadly matches the population at large A bastion of entrenched, wealthy, upper-class, white, southern privilege: David Lammy’s description of Oxford University may be damning, but it is hardly shocking. Elite universities, we are told – often by academics – promote colonialism through the curriculum, practice cultural appropriation in the dining hall and exercise unconscious bias in admissions and assessment. As a result, black and minority ethnic students are far less likely to gain a place in these inherently racist institutions than their white peers. The trouble with this oft-repeated view is that the figures simply do not bear it out. Oxford’s newly released admissions data shows that this academic year 18.3 per cent of places went to black or minority ethnic applicants, more than ever before. What’s more, according to figures cited in the report, this mirrors exactly the proportion of BME 18 to 25-year-olds in the UK population as a whole. The equivalent figure at Cambridge, 23.5 per cent, is even higher. Britain’s top universities are clearly not the bulwark of whiteness that their critics like to suggest.
JUN9	Obese mannequins are selling women a dangerous lie	I fear that the war on obesity is lost, or has even, as is fashionable, ceased to exist, for fear of upsetting people into an early grave. Nike Inc, the multinational company named after the Greek goddess of victory, has introduced plus-sized mannequins to its flagship store in London to “celebrate the diversity and inclusivity of sport”. They wear the famous Nike tick, which says: welcome to the mainstream. Yet the new Nike mannequin is not size 12, which is healthy, or even 16 – a hefty weight, yes, but not one to kill a woman. She is immense, gargantuan, vast. She heaves with fat. She is, in every measure, obese, and she is not readying herself for a run in her shiny Nike gear. She cannot run. She is, more likely, pre-diabetic and on her way to a hip replacement. What terrible cynicism is this on the part of Nike?
JUN9	If we are to have a shred of free speech then we cannot make it illegal to be unkind	Yet more hate crime: Jonathan Osborn, the head of King Edmund School in Essex, discovered an Instagram account (already taken down) poking fun at his school’s teachers. With a whole horrifying 300 followers, the account “mocking” his staff drove Mr Osborn to contact the police, who are now investigating whether a “hate crime” has been committed. Granted, the internet is a more public forum than we had ready access to in my day. Nevertheless, in bathroom graffiti, furtively passed notes in class, or sniggering cliques in the cafeteria, we secondary school students made fun of our teachers all day long. I’m sure we weren’t always kind, or sufficiently appreciative of the sacrifices our hard-working, underpaid instructors made on our behalf. Still. Nobody called the cops. The over-the-top administrative response to anonymous ribbing about, say, what a school source characterised as the “authoritative nature” of certain teachers helps illustrate how blobby and ominously ill-defined this “hate crime” business has become. Inevitably, the vague class of transgression is steadily spreading to encompass any behaviour, outlook, or opinion that someone else doesn’t happen to like. After all, a “hate crime” is identified purely by the fact that an ostensible victim believes he or she has been subjected to one. As according to this definition even a single black look could land you in jail, it’s hardly surprising that hate crimes are on the rise.
JUN9	Scrapping VAT and introducing a lower, simpler sales tax will help Britain to prosper	When it comes to making Britain the best country in the world, I mean business. If I’m Prime Minister of this country I want to ensure it’s the best place in the world to live, learn, raise a family, achieve your potential and start, grow and run a business. That will require someone who is ready to lead our country’s economy from day one and to seize the economic opportunities that Brexit presents, and the chance to change Britain for the better. I grew up knowing and admiring what enterprise can achieve. My dad was a small businessman, running the family fish processing firm in Aberdeen. His hard work didn’t just provide us with a loving home and taxes for public services, he also created jobs, specifically giving young people who had grown up in care a chance to succeed. Business is a powerful force for good in our society, giving individuals the opportunity to earn and belong, generating the economic growth which pays for a civilised society, and powering the innovations which make all our lives better. It’s business that develops the medicines which alleviate pain, creates the technologies which keep us in touch and eliminate the drudgeries of the past, lifts the disadvantaged out of poverty and allows us to clean up our planet.
JUN9	Thought British Remainers were bad? Try explaining Brexit to liberal Americans	Leave supporters may find the implacable self-righteousness of British Remainers trying if not exhausting. Yet that frustration cannot compare with the exasperation of talking to Americans about Brexit. A particular type of American, too: the well-educated coastal Democrat whose views on the UK’s EU membership are as one-dimensional as they are unassailable. Brexit, according to this lot, is a hate crime. Thus in a phone interview for a Boston National Public Radio station during the Trump visit, I found myself talking to a brick wall. I’m not sure how much of our pre-recorded chat about Brexit the programme found usable, because I clearly didn’t say what I was supposed to. “But isn’t it important for nations to cooperate to solve global problems?” asks the interviewer.
JUN11	There's only one man who matters in this Tory leadership race: Boris Johnson	Where is he? Where’s Boris? It’s like waiting for Harry Lime to turn up in the Third Man. Everyone is talking about him, his footsteps can be heard in the dark, a shadow passes in the night. Then, beneath the sudden glare of a lamp, there he is, smirking smugly. Yes, it’s all about me; now the drama can really begin. Read Philip Johnston's latest column on telegraph.co.uk every Tuesday night from 9.30pm  
JUN11	Beijing's encroachment on Hong Kong shows the Chinese regime's terrifying ambitions	Hong Kong’s political crisis should be seen as a salutary lesson in the absolute determination of Beijing’s autocratic regime to get its own way, irrespective of the international condemnation its policies may attract. Ever since Britain was obliged to return its prized colonial possession to China in 1997, successive regimes in Beijing have been quietly encroaching on the quasi-autonomous political system that was bequeathed to the people of Hong Kong when the Union Jack was lowered for the last time. Chris Patten, who enjoyed a fractious relationship with his Chinese counterparts during his ill-tempered tenure as Britain’s governor in the 1990s, voiced serious concerns that, once Britain’s imperial sojourn had ended, Hong Kong would be vulnerable to Beijing’s irredentist designs. 
JUN11	Gagging orders are too often used to cover up illegal treatment in the workplace	We must tackle the indiscriminate use of NDAs and the culture of secrecy that so often surrounds them Every employer, regardless of their wealth or influence, should respect the laws that protect people from bullying, discrimination and harassment at work. Incredibly, some still do not. Concerns have come to the fore yet again with the serious allegations against Philip Green and Arcadia. However, this case is far from an isolated one. Over the past few months, the House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee, which I chair, has heard harrowing evidence of how all too many firms and organisations are tolerating unlawful discrimination and harassment at work. At the heart of this is the misuse of the non-disclosure agreement (NDA), or gagging clauses.
JUN11	The biggest threat to Labour's electoral prospects? Step forward, Michael Gove	No political party, and certainly not a party of government, has ever found itself in the pickle of the sort currently being experienced by the Conservative Party. So it struck me as rather strange that reports of last night’s meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) suggested that the main opposition is having almost as difficult a time of it. Even long-term supporters of Jeremy Corbyn (and there are not many of those) took the opportunity to castigate the leader over his triangulation on Brexit, warning him that he’s losing support among disillusioned party members. One MP leaving the room afterwards described it as “the worst meeting in his time as leader”. That’s quite a claim, given the tumultuous events that have punctuated Corbyn’s tenure in the last four years. Perhaps these MPs are coming to the realisation that however entertaining the Conservative leadership campaign is, it will come to an end at some point in the next six weeks. And shortly after that, attention may well refocus on Labour’s own leadership just as, in the aftermath of Margaret Thatcher’s removal as Conservative leader and prime minister in November 1990, unwelcome attention was brought to bear on Neil Kinnock’s continuing leadership of the Labour Party.
JUN11	Boris Johnson's rivals are desperate to take him on. Should they be careful what they wish for?	Where's Boris? That has been the mantra encouraged by his leadership rivals as they make the most of the spotlight to set out their stalls, exploiting the fact that they have been much noisier than the leadership frontrunner, who launches his campaign officially tomorrow. To be fair to Mr Johnson, he can be justified in taking his time given how much he has given his rivals to talk about with the little he has said so far. They have been piling in over his suggestion earlier this week that he would cut taxes for workers earning from £50,000 to £80,000, but have they fallen into a trap? Headlines like "Johnson's rivals denounce tax giveaway" will lead many to conclude that the frontrunner is the biggest tax cutter in the race, with those attacking him for wanting to slash income tax for more than three million people. By kicking up such a fuss about his plans, they are giving his tax plans more prominence than anyone else's, just when his lesser-known leadership rivals need all the attention they can get to set out their stalls in order to impress Tory voters.
JUN11	Whatever Michael Gove put up his nose, he’s blown it now	As it is now compulsory to fess up to one’s drug-taking past, I should probably admit that I have twice been in the presence of cocaine. On each occasion, it was at a party in the Nineties hosted by journalists from The Times. Was Michael Gove, then a columnist for that paper, taking one of his incriminating snorts nearby? I have no idea. What I do remember is how furtive adults, acting like they were doing something thrillingly edgy and dark, seemed both tedious and oddly pathetic. (Cocaine makes you chunter more nonsense than a leadership candidate.) As the closest Himself and I have ever come to edgy is Playschool’s Through the Square Window, we made our excuses and left.

JUN11	How Labour plan to wrest control of Parliament in a last-ditch effort to block no-deal	Here we go again. Labour have tabled a new motion for tomorrow’s Opposition Day debate, paving the way for MPs to introduce and pass legislation in June – as they did in April – to constrain a new Prime Minister’s ability to pursue no deal on 31 October. Crucially, MPs are not being asked to commit now to a specific course of action, only to sign up to the principle of securing the opportunity to act on 25 June. It’s hard to whip against, particularly when the government has already suffered a collapse in authority. If the motion does pass tomorrow, it will secure the 25 June, potentially for the introduction of a Bill on the same day, which would restrict a new Prime Minister’s room for manoeuvre. It is likely that this would become law before the next PM takes office at the end of July. Though it could be slowed down for a time by a resolute government and a very disciplined large group of peers, the government did not adopt that strategy the first time around, and I doubt they will now. The legislation, when it comes, must relate to the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, but no further detail has been provided.
JUN11	Boris's path to Number 10 is clear. The only thing standing in his way is an overly-cautious approach	Of all the leadership contenders and their followers, it is perhaps most tense in Boris Johnson’s camp right now. The former Foreign Secretary may be the odds-on favourite; but no Conservative has managed to win the top job from this lofty position in the modern era. I can well understand this anxiety about not wanting to put a foot wrong – particularly bearing in mind the colossal disaster of his last campaign - so it is unsurprising that Boris’ team is running a low-key effort this time. They will believe that Johnson, so clearly ahead with MPs and party members, simply needs to avoid slipping up during the next few weeks. Yet although this course of action has its merits, it is beginning to draw some damaging fire from other candidates and his critics. This strategy also overlooks Boris’ obvious strengths, which I have witnessed first-hand. When I was seeking election to Parliament in 2005, Boris's campaigning efforts went above and beyond his duty to help me. He campaigned in my constituency several times and I saw just how effective an operator he is, able to connect with people from all walks of life. 
JUN11	Slash BBC pay so the over-75s can keep their free TV licences	Gosh, it seems like only last week that we were honouring D-Day veterans and saying what a huge debt this country owes them. Maybe that’s because it was last week. A fact that seems to have escaped the BBC, which thinks now is a good time to announce that, actually, it’s a million veterans who owe them a debt. One hundred and fifty-four quid and fifty pence, to be precise. From June next year, people aged 75 and over will no longer be entitled to a free TV licence. That’s up to 3.7 million viewers and listeners, many of whom are hard up and isolated and who rely on television and radio for a connection to the outside world. Only low-income households with someone in receipt of the means-tested pension credit will be able to claim a free licence. “Copying the current scheme was ultimately untenable,” according to BBC Chairman David Clementi. “It would have cost £745 million a year (about a fifth of the BBC budget) by 2021/22 and risen to over one billion by the end of the next decade.” The BBC claims that maintaining the universal scheme would have necessitated the closure of BBC Two, BBC Four, the News Channel, Radio Five Live and BBC Scotland.
JUN11	Proroguing Parliament is not illegal, but it would blow up British politics	One of the things which has set Rory Stewart apart in this rather uninspiring Conservative leadership campaign has been his embrace of old-fashioned campaigning. There has been a definite whiff of Gladstone’s Midlothian campaign in his mass meetings and his rhetoric. But I was nonetheless surprised when I noticed him on Twitter branding proposals to prorogue Parliament ‘unlawful’. On the contrary, proroguing Parliament can only be illegal if it breaks one of more of the laws of this land. I didn’t come across such a law when I recently researched this question, nor have I seen one mentioned by prorogation’s many opponents. Some suggest the courts might be able to rule it ultra vires, but that is at best an untested claim. Today we learn that Mr Stewart has taken the sensible precaution of asking Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, to fact-check his rhetoric – and the Government’s senior law officer has said that proroguing Parliament would not be unlawful.
JUN13	Boris Johnson and Michael Gove could be an unbeatable team	The likely next PM needs someone who can tame government if he wants his premiership to soar Even someone with Boris Johnson’s powers of self-sabotage will struggle to mess this up now. He is almost embarrassingly far ahead, with more MPs behind him than the three next most popular candidates put together. If he ends up facing the not-entirely-terrifying Jeremy Hunt, as looks likely, victory is all but guaranteed. He used to speak about seizing the ball, should it come loose from the scrum. In the event, it seems that the ball might end up landing straight in his hands. It’s a bit worrying. He has barely said a word in this campaign. All is being taken on trust. His premiership could be a gravity-defying electoral success, like his time as Mayor of London. Or it could be a disappointing flop, like his time as Foreign Secretary. We just don’t know. Nor do his supporters. They can hope. They’ve seen how he can bring optimism, energy and purpose to campaigns. But they’ll have heard stories about how, in office, he can be distant, scatty and dangerously inconsistent. It doesn’t depend on his mood. It depends on his team.
JUN13	Dear Sir Philip - if you want to rescue the British high street, just ask a woman	IT rather sticks in the craw to have TopShop boss Sir Philip Green mansplaining that the High Street has “fundamentally changed”. Maybe if the discredited Arcadia founder had focussed more on management of his bottom line and less, as it’s alleged, on the bottoms of his line managers, he would have noticed the decline in sales a lot sooner. But he’s been bailed out and is grumpily gearing up to temporarily abandon his superyacht in Monaco while he sets about reinventing Dorothy Perkins for the hashtag generation. I’m sure a 67-year-old dude with a chip on his shoulder about the fact the British public “get jealous” at his wealth is just what’s needed to coax young people back into spending their hard-earned in Miss Selfridge. 
JUN13	Dear Mr Johnson, prove to us sceptical Scots that you are 'Boris the Brit'	Dear Boris, First of all congratulations. That you have won such solid backing from among the people you work with on a daily basis can only be a significant fillip to your chances of becoming the next leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, as all Telegraph men and women know only too well, popularity is not a permanent position. Or as  you might put it: Ante victoriam ne canas triumphum.
JUN13	The Jo Brand scandal has revealed the Left's hypocrisy, but the answer isn't yet more censorship	We comedians must have the right to experiment with ideas While heads in Westminster were fixed on the Tory leadership race, a scandal was erupting over the radiowaves. Comedian Jo Brand, speaking after a number of European election candidates were covered in milkshakes last month, quipped that since “certain unpleasant characters are very easy to hate… why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?”. Her remarks immediately triggered outrage from many on the right of the political spectrum, including Nigel Farage, one recent victim of ‘milkshaking’, who branded the incident ‘incitement to violence”, and called for a police investigation, reportedly now under way. 
JUN13	I am in this leadership race to win – and I'm not going anywhere	Conservatives should never be afraid to get out there and make their case to the country I started as the 100:1 candidate in this race to choose the next Conservative leader and our country’s Prime Minister and I now find myself coming through, in the latest poll, second to Boris among Conservative Party members. As a Cumbrian MP, it feels a little like Carlisle United making it to Wembley. And it is particularly surprising because while other candidates have concentrated on Westminster I have been out listening to the public. I’ve met nurses and sheep-farmers, designers of robots and third generation market traders, in Londonderry and Derby, Edinburgh and Peterborough, Wigan, Woking and Warrington.
JUN13	Boris Johnson has given Tory voters reason to hope for a free markets revolution	The ball is well and truly loose from the back of the scrum. My friends, it is Boris who has grasped it. By the sheer number of his colleagues pledged to him it seems apparent to all that he’s in with the best shot at the top job. The confessional stage continues to bedraggle the campaign as candidates are asked what they have smoked and snorted over the years. When quizzed yesterday at his launch, Boris said that the law-breaking he was most likely to have engaged in was not sticking to the speed limit on motorways.  This wasn't what Boris was there for though, and he stuck to the task in hand, saying he’d only reach the top, and the Tories only stay in power, by “extolling the merits of free market capitalism”. The use of capitalism was not a slip of the tongue. No, he was adamant it is the best way to "support the poorest and the neediest in society". Boris is right, free market capitalism has allowed over a billion people worldwide to lift themselves out of poverty in the past twenty years, and means we’re living longer and happier lives. This optimism provides an important contrast with the Marxist policies of Corbyn and McDonnell that ruined the lives of countless millions in the last century.
JUN13	Britain deserves a proper leadership showdown, with Rory and Boris in the final two	The votes are in from the first round of the Conservative leadership contest and Boris Johnson has had a blinder. With 114 votes, more than the next three candidates put together, he looks to have all but guaranteed his place in the last two. The theory that MP’s would block his path is in tatters and this leadership race doesn’t look like it’s going to be much of a contest.   It seems highly unlikely that any of the other contenders trailing in Johnson’s wake are going to beat him with the membership. So, what we need now to make this contest genuinely interesting is a fierce face-off between two contrasting Tories: Boris Johnson and Rory Stewart. Stewart, who scraped through with 19 votes, is the only candidate who will give Boris a tough time in a round of hustings. There will be nowhere to hide. While other candidates have taken pot shots, Stewart will really take the gloves off and Boris won’t be able to bluster his way through without being held to account and facing seriously troublesome resistance.
JUN13	Tory MPs who want to thwart Brexit will now have to accept that the game is up	As the smoke clears after the first skirmishes of what will still be a long battle to inherit Theresa May’s crown, the picture becomes much clearer as to which combatants will get the chance to pitch to the Conservative Party’s 160,000 paid up members next month – and inherit the biggest political crisis since WWII. Of course, the stand out winner was Boris Johnson with over a third of the vote in a ten-way contest. A disciplined and focused backroom team, a data driven operation, lots of mingling with MPs, policy ideas on Tory territory (tax cuts to foster ambition and aspiration for the middle classes), a tight script and fewer spontaneous verbal eruptions - as well as his trademark Ronald Reagan-esque sunny and optimistic messages – have given him an all but nailed on chance of reaching the last round. Talking about how great British people are and not how great he is was a simple strategy but it was effective. Just last week we were told that the failure of the Brexit Party to take Peterborough would deflate Boris’s “Cometh the hour, cometh the man” sales pitch. Yet he added a mighty 30 votes on top of the 83 he already had publicly declared by Wednesday night.
JUN13	Boris Johnson has large support but there is still a path to victory for Jeremy Hunt	The outcome of the first ballot for the leadership of the Conservative Party didn't throw up any real surprises after all. Those who were likely to go out of the contest went, in cricketing parlance, having barely troubled the scorers. Those who have always been also-rans remained also-rans, failing to break through. Boris won by a big margin, Hunt came a solid second and Gove's vote held up. This may be the first Conservative leadership election in modern times that runs strictly according to form. Where is the often referred to voting duplicity of Conservative MPs when you need it to make things more exciting? 
JUN13	Sorry to burst the 'Boris-mania' bubble, but even he will struggle to save the Tories now	As one would have expected, the Tory leadership battle has rapidly turned into a struggle between those that want to rule out no deal (such as the supporters of Jeremy Hunt) and those that say the UK must leave on October 31st even if (as seems certain) that means leaving with no deal (such as Boris Johnson). Some of the candidates are saying they will renegotiate May’s deal with the EU, so as to remove the backstop. The EU has been crystal clear that it will not agree to do that. So the key question those candidates should be pressed on is: “What will you do if and when the EU refuses to renegotiate?” On the other side, candidates such as Boris have their own problems. They say we will leave even with no deal, but how do they propose to deliver that? Dominic Raab says he might consider proroguing Parliament and Boris Johnson has not ruled that out.
JUN14	The Tory survival instinct has finally kicked in: only Boris can deliver Brexit	It has at last dawned on the party's MPs that a Leaver is best placed to do the job and keep Corbyn out I can remember learning to read. I found the process slow and painful. It took so long to work out simple sentences, saying words syllable by syllable – “Far-mer Dan has a trac-tor” etc – before I could piece them together. And then, after a seeming eternity, it suddenly became easy. The words’ meaning leapt from the page, and I was away. For three years this coming Sunday, the majority of our political and media classes have been agonisingly slow in learning how to read referendum democracy. They could not or would not see that if you invite people to decide something important and they do so, in the largest vote on anything ever in this country, you must sincerely enact their decision. Even though Parliament passed Article 50 and the Withdrawal Act, both of which make leaving without a deal the law of the land if all else fails, many MPs still refused to admit the consequences. They chose, assisted by Mr Speaker Bercow, to destroy their own constitutional procedures in order to make their previous decisions invalid.
JUN14	The West will struggle to contain the escalating crisis in the Gulf	Iran's hardline government sees confrontation as a means of dividing their opponents The world has got so used to the war of words between Washington and Tehran that the risk of deadly conflict was largely discounted. Or at least it was until yesterday, when President Trump accused Iran’s Revolutionary Guards of being behind the attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf over the last month. Suddenly the political temperature has shot up.  It is easy to see how this crisis could spiral out of control. If hardliners in Iran calculate that America would never risk trying to invade a well-armed country with three times the population of hornets’ nests like Iraq and Afghanistan, they could keep upping the ante. At the same time, the US will struggle not to retaliate more harshly against repeated Iranian interference with the world’s oil supply.
JUN14	My mad first week in Brussels as a Brexit Party MEP	Eurospeak, pointless bureaucracy and an unceasing gravy train; Brussels has exceeded expectation I’m no stranger to Brussels, having been a regular visitor over a 40-year career in business. But I’ve just been back, and this time into the belly of the beast: I was being inducted as one of the new Brexit Party MEPs. My trip began, quite literally, on the “gravy train”. I have never travelled in Eurostar first class before, but we were instructed that it is de rigeur to take the most expensive means of transport lest we let the side down. The EU seems to insist on this, even if it means a ridiculously circuitous route.
JUN14	Hong Kong  shows that the West has lost its confidence in democracy and self-determination	Three years ago I happened to be in Hong Kong as the “Umbrella Protests” were sputtering out. The pro-democracy demonstrators were still there, almost two years after they had first set up camp outside the government headquarters. But now, on a drizzly day, they were sitting huddled under the walkways off what had been the main protest site, their umbrellas practical as well as symbolic as their numbers and hopes dwindled. It was a depressing sight, these few locals hoping for some support that never arrived. But in some ways what struck me more were the conversations I had in the weeks after that visit, as I happened to pass in close succession through the capitals of France, Britain and America. In Paris I described the situation to friends. They listened with furrowed brows as I told them about the abduction of the Hong Kong booksellers and the tightening of Beijing’s grip on the island. All lamented the situation. But then came the inevitable reply: “Bah. But what are you going to do? It’s China.” I wished the responses in London had been different. But while the brows were equally furrowed, and some palpable embarrassment showed itself on the faces of officials, still the statement would come back. “But it’s China.”
JUN14	At last the serial flip-flopper Chuka Umunna has found the party that's right for him	How much of Change would Chuka chuck if Chuka could chuck Change? The answer, it turned out, was that Chuka would chuck all of them, which means it’s all change once more. It must be difficult for Umunna, a man of such ceaseless ambition, to find himself in his current predicament. In 2012, Channel 4 News labelled him the “British Obama” (quoting a Wikipedia entry it turned out emanated from his office) and in an interview with the programme, he spoke of being both ‘impatient’ and ‘hungry’ for government, a good three years before Ed Miliband’s departure. He referred to the coalition government of the time as ‘heartless and hopeless'. A botched election, leadership campaign, unsuccessful insurgency against the winner and failed new party later, and Chuka now finds himself in the hopeless home of the heartless, shaking hands with Vince Cable.
JUN14	Whether it's milkshakes or battery acid, attacking politicians is bad for democracy	How often do you feel incited to violence when listening to Radio Four? Like me, I suspect you get the urge quite a lot, be it listening to yet another sanctimonious lecture on Thought for the Day, or being bored to tears during Money Box Live. I'm joking, of course. R4 listeners are, of course a genteel bunch, who, even when seriously miffed, will normally do nothing more radical than complain earnestly to its “Feedback” show.  That, though, hasn't spared comedian Jo Brand from a police investigation for incitement to violence over a joke this week about throwing battery acid at politicians.
JUN14	Chuka Umunna is the future of politics. It's the fake loyalty of Labour moderates that looks unprincipled	I hope Chuka Umunna has a thick skin. His announcement that he has joined the Liberal Democrats was leaped upon gleefully by people who – let’s be frank – do not have the Streatham MP’s best interests at heart. And who can blame them? A matter of a few weeks ago he sought, along with eight of his former Labour Party colleagues and three ex-Conservative MPs, to launch a new centre party that would provide a safe haven for everyone who feels politically homeless in this era of Brexit chaos. Alas, a series of missteps, including the crucial timing of the launch, meant that the early excitement of the event diminished quickly. When the Liberal Democrats emerged as the main beneficiary of angry Remainers’ votes in the run-up to both the local and the European parliament elections in May, Chuka could see the writing on the wall. The new Change UK (or whatever it is called by the time this article is posted) split and Chuka was briefly an independent MP before deciding to take the LibDem whip. The facts tend to indicate that his skin is indeed thicker than it was just four years ago, when he announced his bid to take over as Labour leader in the wake of the party’s dismal showing at the 2015 general election. That campaign lasted only slightly longer than it takes to boil an egg and he withdrew, citing vague concerns about media scrutiny. And while joining the Liberal Democrat benches in the Commons would normally be considered an astute way of avoiding media attention, for Umunna it is a red rag to his many detractors.
JUN14	Boris Johnson has shown his rivals up before on TV. He can do so again in the race to be PM	Boris Johnson won so many votes from his fellow Tory MPs yesterday that his three nearest rivals, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Dominic Raab, would still trail him if they added the votes they got together. So it makes sense why they are so eager to face him in the studio. All of Mr Johnson's rivals have agreed to appear on televised leadership debates this Sunday (on Channel 4) and Tuesday (on the BBC), with Channel 4 threatening to represent him with an empty lectern, in the hope of bouncing him into taking part. The Foreign Secretary went as far as to use Mr Johnson's authorship of a book on Winston Churchill against him, asking pointedly on the Today programme what "Churchill would say" about an aspiring prime minister "hiding away". Mr Johnson has now said he would be "more than happy to do the BBC TV debate" next Tuesday after MPs have whittled down those in the race further, although it is easy to see why he has not rushed to share a studio with all of his opponents, as evidenced by him still leaving Channel 4 hanging. What would he, or the viewer, have to gain? A six-way Tory leadership debate would yield a similar level of debate to ITV's messy 2015 seven-way clash, in which the discussion never ventured beyond glib talking points and prepared gags. Only David Cameron and Ed Miliband had any realistic chance of being the next Prime Minister, but they were saved from any serious scrutiny by the fact that the debate had to make sure to include the likes of Leanne Wood, Nicola Sturgeon and Natalie Bennett.
JUN14	After Brexit, let’s take back control of agriculture	The EU has had successes and failures in various different policies it has implemented, but there are few areas where the wins have been neutralised at best and wiped out at worse, by the losses. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is one such area. In its stated objective of supporting the livelihoods and lifestyles of farmers, the policy has unambiguously achieved its goals; in all other aspects it has been an abject failure. Under the CAP and the EU’s Common External Tariff, inefficient producers have been subsidised, affordable imports have been excluded from European markets and technological innovation has been stifled. As a result, consumers have paid higher prices, producers have become less competitive globally and the whole of society has had to pay an increased environmental cost thanks to more land being handed to farmers and greater use of outdated pesticides. Of all Brexit’s challenges and opportunities, reform of the CAP might be the greatest. The only way to begin such reform is with a clear statement of what your goals are. A new report from the Institute of Economic Affairs, Fertile Ground: Opportunities and challenges for UK agriculture, does just that. This report makes the case that the goals of an independent UK agricultural policy should be as follows: the provision of good quality, affordable food to consumers; supporting farmers such that they can compete in global and UK markets; and, protecting the UK’s environment.
JUN14	Complacent frontrunners ought to be wary of dismissing Rory Stewart as a 'vanity candidate'	I put £20 on Rory Stewart yesterday morning to be in the final two of the Tory leadership contest. I got 8/1, but those odds have now shortened to 5/1, not far behind Michael Gove (9/4). Rory is now officially the dark horse candidate. He doesn’t have a hope of winning, of course. He’s made no bones about the fact that he will do everything in his power to stop a no deal Brexit and 66 per cent of Conservative Party members are in favour of no deal. But he seems to be emerging as the favourite of the Tory Remainers. And according, to a poll for the Conservative Home website, he is now the second-most popular candidate after Boris. Rory began the campaign as the comedy candidate, with his amateurish social media campaign and his confession about smoking opium. A rank outsider whom most people thought would fail to secure the backing of enough MPs to get on the ballot, he was dismissed as an attention seeker who was more interested in re-tweets than votes.
JUN16	Trump is right about London's spiralling crime crisis	The president of the United States might have better things to do than engage in a war of words with Sadiq Khan. But Donald Trump evidently finds the Mayor of London irksome enough to aim some of his renowned Twitter salvoes in the direction of City Hall. Mr Khan, it may be remembered, denounced the president’s state visit to the United Kingdom and was in turn dismissed as a “loser” by Mr Trump, in a somewhat petulant exchange. This time he called him a “national disgrace” who is destroying Britain’s capital. The Left is outraged that their champion should be criticised yet again, even though they reserve the right to castigate Mr Trump over anything he says or does. But context is all. The president was responding to exchanges concerning another spate of murders in London with which Mr Khan appears to be unable or unwilling to get to grips.
JUN16	Let’s reboot 'left-behind' Britain with a turbo-charged broadband revolution	I was speaking to some Lincolnshire Conservatives the other night, and there was one thing those farmers wanted me to do to improve their lives – and they wanted it done as fast as possible. Yes, they want a good Brexit by October 31, and if I am elected, that is certainly what we will do. Yes, they want a government that will champion British farming and British food production; and as someone who partly grew up on a family farm (milked cows, dipped sheep) I am totally committed to supporting farming and rural life. But when I mentioned another priority of mine – almost casually – those farmers smote their weatherbeaten hands together and roared their assent. They want better broadband. They are indignant at the current failure to provide it – and they are absolutely right. A fast internet connection is not some metropolitan luxury. It is an indispensable tool of modern life. You need it for your medical prescription, for paying your car tax, for keeping up with the news and with your family and friends. It is becoming the single giant ecosystem in which all economic activity takes place. It is the place you find bargains. It is the place you find customers. It is not only the place you can find a job. It is the means by which you can be interviewed, and your talents uncovered, without incurring the cost of a rail ticket. If your area has a truly fast broadband connection, that area will be a better place to live, to invest, to set up a business; and that area will have a better chance of retaining talented young people, and allowing them to start up businesses and bring up their families.
JUN16	To save our country from Corbyn, the next PM must do a deal with Nigel Farage	During the 2016 referendum campaign Nigel Farage famously declared that if Leave won there would be no need for him to remain a political player in British politics. Presumably he assumed that, should the country vote to break from the EU, the natural party of government and patriotism, the Conservatives, would then ‘own’ Brexit and dominate the issue so as to render all opposition to it to the wrong side of history. However, that was before the 2017 election and you know the rest. Since then Tory ownership of Brexit has floundered in a swamp of its own factions. Whether or not Farage becomes seduced by success and sees government as a realistic possibility in an electoral cycle or two remains to be seen. If a Brexit acceptable to him is achieved maybe he will return to a career as a polemic celebrity or fade into statesman-like retirement. I doubt it though. A YouGov voting intention poll published on Sunday puts the Brexit Party in first place on 24 per cent, three points ahead of the Tories. One can see the likelihood of the Brexit Party splitting the Right-wing at the next general election, ruining prospects for the Tories for at least a generation and allowing a genuinely socialist Labour Party to play merry hell with society and the economy.
JUN16	Forget utopian schemes for net-zero: here’s a solution that can actually work	If the British government declared the abolition of sin by 2050, commentators would be rightly cynical. The announcement last week that Britain will enact a net-zero carbon target for 2050 was instead welcomed, especially by “faith leaders”. Yet without specifying how it is to be achieved, setting this target is about as wishful as pledging to eliminate sin. It is not just a matter of cost – although £1 trillion is not small change (if you had been spending a pound a second and had now reached £1 trillion, you would have had to start when Neanderthals were still on the scene). Too many Tories think that going green means getting into lucrative bed with the crony-capitalist wind and solar industries, putting profit-seeking lipstick on a subsidy-dependent pig. But this is a futile strategy, politically as well as practically. In Britain last year, generously using the Final Energy Consumption metric, 4 per cent of energy came from wind and solar, 3 per cent from nuclear and less than 1 per cent from hydro, the three zero-carbon sources. The common misconception that wind and solar are bigger contributors comes from forgetting that electricity is just 20 per cent of energy: the rest is heat, transport and industry.
JUN16	Britain is headed for the one outcome we thought impossible: a Marxist-led government	What if we have left it too late? What if three years of dreary and petulant delay have made possible the one outcome that, in a country like Britain, should have been impossible – namely the election of a Marxist-led government? Had Theresa May stood down after the 2017 election, the Conservative Party would now be hoovering up mainstream Labour voters repelled by Jeremy Corbyn. Had she been ousted last December, her successor would have inherited a healthy lead. But now the opinion polls have the Conservatives in fourth place – something that has never happened before. According to Electoral Calculus, the party would win just 22 seats. The Tories are belatedly holding the leadership contest they should have held three years ago. This time, the contenders are clever, charismatic and qualified. They fizz and gurgle with brilliant ideas, from well-aimed tax cuts to ways of easing the housing shortage. There is a parallel universe somewhere where the Tories were spared the three-year Theresa May hiatus. In that universe, Britain has left the EU, the Labour Party has been pulled apart by the tensions between its MPs and its Trotskyist activists, and we have avoided a hideous culture war that expresses itself in broken friendships, malicious lawsuits and hurled milkshakes.
JUN16	Forget paying the licence fee or not – the BBC should just scrap it all together	When one is used to having something for nothing, it hurts to be asked to pay for it: hence the howls that have accompanied the BBC’s decision to scrap universally free-of-charge television licences for the over-75s. Lord Hall, the director-general, has been challenged to explain his reasoning for this flagrant violation of elderly rights; but it would, surely, be more pertinent to ask him to justify why there should be a licence fee at all. In the days – well within living memory – when the only way to receive a television picture was through an aerial on the roof, and it was provided either by the BBC, funded by a licence fee, or by Independent Television, funded by advertising, one could make an argument for the public to pay a tax to receive those pictures, so that the tax could fund the public service broadcaster.
JUN16	Cocaine users and hypocrites - both are morally cretinous	Complete disclosure: from the age of 25 until the age of 55 I took enough cocaine to stun the entire Colombian armed forces. What a good job I don’t want to be leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party of the United Kingdom! Not only did I inhale, but I purchased hundreds of pounds-worth a week and gave it to people who had never used it before, including many much younger than me. I didn’t break down, go bankrupt or ruin my health, so there’s no moral to this story that might redeem it. And then, four years ago, I gave it up without so much as a backward glance, because I discovered the simple secret of drugs; that they are an optical illusion which appear to expand your life while actually shrinking it until it’s a withered husk of what it could have been. I’m not ashamed of anything I’ve written here, but I’d prefer to have given up for moral reasons, as I now view cocaine users with extreme distaste. The other day a friend told me that a coke dealer who looked about 14 came over to deliver, dressed unusually smartly in a suit. When this was commented on, he remarked: “Yes – I’ve been to X’s funeral.” X, too, had been a teenage drug dealer.
JUN16	Boris Johnson is supporting my agenda – which is why I'm supporting him	The Conservative Party needs to become a natural home for voters in hard-working communities who have been abandoned by Jeremy Corbyn’s divisive Labour Party. If we are to win again we have got to deliver for our people in the North, the Midlands and the regions, and we need a leader who can reach out to them.  In 2016, 17.4 million people voted to leave the European Union – not because they wanted us to pursue an isolationist future, but because they were filled with hope; hope and optimism that, free from the backward-looking and undemocratic institution that is the EU, the UK would be able to thrive by controlling its own destiny.
JUN16	Can Britain afford not to embrace Boris’s middle class tax cuts?	The bad arguments made against Boris Johnson’s tax cut plans by his leadership rivals tell you a lot about the state of the Tory party. First, they contend, raising the 40p income tax threshold favours the “wrong” groups. What do they mean? Implicitly, that tax cuts should only ever be enacted as a cynical electoral ploy, to satisfy favoured voters, not as a principled move to allow people to keep more of their own money because that is the right thing to do. The second line of attack is more specific: tax cuts shouldn’t benefit the “wealthy”. Never mind that someone earning £60,000 isn’t all that rich – especially if they’re in a single earner household, with children and a mortgage. This argument betrays a lack of intellectual self‑confidence, seen in everything from the willingness of many Tories to bow before Left-wing cultural totems to their slavish belief in an unreformed NHS. Since Left-wingers, even the self‑loathing prosperous ones, consider the wealthy to be wicked, some Conservatives feel the need to think so, too.
JUN17	'People power victory' in Hong Kong looks more like a tactical retreat	Carrie Lam’s apology over the extradition bill would appear to be a victory of democracy and “people power”. People 1: Beijing 0.   However, it’s worth looking a bit further into why the Hong Kong government apparently backed down in order to understand the wider implications of China’s impact on the city, and by extension the West’s relationship with Hong Kong and China. There are a number of possible reasons for Lam’s climbdown, which broadly fall into three categories: the democratic victory, external pressure and tactical retreat. In the first instance, it does seem that the government of Hong Kong was completely unprepared for the huge outpouring of dissent. 
JUN17	A pact with the Brexit Party would be an admission the Tories are dead	An electoral pact would be an admission that the Conservative Party is dead The European election was not quite an extinction-level event for the Tory party, but it was not far off. And while that vote offered a unique set of circumstances, it was also by no means a one-off. Poll after poll in the weeks since have shown a collapse in Westminster voting intentions. While a couple of the pollsters place the party in second behind Labour, Deltapoll sees the Tories slip to third in a general election, while YouGov sees us limping home in fourth.
JUN17	The contest the Conservatives need is Boris v Rory	I’ve finally put my finger on why I don’t want Rory Stewart to be PM. But before we get to that, let me say that the final round contest the Tories need to have is Boris v Rory. The Conservative Party has no idea what it’s about at the moment and these two offer the sharpest contrast, not just over Brexit but in their character and philosophy. On Brexit, both men promise the impossible. Boris says he can renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement before October 31 or else walk away, but time has run out for renegotiation and Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. Douze points then to Rory and his plan to plough on with the Withdrawal Agreement? Well, no – because while there isn’t a Commons majority for no deal there isn’t a majority for the agreement either, and Remainers hope that Rory’s language of “realism” is really about setting Britain up for the conclusion that Brexit simply can’t be done. This is one of my biggest beefs with Rory. He says he wants to deliver Brexit but he largely talks about how difficult and dangerous it is, and we all know that’s the main reason why Remainers are excited about him. It’s unsustainable to present yourself as the only man who can lead us out of the EU when your support is rooted in those who are against it.
JUN17	Channel 4 News has moved from gentle bias into full-blown activism	The show has misjudged why fewer people are tuning in It’s been a difficult few days for Channel 4 News. First was the revelation that its viewing figures were declining, facilitated by what it calls "Brexit fatigue". Then came their appalling attempt to use a homophobic attack on a London bus as a vehicle to smear Boris Johnson. Johnson chose not to appear on the programme’s leadership debate over the weekend, fearing it would be ‘cacophonous’ and calling for a more ‘grown up’ debate. Channel 4 responded, in a very grown-up manner, by leaving an empty podium for him on the stage. The debate itself, chaired by Krishnan Guru-Murthy, divided opinion, with plenty of accusations that the format was too inflammatory, and that members of the audience and even Guru-Murthy had taken cheap shots at the MPs.
JUN17	The moral high ground can be a treacherous place	Almost daily, I witness a cyclist fly gaily down the one-way street on which I live… in the wrong direction. Roughly half of these aren’t wearing helmets and a mind-blowing quarter are plugged into headphones. But none of this matters, because cyclists have the moral high ground. That it’s their own lives they’re putting in danger makes them unusual, it struck me on Sunday, as I read about the breach of privacy that has been revealed to have taken place within the leading UK transgender charity, Mermaids. Moral high-grounders tend to casually imperil others, not themselves. And what better example of the breed’s dangerous mix of thoughtlessness, arrogance and defiance could there be than Mermaids’ accidental leakage of confidential data?
JUN17	Our hypocritical eco-youth can only be bothered to save the world when it's convenient	Back in the day when he was an agitprop stand-up, Ben Elton perfectly summed up the human condition. “We’re all good socialists aren’t we? We all believe in equality and solidarity with our fellow man and woman – until one of them comes and sits beside us on the bus.” I thought of him when I read about the prospect of recyclable cardboard tents at Glastonbury – and then overheard the muffled conversation between my stridently vegetarian 17-year-old daughter and her friends, who are off to a (much cooler) festival in a couple of weeks.  
JUN17	As Boris Johnson's rivals enjoy their time in the spotlight, his popularity with party members keeps rising	After Boris Johnson stormed ahead in the first ballot of Tory MPs, his leadership rivals have seized every chance they can get to try and close the gap. They have kicked up a stink about Mr Johnson's absence from media-friendly leadership forays, such as yesterday's Channel 4 debate and today's hustings with the parliamentary lobby of political journalists, in the hope of sending his supporters running their way by painting him as a coward. But what have they achieved? The main way Tory MPs seem to be running is towards Mr Johnson. Matt Hancock (who has previously made clear his aversion to his rhetoric), has thrown his weight behind the campaign frontrunner, acknowledging that he is "almost certainly going to be our next prime minister". Chris Heaton-Harris, the right-hand-man of ousted leadership contender Andrea Leadsom, has endorsed him and others will surely follow.
JUN17	Rory Stewart is missing the point if he thinks you can have national service without a military edge	Last Sunday, 2,000 young French teenagers reported for Emmanuel Macron’s new-look version of National Service: a two-week programme designed to promote national identity. The French are not the only ones to recognise the benefits of national service – the Swedes have a (hugely oversubscribed) scheme based on the Swedish Army that is in theory compulsory , while over here in Blighty, the Tory leadership hopeful Rory Stewart has also suggested that a form of national service would be a good idea. He insists, however, that such a scheme should not be military. He is missing the point.   The spirit of national service is to serve the nation and in doing so become more closely identified to it, its traditions and ways. Many nations resorted to conscription in national emergencies in order to fill armies, but retained it in the form of national service in more peaceful times, having appreciated the side effect of binding successive generations of young people of all backgrounds into better citizens.  Recruit training has this effect. It is designed to suspend the recruit from their normal way of life and build them into an essential part of a team. In effect they change from being an evolving individual to becoming a good neighbour with an understanding of responsibility. This is achieved in the first four to five weeks of "passing in" by isolating recruits from their old life and creating a regime where there is never enough time to do anything. Sleep becomes a precious commodity which has to be earned and is much prized. 
JUN17	Millennial Top Gear? Don't be fooled – it's still more bloke than woke	In the latest Top Gear three middle-aged blokes with iffy dress-sense and even iffier stubble blundered their way across an exotic landscape. “Banter” was exchanged (as required by Act of Parliament), engines sputtered, mishaps unfolded with mildly chortlesome results. Business as usual on Planet Petrolhead, then.  The big difference – and you may have heard about this – was the arrival of the two new presenters: likely lad cricketer Andrew “Freddie” Flintoff and comedian Paddy McGuinness. As Top Gear debuts go, theirs’ was widely acclaimed. Judging by the coverage, one might conclude they had in fact reinvented the wheel.  More than that, actually. The consensus is that they have actually whisked the wheel off to a touchy-feely nirvana where man-pats are obligatory, male pedicures complementary and there’s a miniature pride flag under everyone’s seat. Millennial Top Gear is now a thing – and we’re told Flintoff and McGuinness (and the returning Chris Harris) are the face of it. 
JUN17	Tom Watson cares far more about overthrowing Jeremy Corbyn than staying in the EU	Until 2016, it was perfectly possible to serve as a Labour Member of Parliament without worrying too much about the European Union. Certainly, there were some MPs who liked to emphasise their continental sophistication by occasionally press releasing this or that EU law and reminding their voters about how wonderful it was that Britain was a member of the club. But such declarations of love were almost entirely motivated by expressions of opposition to the EU by Conservatives. A bit like Scotland’s football fans going out of their way to be well behaved when abroad just to show up the English fans. The two subjects that would guarantee the lowest attendance at meetings of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) were Northern Ireland and the EU. Since the referendum, of course, that’s all changed. It’s now quite difficult (though not impossible) to find a Labour MP who doesn’t feel defined by our EU membership. It turns out that most of those stories told to local constituency selection meetings about how childhood experience of poverty led them to join the Labour Party, of seeing at first hand the impact of Thatcher’s pit closure programme, of benefiting from a free university education, were a load of bunkum. According to this generation of MPs, it was devotion to the European project that led to their ambition to become parliamentarians themselves. It was their appreciation of the absolute necessity of Britain’s continued membership of a particular trading bloc that brought them into politics, because they understand that outside the EU, we will lose everything: our employment rights, the fight against climate change, the NHS, and the TV remote (probably).
JUN19	If the BBC was attempting to smear Boris Johnson, it has heavily backfired	No one who read Boris Johnson’s column about the burka in this newspaper last summer with an open mind would have concluded that he was a racist. He was arguing for freedom of expression. In Britain, unlike in some European countries such as France and Denmark, Muslim women should not be forbidden from wearing Islamic dress, he said. Mr Johnson considered such garb to be oppressive and ridiculous, likening it to a letterbox or being disguised for a bank robbery. But this was not a reason to prohibit it. Yet despite taking an impeccably liberal approach, Mr Johnson found himself pilloried for the offence of “Islamophobia”. Now that he remains well ahead in the Tory leadership race, his words have been resurrected.
JUN19	A Tory-Brexit Party coalition would spell disaster for both	Boris Johnson is going to win the Tory leadership election, with the result announced on July 22nd. When he wins, he will probably face an instant no confidence motion from Jeremy Corbyn. If he wins that no confidence motion, he may take that as a justification for proroguing Parliament to effect No Deal. That means he will probably be voted down in that confidence motion. It is conceivable that Parliament might try to cobble together a majority behind some other Prime Minister (say, Hilary Benn) to revoke Article 50 or legislate for a Second Referendum. But given that Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely to be willing to back anyone else, the most likely outcome is a General Election — perhaps as soon as early September. Recent reports have claimed that Tory donors have sounded out Nigel Farage about the possibility of the Brexit Party entering into some form of electoral pact with the Tories under those circumstances.
JUN19	Time for a Boris vs Gove finale before Johnson heads for No 10	Rory Stewart never stood a chance Wanted: a leader who can take the UK out of the EU in a meaningful way, and who can defeat Jeremy Corbyn and his anti-capitalist, anti-Western henchmen. That is the job description drawn up by the Tory membership: it means Boris Johnson has been the overwhelming favourite from the start. Just as clearly, it always ruled out Rory Stewart, for all his undoubted charisma: “centrist”, Remain-obsessed metropolitan voters loved him, especially those who would never actually consider voting Tory, but he stood zero chance with the members. His votes came from the parliamentary party’s uber-Remain rump, determined to thumb their noses at the grassroots in one last act of pique.
JUN19	Conservatives must not empower the hardliners with a needless inquiry into Islamophobia	Tories risk giving succour to those who would limit free speech, marginalise moderate Muslims, and boost Islamism It is bad enough that, during their leadership debate, the BBC selected questions from a former Labour staffer and an anti-Semitic imam. But far worse was the attempt to bounce the candidates into an independent inquiry into Tory “Islamophobia”. There are many examples of Tory activists and councillors being rude about Islam. Some have been deliberately offensive about Muslim people. Some might have broken the law by inciting religious hatred. The next Tory leader should investigate these cases and decide whether the party has an institutional problem. But they must not play the Islamophobia game, and not only because opponents are trying to create a false equivalence with Labour’s endemic anti-Semitism. The real problem is the concerted effort to create a one-religion blasphemy law for Islam.
JUN19	Why Tory MPs just sighed good riddance to rambunctious Rory Stewart	The rambunctious Rory Stewart ride is finally over after his unlikely surge to the late stages of the Tory Leadership ran out of steam with two rounds to go. Rory has provided entertainment and bewilderment in equal measure, but ultimately his eclectic campaign was held back by the fact that it played far better outside the Tory Party than within it. At the start of the contest the establishment wing of the Tory Party were widely expected to coalesce behind Jeremy Hunt as the 'Stop Boris' candidate, but for a while it looked like Rory might be building up enough momentum to become the surprise favourite of Tory Remainers. His old boss at the Ministry of Justice, David Gauke, was playing an integral role in his campaign, while he also secured the backing of May's deputy David Lidington this week (although it is questionable whether securing the support of someone so intimately involved in the failure of the May Government was truly a help or a hindrance). Still, the warning signs were there that his campaign ultimately lacked the requisite staying power to go the distance. His disappointed debate performance on Tuesday night exposed the reality that he was far more comfortable on the attack against Boris than defending policies of his own. Tory Party watchers will have also noticed the unusually large discrepancy between the number of MPs who were prepared to publicly declare their support for Stewart, and those who were only willing to support him in the privacy of the polling station that is Committee Room 14.
JUN19	Boris Johnson is already Tory king, so why not crown him then he can get on with Brexit?	One should only call this a Tory leadership contest if there is some actual competition. Boris Johnson has been doing so well with his fellow Tory MPs, as evidence mounts that members are just waiting to acclaim him leader, that all his rivals seem to be achieving is to string out his ascent to power. And so, I argued yesterday that the party might as well crown the man so his new government can get going as soon as possible. Although the estimable Tim Montgomerie insisted that the contest needed to go on to ensure the next Prime Minister had been "properly tested". Have the latest events changed my view, now that Mr Johnson has gone through last night's BBC leadership debate and another MPs' ballot? If anything, they have left me feeling even more sure.
JUN19	The Tories must end this leadership farce and elect Boris now – the clock is ticking	I became an MEP because of endless Brexit delay. The last thing we need is more of the same I hate waste! In a world of limited resources it’s just bad economics. United Nations estimates put the global cost of food waste at a staggering $2.6 trillion; but of course we don’t meekly accept that as “the way of the world”. In my own business we waste nothing. We use our offcuts to make smoked salmon jerky; our fish bones and food waste to produce biofuel. I’m even working on a project to tan our smoked salmon skins into leather. Watch this space.
JUN19	Ban all-male comedy writing teams? It's a joke at the expense of genuinely funny women	What matters most is whether you have chemistry with your fellow writers – male or female Saskia Schuster, ITV’s head of comedy, says she “won’t commission anything with an all-male writing team” anymore, and to correct “the significant lack of shows written by women”, she has launched a scheme called Comedy 50-50. Ha! Ha! Ha! Sew up my splitting sides! Sorry, I thought it was a joke, it sounds so much like an episode of BBC2’s W1A.
JUN19	A trapped Jeremy Corbyn must now wait for the Conservatives to decide his fate	Another day, another gear change from the Labour Party in its long, tortuous road towards supporting a second EU referendum. Yesterday it was widely reported that Jeremy Corbyn was expected, today, to announce the change of policy that has been long demanded by his deputy, Tom Watson, and a majority of Labour MPs and members, namely that the party will, in any circumstances, not only support another referendum but will campaign for Remain. The more observant will notice that such a position not only flatly contradicts the party’s position before and after the 2016 referendum – when it undertook to respect the outcome the first time round; but also Corbyn’s own frequently stated view along the same lines.
JUN19	Abdullah from Bristol wasn't the only culprit in last night's woeful leaders' debate	The BBC's lack of vetting was matched by a lamentable lack of robustness from the candidates Boris Johnson reportedly gave Sunday’s Channel 4 leadership debate a miss after he and his team concluded that the programme could not be trusted to give him a fair hearing. How ironic that instead, he walked into last night's BBC offering which made Channel 4 News look a pillar of fairness. To be fair to the BBC, they did manage to find one man who claimed to have voted Tory before switching allegiance to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party at the European elections, but the other hand-picked questioners might as well have come straight from Jeremy Corbyn’s personal address book.
JUN20	No, Boris isn’t a racist, Scot-hating, Islamophobe. He’s a hopeless softie	A volley of righteous indignation will only deflect from Johnson's biggest weakness So it has ended as Boris Johnson wanted: a duel with the genteel Jeremy Hunt. The Foreign Secretary has promised to put his predecessor “through his paces”, which makes him sound more like a personal trainer than an opponent. This will suit the Conservatives, who want Boris to emerge from this in one piece and able to wrap up Brexit within a few months. And they needn’t worry about Boris not being subjected to abuse. He is about to receive more of it than any Tory leader in recent history.
JUN20	Britain needs a radical pro-Brexit chancellor, not more of Hammond's disastrous gloom	A tax break on charging your electric car at work. A Future High Streets Fund to help out retailers in trouble. A couple of tweaks to stamp duty so fiddly that even your accountant can’t quite remember the details. If Philip Hammond had felt like celebrating his greatest achievements when he drafted what is likely to be his final Mansion House speech as Chancellor, he would have realised very quickly there was nothing much to report – which is why he probably retreated to the usual apocalyptic, and increasingly hysterical, warnings about a no-deal Brexit. In truth, Hammond has been a terrible Chancellor. When he moved into No 11 in 2016, he inherited a better legacy than any Chancellor since Gordon Brown in 1997; certainly far better than Alistair Darling and George Osborne, both of whom had to cope with either a deep financial crisis or its immediate aftermath. Growth was robust. Employment kept hitting record levels. Tax revenues were buoyant, and the public finances were moving back towards balance. Sure, there was the challenge of Brexit to deal with, but that was an opportunity as well as a threat. We expect chancellors to be a little gloomy – they are after all the money men – but Hammond has brought a lugubrious pessimism to the role that was both completely unnecessary and ultimately self-defeating. He has been complacent about the challenges the UK faced, and has shown no interest in anything other than managing the status quo.
JUN20	The future of AI? I’m already sick of intelligent machines	In this week’s final episode of the BBC’s spectacularly watchable futuristic drama Years and Years, an indomitable Anne Reid launched into a scathing rant about the parlous state of the nation. Her bitter conclusion? That much of the blame for Britain’s authoritarian dystopia lay in the dehumanising rise of automatisation, she declared. And it all began with the grumbling, grudging, yet ultimately supine acceptance of self-service checkouts. Everyone hated them – but where was the boycott, the letters of complaint? I’m sure I wasn’t the only one looking askance at my husband on the other side of the sofa. I hated them. I still do. I swore I’d never use one when they were first introduced.
JUN20	Labour's cowardly conundrum will push Boris Johnson towards no deal	The most important thing about the 313 Conservative MPs choosing our next Prime Minister is that there are 313 of them – and you need 320 MPs to have a majority of one in the House of Commons, once the seven Sinn Fein MPs, who do not take their seats, and the Speaker and his deputies are taken into account. That means that whoever the next Conservative leader is – let’s call them “Boris Johnson” because that’s who it will be – they will have to find at least seven votes from somewhere else across the House if they want to pass a Brexit deal. And because whoever the next Conservative leader is, they will not be able to secure the votes of the seven committed supporters of a second referendum on the Tory benches and at least 15 Brexit ultras, they are going to need, at a conservative estimate, to find 22 votes from the opposition parties to make up the difference.
JUN20	How will Boris deliver Brexit? Rory Stewart isn't the only one who deserves to know	Rory Stewart approached the Tory leadership campaign like Socrates, irritating his rivals by constantly asking them questions, and his campaign ended in a similar way to the Greek philosopher: hounded out for asking too many questions. He blamed his expulsion from the race yesterday on the "uncomfortable questions" he had been posing that touched on "truths that people were not ready to hear". Those questions were being asked from the off, with Mr Stewart taking a special interest in Boris Johnson as campaign frontrunner that made Johnsonites question his motives.  His efforts to find enlightenment through Socratic dialogue culminated in the two TV debates, where he seemed more interested in hearing from how their rivals' plans - especially for tackling Brexit - would work rather than explaining his own.
JUN20	Could Boris Johnson be the man to call Brussels' bluff?	In many negotiations, it takes a hardliner to close the deal - a committed Brexiteer could do just that It now seems almost inevitable that Boris Johnson will become the next Prime Minister of the UK, tasked with delivering Brexit. Boris may not be universally loved in Brussels, given his role in swinging the referendum vote towards Leave, but it would be wrong to assume that concluding a Brexit deal has become less likely as a result. In many negotiations, it takes a hardliner to close the deal. Theresa May, a Remainer, would always have had much more trouble selling concessions to the British public than a Brexiteer would. For Boris, there are two options: either he goes 'full Trump' with a bullish strategy, or he chooses a more diplomatic path. It is not obvious what will work best with the EU.
JUN20	Trust me, it's not fitness tests stopping women joining the fire service	I read with interest, and then dismay, the news that Fire and Rescue Services are considering reviewing their fitness tests for women in order to encourage them to apply. But what needs to change in a modern Fire and Rescue service is not the notion that women are somehow inferior to their male peers. When I left Essex Country FRS in 2011, it was with the grim irony that I had been training for months to move from the Control Room to the fireground in a rare round of internal recruitment. At the time when I confirmed my pregnancy to my Watch Officer, I could pass all of the physical fitness tests at Service Training Centre by a comfortable margin. This was despite my having been born almost three months prematurely, and having struggled with childhood asthma. I was never particularly athletic as a teenager, and to this day, no matter how many weights I lift or how much I row, my arms resemble knotted embroidery skeins hanging limply out of my t-shirt. I made my peace with all of that a long time ago. But I put my mind to it, and my body, and on long night shifts and days off, I would be at the gym in the garage adjoining the service control room, steadily working my way up the close-grip pulldowns and chest presses, and running to the bleep test I had marked out across the car park. I still have the notebook I marked my progress in – a relic from a life past: some evidence that before I was a mother, I was a single-minded, focused, machine.
JUN20	Like #NeverTrump Republicans, Labour moderates are rallying around Corbyn at the first hint of power	There are striking parallels between the behaviour of Marco Rubio and Labour’s New Corbynites Like most of the Republican establishment in 2016, Senator Marco Rubio made his views on one aspiring President clear: “Donald Trump is a con artist – and he cannot be our nominee. #NeverTrump”, he tweeted, .  Ah, but that was then and this is now. Yesterday the Florida senator posted a Facebook status, telling his followers: “Ecstatic about President Trump starting his 2020 re-election tonight… I can think of no better place to kick off his campaign than the great state of Florida!” Perhaps a "con artist" can be the Republican nominee after all.
JUN20	Tory MPs must now choose between a bloodbath and a boring coronation	Sajid Javid is out of the contest to become leader of the Conservative Party and therefore Prime Minister, leaving Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt fighting for second place. It couldn't be much closer with only a couple of votes separating the two heavyweights – Gove nipping ahead after being just behind in previous rounds. In the hours that remain, who knows which one will finish second? However, it leaves the Parliamentary Conservative Party with a big decision to make, because the choice of the second name on the ballot paper going to Conservative Party members will generate two very different contests. The first contest is highly personal with a lot of history between Michael Gove and Boris Johnson that is still highly emotional and runs extremely deep. Stabbing Boris in the chest at the last minute in the 2016 leadership contest left a mark and has not been forgiven, particularly by many of Boris's close supporters who simply loathe Gove.
JUN20	The keyless car key is a dumb solution to a problem that didn't exist	The car industry is full of inventions and designs which have saved lives and made the world a better place. Seatbelts spring to mind, as do disc brakes, as well as the infinite iterations of engine and powertrain that have propelled the automobile from Karl Benz’s garden in Mannheim to a hydrogen refuelling station in Shanghai, all in around a century. It’s therefore difficult to pinpoint a single invention or idea that represents the apex of this process, or that adequately reflects the brilliance of an industry that seems to outdo itself every year. But if I was going to choose just one piece of automotive design, a pinnacle of ingenuity in the cordillera of engineering acuity, it would be the keyless car key. In the olden days, motorists were forced to carry around heavy, cumbersome car keys, often in excess of five centimetres in length. These would be used to open the car’s external doors as well as start the engine; a special ignition switch that accommodated the key was used at the beginning and end of every journey.
JUN21	The Conservative Party grass roots is the only group that can save Brexit now	Sometimes it makes a difference where you are when you write. I am writing this column at home in the country, somewhere in southern England. The sun is shining and the midsummer grass is green after rain. Being close to the grass, I am close to the grass roots – the people who will decide who the next Conservative leader will be. Viewers of Channel 4 News on Thursday had the delicious sight of Jon Snow complaining that the Tory electorate in this vote were all white men over the age of 55. Mr Snow is white, male and aged 71. The victim of his harangue was Nusrat Ghani, the brown-skinned, female, Conservative MP for Wealden, who is 46. Read Charles Moore's latest column every Friday night from 9.30pm 
JUN21	Everyone loses from the desperate attempt to paint Britain as an Islamophobic country	This victimhood is not only wrong in itself, but prevents all of us from enjoying the freedoms around us This week, the Tory leadership candidates all committed to launching an independent inquiry into “Islamophobia” within their party. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt must be careful not to walk into a trap. Islam is now the second largest religion in Britain and the fastest growing faith in many of our cities. With nearly four million Muslims living across the country, what happens inside Islam and to its adherents has an impact on every one of us, religious or not. To ensure an easy integration of Muslims into British society and secular co-existence, we must be free to talk about Islam, indeed even be critical of certain Muslim practices. Such free discussion must not in any way be prevented because it has been labelled “Islamophobia”.
JUN21	Donald Trump has confounded the Iranians by refusing to launch the military strike they so desired	As I write this from London on the British Friday afternoon that is the American morning, people on both sides of the pond are talking about nothing except the US military strike against Iran that was aborted by President Trump before its completion. The strike was in response to the downing of a US Military drone by the Iranians on Thursday. The President reportedly decided that the number of estimated casualties was too high, and the US attack would not be seen as a proportionate response.   While I have no inside information about what is going to happen next, I for one am finding myself feeling grateful for the President showing restraint.  
JUN21	Your reaction to the Mark Field video says more about you than Mark Field	The optical illusion “My Wife and My Mother-in-Law” has been making us scratch our heads for over a century. The famous brain teaser, devised by American cartoonist William Ely Hill, boasts a sneaky facial perception trick: when you look at the image, you either see the face of a young and beautiful woman or a grizzled old hag; it’s impossible to see both simultaneously. Studies suggest that what you see is determined by your age. I recall my astonishment when the elderly woman’s face was first pointed out to me as a child; when checking recently my eyes immediately darted towards the old hag. I thought of that image in the fallout from the climactic events at Mansion House this week, after dozens of Greenpeace activists infiltrated a black-tie City dinner while the Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered his annual speech. MP Mark Field has since been suspended as a minister after a video showed him pushing a female activist against a pillar and marching her out of the venue. Much like the optical illusion, public opinion of what he did was equally subjective – divided not by age but by the viewer’s pre-existing political beliefs. Progressives were, predictably, appalled. “This is Tory Britain”, wrote The Guardian’s Owen Jones, seeing Field’s behaviour as a sinister omen of things to come. Some leapt to brand Field a misogynist wife-beater. “If he does this in public”, the logic went, “just think what he must get up to behind closed doors.’’ Others drew broader conclusions. According to one columnist, the apathy of Field’s fellow diners explained “how… powerful men get away with violence towards women”. No room for misinterpretation, no chance that the MP might have reacted instinctively to a strange and heated situation. He was a conservative, and therefore naturally evil.
JUN21	Presenting our big Boris Johnson archive: from Europe to the environment and more	Boris Johnson has written a column for the Telegraph for the best part of three decades. No modern politician’s opinions are better known: readers have been treated to his views on skiing helmets, the African elephant, and the disappearance of the otter, among other more weighty subjects. But his columns have also become a source of controversy, with his opponents selectively quoting from them in an effort to discredit him. Today, therefore, we have decided to delve into the archive, so readers can judge for themselves. And to aid that process, we have gone through his back catalogue to find out how his thinking has evolved on the key issues. Here are eight to start off with.
JUN21	The real Mark Field scandal is that Greenpeace was even allowed to perpetrate this stunt	There was a scandal at the Mansion House on Thursday evening, but it wasn’t that Conservative MP Mark Field grabbed a protester and physically removed her from the room in which politicians, bankers and business people were dining – it was that police and security staff allowed her to get into the room at all.  That is the debate we should be having: how come the intruder was not blocked at the door?  It isn’t Mark Field who should be considering his position; it is whoever was in charge of security. True, knowing what we now know about this woman it is highly unlikely she intended to harm the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, or any of the guests. She was a Greenpeace protester – irritating and wrong, but not violent. 
JUN21	Sorry, Mark Field. It is simply unacceptable for a powerful man to accost a young woman	There’s nothing that political types love more than a sleight of hand, a deflection that allows them to talk about one thing when everyone else wants to talk about something else entirely. So, for example, last night’s incident at the Mansion House in which a government minister roughly manhandled a female Greenpeace protester is now being used as an opportunity to complain about protesters in general and their increasing sense of entitlement to disrupt any event for the sake of their own pet causes. Of course, if that really were the subject at hand, I could wax lyrical on the arrogance of such protesters, who think nothing of messing up other people’s daily lives – or, indeed, the economy – in order to get their latest grievance off their chests. In recent weeks we’ve seen the so-called Extinction Rebellion protesters close off central London to traffic – in full view of indulgent police officers – to promote their cause. And of course we have the unpleasant bullying of “milkshake protesters” who, having decided that they themselves are the sole moral arbiters of what other people can and cannot say, shut down their opponents by ruining their suits and videoing the whole thing (there would be no point in doing it at all unless they can subsequently show off their handiwork).
JUN21	The Tory leadership contest could end up being a test run for a Brexit general election	Who would want Theresa May's job? Perhaps the biggest reason those vying to succeed he right now had held back at first was the fear that they would have to find a way through the same EU, Tory Party and Parliament. They had little excuse to hold back any longer when the Tory leadership vacancy opened up, but Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will need to work out how they will do any better. The parliamentary arithmetic has not changed, and what has happened in the Tory leadership process so far should give the finalists cause to wonder whether they will only be able to accomplish what they want with a new Parliament. As it stands, the Tories have only been able to enjoy majority support for their agenda with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party. They have a tiny working majority of just five votes, and the next Prime Minister could be thwarted if just a few Tory colleagues fail to support his plans.
JUN21	For the good of Europe, Britain needs a leader who will not appease the Eurocrats in delivering Brexit	Five years ago, the Dutch Freedom Party PVV commissioned the independent research company Capital Economics to assess the economic impact if the Netherlands should leave the EU (NExit). The findings were very clear. Regardless of the outcome of any Netherlands-EU trade negotiations, in every scenario, Dutch gross domestic product was shown to be between 10 and 13 per cent higher by 2035 than it would be if the Netherlands continue as a member state of the EU. Leaving the EU allows a country to reduce the cost of doing business by reducing burdensome regulations in areas currently under the jurisdiction of Brussels. It also improves public finances by opting out of costly EU spending programmes. It reduces public expenditure through revising immigration policy. It increases exports to booming non-European markets through mutually advantageous bilateral trade deals. And it stimulates the national economy by having the freedom to set one’s own monetary and fiscal policy, without being tied to common one-size-fits-none policies.
JUN21	Forget Eton. Sending your children to state school could soon be the poshest thing of all	Yesterday I discovered that I am part of the aristocracy. Or rather – dispiritingly – I used to be. My parents sent me to private school, and took me to the opera: both distinguishing features of the wealthy elite,  according to the Coutts Luxury Index (CLI). This annual survey of price inflation is a sort of companion piece to the standard consumer price index, but with Cuban cigars and bespoke suits in the shopping basket instead of a packet of B&H and a Topman T-shirt. The latest CLI makes painful reading for the ruling classes: the price of lobster tails has apparently soared by 25 per cent and foie gras by 100 per cent (because of a bout of bird flu). A first-class airline ticket to New York now costs £6,000, compared with £4,500 three years ago. Above all, there’s the staggering cost of school fees. Sending one child to private school for five years now costs an average of £155,000 – more like £200,000 if you send them to a top-tier boarding school such as Eton or Harrow.
JUN22	UK needs a leader who will stand up for Brexit	In the last three years, the British government and the UK parliament have successfully turned our country into an international laughing stock, humiliated by the EU’s negotiators. Mrs May and her Cabinet are chiefly responsible for this. They claimed to want to reach a consensus and swore that in taking this approach they were acting in the interests of Britain. Yet after three rejections by Parliament, their strategy failed. Their search for what they termed consensus, ended with the UK bound to pay some £40bn to the EU whilst being locked into an arrangement we couldn’t leave unless the EU let us. As Margaret Thatcher said: “... consensus seems to be the process of abandoning all beliefs, principles, values and policies. So it is something in which no one believes and to which no one objects.” Who can argue with the wise words of the Iron Lady?
JUN22	Driving is a political act in the battle to live independently of the state	Imagine if Sadiq Khan were to propose a special event, to take place this coming September. Cycle-Free Sunday would see all bicycles banned from London. Cars would be permitted to stray into cycle lanes, restoring the streets to something approximating an open road. Pedestrians could enjoy their walks without fear that the lycra-lout up ahead is going to mount the pavement, or rush dangerously across their path on a zebra crossing. In sum, we would be able to experience our cities differently for a time, free from the machismo and sense of entitlement of a breed of road user who consider themselves a cut above the rest. If the Mayor of London were to suggest such a thing, you would think him completely mad: it would be governance by prejudice and gimmick. And yet this September, Mr Khan is planning to do precisely this to another set of road users. His “Car-Free Day” will see motorists banned from 12.3 miles of roads in the capital. People will be encouraged to see the city “from a different perspective”. “Public space” will be recaptured, say his campaigner allies, and they presumably hope that it will never be taken back. I understand the arguments: air pollution is obviously a problem, and it is one that is being rapidly addressed through technological progress. But why, then, is Mr Khan banning electric vehicles from the roads, too, along with hybrids?
JUN22	Bring on the robots: fun, caring and no boring small talk	I have a lot of time for heartless mechanical beings and always feel slighted on their behalf when they’re “bot-shamed” in the media, so I was pleased to see some positive stories about them this week. Alexa can now tell whether her owner is having a heart attack, while Amazon has announced its plans for hired drones which would act as a sort of non-judgmental Neighbourhood Watch. Even the humble Furby – lost legions of them currently collecting dust in universal attics – featured on a Radio 4 science show as providing just the right level of stimulation for dementia patients. Good work, unfeeling friends! Maybe it’s because I’m a stoic that I like them. I hate moaners, and robots don’t moan; even better, they don’t speak until they’re spoken to, so you won’t have to put up with dreary small talk. I feel thrilled by the idea of driverless cars (I can’t drive but I love to drink alcohol in cars) and mechanical pets (the real ones hurt too much when they die) and I like the idea of the entitled classes seeing their cushy jobs being taken over by Artificial Intelligence when they never spared a spot of sympathy for the working class communities destroyed by mechanisation.
JUN22	Under ITV's new comedy rules, Python would cease to be	The road to hell was given a fresh paving last week when ITV banned all-male comedy writing teams. In order to combat an “aggressive and slightly bullying” environment, ITV will not only stop commissioning men-only writing troupes, but will go further: teams must “aim for 50:50 representation”. The commissioner will be required to sign off on their balance.  Scripts will no longer simply be judged by the quality of the jokes they contain, but by the gender of those writing them.  I do not doubt the intentions behind this policy. Saskia Schuster, ITV’s Head of Comedy, has shown a strong commitment towards bringing more women into a field within an industry that she considers to be male dominated. Having conducted a review of her network's comedy production, Ms Schuster found out that only one script was submitted “from a female writer for every five scripts written by a man”.  But I do question the merits of the policy she has devised to deal with the issue, not the least because I have grave doubts as to whether it would actually deliver the sort of inclusion which she seeks. The lazy approach of banning all-male teams from competing in order for women comedy writers to have a fair chance seems to me to be not only ham-fisted and potentially unjust but also deeply insulting. It insinuates – even assumes – that left only to their own calibre, faculty and wit, women candidates cannot expect to beat all-male teams when competing for a commission at ITV.  
JUN22	No, Brexit isn’t killing Britain. It’s the refusal to deliver Brexit that’s turned politics inside out	Look what Brexit is doing to you,” a German MEP told me this week. “You’re in crisis, your system is breaking down, everyone is looking for a way out”. I get this a lot in Brussels. “Brexit is making you poorer.” “Brexit is making you angrier.” “Brexit is making you more xenophobic”. Sheesh, guys, do I really need to spell this out? Brexit hasn’t happened. The thing that is causing a crisis, making us angrier etc is not Brexit, but its precise opposite – the refusal of our leaders, despite their promises, to deliver Brexit. I have almost given up trying to explain this in the EU. Pretty much every interview with continental media begins from the assumption that Britain is collapsing, that we’re scrambling for European passports and the leaders of the Leave campaign are ashamed to show their faces. I try to explain that there is no crisis except in Westminster, that the economy is outperforming the eurozone and that opinion polls have barely moved, but I can tell the interviewers don’t believe me.
JUN22	There's no enchantment in an ice-cream van without the jingle	For my townie sons, the sound of summer isn’t a lark ascending or the thwack of a cricket ball on willow. It’s the fairground burst of tinny melody announcing an ice‑cream van doing its rounds. Nothing in real life seems as close to Enid Blyton’s Magic Faraway Tree as the fact that a vehicle carrying Mr Whippy cones, flakes and ice lollies will stop right outside your front door if you care to hail it. More cunning yet, the same van will position itself right outside our local primary school whenever a parking space frees itself.
JUN22	How to avoid the hard Left purge: a handy guide for Labour MPs	Moderate Labour MPs have long feared a purge by the hard Left. But perhaps they may yet survive. According to reports this week, Tom Watson, the party’s deputy leader, is now offering lessons to his fellow moderates in how to avoid being deselected by supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. Unfortunately, since consorting with Mr Watson is itself an offence liable to result in deselection, moderates may be wary of accepting his offer. As an alternative, I present five tips of my own.
JUN22	Sacred Mysteries: How P D James cast light on murder in the dark	The novelist P D James “writes about prayer the way the Victorians wrote about sex, with the utmost delicacy and indirection.” This well phrased observation comes in an essay by Alison Shell in a new collection that she has edited with Judith Maltby called Anglican Women Novelists. It looks at 13 writers ranging from Charlotte Bronte to Rose Macaulay and Barbara Pym. P D James’s forerunner as a detective novelist, Dorothy L Sayers, is there too, and Iris Murdoch, categorised as “Anglican Atheist”. Like Sayers, the translator of Dante, P D James is a well-read writer. She is familiar with poets from the Metaphysical period, mostly of the Church of England, and she appreciates the literary worth of the Book of Common Prayer as well as its sacred status. Her detective Adam Dalgliesh is a poet serious enough to find his art more a trial than a pastime.
JUN22	Brexiteers risk a 'Boris betrayal' unless they play a ferocious final hand	Straining an ear at the triumphant anthem of Boris Johnson’s steady march towards Downing Street this week, one could definitely detect the first crackles of panic. On paper, installing Britain’s most famous Brexiteer as the new PM is an extraordinary win for the European Research Group of Leave MPs, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. After three years of clanging caution under Theresa May, Britain will finally be led not just by a Brexiteer who campaigned to Leave, but by the golden optimism of the referendum made flesh. The ERG know that nobody symbolises the seething determination and defiant patriotism of the Brexit project quite like Boris, and at a time when the public is losing the will to live, they couldn’t ask for a more powerful poster child for their mission. Leaver MPs also calculate that Boris’s strong-willed personality will be a massive asset in the next round of negotiations with Brussels. But they are jumpy nonetheless. In recent days they have vacillated between giving MPs rather desperate ankle-flashes of their “spartan” fundamentalism – tweeting that the backstop isn’t the only thing wrong with Mrs May’s deal, for example – and falling over themselves to demonstrate their unwavering devotion to Boris, not least by whipping against tactical voting in favour of rival candidates during this week’s leadership ballots.
JUN22	The Conservative Party grass roots is the only group that can save Brexit now	Sometimes it makes a difference where you are when you write. I am writing this column at home in the country, somewhere in southern England. The sun is shining and the midsummer grass is green after rain. Being close to the grass, I am close to the grass roots – the people who will decide who the next Conservative leader will be. Viewers of Channel 4 News on Thursday had the delicious sight of Jon Snow complaining that the Tory electorate in this vote were all white men over the age of 55. Mr Snow is white, male and aged 71. The victim of his harangue was Nusrat Ghani, the brown-skinned, female, Conservative MP for Wealden, who is 46. Read Charles Moore's latest column every Friday night from 9.30pm 
JUN23	Boris Johnson will swat the SNP like a midge in Scotland	Iconic Aberdeen granite forms the foundational underpinning of the Palace of Westminster.  In the same way, Scotland provides a foundational keystone to what Boris has referred to as the “awesome foursome” - our United Kingdom.  It’s clear to us that a Boris Johnson premiership would have the future of our Union at its heart. Boris is a passionate and committed Unionist.  He not only believes in the Union but understands the unique synergy between the nations of our United Kingdom; what we have done together in the past and how much more we can achieve together in the future.   In Scotland, the SNP’s never-ending calls for Indy Ref two have become the never ending background noise of a midge loose in a room. Boris is the candidate who has been clear that more referendums - on either the EU on independence - are not on the cards.  In doing so he will help swat the SNP.
JUN23	It's been three long years since we voted to Leave – which is why we can, must and will do so by October 31	It is incredible, it is infuriating, it is disgraceful that it should now be three whole years since the EU referendum result; and I can tell that the whole country is positively aching for us to get it done. You can feel the impatience building like a giant thunderstorm on a hot June day. I know that if we fail again, we face a democratic explosion and a deluge in which both major parties may be swept away. And so, my friends, it is absolutely vital that we keep our eyes on the prize. It has been a long and parching march, but the oasis is finally in sight. We are so nearly there. We are just over four months away from the date on which, by law, we must leave the EU; and this time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail. This time we are not going to shrink in fear from the exit, as we have on the last two occasions. We are going to show all the mettle, the creativity and the energy of this amazing nation. We are going to focus all our efforts on honouring that single great promise – and we are going to come out of the EU on October 31.
JUN23	We all love a character in politics – that's why, despite his transgressions, Boris is still the frontrunner	I am expecting to see Boris Johnson in church tomorrow, not necessarily on his knees struggling with the second commandment to love his neighbour as himself, but certainly on his feet, at St Margaret’s, Westminster, singing rousing hymns at the memorial service for Jean Trumpington, who died last year, aged 96. Baroness Trumpington, wartime Bletchley Park code-breaker, health minister under Mrs Thatcher, and the woman who notoriously gave a V-sign to a colleague in the Lords’ chamber (becoming an internet sensation as a consequence), was, arguably, the most-loved Conservative politician of recent years. Why? Because in a colourless political world, she was a “character”, and we like characters. That’s why Boris, wine on the sofa notwithstanding, remains the current leadership front-runner. When I last saw Jean Trumpington, she told me stories of some of the prime ministerial characters she had known. “Winston Churchill was both fun and rather frightening”, she said. “He loved animals. He liked to have animals all over his bed. Lloyd George, of course, liked to have girls all over his bed.”  How well had she known Lloyd George? I asked. “I was only fifteen when I met him. He had quite a reputation, as you know. It was at his farmhouse. He measured me – with a tape measure. It was a bit odd, but nothing happened.” I told Baroness Trumpington my Lloyd George story. It was told to me many years ago by the veteran broadcaster, Wynford Vaughan-Thomas, who joined the BBC in the mid-1930s and, as a young reporter based in Cardiff, was sent to interview Lloyd George in the aftermath of the 1935 general election.   Vaughan-Thomas, carrying his recording equipment, arrived at the hotel where Lloyd George was staying to be informed by the landlord that the great man was expecting him. Thomas went up to the former prime minister’s room and knocked on the door. “Enter!” called the unmistakable voice from within. Thomas entered and found Lloyd George sitting up in bed with a couple of young women, both entirely naked, one on either side of him. “Unpack your equipment, boy,” commanded Lloyd George, “Let’s get on with it.” Thomas did as he was told, recorded his interview – “it was a good one” – and departed.
JUN23	If history proves freedom enriches, EU oligarchs could impoverish a continent	In the Gulf, Iran shoots down an American drone. In the north Africa port of Ceuta, Russian warships are permitted by Spain to refuel as they head towards Syria. From the south China sea to central Asia, a week seldom passes without China asserting herself in new ways. Lift your eyes above parochial Westminster politics and it becomes clear that a process of geopolitical jockeying is underway. It’s less the Tory leadership contest that should preoccupy us, but the way that new powers vie with America as they challenge an international order that we take for granted. Why does this matter? Because for the past forty years the world order has been extraordinarily benign. We have lived through – without always appreciating it – the greatest period of improvement in the condition of human kind ever.
JUN23	Boris’ two great tasks are to get us out of the EU and cheer us all up	"Things can only get better” – Labour used the lyrics in their triumphant 1997 general election campaign, and relief remains a powerful sentiment in politics. The prospect of seeing the back of Theresa May now, even more than of seeing the back of John Major then, is enough to lighten one’s step. So is the advent of Boris Johnson. He is the atmospheric opposite of Mrs May – never boring, always hovering on the edge of truths that should not be spoken or deeds that may be regretted. Even when, it seems, he has a flaming row with his girlfriend for getting wine on the sofa, it is a good story. More seriously, if he finally succeeds in securing Brexit and saving the Conservative Party, he will surely be judged one of Britain’s great Prime Ministers. The Tory leadership campaign, though, will not have helped reverse the Party’s misfortunes. The television debates were as bad as anyone envisaged, and in the case of the BBC substantially worse. For their part, the leadership candidates bickered, sniped, preened, and bitched. Perhaps the saddest moment of all was when Sajid Javid bounced the other candidates into supporting an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. One result of such nonsense is to relativise antisemitism in the Labour Party, where it is systemic and allegedly goes right to the top. If televised exposure was meant to display the elite of the Conservative Party, perhaps it did, and it was not a pretty sight.
JUN23	UK needs a leader who will stand up for Brexit	In the last three years, the British government and the UK parliament have successfully turned our country into an international laughing stock, humiliated by the EU’s negotiators. Mrs May and her Cabinet are chiefly responsible for this. They claimed to want to reach a consensus and swore that in taking this approach they were acting in the interests of Britain. Yet after three rejections by Parliament, their strategy failed. Their search for what they termed consensus, ended with the UK bound to pay some £40bn to the EU whilst being locked into an arrangement we couldn’t leave unless the EU let us. As Margaret Thatcher said: “... consensus seems to be the process of abandoning all beliefs, principles, values and policies. So it is something in which no one believes and to which no one objects.” Who can argue with the wise words of the Iron Lady?
JUN23	Driving is a political act in the battle to live independently of the state	Imagine if Sadiq Khan were to propose a special event, to take place this coming September. Cycle-Free Sunday would see all bicycles banned from London. Cars would be permitted to stray into cycle lanes, restoring the streets to something approximating an open road. Pedestrians could enjoy their walks without fear that the lycra-lout up ahead is going to mount the pavement, or rush dangerously across their path on a zebra crossing. In sum, we would be able to experience our cities differently for a time, free from the machismo and sense of entitlement of a breed of road user who consider themselves a cut above the rest. If the Mayor of London were to suggest such a thing, you would think him completely mad: it would be governance by prejudice and gimmick. And yet this September, Mr Khan is planning to do precisely this to another set of road users. His “Car-Free Day” will see motorists banned from 12.3 miles of roads in the capital. People will be encouraged to see the city “from a different perspective”. “Public space” will be recaptured, say his campaigner allies, and they presumably hope that it will never be taken back. I understand the arguments: air pollution is obviously a problem, and it is one that is being rapidly addressed through technological progress. But why, then, is Mr Khan banning electric vehicles from the roads, too, along with hybrids?
JUN23	Bring on the robots: fun, caring and no boring small talk	I have a lot of time for heartless mechanical beings and always feel slighted on their behalf when they’re “bot-shamed” in the media, so I was pleased to see some positive stories about them this week. Alexa can now tell whether her owner is having a heart attack, while Amazon has announced its plans for hired drones which would act as a sort of non-judgmental Neighbourhood Watch. Even the humble Furby – lost legions of them currently collecting dust in universal attics – featured on a Radio 4 science show as providing just the right level of stimulation for dementia patients. Good work, unfeeling friends! Maybe it’s because I’m a stoic that I like them. I hate moaners, and robots don’t moan; even better, they don’t speak until they’re spoken to, so you won’t have to put up with dreary small talk. I feel thrilled by the idea of driverless cars (I can’t drive but I love to drink alcohol in cars) and mechanical pets (the real ones hurt too much when they die) and I like the idea of the entitled classes seeing their cushy jobs being taken over by Artificial Intelligence when they never spared a spot of sympathy for the working class communities destroyed by mechanisation.

JUN24	No frontrunner can take victory for granted. It's time to show us your fighting spirit, Boris	Twenty-two years ago, after the landslide victory of Tony Blair in the 1997 general election, Ken Clarke and I emerged as the final candidates to be Conservative leader. It was the last time that party activists had no role in the process for electing a leader. Although it is not very long ago, it seems now that the standards of the campaign and atmosphere within political parties belonged to a different age. Ken and I never said a word against each other in public, and probably not in private. Much of the process was behind closed doors, although I made the first effort in such a contest to go out among the grassroots and win support from the party members. Now, thanks to the rule changes that followed, a leadership campaign is very different. The party members possess the decisive vote between the finalists. Social media means it is possible to communicate with them round the clock. There are even more media channels, as well as the plethora of podcasts and blogs.
JUN24	Sorry Lefties, but the Tory grass roots is sticking with Boris, come what may	When it comes to famous political quotations, one corker in the overflowing section devoted to Donald Trump really stands out. Reportedly uttered at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa back in 2016, it offers a telling insight into the Republican front runner's view of his position in the race for the White House. "I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody," stormed Trump, "and I wouldn’t lose any voters." This week our own box-office blonde threw down a similar gauntlet. Not, heaven forfend, to shoot somebody. But by ignoring the enduring saga surrounding his private life, and refusing to answer questions about his domestic troubles, Boris Johnson is more or less saying the same thing. His refusal to break the silence over his angry row with girlfriend Carrie Symonds is semaphore for "they're still going to vote for me". And he's probably right.
JUN24	Never mind the Irn Bru, Jeremy Hunt was firm in his support for the Union	Given their propensity for seeking out insults – real or imagined – it’s inevitable that the more sensitive of SNP supporters would take umbrage at Jeremy Hunt’s weekend visit to Scotland. They really were at their childish worst. They were particularly annoyed, apparently, that the Foreign Secretary and Tory leadership contender had used all manner of props to justify his attachment to all things Scottish. And to be fair to my Nat friends, Mr Hunt did overdo things a bit. For instance, in a recent column I did appeal to the Tory contestants not to try and trumpet their Scottish antecedents through telling us about their long remembered holidays north of the border, as well as their well-beloved Scottish aunties.
JUN24	To solve Britain's rudeness epidemic we need to start dressing well	Every summer, something curious happens to the men inside Ascot’s Royal Enclosure. Doors and gates are held open for women, hands extended to help us down stairs and top hats doffed in our direction, as though, for that one week a year, young British men have decided to play at being chivalrous vintage gents – before leaving the manners and morning suits in a rumpled pile on the floor at the end of the day. Last Friday, it hit me: they’re playing that part because they’re dressed for it. I was being helped down a laughably safe flight of stairs by a top-hatted stranger when I had the epiphany. His fine woven-silk tie was adorned with a pearl, a white carnation sat in his button hole and on his face the man wore an unmistakable expression… of pleasure. Not only did it look good – lordly and magnanimous – to be genuflecting before what was in fact a Portaloo in this 19th-century way, but clearly it felt good, too. And I found myself scanning through a whole mental montage of recent boorish young male behaviour – from the group of teenage boys who stood back and watched me try to heave my case not once but twice off the luggage carousel at Heathrow last month, to the doors I’ve seen pushed through and swung shut in women’s faces across London daily – and wondering whether the answer to our rudeness epidemic could be hat and tailing every man under 40. It’s not. Largely because it would fail to deal with the young British women whose manners are just as bad. And I can’t help thinking that with Fourth Wave feminism, the curdling mess of ethics and ideologies that it is, men are probably too scared to help us carry a bag or open a door. 
JUN24	President Erdogan's iron grip on Turkey may finally be weakening	Whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey,” said Reccep Tayyip Erdogan in what he probably now considers to have been an unguarded moment. On Sunday the Turkish president’s AKP party was soundly defeated in the city’s mayoral elections, encouraging speculation that the leader’s hitherto iron grip on the country is weakening. It was in Istanbul that President Erdogan launched his own formidable political career 25 years ago, subsequently dismantling Turkey’s secular dispensation in favour of greater Islamification. The new mayor Ekrem Imamoglu believes he can influence the country’s future in the same way. However, while the outcome was a blow to Mr Erdogan, it is always unwise to read too much into a local election: the second after an earlier vote was deemed inconclusive. He remains a powerful and controversial figure, presiding over a regime which does not look kindly on its critics, to put it mildly.
JUN24	How can parents behave like couples when the leave system is so out of joint?	Theresa May is on a spending spree; a splurge to leave a legacy that extends beyond just failing to deliver Brexit. Her latest proposal is to extend paid paternity leave to 12 weeks (four weeks at 90 per cent of salary; the rest at statutory maternity pay level): cue concern from government bean counters worried about the impact such a policy would have both to the taxpayer and employers, especially for staff on high pay. How depressingly retrograde. Because, while it’s easy to dismiss Mrs May’s proposal as a desperate – and expensive – clutching of straws before she leaves office in a few weeks’ time, the Prime Minister is onto something. As it stands, the current system means that it’s mostly the mother who takes time out of work to have a baby. Legally, she has to take two weeks off after giving birth, but women are also entitled to a further 50 weeks of statutory maternity leave, and many companies offer more than this. Fathers, meanwhile, are usually only entitled to one or two weeks of paternity leave, which must be taken in one go within 56 days of the birth, paid at the statutory rate (the princely sum of £148.68 a week).
JUN24	Theresa May might not have much of a legacy, but could she still outlast her successor?	If you've just tuned in, the attention Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have been getting as they confidently talk about the United Kingdom might lead you to think they are in charge as part of some new-fangled duumvirate. But no, there is still only one prime minister, and that is Theresa May. She has a few weeks left in Downing Street, which she has been using to try and shore up some sort of Brexit legacy besides a withdrawal agreement thrice-rejected by the House of Commons. To pile on the indignity, Mrs May has to put up with her ministers already dismantling key part of her blueprint for post-Brexit Britain. Sajid Javid has announced today that her proposed £30,000 minimum salary threshold for migrants - including those from the EU - to work in Brexit Britain would be dumped.
JUN24	Labour may come to regret its intolerance for anyone who crosses the party line on LGBT education	Whatever happened to the party that once respected MPs' consciences and religious views? At the first Labour Party meeting I ever attended, back in Edinburgh in 1985, attendees discussed making the issue of abortion a matter of party policy rather than individual conscience. Naturally, I spoke up, not just because I was at the time opposed to abortion on principle, but because it seemed a wholly illiberal and unnecessary change. I was greeted with a degree of polite tolerance, as one of a tiny minority who voted against it. Sixteen years later, when I had made it to the Commons itself, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the small cohort of Labour MPs who regularly opposed any extension to abortion rights (by this time I was not among them) experienced no hostility from “the Sisters”, the parliamentary feminists in Labour ranks who, in the absence of a party whip, would marshal the troops whenever the 1967 Act was up for review. It was accepted that these MPs should be respected for voting according to their conscience and religious beliefs.
JUN24	Turkey's strongman president is still capable of causing plenty of problems for the West	The political earthquake that took place in Istanbul on Sunday – a resounding win for the opposition party, in the re-run vote to elect a mayor of a city that the country's strongman leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, once ran – is sending shockwaves far beyond the Bosphorus. Many of President Erdogan’s opponents at home and abroad hope that his plans to dominate the country until 2030 have been buried in the rubble of his party's defeat. Certainly Erdogan’s refusal to accept the opposition’s wafer-thin win in March has backfired spectacularly. Three more months of rising inflation and joblessness in the economic powerhouse of Turkey caused three quarters of a million more voters to choose the anti-Erdogan candidate as mayor of a megalopolis with a population the size of the Netherlands.  The West – alarmed by Erdogan's confrontational approach to foreign affairs – will be hoping that change is afoot more broadly in Turkey. Since 2002, Erdogan has shifted his country from being the linchpin of Nato to a fractious spoiler within the alliance. By courting the West’s rivals, Russia, China and Iran, and radically downgrading relations with both Israel and the EU, Erdogan has long seemed set on abandoning the westward orientation his country has pursued since 1950. This sea-change is symbolised by his purchase of Russian S400 anti-aircraft missiles and the Americans’ decision to cancel Turkey’s purchase of its F35 fighter jet – the main target for Putin’s surface-to-air missiles.
JUN24	For how much longer can we ignore the genocide happening on our doorstep?	Our current approach could see DFID  funds sent directly to the murderous Assad regime  Were it not for Brexit and the ongoing leadership debates, the atrocities unfolding in Idlib province would be filling our TV screens and dominating the newsprint. The international shock of Syria’s crimes against humanity and the West’s inability (and unwillingness) to act, will reverberate long after our domestic issues are resolved. Since late April, the province of Idlib in Northern Syria has come under relentless bombardment by the Assad regime and its Russian allies. The Idlib Health Directorate, who we advise, has just issued a report, whose gruesome and shocking findings should give pause to policymakers and concerned citizens alike.
JUN25	Want to end the reign of public schoolboys at the top? Build more grammar schools	Not a week goes by nowadays without its being branded for some campaign or another. This, we are informed, is Evidence Week in Parliament. Policies based on evidence are essential to good governance – and yet many appear to fly in its face. Moreover, the use that politicians make of this evidence often depends on which axe they have to grind. Confronted with exactly the same facts about, say, the backstop in the EU Withdrawal Agreement, Brexiteers like Boris Johnson say scrapping it is not a problem, whereas those who want the UK to stay in the EU or retain the closest ties possible maintain that it is an insurmountable one.
JUN25	Don’t ban the Philadelphia ad… dads really are dopey	I am sad to report that a fundamental human right is under threat. The right, that is, of women to laugh at men and, of course, vice-versa, although there is so much less material because women are always sane and right, aren’t we, ladies? An advert for Philadelphia cream cheese that portrays dads as a bit dopey could become the first to be banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) under its new gender stereotype rules. The ad in question shows two first-time fathers who get so distracted by eating cheese that their babies end up on a conveyor belt of Philadelpia on toast. A full 32 complaints have been made about this scandalous and grossly unfair portrayal of male ineptitude.
JUN25	What Donald Trump really wants is a deal with Iran. Here's how he can get one	Does Iran see itself as a country or a cause? US policy is driving the Iranians to answer Kissinger’s question unequivocally: a cause. Neither Washington nor Tehran has a unified foreign policy establishment. Hardliners in both camps are upping the ante in ways that leave little space for the middle ground. And the US policy of “maximum pressure” now has a potential military dimension. The aborted raid on Iranian sites late last week shows how close we are to military confrontation; indeed, it has already begun in the cyber-sphere. How little we would seem to have learnt from our post-9/11 wars. US military power is optimised for taking on a country; it is ineffective against a cause – you cannot kill an idea with a bullet. My take from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is that military operations without achievable political goals are flawed. Bombing is easy. But if there is a gaping silence in the current debate on Iran, it is the absence of any discussion of what happens after the military has done its job – which, let’s not forget, is to kill people and break things. Then what? The size of the post-strike challenge rises dramatically once Iran declares itself a cause not a country. The sectarian map of the region is disturbingly different to the state map we look at in the West. As Mark Allen points out in his classic book Arabs, state institutions have the lowest loyalty in Arab societies. Iran as a cause represents the Shia, who are significant minorities (in Bahrain a significant majority) in Sunni-run states. And, by a quirk of fate, there is a strong correlation between where the Shia live and where the oil is in Sunni states.
JUN25	Boris's sunny optimism can get Brexit over the line	The media establishment is in full-scale attack mode. Boris Johnson faces a no-holds-barred onslaught – as blatantly pro-Remain broadcasters throw whatever mud they can to stop him reaching No 10. Some have genuine reservations about Johnson’s suitability for high office. But much of this relentless negativity is driven by envy, class warfare and, above all, Brexit. The bien pensants in both politics and the media know Johnson is determined to leave the European Union, if necessary with no deal, on October 31. And the Boris-bashers’ biggest fear is that his enthusiasm and belief that we can finally do so, after three years of foot-dragging, proves infectious ­– generating the final wave of public support that gets a meaningful Brexit over the line. Johnson’s rallying cry that Britain can thrive by staying close to Europe, but outside an increasingly over-bearing EU, is not only economically true, it also taps into a deep well of emotion – not only among the Leave-voting majority, but also the millions who backed Remain and know that it’s vital for the integrity of British democracy that this debilitating log-jam is broken.
JUN25	Brexiteers will not easily forgive Boris if he blows his shot at becoming Prime Minister	The Remainer establishment has the scent of victory in its nostrils. For the last three years, its campaigners have cynically plotted to overturn the referendum result. Among the weapons in their undemocratic arsenal have been court actions, Project Fear propaganda, Parliamentary manoeuvres and collusion with Brussels. Exactly as they planned, the Brexit process has become hopelessly bogged down in a legalistic and bureaucratic quagmire, with the prospect of British independence beginning to fade.  Now these anti-Brexiteers could be on the verge of their greatest triumph yet: the prevention of Boris Johnson’s advance to Number Ten. A Johnson premiership is perhaps the last hope for the implementation of Brexit. As a key architect of the successful referendum campaign, he is the one senior MP with a realistic chance of delivering British self-governance from the shackles of EU rule. That is why the progressive elite is so determined to bring him down – by any means necessary.    Over recent days, the Stop Boris drive has been ferocious in its intent and its range. The stitch-ups have come in several forms. One could be found last week in the shambolic BBC debate, when Boris not only was challenged on Islamophobia by an imam who turned out to have tweeted anti-Semitic and misogynistic posts as well as being a Corbyn supporter, but also was interrogated by Emily Maitlis with an intensity she did not display towards any of the other four candidates. Even worse was the firestorm over his row with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds at their south London flat, a controversy that was stoked by apparently politically-motivated neighbours who taped the incident and then passed the recording to left-wing newspaper The Guardian.  
JUN25	The Lib Dems will never break into mainstream politics by behaving like student politicians	Instead of a credible message, all voters will hear are playground insults and nursery-level language. The current state of British politics has given the Liberal Democrats a rare opportunity; the chance to emerge from the long shadow of the Coalition years and establish itself as a radical, progressive force of the centre ground. The electorate, grown weary of left-wing utopian visions and right-wing obsession with the EU, could well be in the market for a party that uses grown up language. That opportunity looks likely to be squandered, however, because just as voters have turned their backs on the two main parties and decided to listen to the Lib Dems for the first time in ten years, instead of a credible message, all they hear are playground insults and nursery-level taunts. Hillary Clinton’s dictum that “When they go low, we go high” in Lib Dem world would be “You think that’s low? Hold my beer…”
JUN25	Boris Johnson's passion for painting is no portrait of deceit, but the love affair of a lifetime	Boris Johnson will never please some people. After days of demands to give more interviews, in the hope he might give some personal colour, Mr Johnson decided to speak to three broadcasters. While he held firm in his refusal to speak about his nearest and dearest, he did answer Talk Radio's query about how he relaxed honestly: "I make models of buses. What I make is I get old wooden crates, right? And I paint them. I suppose it's a box that's been used to contain wine bottles. I paint the passengers enjoying themselves on the wonderful bus." But his critics were not satisfied.
JUN25	Banning the booze on Eurostar? Quel cauchemar for us responsible passengers	I’m not sure of the French word for “own goal” – you’d have to ask some très angry Cameroonian lady footballers about that – but I think we can agree that Eurostar has just scored one. The cross-Channel rail operator has decreed that passengers may not bring more than one bottle of wine or any holiday spirits back to Britain with them. What’s that about? Do they think we get through too much foreign plonk at home, and so should be rationed? Or is this just a cynical ploy to make us buy more booze on board? Either way, it’s not very entente cordiale. I’m not saying all British people want to get hen-party hammered when we travel – at least, not every time. We just like to know that we could alleviate the boredom by cracking open as much of our smuggled stash of Vin de Pays as we want; it’s the Anglo-Saxon version of liberté.
JUN25	Our obsession with 'offence archaeology' is robbing young people of a carefree childhood	Whether directed at sixth-formers or celebrities, scouring online to find offensive views is an ugly practice Exams are over and school is – almost – out for summer. But there is no slacking off for anxious teens worried about university places and future careers. According to a new report from the LSE, growing numbers of young people would prefer to delete their social media accounts altogether, concerned that someone, at some point in the future, might poke around and find something inappropriate.
JUN25	These green targets waved through by MPs will make the cost of no deal look like small change	 This legislation was approved with little scrutiny, all to boost the ego of one of Britain’s worst prime ministers Never let it be said that Parliament cannot get things done when it wants to. In the three years since the referendum, MPs have not only rejected Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement but have failed to produce a majority for every other conceivable plan to exit the European Union. Those who never wanted Brexit in the first place say that it will cost the country billions. Britain is too small and insignificant to stand alone, they say. Nobody voted to be poorer, they say.
JUN26	Remainers' irrational terror of Boris epitomises our toxic new politics	What has happened to us, to our politics, to our pragmatism? There was a time when, even after a heated discussion, we could agree to disagree, perhaps after a reconciliatory drink, and part as friends: yet that was before wilful misrepresentation, hysterical catastrophism and ad hominem argumentation became the norm. These days, it’s easier to discuss erstwhile taboo subjects such as money, religion or even sex than it is to discuss Brexit or Jeremy Corbyn. People are developing sophisticated political radars to gauge whether an acquaintance is on-side or not before they dare to broach politics. Millions are retrenching into their comfort zones: a YouGov poll earlier this year showed that 37 per cent of Remainers would be upset if a close relative married a Brexiteer. The latter remain more open-minded, but both sides are isolating themselves, fuelling a vicious circle whereby misunderstanding builds upon misconception.
JUN26	Brexit without a deadline risks no Brexit at all	If Conservatives accept that Britain must leave the European Union, they have to be honest about their bottom line – that we would leave without a deal – and set a hard deadline for our departure. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt say that they would lead Britain out of the EU without a deal if a new one cannot be agreed. But on the deadline, they differ. Mr Johnson says we must leave no later than October 31, “come what may, do or die”. Mr Hunt insists that this is a “fake deadline”, which risks a general election and no Brexit at all. Unfortunately, Mr Hunt’s approach has been tried twice already. Britain was due to leave the European Union on March 29. This was pushed back to April 12, and then to October 31.
JUN26	Bureaucracy and bean-counting are taking the joy out of being a GP	General practice is the best job in the world – sharing the joy following the difficult arrival of a baby or seeing folk recover from depression. Even at the saddest moments, such as working with our amazing district nurses to ensure people at the end of life have the gentlest home death possible, it can be deeply rewarding. So why are we so desperately short of GPs that hundreds of villages no longer have one? The fact is that the job I love also drives me regularly to tears of frustration, and I often wake in the small hours worrying about the next day. I understand why GPs retire early, emigrate to Australia or leave partnerships to work as locums. It’s not the long hours, typically 11 or 12 a day, because we expected that when we started out. It’s about what happens in those hours. The computer, which should be a force for good, instead sits malignantly in the corner, interrupting and directing the consultation. What’s more, basic IT faults are so common that many of us have given up complaining. Rather than sorting this out, the Government has focused on supporting companies making symptom‑checker apps.
JUN26	Jeremy Hunt's 'Little England' gaffe is an infuriating insult to Tory Leavers	In the classic 1963 film The Great Escape, Flight Lieutenant Andy MacDonald and an accomplice are undone at the last when MacDonald, played by Gordon Jackson, replies “thank you” rather than “danke dir” or simply looking non-plussed after being wished a safe journey in English by a suspicious German guard who has found nothing wrong with their travel papers. The famous scene portrays an important truth – it is in humdrum moments of reflexive communication that cover gets blown. I was reminded of the exchange when Jeremy Hunt, the former Remainer in the Tory leadership final two who now insists he keenly backs Brexit, had a Twitter conversation with a sympathetic inquisitor on Tuesday evening as part of his #BoJoNoShow event. (The whole exercise would surely have been characterised by the late Lord Whitelaw had he still been alive as “going round the internet stirring up apathy” but that’s another story).
JUN26	The EU will come to regret its economic blackmail of Switzerland	The Swiss have become mere collateral in the EU’s desire to cow Britain into submission While Brexit negotiations have stalled, tensions between the European Union and Switzerland are ramping up. Since 2014, Switzerland and the EU have been trying to amalgamate their existing 120 bilateral treaties into a single agreement. Yet the Swiss refused to concede to EU terms without clarification on certain issues; in response the EU now looks likely to cut off Swiss stock exchanges from the Single Market within days in retaliation for their failure to ratify the treaty quickly enough. 
JUN26	Letting Boris off his leash may be the canniest strategy of all	If there’s one thing the British love, it’s an oddball My parents’ dog is poorly trained. It yaps, harrumphs and leaps all over the house. Though only marginally bigger than the average porcupine, it defends its territory with reckless abandon, making enemies for life with every dog bigger than it in town. It desperately seeks the amorous approval of all the local cats, and salivates at every person who comes to the door. It has only a cursory understanding of the word ‘sit,’ and no concept of a command. Its main aim in life is to walk on the kitchen table without being removed, and its biggest achievement is learning to open the bin when no one is watching. For all these faults, my parents have never really given much thought to reigning in its wild ways. That, you see, would deprive it of so much of the infuriating character that makes the dog so loved. And they wouldn’t have it any other way.
JUN26	Jeremy Hunt's boxing-ring talk has gone too far. He needs to remember who the real enemy is	With his blue-on-blue attacks, Hunt is doing Jeremy Corbyn's work for him Unite to Win is Jeremy Hunt’s campaign slogan but you don’t build either party unity or a winning team by calling your rival for the Conservative leadership a “coward”. You don’t help your own party’s opinion poll standing by constantly accusing your opponent of ducking scrutiny. The only beneficiaries of such talk are the Conservative Party’s opponents. I can picture some social media whizz kid in skinny jeans inside Labour HQ preparing the attack video now. To a background of cinematic music, “even Boris Johnson’s own colleagues see him as a coward… afraid of tough questions… he is the wrong man to lead Britain…”
JUN26	Boris is right - delivering Brexit by October 31 really is 'do or die' for the Tory party	The Conservative Leadership race has now moved out of Parliament and into the country, where Party members will make up their minds over the series of hustings before the poll closes on July 22. But members casting their votes over the coming weeks should be in no doubt that the choice they face is binary.  Boris Johnson has been absolutely clear in the approach he will take to Brexit. He has recognised that Theresa May’s draft Withdrawal Agreement is completely and unrevivably dead, so he is not proposing mere tinkering with it, or more woolly commitments in the legally non-binding Political Declaration.  He has set out that a completely fresh approach with fresh vision and fresh impetus is required to secure what we want and what the British people voted for: the UK’s full withdrawal from the European Union, taking back control of our money, laws and borders, and forging a new, mutually-beneficial trading relationship with our closest neighbours. 
JUN26	Brexiteers have nailed Boris Johnson down and will accept no excuses for delaying Brexit	From the moment Boris Johnson promised at the start of his Tory leadership campaign to ensure the United Kingdom left the European Union on October 31st "deal or no deal", I thought it was worth keeping an eye on how closely he stuck to that pledge. Mr Johnson seemed to go off track in last week's BBC debate, suggesting that the Halloween deadline was just "eminently feasible". Such wayward remarks have clearly driven his Tory Eurosceptic backers to take a closer interest in his campaign, with Iain Duncan Smith now taking the reins. The IDS influence has already had an impact, with the leadership frontrunner happy to tie himself in unquestionable terms to Brexit by October 31.
JUN26	We need a First Amendment for the Internet to counter the troubling censorship of social media	For all its focus on "diversity", Silicon Valley is about as ideologically diverse as a vegan powwow The advent of modern technology has brought us extraordinary freedoms. Millions now find love by swiping on their phone, podcasters reach audiences of millions from the comfort of their bedrooms and well-meaning neighbours keep us safe by recording private arguments and sending them to national newspapers. Nowadays elections pivot on viral content published online, while political careers can  be ended by an ill-thought tweet or launched with an ingenious piece of clickbait. According to Pew Research, over 61 per cent of milennials get their political news primarily from Facebook. In the decades to come, TV and legacy media will cede power and influence to social media, YouTube and podcasts.
JUN27	Ruth Davidson's progress hampered by Brexit 'do or die' from Boris	She might well have been, arguably, Britain’s most successful Conservative politician but on returning from six months maternity leave last month Ruth Davidson discovered that reputations count for nothing in this frenetic Brexit world. The leader of the Scottish Tories for the last eight years revitalised the almost-moribund party north of the border, took it to second place in the Holyrood parliament – eclipsing Labour on the way – and won 12 Commons seats, mostly at the expense of the SNP in 2017. But now this mother of eight-month-old Finn fears that she faces the prospect of all that being undone if, as every survey and opinion poll predicts, Boris Johnson wins the Conservative Party’s leadership election and become Prime Minister.
JUN27	With the EU in need of friends on the world stage, conditions are ripe for Boris to pull off a Brexit deal	A charm offensive from the unlikely figure of Boris Johnson could be all it takes to win the concessions we need Of all the tall stories that Boris Johnson has told, his latest – about how he’ll secure a Brexit deal by Hallowe’en – is seen as the most laughable. There is a million-to-one chance of his failing to negotiate a Brexit deal, he says. Most Tories think it’s the other way around, that he stands a million-to-one chance of success. They back him because they think he’d leave without a deal if he had to. But the mood music in Europe is changing and there’s a decent chance of a breakthrough – for a Prime Minister sharp enough to take it. The EU still likes to say the deal it offered to Theresa May cannot be “reopened” but this is a bit of a verbal trick. No one is seriously expecting a new 585-page deal to be negotiated. If a few sentences were added to the end, giving either  side the ability to walk away – in the way EU members and Nato members can walk away – then Parliament would probably vote it through.  The Northern Irish backstop is a problem, but alternatives are there. Agreement is tantalisingly close.
JUN27	We arts graduates may not earn as much as our peers – but it's no reason to feel sorry for us	It's an entirely noble trade-off to choose interesting but poorly-paid work over lucrative drudgery Hold the front page. Humanities students aren’t brilliantly paid. Department for Education figures show that Oxbridge English graduates after five years earn on average £34,600 – more than £1,000 less than those who studied nursing at Brunel University. English graduates are a much-maligned group, and many will view these statistics as further evidence of their fecklessness. But let’s not cast students of literature as unemployable victims or dippy slackers who would be better off studying engineering. As an English graduate who left Oxford five years ago, I am a guinea pig of sorts. How do my earnings compare to the average? I consider it indelicate to discuss money over dinner, let alone in the pages of a national newspaper, so I will merely say that this sum isn’t wildly off the mark. But it’s also unsurprising. Few nurses go into nursing to earn money; the same is true of English students. Even graduates of prestigious universities are content to earn less than their law or economics graduate peers, choosing creative, interesting but often poorly-paid work, in fields like publishing, art, education (and yes, journalism) rather than becoming a management consultant or doing the obligatory law conversion. And thank goodness for that.
JUN27	The Brexit wreckers' desperate rear-guard action on No Deal risks taking our politics to new extremes	Dominic Grieve and Margaret Beckett are determined to make no deal as difficult and unpredictable as possible The barrel is being scraped – the latest tactic to constrain a new Prime Minister and undermine their negotiations with the EU, in the name of preventing no-deal, is to deprive key public services of funding in a no deal scenario. Not content with their own evaluation of the dangers, Dominic Grieve and Margaret Beckett are determined to make a no deal outcome as difficult and unpredictable as possible. Specifically, they want MPs to vote to deprive the Department for Education, Department for Work and Pensions, Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, and the Department for International Development of funding from 31 October if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
JUN27	Boris's enthusiasm is the perfect antidote to the patrician Tories who don't get what makes their party tick	Jeremy Hunt is clever, decent and diligent, but Johnson is edging ahead for a reason Dominic Grieve is reportedly seeking, through parliamentary chicanery, to cut off public funding for schools, pensions, international aid and local government, in order to prevent Britain leaving the European Union in October without a deal. Aside from being an extreme case of "Brexit Derangement Syndrome", it shines the harshest spotlight on how out of touch some Conservative MPs are with their party membership and electorate.   Grieve is not alone. The Rory Stewart phenomenon – much of it gossamer thin in terms of substance and viability – and undoubtedly driven by media frenzy, was similarly baffling to many Conservative supporters: Mr Stewart almost physically recoiled from the suggestion in the course of one debate that his party might seek to cut taxes as part of its economic programme. Seriously? Isn’t this in the DNA of almost all natural conservatives?
JUN27	Recycling will never be enough to solve the plastic pollution crisis. We need to think bigger	Rats run amok. Cockroaches scuttle along the floor. Plastic bottles earmarked for recycling get chucked into piles of rubbish destined to be burned. Materials once separated get mixed up in the chaos of a never-ending conveyor belt of detritus. Welcome to life in Britain’s hotchpotch waste recycling system. This week the Telegraph published the results of a landmark investigation into what happens to the waste we put out each week for collection. An undercover reporter was dispatched to a recycling site in West London tasked with processing the rubbish from four local authority areas. They found staff given precious little time to properly sort through materials. The result? Plastic bottles earmarked for recycling put in bins destined for the local incinerator.   Consumer credit has become a way of life for many of us. And companies large and small have battled to keep pace by churning out ever more goods laden in plastic. On the labels of these goods is an alphabet soup of symbols about recycling. The CEO feels he has done his bit. It’s “recyclable”. The consumer feels they are making a responsible choice. And everyone goes home happy.
JUN27	We need an immigration system that can wean our economy off its addiction to cheap labour	A UK version of Australia's points-based system could work provided it  focuses on cutting numbers The longest continuous expansion ever recorded by a major developed economy. Lots of jobs, high pay, a solvent government, and booming exports into the world's fastest growing countries. Some wobbles in the property market aside, there is plenty to admire about the Australian economy, and in many ways it is the perfect template for what a post-Brexit Britain should look like. There is one significant twist, however. A purely points-based system of immigration controls cut and pasted from down under, as advocated by the prime minister in waiting Boris Johnson, won’t quite work. We need to reshape our economy so it generates more high skilled work, and we still need to control numbers – not just be more picky about who we let in. To listen to some of the pollsters, you would think that immigration was no longer an issue in British politics. It has dropped right down the list of things people say they are worried about. And yet in truth that is only because it has been drowned out by the furious row over Brexit. As soon as we have a new Prime Minister, and as soon as we work out how we are getting out of the EU, it is going to be right back on the agenda again.
JUN27	Brexiteers risk blowing their best chance for no deal	Boris Johnson is making all the wrong noises. He tells us there is only a "million to one" chance we’ll leave the EU with no deal. He tells us he will get the EU to agree a new deal. He tells us that will include "the commonsensical protraction of the existing arrangements until such time as we have completed the free trade deal between us and the EU" (so, something like May’s standstill 'transition' period, but whereas hers lasted 21 months his would apparently be indefinite). None of this is in any way reassuring to Brexiteers that he has any genuine way to actually get us out through the only route that any longer exists: via no deal. The EU isn’t going to agree any new deal. It isn’t going to believe he’ll pursue no deal if he says it’s a million to one shot. It isn’t going to believe Parliament will allow him to pursue no deal even if he truly wanted it. And it isn’t, at this late hour, going to change its deal even if no deal is the result. Pretending or wishing that weren’t so won’t make it go away. If Boris is not clear that his plan is for no deal, how can he possibly hope to carry his party, let alone the House of Commons, with him on it. Even with it being widely acknowledged that the election of any candidate other than himself means the extinction of his party, some 150 Tory MPs still voted for other candidates – presumably through a passionate opposition to the no deal Brexit that he supposedly champions. How can he convert them to his scheme if he won’t even declare for and argue for it, and explain how he’d make it work? And if he says no deal is a million to one, how could he claim a mandate for proroguing the Commons to deliver no deal even if he won a vote of confidence in the House?
JUN27	Never underestimate Jeremy Corbyn, or the cowardice of the Labour MPs who oppose him	Nearly four years after Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party, his internal opponents are still underestimating him.  It’s an easy trap to fall into. Corbyn is not the cleverest or most strategic leader the party has ever had. Oh, let’s be honest: he’s barely the cleverest or most strategic leader the Labour Party currently has right now. And yet his political obituary has been written time and again by people who simply don’t understand why he’s still in post. The Chris Williamson saga might help explain.
JUN27	Boris just might have the answer to Britain's immigration troubles	Here is an opportunity for a PM to take the country with them on a controversial issue Boris Johnson once declared that he was the only politician in Britain prepared to describe himself as “pro-immigration”.  His new immigration plan cautiously combines the ideas of openness and control to bridge this most polarised of public debates. The “Australian points-based system” is a popular slogan that resonates with voters. When our National Conversation of Immigration held citizens’ panels in sixty towns and cities around the UK, many people talked about the Australian system yet only a small minority had ever heard of the British Government’s net migration target.  
JUN28	Too many in the West insist on dancing to Vladimir Putin's tune	Is liberalism obsolete? Has it outlived its purpose? That is what Vladimir Putin claimed in a wide-ranging interview given on the eve of the G20 summit in Japan. And as with so much that the Russian leader says, the problem is not whether he is right or wrong, but that when he is right it is for the wrong reasons. For some years now Putin has demonstrated an ability to push his KGB-trained fingers on the very sorest parts of the Western nervous system. Russia may have lost the Cold War and spent the Putin era struggling to make up in bombast what it has lost in prestige. But precisely because Russia’s force-projection and demographics are dwindling, Putin has found a way to assume a position on the world stage vastly out of proportion to what should be his global standing. He deranges different people in different ways. For those broadly on the Left in Western politics he has become the puppet-master supreme. Nothing Putin could ever boast of could exceed the claims made about him by those who imagine themselves his opponents.
JUN28	The people have lost patience with an immigration system built on lies	Britain’s status quo isn’t so much a “broken system” as a self-justifying swindle. This week was a blistering reminder  – and not just because of those plotting Remainer MPs who love nothing more than to sneer down their constitutional noses at the will of the people. Two other potent national symbols of the managerial scamming that now passes for modern government have been in the spotlight over recent days: namely, bogus recycling and uncontrolled mass immigration. Although these are two very different governmental controversies, they have a lot in common. In both cases, the public are impatient for reform: while Middle England has bristled over the last few days at the infuriating revelations that recycling centres are sending plastic and paper to be incinerated, Boris Johnson’s announcement that he’d favour an Australian points-based immigration system as PM was enthusiastically received. What’s more, in both areas basic reality has long been crushed under the weight of bureaucratic chaos and self-delusional orthodox thinking – our administrative overlords have spent years trying to convince us and themselves that the country’s future depends on baffling, opaque procedures that they have painstakingly devised.
JUN28	Dominic Grieve's latest plan to block no-deal is so destructive, so irresponsible, that it can only be a bluff	The supposedly "progressive" Remain camp is behaving like Tea Party Republicans Estimates Day was always a three-line whip during my time as an MP - but one with a difference: everyone knew there was no possibility of a vote being held on the government motions that allowed public services to be funded for the next six months, and so it was seen almost as a day off. No opposition party would vote against the funding of the government, thereby wrecking any reputation it had for fiscal responsibility.  So why did we bother hanging around the Commons for a vote that everyone knew would never take place? Because the issue was of such obviously vital importance, the three parallel lines under the words “Estimates” on the pink piece of paper sent to all MPs each weekend seemed unavoidable.
JUN28	Bravo Boris! His economic vision shows he is ready to champion Brexit Britain	At last this prime ministerial contest is taking off, and the frontrunner is finally exhibiting that potent mix of fire and flare that’s been worryingly missing in recent weeks. Boris Johnson’s team are fashioning a comprehensive platform of tax reforms, red-tape moratoriums, practical immigration proposals and targeted public investment designed to mitigate for No Deal and to look to the world beyond October 31. His rival, Jeremy Hunt has been royally taken to task this week over a tweet confirming he didn’t want a ‘little England’ Brexit. Critics suggested that in restating his priorities in these terms Hunt was deliberately slurring the 17 million voters who chose to leave. Whilst it’s absolutely right to scrutinise both how and when Mr Hunt would take us out of the EU, this confected furore was misdirected.  We all know that there is a sizeable constituency within the complicated coalition that voted for Brexit that does romanticise about a lost idyll of a ‘little England’. Typically it wants less immigration, more economic protectionism and greater cultural homogeneity – in short, small ‘c’ conservatism. Polling has shown us repeatedly that many leavers do sympathise with these instincts but theirs is not the only vision for Brexit. 
JUN28	The elites pushing to legalise cannabis are blind to the harm it wreaks on vulnerable communities	Marijuana's wider harms are hidden from the bulk of society, while law enforcement is non-existent Just before my election to chair my local Federation last year, I attended a report of a violent domestic incident taking place in a desolate tower block in a Black Country town. A known local criminal was reportedly beating up his girlfriend. On arrival, alone because all my officers were committed at other incidents, I ran into the building and up several flights of stairs. As I did, I noticed through the stairwell windows, my man below on the ground impressively vaulting the fences of nearby properties making his getaway. Using some local knowledge to find a short cut I managed to get him in sight, yet he sprinted away. Dispirited I slowed, thinking I’d never catch someone running at such break-neck pace. But suddenly, he slumped to the ground. 
JUN28	Calling the French 'turds' will just make Tory members love Boris all the more	Quel horreur! How can Boris Johnson possibly recover in the Tory leadership race now party members know that he once thought the French had been a bit much in the Brexit negotiations, and let it be known on camera bluntly? As Foreign Secretary, he was reportedly recorded by a BBC camera crew calling the French "turds" for their behaviour (incidentally, the only other time he has indulged in such coprolalia over Brexit has been when he described Theresa May's Chequers deal as a "turd").  Foreign Office officials managed to persuade the corporation to remove the jibe from its documentary to preserve the entente cordiale. But it is hard to be sure who would have most wanted reports of this remark to come out, as it could just as plausibly be Mr Johnson as his rival, and successor as foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt.
JUN28	Dressing like a Regency Dandy is an act of heroism in a world of navy blue suits	The British male is suffering from sartorial depression  Zack MacLeod Pinsent is a posh-sounding, baby-faced 25-year-old who dresses like a Regency dandy. I don’t mean that metaphorically, in the Jacob Rees Mogg sense. I mean that he gets up every morning, slips into a pair of pantaloons, a waistcoat and a tailcoat, arranges a frothing cascade of cravats around his neck, slaps a topper on his head and strides out into the streets of his home town, Brighton. You might expect all this to make him an object of ridicule. But here’s the wonderful thing. A short BBC interview with Mr Pinsent went viral on Twitter yesterday – 29,000 likes, 6,300 retweets and 1,700 comments – and it’s almost impossible to find a bad word said about him. In this irritable age, on that vitriolic platform, Mr Pinsent has performed the impossible trick: standing out from the crowd without enraging it.

JUN28	We arts graduates may not earn as much as our peers – but it's no reason to feel sorry for us	It's an entirely noble trade-off to choose interesting but poorly-paid work over lucrative drudgery Hold the front page. Humanities students aren’t brilliantly paid. Department for Education figures show that Oxbridge English graduates after five years earn on average £34,600 – more than £1,000 less than those who studied nursing at Brunel University. English graduates are a much-maligned group, and many will view these statistics as further evidence of their fecklessness. But let’s not cast students of literature as unemployable victims or dippy slackers who would be better off studying engineering. As an English graduate who left Oxford five years ago, I am a guinea pig of sorts. How do my earnings compare to the average? I consider it indelicate to discuss money over dinner, let alone in the pages of a national newspaper, so I will merely say that this sum isn’t wildly off the mark. But it’s also unsurprising. Few nurses go into nursing to earn money; the same is true of English students. Even graduates of prestigious universities are content to earn less than their law or economics graduate peers, choosing creative, interesting but often poorly-paid work, in fields like publishing, art, education (and yes, journalism) rather than becoming a management consultant or doing the obligatory law conversion. And thank goodness for that.
JUN29	Don't expect the next Tory PM to have the guts to grapple with the NHS	An irony of the campaign to choose Britain’s next prime minister is that the state institution most desperate for serious reform is not being discussed in any meaningful fashion: the NHS. Although Jeremy Hunt had ministerial responsibility for it for almost six years, the prime ministers he served wished the secretary of state to engage in day-to-day crisis management rather than overhauling a failing behemoth. He says he will not privatise the NHS. Boris Johnson says the NHS “needs reform,” but we await details. He says it needs more money, but not where it would come from, or how it would be spent efficiently. Trying to get an appointment with a GP can take days, echoing the sclerosis of a state-provided service once so typical in the Soviet Union and the old Eastern Bloc. One must not exaggerate: we are not yet at the stage of Jeremy Corbyn’s beloved Venezuela, where healthcare resembles that of a war zone and has almost broken down completely. But all the inefficiencies of a state-controlled system, lacking a price mechanism to ration resources, are glaringly obvious in a way that is absurd in a first-world country. One of its major burdens is our ageing population. Successive governments have been aware of this particular demographic time-bomb since the mid-Eighties, but have always found reasons to do nothing about it. To say this cannot go on is beyond understatement.
JUN29	The American Left's prissy purism risks making Trump unbeatable	At 76, Joe Biden, the current front-runner in the American Democratic primaries, is old enough to remember a time in his political career when Congress was a functional legislature. Senators spoke to one another. They even ate together, while now the Senate dining room is often deserted. Opponents compromised, as Biden put it earlier this month, to “get things done”. Like Obama before himself running into the rigid realities of entrenched belligerence in contemporary D C, the former vice president has prided himself on engaging with the opposition. Fatally, however, the example Biden cited of people with whom he fiercely disagreed in the Seventies, yet was still willing to work with, was two segregationist senators. [Insert here the blaring horn on Jeopardy when the contestant gives the wrong answer.] Competing presidential candidates rushed to deplore his remarks. Cory Booker demanded Biden apologise (Biden refused: “Apologise for what?”). Kamala Harris accused Biden of not understanding “the dark history of our country”, and in last week’s television debate deemed his statement “hurtful”.
JUN29	Why let the snobbery of reading get in the way of a good book?	Reports of reading’s death have been greatly exaggerated – generally by the sort of people who like to believe that Things Are Always Getting Worse because it gives them a masochistic parasexual thrill and/or makes them feel that their little lives are at some epoch-making point of history. These will be the same sorts now moaning about people not reading anymore; in my experience, they themselves are people who’ve never read much anyway but want you to think that they do because they like to look down on what they probably think of as the Brexit Chav Pasty Mob who struggle with Heat magazine. All that’s happened is that UK book sales fell for the first time in five years in 2018, thus ending a period of growth from 2014. But the good news – sorry, doom-mongers! – is that audiobook sales shot up 43 per cent last year.
JUN29	This is your ‘Churchill moment’ Boris - if you have what it takes	Dear Boris, First of all, many congratulations on getting to the last round of the Tory leadership contest. Although I supported Michael Gove, I’ll be voting for you. If you win on 22 July, after only 11 years and 71 days in parliament, you will have entered No.10 faster than any other of the fifty-four prime ministers except Pitt the Younger (2 years as an MP), Lord Bute (5 years), Henry Addington (6 years) and David Cameron (9 years). It will be an extraordinary achievement. Of course in order to avoid going down in history as an even shorter-serving premier than George Canning (119 days), you are going to have to show remarkable boldness the moment you cross the threshold.  The screams of rage and anguish from Remainers of all types and parties that greeted Dominic Raab’s proposal to use the prorogation of parliament to avoid either a general election or second referendum shows how scared they are of it, rather than how undemocratic they say it is. If they genuinely believed in democracy, they would have abided by the democratic vote in the referendum rather than constantly attempting to subvert it.
JUN29	In a world of curated perfection, random failure is a useful life lesson	The anonymous GCSE examiner, who last week blew a whistle on swingeing inconsistencies in the marking of English Language papers, took me on a walk through one of the little nettle patches of memory lane. On the morning of my O-level results, back in the 1980s, I discovered that I had got a B in English Language. That in itself was no bad thing – there were certainly other subjects in which a B was ample cause for celebration – but English had always been my best subject; perhaps the only one in which I had felt virtually certain of an A. And I had got one in English Literature – but not in English Language. I soon discovered, however, that I had got off lightly. Friends were getting unexpected ‘U’s and ‘E’s. Although English Language has more room than other subjects for variable interpretation, the system seemed to have gone awry. One teacher joked that it was as if the examiners had thrown all the exam scripts down a staircase, swept them into random piles, and graded them accordingly. The pupils with the most surreal outcomes asked for a re-mark. The rest of us mooched on. This is not to say that huge variations in marking now, as then, don’t matter. If an examiner today is sufficiently alarmed to share on Twitter that “the standardisation scripts” for marking are “all over the place” – and that many worried colleagues agree – then it warrants further investigation. Still, this little story might be no bad thing for pupils to reflect upon.
JUN29	In modern Britain, the status divide is officially a load of rubbish	Today, I want to write about absolute rubbish. Garbage. Trash. How does this differ from your usual Saturday offerings, you may well be thinking, if you’re not the kind of person who enjoys reading about feelings or Love Island. But humour me. For this week I want to write about actual rubbish: the stuff we chuck in our ever more complicated collection of bins. Is there a subject more likely to make British blood boil than litter and waste management? Like queuing and tea, the need to Keep Britain Tidy is written into our DNA – and God help anyone who doesn’t adhere to it. Note, for example, how a small neighbourly dispute about fly-tipping in north London has become headline news across the nation. This week, it was reported that a hospital consultant in leafy Hampstead had been caught hurling bags of rubbish over his neighbour’s fence, apparently in retaliation for said neighbour leaving the bags outside his house on the wrong rubbish collection day.
JUN29	Politicians' pastimes have only made me more ashamed of having no hobbies	Golf, pottery, choir, cooking: pick your pastime, everybody’s got one. Or so it seemed this week, as the Conservative leadership hopefuls did battle for most esoteric admission over how they divert themselves. Boris Johnson paints wine boxes to make them look like buses, he said, while Jeremy Hunt has been known to indulge in a little lambada, Brazil’s “forbidden dance”, which he describes as his “big passion.” It is “quite intimate”, he added during an interview with Jeremy Vine, apparently deaf to the sound of the nation’s stomachs turning. “It brings back some happy memories.” Which – if we put awkward-politician-cum-dad-dancing images aside for a moment – is just what a good hobby should do. Did Johnson dream up this particular leisure activity to bury the more egregious bus-based news that had until then appeared when Googling his name and said vehicle? Was Hunt’s revelation a desperate bid to out-niche his rival? Possibly, both. But either way, both have hobbies – or at least publicly pretend to – along with the 95 per cent of the population who spend almost a day each week nurturing theirs, according to 2016 research. 
JUN29	The next PM must declare war on May's legacy of busybodying and petty rules	The Conservatives have become a preachy and micro-managing presence. This needs to be reversed Recent reports that Boris Johnson and his team are sympathetic to cutting taxes will be music to the ears of many Conservatives. Under Theresa May and Philip Hammond, the tax burden swelled to its greatest size in 50 years – a deplorable record for a government of any shade, but a particularly shameful badge of dishonour for a Tory administration. Businesses, households and individuals have to work harder to pay the bills, and secure themselves against future downturns. In many ways, this makes Britain’s “jobs miracle”, and our economy’s consistent defiance of doom-laden Brexit forecasts, all the more remarkable. Imagine how much more our country could have achieved with a tax policy that helped rather than hindered us.
JUN29	Sacred Mysteries: The smallest chapel in Westminster Abbey	A place that you can’t get into is all the more attractive. One is the shrine of Edward the Confessor, behind the high altar of Westminster Abbey. When it is sometimes open, as on St Edward’s feast day, October 13, being there is all the more memorable. Another chapel in the abbey is also closed to visitors. It is so small – four feet square – that crowds rubbing their shoulders on the walls would deface the medieval painted images that remain there. It is called the chapel of Our Lady of the Pew. Remarkably, its very existence was denied by some experts in the 20th century, such as Herbert Westlake, a Minor Canon who published a history of the abbey in 1923. The name, he contended, was a modern invention. Those who agreed with him said that there had been a confusion with a chapel of the same name in the Palace of Westminster. But now Matthew Payne, the Keeper of the Muniments at the abbey, has shown conclusively that Our Lady of the Pew was the ordinary name for the little chapel.
JUN29	Strict laws govern the battlefield. We must restore their primacy to protect our soldiers	The brave men and women who make up our Armed Forces deserve our thanks and appreciation. Serving as defence secretary, I saw first-hand the professionalism, comradeship and loyalty that make the three Services the finest in the world and if the events taking place around the country today to mark Armed Forces Day show anything it is the depth of gratitude that we as a nation feel towards those who keep us safe. However, as well as our thanks, our service personnel deserve our protection – including from malicious legal claims and repeated investigations. Everyone in the military rightly accepts that when individuals break the rules there must be consequences and personnel should face the full force of military justice. Since the turn of the century, however, the scales have tipped. Personnel and veterans who served in various theatres – not least Iraq and Afghanistan – have been hounded in the courts. Recent public concern, meanwhile, has been for the targeting of veterans who served in Northern Ireland and the spectacle of old men being dragged into the judicial system.
JUN30	We will prove Vladimir Putin wrong by leaving the EU by October 31	It is a matter of economic fact that, when Vladimir Putin says that liberalism is obsolete, he is talking the most tremendous tripe. Liberalism is alive. It is well. It is delivering prosperity on a scale unimaginable to previous generations. That is because a society that is free and inclusive and open will – on the whole – be the best place to start a business. It will be the safest place to invest. It will be the best place to start a family. It will be the best place to live. And there could be no better example of the triumph of liberal values, of course, than Britain today. There are all sorts of reasons why London and the South East are the most productive regions of the whole of Europe. There is the time zone. There is the language. There are the historic agglomerations of talent in the arts, culture, business and financial services. But there is something even more important; and that is the British sense of freedom to live your life as you choose – provided you do no harm to others – without the fear of persecution, or judgment, or discrimination.
JUN30	I fear I will be found wanting by the dictatorial gurus of good taste	In the window of my local charity shop, my eye was caught by a glass vase, tiger-striped in orange and black. It was an arresting monument to the glass-blower’s art. Now it stands on a Victorian whatnot in my living-room, alongside my grandmother’s Cupid-strewn jasper trinket box, and a plastic hamster on wheels that fell out of a cracker. In a house decorated in a cloudscape of grey, it is a raucous combination that cheers me every time I pass it. Back in 1852, however, it would have been a candidate for the chamber of design horrors gathered at Marlborough House, Pall Mall, by Henry Cole and Richard Redgrave, who went on to found the Victoria and Albert Museum. Their Gallery of False Principles in Design was supported by Prince Albert. It assembled a baleful bestiary of design shockers: a chintz swarming with lilac and roses displayed a “want of repose”; a popular gas lamp in the form of a convolvulus was “entirely indefensible”. Even the Wedgwood factory that made my grandmother’s trinket box was condemned for “the resurrection of a dead art”. Like John Ruskin, the bicentenary of whose birth falls this year, Cole and Redgrave saw taste as a moral, as well as an aesthetic, issue: “Taste,” said Ruskin in his 1864 lecture, Traffic, “is the only morality.” Charles Dickens thought otherwise; in Hard Times he sprang to the defence of the popular taste condemned in Coles’s exhibition. When the utilitarian schoolteacher Thomas Gradgrind brutally dismisses the circus girl Sissy Jupe’s longing for a flowery carpet, Dickens directs us to sympathise with Sissy.
JUN30	Jeremy Corbyn is very extreme and very dull, and poses no electoral threat to the Tories	Obviously, if you are a Conservative politician, you have to warn voters constantly about what the Tories like to call “the ultimate catastrophe of a Corbyn government”. Yesterday Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson’s newly appointed campaign manager, told our Sunday sister paper that he has “only one ambition – that Boris gets elected and Brexit is delivered, and we destroy Corbynism.” Actually, I make that three ambitions; but you can see why he thinks of them as one, since he believes that each event leads to the next. I am sure Mr Duncan Smith is right that the Conservatives will become much stronger as soon as Boris accomplishes a real Brexit, but I wonder if Mr Corbyn is quite the threat he is made out to be. At the risk of being accused of absurd complacency, I think that it is well-nigh impossible for a Corbyn-led Labour Party to win a general election. His best chance was the general election of 2017. His two great advantages then were the emptiness of Theresa May and the fact that he was almost unknown to the public. Even so, they were not enough to get him into No 10. More than two years later, Mrs May is going, and Mr Corbyn is a known quantity to most voters. This change of circumstances is fatal to his cause. All we are left with is the real Jeremy Corbyn. Even at the Glastonbury Festival, no one wants to coo over him this year.
JUN30	Donald Trump's unsettling 'fire and fury' should not blind us to his successes	It is all too easy to dismiss Donald Trump as a showman who has strayed onto the world stage from his natural element of reality TV.The latest example is his “unscheduled” trip into North Korea, the first by a sitting US President, which has been dismissed as political theatre by critics who think that Mr Trump’s violent sabre-rattling against the Communist state and no less flamboyant rapprochements have only served to damage America’s credibility. But the mechanics of President Trump’s foreign policy – from the “fire and fury” of threatened military action to the showy high-level summits – should not blind us to his real success in upending the conventions of diplomacy to his benefit. Behind all the theatrics is something very simple: Trump has recognised that the tried-and-trusted ways of handling problems were not solving them, just kicking cans full of worms down the road for a successor to pick up. North Korea clearly was not restrained even by UN sanctions agreed to by China and Russia, since its nuclear arsenal and the range of its missiles was growing apace before Trump entered the scene.
JUN30	BoJo can give the economy back its mojo by ditching Left-wing Toryism	Boris is apparently thinking about giving us a cheering, exciting first budget which will sweep us past any little local difficulty that a no-deal Brexit might entail. It is claimed he is considering a reduction in stamp duty. He has already said he wants to increase the threshold for higher rate tax. This first budget will show us what kind of prime minister he will be. This is what he should do: first, he should bring home to us all that our taxes are far too high. Most people are unaware that, in the wake of the 2008 crisis, the tax take has kept on rising to an historically high level. It amounts to 34.6 per cent of GDP, the highest rate for 50 years. All this taxing and government spending cramps economic growth. That’s partly because Governments invest badly. It’s partly because individuals are more motivated if they can keep more of the money they earn. Also, in a low-tax environment, skilled workers and companies are more likely to work here, creating enterprises and paying tax. So go for it, Boris! Raise the threshold for higher rate income tax. While you are about it, lower the top rate of tax back down to 40 per cent. There is a good chance that a reduction in the top rate will bring in more money, not less, just like the previous reduction. That, too, will encourage international businesses to come here post-Brexit. On top of that, lower corporation tax. On past form, that will increase revenue, too.
JUN30	Let's use Gaddafi's wealth to compensate victims of the IRA	It was revealed this week that, in the last three years, the British government has taken £17 million in tax from £12 billion of Libyan assets linked to Colonel Gaddafi, which are frozen in the UK. There is a strong moral and legal case for this money to fund a compensation scheme for the victims of the IRA. During the Troubles, Gaddafi armed the IRA with Semtex. He supplied weapons that undoubtedly contributed to the lengthening of the terrorist campaign. Those weapons targeted innocent citizens of the United Kingdom, cutting short some lives and changing others forever.
JUN30	Companies that police their workers' opinions are a danger to democracy	Most people who work will have a contract that allows employers to dismiss them under certain circumstances: incompetence, negligence, misconduct. But how far does that right extend? If the example of an Asda employee this week is anything to go by, too far.  Till worker Brian Leach was reportedly sacked by the supermarket chain after he shared a video of a sketch by comedian Billy Connolly on his personal Facebook page. Leach was said to have been dismissed after a colleague complained that comments in the skit - which takes aim at all religions - were anti-Islamic. Leach said he was called into a disciplinary meeting and dismissed without notice for violating Asda’s social media policy. Asda refused to comment beyond saying it does “not tolerate any form of discrimination from colleagues or customers and take such behaviour extremely seriously”. So, which was it? Violating the company’s social media policy or discriminating against a colleague? Or, as others have reported, bringing the company’s reputation into disrepute?  If one of the above, Leach would be right to feel confused. Legal precedent suggests Leach may have a freedom of expression case against Asda: a judge ruled in 2012 that an employee of a housing trust, who was a practising Christian, was unfairly dismissed after he expressed his opposition to gay marriage on his own Facebook page.
JUN30	My beloved Cambridge is being strangled by woke wars… but it’s not over yet	I used to love Cambridge; its dense, ancient beauty and social intensity cast a spell. Above all, throughout both of the degrees I did there, I loved the wild eccentricities of its elder geniuses. The death last week of Norman Stone, a historian of Eastern Europe who spoke eight languages fluently, including Turkish, was a melancholy reminder of a vanished era. Stone read history at Cambridge in the late 1950s, teaching there for many years before taking up the Oxford chair in modern history. He was also an alcoholic who lavished drink and wit on his favourite supervisees, authored some of the best books ever written on the Eastern Front; flirted wildly; had numerous affairs with female students, and taught students of both sexes to think. He hated political orthodoxies and particularly those on the Left. 
JUN30	Watch out, 'Boris Derangement Syndrome' has spread to America	In the olden days – before 2016 – I looked to The New York Times for halfway neutral reporting. Obviously, all media suffer from slanted coverage, and even the hallowed “paper of record” has always had an agenda. Yet I still admired the fact that the Times nurtured an ethos that put verifiable content above politics. Even if the selection and emphasis of stories was inevitably vulnerable to bias, this august institution seemed to honour the spirit of non-partisanship. Post-Trump, the paper has abandoned this ethos altogether, along with any pretence of objectivity. Last week’s hatchet job on Boris Johnson is a depressing case in point. The “neutral” headline “A Gaffe-Prone ‘Lord of Misrule’ Who May Soon Rule in Britain” appeared on the front page, and the paper didn’t even bother to subtitle the article, “News Analysis”, its usual cover for rampant editorialising. No, this was presented as a straight news story. The journalist tracked down numerous colleagues from Johnson’s past willing to denigrate his trustworthiness; a former editor of the Daily Telegraph Max Hastings is quoted, “He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.” Yet the reporter was strangely less thorough in interviewing Johnson’s supporters.
JUN30	Don't expect the next Tory PM to have the guts to grapple with the NHS	An irony of the campaign to choose Britain’s next prime minister is that the state institution most desperate for serious reform is not being discussed in any meaningful fashion: the NHS. Although Jeremy Hunt had ministerial responsibility for it for almost six years, the prime ministers he served wished the secretary of state to engage in day-to-day crisis management rather than overhauling a failing behemoth.

He says it needs more money, but not where it would come from, or how it would be spent efficiently. Trying to get an appointment with a GP can take days, echoing the sclerosis of a state-provided service once so typical in the Soviet Union and the old Eastern Bloc. One must not exaggerate: we are not yet at the stage of Jeremy Corbyn’s beloved Venezuela, where healthcare resembles that of a war zone and has almost broken down completely.

To say this cannot go on is beyond understatement.
JUL1	With so much at stake, only one of the Tory contenders has what it takes	If you are a former leader of the Conservative Party and have known both of today’s leadership candidates for about 30 years, how do you decide who to vote for? Before the ballot papers drop though our letter boxes from the end of this week, I have to make that decision, just like the other party members throughout the country. It is a decision made more difficult by the knowledge that if we collectively get this wrong there will probably be no further time to correct it. The whole idea of a broad, centre-Right party, which has an unbroken history in this country from Robert Peel to Theresa May, is now under threat. Serious mistakes in the coming months could be terminal for the world’s most enduring political force. Furthermore, one glance at the Leader of the Opposition, who nearly won the last election, shows the stakes have never been higher. In nearly 300 years of the existence of a British prime minister, Jeremy Corbyn would be in a category of his own for his hatred of so many attributes of the country itself. He loathes our entrepreneurs, despises our history, scorns our allies and often seems to sympathise with our enemies. Either Conservative would be a thousand times better than him. Indeed, so would any of the 10 who stood for the leadership, or any one of the 313 Tory MPs.
JUL1	Crushing dissent in Hong Kong will not be as easy for China as Tiananmen Square	The people of Hong Kong won a great battle when they forced the Hong Kong Government and Beijing to announce an indefinite suspension of the Extradition Bill last month. Their ability to bring two million Hong Kongers out on to the streets, along with the mass protests held on Monday on the anniversary of the handover, have stood as a clear repudiation of Xi Jinping's assertion that democracy and human rights are a “Western” concept that will not work in Asia.  But, sadly, although Hong Kong has won the battle it is unlikely to win the war.
JUL1	In the race to replace Juncker, the EU's sleight of hand reminds us why we voted Leave	The outcry over Manfred Weber exposes a serious flaw in the project’s organising principle The Remainers say “we didn’t know what we were voting for!” and, fair enough, lots of Brexiteers didn’t. But neither did Remainers. Back in 2016, they couldn’t say who their MEPs were or what the EU Council is or name any of the commissioners – and that’s a problem because democracy only works when you understand how it works and who is working it. The EU is a sham democracy. That’s the real reason Britain voted to leave, and the row over the next President of the EU Commission suggests that we’re getting out just in time. Brexiteers are accused of being obsessed with the Second World War, but the Europeans live very much in the shadow of Hitler and the terror of a return to fascism. The EU was constructed by men who were frightened of their own voters, so they cooked up a structure in which democracy is checked by a self-selecting, bureaucratic elite – a bit like the philosopher kings in Plato’s Republic or the clerics in Iran.
JUL1	Sorry, Mr Hunt – Leavers simply can't trust you to deliver Brexit	The Foreign Secretary's record - both before and after the referendum - does not inspire confidence Today Jeremy Hunt set out his ten-point action plan to secure a deal and prepare in earnest to leave without one. His newfound earnestness will come as a surprise to those who vividly recall his dire warnings during the referendum; when he said that leaving the EU would make each and every household in the land £4,300 poorer. But perhaps it is unfair to listen to what Remain politicians like Hunt said before the referendum, as many dramatically changed their worldviews when the sky did not fall in on 24 June 2016 – completely contrary to their dire predictions, growth continued and employment rose. Perhaps it is more fair to look at what they did and said after the referendum. Sadly for Hunt his post-referendum record does not inspire confidence.
JUL1	I'm an ultra-competitive sports day mum – and there's nothing wrong with that	I have never been competitive about anything. The only thing I’ve ever won is the hypothetical competition for Least Competitive Person. I don’t have what it takes to win and I don’t like losing, so mostly I don’t take part. I even sent my kids to a chilled, non-competitive school and we’re all incredibly happy. But then, my friends, came sports day. The moment three years ago my daughter won a little orange “1st” sticker for winning a Reception running race, a snarling monster reared up in my solar plexus. My eyes briefly flamed red. “You won!! You really won!” I roared. When we got home I held the sticker aloft and processed to the fridge where I lovingly placed it, smoothing the scuffed edges. It is still there. This vicarious taste of victory confirmed what I had always suspected, which is that winning is amazing. It’s brilliant! It’s addictive. I see the huge boost of confidence it gives my children to be picked out and unequivocally, in that moment, declared the best. And, yes, for me, it more than makes up for a lifetime of not even coming second in any kind of contest. Usually I trot in ninth out of ten – often solid last.
JUL1	The 'frail' Corbyn civil service leak is dangerous – and only feeds the far Left's conspiracy theories	Civil servants should never – must never – trespass into party political territory Sometimes it feels like the civil service is its own worst enemy. Its defenders (of whom I am one) never tire of pointing out its professionalism and competence, its ability to grasp complex political problems and produce pragmatic solutions. And yet such efforts are so frequently blunted by civil servants themselves. We’ll come to the most obvious contemporary example shortly, but it’s not hard to find recent historic examples of senior figures using the freedom of their retirement to say things that no one doubts were opinions even when they were still being paid a salary. Former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake, for example, only recently described a Boris Johnson premiership as “an opportunity for disaster”. And repeated offender, Lord Gus O’Donnell, last year accused Brexit campaigners of “peddling snake oil”.
JUL1	Jeremy Hunt's bid to match Boris on Brexit risks turning him into a sad tribute act	Tory members will be receiving their postal votes this weekend, which means Jeremy Hunt is fast running out of time to persuade them to elect him, rather than Boris Johnson, as their next leader. Judging by the latest polls of the membership, the Foreign Secretary is already too late. Surveys showing Mr Johnson has a lead of as much as 36 per cent should dispel any idea that an outbreak of Huntmania is about to sweep him aside.  What is holding Mr Hunt back? Brexit. He knows that Tory members are wary of having another Prime Minister who backed Remain during the referendum wrestle with Brexit, which is why he sought to make up for it by rushing as one of Theresa May's ministers to publicly declare his support for leaving the European Union. But the zeal of the convert was never going to match that of the victorious Vote Leave frontman who staunchly criticised Mrs May's Brexit deal for not delivering a clean enough break. By contrast, Mr Hunt sat in her cabinet throughout and loyally supported her deal in every parliamentary vote. Is it any surprise that Mr Johnson is finding it easier to persuade Tory members they can trust him best to do better?
JUL1	We don’t need a withdrawal agreement for a deal with the EU	Most people assume that a deal with the EU would mean getting some changes to Theresa May’s thrice-rejected withdrawal agreement (WA). This kind of deal faces three huge problems. First, timing. Negotiating changes to the WA with the EU, and then getting the necessary legislation through Parliament in time to leave the EU on Oct 31, would be quite impossible. The 175-clause Bill (still kept under wraps) is a horror story packed with contentious clauses. It effectively unrepeals the 1972 European Communities Act, and gives supreme status in our own courts to the WA and the EU laws which it applies to the UK.
JUL1	Scrapping HS2 would be a national embarrassment. Boris must commit to keeping it on track	HS2 seems to divide people as much as Brexit, and Tory party activists, like the public at large, usually have settled and noisy opinions for and against the country’s first new railway north of London for over 100 years. Jeremy Hunt has given HS2 his unequivocal support, while Boris Johnson has spoken of the need for another review of its economic benefits. No doubt his ear will have been ached by the groundswell of opprobrium in the Home Counties for this ambitious new rail project. There is, indeed, a conservative case for not building HS2. The strategic need for greater rail capacity is overwhelming but the project’s critics argue that this can be delivered much more cheaply by alternatives, via investment in existing lines, for example. Equally, the economic case made to justify the cost of HS2 can be criticised for using an absurdly lengthy timetable of 67 years and for putting hard values on advantages that are real but perhaps better left unquantified, such as quicker journey times and stopping overcrowding. Some also treat the financial case for HS2 with scepticism, given the civil service’s usual surfeit of optimism in estimating the costs of large projects. These criticisms are wrong, however. To declare an interest, HS2 will go through a field and a derelict barn of mine that I had plans for. There will be compensation, but it won’t be close to what I would otherwise have generated. I could be grumpy, but I had become convinced of the benefits of HS2 long before the route plans were published.
JUL1	We will prove Vladimir Putin wrong by leaving the EU by October 31	It is a matter of economic fact that, when Vladimir Putin says that liberalism is obsolete, he is talking the most tremendous tripe. Liberalism is alive. It is well. It is delivering prosperity on a scale unimaginable to previous generations. That is because a society that is free and inclusive and open will – on the whole – be the best place to start a business. It will be the safest place to invest. It will be the best place to start a family. It will be the best place to live. And there could be no better example of the triumph of liberal values, of course, than Britain today. There are all sorts of reasons why London and the South East are the most productive regions of the whole of Europe. There is the time zone. There is the language. There are the historic agglomerations of talent in the arts, culture, business and financial services. But there is something even more important; and that is the British sense of freedom to live your life as you choose – provided you do no harm to others – without the fear of persecution, or judgment, or discrimination.
JUL2	Why is the BBC splurging on million-pound salaries while taking away pensioners' free TV licences?	Is the salary issue at the BBC the fact that men earn more than women or that too many of either gender are paid too much? Gary Lineker, a fine footballer in his day, tops the list with an annual package worth about £1.75 million. That is a staggering amount for introducing a programme that most fans would probably watch if it had no presenter at all. We do not know this for certain, of course, because the market is an artificial one. Maybe Mr Lineker would get the same if he went to work for Sky; but there is no indication as far as we know of any attempt to poach him. Were he still playing football and Barcelona FC, say, was bidding for his talents, as happened in 1986, then his value would be apparent. But we only have the BBC’s word for it that he is worth £1.75 million to front Match of the Day. By the same token, Alan Shearer, another fine footballer, has had a pay rise of at least £20,000, which seems generous in the current circumstances – so straitened, indeed, that the BBC has to end the free TV licence for all over-75s.
JUL2	Missing golden eagles should not be pawn in political battle between landowners and wildlife groups	A cynic might say that it was all brilliantly orchestrated … The background story of how the world got to know about how two golden eagles had disappeared over a Perthshire estate was almost a text-book example of news management. Here we had a picture – made available to the entire UK media - of a politician, with pronounced anti grouse-moor leanings, cuddling an eagle chick called Adam.  Only now he’s expressing outrage that it might well be dead.
JUL2	Is the Chinese dragon about to kill its golden goose?	Who could have imagined that, 22 years after Britain relinquished control over Hong Kong, protestors in the territory would reach for the Union flag to symbolise their disdain for Chinese authoritarianism? Yet there it was being waved inside the smashed-up chamber of the Legislative Council amid startling scenes that have reverberated around the world. If the authorities in Beijing have managed to encourage a wistful nostalgia for colonial rule then they really have made a mess of things. It has long been feared that they would. In the decades running up to 1997, British governments fretted over what might happen. The island was not part of the 99-year lease on the New Territories obtained in 1898, having been occupied some 50 years earlier during the First Opium War.
JUL2	This country can leave the EU and thrive – but only with a true Brexiteer at the helm	We cannot have another Remain-supporting PM acting as a born-again Leaver Over the next week, Conservative Party members must ask themselves one key question: do we elect a leader who will continue to ignore the British people’s decision to leave the EU by dragging on with this Government’s failed strategy of kicking the can down the road? Or do we choose someone who is committed to delivering Brexit, come what may, by 31 October and who will raise our standing in the world? The future of the Tory party is on the line because of this Government’s failure to get Brexit done. Unless we have fresh leadership with the conviction and determination to leave the EU, the party will continue its precipitous decline. For three years, ministers who claimed they were pro-Brexit chose not to stand up for the 17.4 million people who voted Leave and failed to make a robust case for delivering on the referendum mandate. Our political class lacked confidence in our country and had no trust in the verdict given by the public. They sought the comfort of the EU making our laws and governing our destiny. No wonder the British people feel betrayed.
JUL2	With sporting role models like these, it’s a tragedy girls still think they have to change gender	I got home on Monday evening and turned on the TV to find a Wimbledon ladies’ match. I recognised Venus Williams – but who was the statuesque kid at the other end of the court? Her gaze was sphinx-like, betraying no emotion, save for a slight satisfied twitch of the lips when her opponent failed to get her racquet to an exocet serve. There is something miraculous about talent of that order. It makes you laugh out loud with delighted disbelief. This girl we had never heard of – her name was Cori “Coco” Gauff – was a fully-formed star. The prowling grace of her physicality, the precision of her stroke length, the way her sweet child’s face composed itself with the maturity of a champion. Cori Gauff is just 15 years old.
JUL2	How summer party chit-chat convinced me who will win the Tory leadership race	Lord Hague made an eloquent case writing for the Telegraph for Conservative members to back Jeremy Hunt in the leadership election. The only flaw in his otherwise excellent argument is that Mr Hunt could not attract back a single Brexit Party supporter. Quite the opposite. Leavers – some 61 per cent of Tory voters – would rightly be furious at having another undercover May-style Remainer thrust upon them. (Mr Hunt has deleted all of his Facebook posts from 2016, making it hard to see how anti-Brexit he was. Sneaky!) That would spell the end of the Conservatives. Otherwise, Jeremy would be an absolutely marvellous choice, apart from, you know, the destroying the party problem.
JUL2	Who is Jason Mohammad, and why on earth does the BBC think he's worth £355k a year?	When the BBC’s latest star salaries list was published at 11am on Tuesday, a bemused cry could be heard echoing around the nation. And that cry went: “Who the hell is Jason Mohammad?”  Once everyone had bothered Googling him (or been informed by a helpful acquaintance that “he's that Welsh bloke who does a bit of sport – no, not him, the other one”) several more cries went up. Specifically: “How come he’s on £355,000 per year?”, “Is he really one of the Corporation’s top 10 earners?”, “Are you absolutely sure?” and “Could it be a typo?” Sadly, it’s not a typing error. Jason Mohammad really does bring home a salary between £355,000 and £359,999, rocketing up from £260,000 last year. That’s an eye-watering pay rise of £95,000, the second highest hike in the entire BBC. You’d imagine he did something pretty spectacular to earn such an increase but, well, he didn’t. 
JUL2	It will take relentless focus for Britain to come out of the no-deal Brexit shock on top	The two leadership candidates have made clear their aim to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Their Plan A is a future free trade agreement with the EU. This is a desirable outcome. The challenge is that this depends upon raw politics, here and overseas. Thus we need to prepare for Plan B – no deal – where the UK leaves the EU at the end of October without any agreement on what replaces our existing relationship. We and they would become third countries to each other. It is a complex area, with near-term challenges for both. It would be an economic shock. ​ My preference is for a deal and an agreement on a transition period to our future relationship. While I would not call myself a supporter of no deal, it may become the only viable option for leaving and finally moving on. 
JUL2	As a Tory MP, I know we'll never restore trust in politics until we ditch First Past the Post	Having first stood for election in the midst of the MPs’ expenses scandal, I know what it is to face voters who have completely lost faith in Parliament. A democracy cannot work without trust between the electors and the elected – and in the fairness of the democractic process itself. So since I was elected I have worked hard, as I know others have, to find ways to restore trust in politics. As a back-bencher, I have secured as many debates on behalf of my constituents as possible. Each has been the result of a conversation with a constituent about a subject of great importance to them and the community: from fuel poverty, to the post office network, to community pharmacies, to the environment.
JUL2	Why the Brexit Party is a much bigger electoral threat than the Lib Dems	Since the 2016 referendum, British politics has been at once extremely volatile and astonishingly stable; in spite of the tumult of the past three years, the electorate's viewpoint is essentially unchanged. The country is about evenly divided on whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.     And yet, the two main parties have achieved record highs and lows at national elections in the last three years. The 2017 election delivered the highest combined vote share for Labour and the Conservatives since before the UK joined the European Community in 1973. The 2019 EU elections provided the two main parties with their worst results in national elections since universal suffrage. This partisan volatility is the inevitable consequence of a failure in statecraft by both Labour and the Tories. National voting intentions need to be understood in the context of vote distribution across constituencies. Some electorates are better distributed than others.
JUL3	I am the only person who can save the country from Jeremy Corbyn	Today the United States of America celebrates its independence. And while I don’t agree with everything President Trump says or does, he is absolutely right to say the alliance between the United Kingdom and the USA is the greatest in history. I’ve met the President several times and had productive discussions with him, businessman to businessman. As Prime Minister, I would meet him again in a few weeks at the gathering of G7 leaders in France. We’ll discuss how our two great nations can continue to keep our peoples safe from terror attacks by sharing vital intelligence, and how we can continue to create jobs and investment opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic. If Jeremy Corbyn were to take my place as Prime Minister, it would be a different story. We’ve seen the furious reaction to rumours about Corbyn’s frailty. But it’s not whispers about his physical fitness that should worry us, it’s his fitness to govern this country.
JUL3	The EU is a sham democracy, and its pitiful new leaders are the proof	The spectacle of the past few days has shown the EU’s big beasts at their unguarded worst Thank you, Eurocrats, for being yourselves. The best cure for Europhilia is always to observe the EU’s big beasts at their unguarded worst, wheeling and dealing in their natural habitat, unencumbered by any attachment to democracy, accountability or even basic morality. The spectacle of the past few days made for compulsive watching: we witnessed rare footage of the secretive process that propels so many retreads and second-rate apparatchiks into positions of immense power in Brussels and Frankfurt, utterly disregarding public opinion.
JUL3	Women footballers should show 'grace and humility'? Please	Was Alex Morgan “distasteful” for miming taking a sip of tea to celebrate scoring against England's Lionesses during this week's Women's World Cup semi-final? Was it rude, or, as one commentator tweeted, “bordering on a declaration of war”? Megan Rapinoe’s open-armed goal celebration pose has drawn repeated criticism, too, to the point where she was forced to explain on American morning television: "You're sort of on the stage, so I guess I'm looking at myself as a performer and trying to entertain.... It's sort of a funny playful pose and were always looking for good celebrations so this one stuck a little." As if no one had ever celebrated a goal in the history of football.
JUL3	Only moving to a fully-federal system can save our Union from destruction	Brexit has shown that where power lies matters. Half-hearted reform will no longer do. Can there be any doubt that the Union is in danger? England and Wales voted for Brexit. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted Remain. In Scotland, a second independence referendum looms. In Northern Ireland, devolved government is suspended. The Irish border is the roadblock to Brexit. English identity is on the rise. Tomorrow, Theresa May is in Scotland, where she will make a sincere case for the Union. This Friday, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will take part in Conservative leadership hustings in Perth. Both candidates will endorse the review established by the Prime Minister to work out how to strengthen the Union. Both will be quizzed on their plans to keep our family of four nations together.
JUL3	Watch out Boris, a no-deal Brexit could turn Theresa May into a chief Tory rebel	Prime Minister’s Questions is rather pointless when the Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn has to get answers from will be gone in a matter of weeks, which is why he turned his fire on the "fantasy" plans of the two men vying to succeed Theresa May. To make his case against a no-deal, the Labour leader could not resist seizing on the warning made by Philip Hammond that it would cost the public finances as much as £90 billion. The Chancellor has been increasingly rambunctious in his warnings against a no-deal, so will not mind giving Mr Corbyn ammunition, as he concluded that he will have no future in a Boris Johnson cabinet. Therefore, Mr Hammond is going down fighting for what he believes in before being sent back to the backbenches, alongside fellow no-deal critics like Rory Stewart and David Gauke. Mr Hammond will likely be replaced by someone much readier to consider a no-deal, like Liz Truss or Sajid Javid, as I pointed out elsewhere that Mr Johnson’s vaunted war on “sin taxes” leaves more Hammondish candidates like Matt Hancock out of favour. So that will give greater urgency to the “Gaukward squad” in their fight to stop a no-deal from outside government. 
JUL3	Enough with the Nazi analogies. The Brexit Party is not 'fascist'	Brexit Derangement Syndrome has led to a total loss of perspective Yesterday, while the EU anthem Ode to Joy played in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the new Brexit Party MEPs protested by turning their backs on the music. Make no mistake, this was an infantile rebellion that achieved little, beyond embarrassing Britain. But it certainly did not merit the apoplectic reaction it triggered on social media, as Remain-voting commentators revelled in the chance to deploy their favourite insult - “Nazi”.
JUL3	If Boris wants to help Britain's poorest, scrapping the sugar tax is the place to start	Milkshakes have played a bigger part in 2019 than I expected. Whether people are throwing them, ducking them or trying to tax them, they have become an unlikely symbol of the culture wars. Boris Johnson has now declared his hand in this important political debate. His policy on milkshakes is pro having them and pro drinking them. Down with the killjoys who want to extend the sugar tax to keep them out of the hands of the common man.  Mr Johnson has not only suggested that he will cancel plans for a milkshake tax, he wants to review existing sin taxes to see whether they "clobber those who can least afford it". He will not struggle to find evidence for this proposition. A study published in Applied Economics in 2015 looked at taxes on alcohol, cigarettes, fast food, cookies, cakes, crisps, confectionery, donuts, bacon, fizzy drinks, items sold from vending machines and out-of-home meals. All were found to be regressive, which is to say they took a greater share of income from the poor than from the rich. Many other studies have come to similar conclusions. Excise taxes can only be progressive when the product is much more widely consumed by the rich than by the poor. A tax on sports cars and Gucci handbags would be progressive because only people with money buy them, but governments rarely tax luxuries.
JUL3	From Brown to Corbyn, Stalinist purges are how Labour keeps order	You could almost hear the relief in Ellie Reeves’s voice: “I was really pleased to receive a message from [the Leader of the Opposition’s office] this morning saying the leader has stated he does not support the no confidence vote. This was the support I was hoping for when I contacted them about it on Monday.” Reeves, the Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, is the latest target for far-Left activists who hope to pass a motion of no confidence in her at their next meeting. The MP’s sin, on this occasion, was to have added her name to a letter demanding that Jeremy Corbyn ally Chris Williamson MP, suspended over claims of anti-Semitism, should not be allowed to return.  Reeves’s comment, after Corbyn had finally intervened on her behalf, reminded me of the closing scene of the 1994 Russian film, “Burnt By The Sun”. Set in 1936 at the start of Stalin’s purges, retired army general Sergei Petrovich Kotov is arrested by the state police for no other crime than being a war hero. Badly beaten up and thrown into the back of a black sedan, he manages a triumphant smile at his captors, believing he has a trump card to play. “You know I have Comrade Stalin’s personal phone number?”
JUL3	Let’s applaud the Lionesses for their tenacity and prowess - not how likely you are to bed them	I’m certainly not the first person to shed tears over a game of football. But any waterworks (“just some dust in my eye”) are usually the product of a devastating loss or relegation - not merely a load of people cheering in a pub. But this week I found myself welling up after England’s Lionesses scored a goal in their semi-final against the US. It wasn’t even that they’d managed to pull one back. I was just overwhelmed that the reaction - from women and men alike in my local - was akin to the Men’s World Cup last summer. Shouting, cheering, beer flying.  How much has changed in just a few short years, since we covered the Women’s World Cup 2015 in Canada on Telegraph Women and had a bit of a job getting anyone interested in it at all. 
JUL3	Yes, Ursula von der Leyen is an EU federalist, but she knows she can't afford to alienate Britain	Blonde, conservative, charms everyone, does detail: there’s a new player coming on stage in Brussels. If confirmed by the European Parliament as the next Commission president, the German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen will add formidable capability towards unpicking the Brexit imbroglio.   I worked alongside Ursula for three and a half years in Nato and EU defence ministers meetings and the round of international security fora. She was always a star presence: firm, clear and passionate. As US defence secretaries came and went, she was the doyenne of Nato ministers for over five years, always the first person you wanted to talk to on entering the conference chamber.   Despite differences back home in Germany, she held the Nato line in Afghanistan and committed German troops to the campaign against Daesh/Isis in Iraq. Though it still spends way below Nato's 2 per cent target, it’s important to remember that Germany, after we leave the EU this autumn, will be the only EU country leading one of the four brigades of Nato Enhanced Forward Presence in the Baltic. And it was Ursula who led the Nato response to the migrant crisis in the Aegean Sea: realising that this couldn’t be an EU mission, she brought Greece and Turkey together and drove the creation of the Nato maritime task group that has saved hundreds of lives.   
JUL4	By taking us out on time, Boris will jumpstart a trade deal with our friends in America	His cast-iron October deadline will allow discussions with America to commence this summer One thousand Conservative Party councillors have today pledged their support for Boris Johnson. Men and women who work tirelessly – and often unsung – to improve their communities have made it clear that they believe he is the one who should now become our Prime Minister. Leading this surge in support is Gary Porter, the head of the Local Government Association. After a barnstorming performance at the LGA meeting this week by Boris, it is significant that Gary and so many councillors who recognise what needs to change in the UK are backing him. And the sheer scale of this support shows how uniquely placed Boris is to unite the party and then the nation.
JUL4	Ousting Jeremy Corbyn now could spell catastrophe for Labour	His strategic ambiguity on Brexit enrages MPs, but it didn’t hurt at the last general election Some of the wildest rumours in Westminster involve Jeremy Corbyn’s supposed ill health. Many of them border on fantasy: that he has suffered a nervous breakdown, can barely speak and is being kept going, Lenin-style, by a cabal of malicious advisers. Such rumours are normally ended when he appears very much alive, revving up an adoring crowd. It’s his resilience, not frailty, that most dismays Labour MPs. They tried to get rid of him – they failed – and they now comfort each other by imagining he’ll resign. They should be careful what they wish for because the brutal truth is that Labour could do a lot worse than Jeremy Corbyn.
JUL4	The EU's new 'dream team' stand as proof that Brexiteers are on the right side of history	Ann Widdecombe’s magnificent cri de coeur in the European Parliament neatly encapsulated the anger and frustration of so many Leave voters toward the European Union – its corporate arrogance, political cronyism, disdain for the views of ordinary voters and its comic pretensions to be a proper sovereign state. They really don’t get it, do they? Some naive souls thought that after the 2016 referendum, our friends and partners in the EU would dial back on the bellicose rhetoric, the hubris and catastrophism about Brexit and this country’s biggest democratic decision. But it hasn’t happened. It’s business as usual. Donald Tusk even told many of us to go to hell. The last few weeks of ruthless and grubby horse trading for the top jobs in the EU demonstrate the hollowness of the hardcore Remainers' claims that this supranational political entity is an exemplar of democracy and liberty. The quasi-religious language of the EU as a grand project, a mission, the epitome of liberalism and progressive endeavour, is both laughable and troubling.
JUL4	The hunting ban was never driven by animal welfare, only hatred of conservatism	The red coated foxhunter has become a cipher for rural England and the Conservative Party Perhaps there was a time when the hunting debate was actually about foxes, but there can be few alive who remember it. The first Bill to ban hunting was moved in 1949 and for the next 55 years the ludicrous discussion of how (not whether) foxes are killed sucked up over 700 hours of parliamentary debate. The Labour manifesto of 1983 may have been ‘the longest suicide note in history’, but one commitment from it remained after New Labour had jettisoned the rest by 1997 – a free vote on hunting with dogs. The two huge successive Labour majorities of 1997 and 2001 finally saw hunting run to ground and by using the Parliament Acts to bypass the Lords (for only the 4th time in 55 years) the Hunting Act was passed.
JUL4	Why Corbyn loyalists are so determined to save their doomed leader	There can be no doubt that the Labour Party and its leader are facing a pretty torrid time right now. Yesterday the polling organisation YouGov recorded the party’s support at 18 per cent which, alongside a poll in 2009, is the lowest level in YouGov’s history. The finding has made headlines at exactly the right time for Jeremy Corbyn’s critics. With unhappiness over the leader’s continuing prevarication over his support for a second in/Out EU referendum, he is seen as particularly vulnerable. Could we be witnessing the end of the Corbyn Project? The short answer is yes, we could. But that’s only because at this weirdly chaotic and unpredictable point in our country’s history, everything is possible and nothing is likely. Jeremy Corbyn could resign. He could be forced out by treasonous allies. He could fall under a London bus (has anyone checked if Tom Watson is qualified to drive one of those?). He could be advised by his doctors that he is, as anonymous senior civil servants have claimed, too old and frail to continue.
JUL4	Forget Boris or Brexit – the real threat to the Union comes from giving in to nationalists’ demands	If anything threatened the Union during the last three years, it was the Withdrawal Agreement Over the last few years we have been told that leaving the EU will stop planes from flying, turn the M20 into a lorry park, cause unemployment to soar, treble interest rates and destroy the housing market. But now Project Fear has a new rallying cry, one that says that a Boris Johnson premiership will lead to the break up of the United Kingdom.  Not since George Robertson’s claim that devolution would kill nationalism stone dead has there been a more fatuous proposition. Do we really think that Nicola Sturgeon and her acolytes would be attacking Boris with such vehemence if they believed he would be the midwife for Scottish independence? In reality, the SNP are a failing administration which, despite benefiting from the Barnett formula and making Scotland the most highly-taxed part of the UK, is falling far behind England in economic performance and delivery of public services. 
JUL4	The Tories will struggle to recover from their abject failure on crime	In recent years, police officers who attempted to sound the alarm about the inevitable consequences of massive cuts to policing budgets were told repeatedly by the government that it was not about the numbers. Seasoned and dedicated professionals with serious and well-evidenced concerns were dismissed out of hand and accused of “crying wolf”. But it turns out that they were doing nothing of the sort and now, apparently, it is all about the numbers.  Boris Johnson’s announcement of plans to recruit 20,000 additional police officers in the event that he becomes Prime Minister represents both an acceptance and an admission: an acceptance (undoubtedly welcome) of the overwhelming need for urgent reinvestment in frontline policing and an admission (far too late) of the catastrophic failure of the government’s approach to law enforcement during the last nine years.  Because, rounded down to the nearest ten thousand, 20,000 is the number of police officers cut in England and Wales since the coalition government came to power in 2010. And so we are faced with a prospective Prime Minister compelled to acknowledge the need to undo harms that are entirely of his own government’s making.
JUL4	If Brexit rebels bring down a no-deal Prime Minister, he could still have the last laugh	The Conservatives' working majority of five means that it would only take a few Tory MPs to kick off for Parliament to be able to push the Prime Minister around, as Theresa May found to her increasing humiliation. That should mean Mrs May's successor, all but inevitably Boris Johnson, is doomed in his promise to ensure Brexit happens at very minimum without a deal by October 31. Plenty of Tories have made clear they do not like it, with Richard Harrington - who resigned as business minister over it - despairing on Sky News about it being "madness". But would he vote down a Conservative Prime Minister hellbent on delivering it? Er, no.
JUL4	This contest is closer than you think, as Tory members switch to Jeremy Hunt	The race to become the next Prime Minister is now hurtling towards a conclusion as postal ballots start winging their way to Conservative Party members over the next few days. Voting will begin very soon for those who had probably made up their mind before the campaign began. Both candidates know that their 160,000 electorate have some, let's say, entrenched Right of centre views hence the dog whistles over sin taxes and fox hunting in the last few days.  Amid all the smoke of battle it's fair to say, reflecting on my many conversations with party members, that a significant number of members are less certain about their vote now than when the contest begin three weeks ago - particularly as they have seen the wider public warm to Hunt. Indeed there is plenty of anecdotal evidence of members changing their minds and switching their vote. Commentators, like many Conservatives, are noticing a shift in mood, moving from a Boris coronation to a proper contest - a thoroughly good thing for both candidates - as being Prime Minister will test them to destruction.  Whether a mood swing will be supported in a poll or translate into the final result remains to be seen.
JUL4	Our obsession with paternalism has turned obesity into a disease from which there can be no escape	Where is the personal responsibility, where are the attempts to empower people? Boris Johnson’s pledge to review the “sin taxes” that have spread across the statute book with the inevitability of holiday weight gain has certainly divided opinion. Some have branded the move irresponsible and even dangerous, highlighting new Cancer Research UK findings linking obesity to more cases of common cancers in the UK than smoking. Steve Brine, the minister responsible for implementing the tax on sugary drinks, described the move as “transparent dog whistle politics” (whistling to whom? People who enjoy a full-fat Coke?)  Yet for most conservatives, I suspect the announcements will mark a welcome departure from the nannying currently dominating our politics. A party that claims to favour personal responsibility should not wield the blunt instrument of sin taxes, a form of collective punishment that penalises moderate consumers for the “crimes” of a small minority that indulges to excess. It is a punishment imposed in an increasingly indiscriminate and far-reaching way. Just last month Health Secretary Matt Hancock asked chief medical officer and self-described “Nanny-in-Chief” Dame Sally Davies to look into new taxes on pizza and cakes and to consider extending the sugar tax to milkshakes. 
JUL5	Boris the PM must act decisively in the first 100 days – or it will all end in tears	Mostly, the London-based media are ahead of the news. That is our job: it is our professional duty to find out what is happening quicker than someone who lives in Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. In the entire Brexit saga, however, the usual order has been reversed. The people “out there” have understood much more quickly than the people in the thick of it what is going on. Hence the utter shock of the Leave vote in 2016 to most of the elites who run the media and the country. This lag is still apparent. In Westminster, politicians and journalists are behind the pace, engaging in ultra-complicated speculations. I am not claiming any special, secret knowledge myself, so I could well look idiotic on July 23, but it seems to me that the situation is as follows. Boris Johnson will be the next Conservative leader, and therefore the next prime minister. This was all-but assured once he got so many votes from his fellow MPs. He was always more unpopular with them than with the members. By triumphing in the parliamentary party, he stilled enough doubters in the country to build on his already big constituency base.
JUL5	Boris cannot expect to beat Brussels at no-deal chicken without facing down Tory rebels	Boris Johnson has been quietly meeting prospective members of his cabinet, which may seem presumptive given there are over two weeks left to run in the Tory leadership contest. But no evidence has emerged to suggest he will not win in the end. In fact, Mr Johnson could clinch the leadership in the next few days given the haste with which many party members will be sending off their postal votes after receiving their ballot papers. The latest polling by ConHome finds he has 67 per cent of the vote, compared to Jeremy Hunt’s 27 per cent, suggesting the only variable now is the degree by which he wins, with his allies busy urging grassroots supporters to not forget to vote to give him as commanding a majority as possible as party leader.  The bigger the majority, the easier it will be for Mr Johnson to have his colleagues fall in line behind his Brexit plan. He has placed October 31 at the heart of his strategy, billing it as his "do or die" deadline and one that any minister will need to be "reconciled" with in order to serve in his government. 
JUL5	It’s easy to hate Nick Kyrgios, but tennis needs its bad boys	Spectators on Wimbledon’s Centre Court this week must have wondered whether they had travelled back 30 years. Before them on the hallowed turf, a petulant man-baby named Nick Kyrgios was raging at the chair umpire and blatantly trying to fire the ball into the chest of his opponent, Rafael Nadal. In the halcyon days of the Eighties, such scenes were commonplace. John McEnroe regularly treated officials to Gordon Ramsay-style rants. Jimmy Connors used to stroke his racket handle in a post-watershed manner. Ivan Lendl’s favourite tactic was the “tube”: tennis-speak for aiming directly at your opponent’s body from short range. It was all part of the fun. So what happened? First corporate dollars landed in tennis. And then came Roger Federer, the game’s greatest icon and a man who subscribes to a see-no-evil, speak-no-evil philosophy. As arguably the most revered man in world sport, Federer is tennis’s No 1 asset. Yet he has created a strange homogeneity within the locker room, as other players try to emulate his squeaky-clean façade.
JUL5	It'll take more than bobbies on the beat to restore order to lawless Britain	Leaving the EU is the number one issue for voters, but crime has proven itself capable of being the number two issue this year – and the next Prime Minister must have a bold plan to tackle it. The rise of crime as a political issue speaks to the undeniable rises in knife crime, serious youth violence, and related violence and thuggery – but it also speaks to the virtual demise of proactive crimefighting across large swathes of the country. The failure to provide adequate resources for this fight exacts a huge price on the poorest communities. Just imagine trying to bring up your kids on a housing estate where criminality and illegal drug use is obvious, explicit, and expected. The addition of 20,000 police officers – as offered by the likely next Prime Minister Boris Johnson – is a welcome step provided he can successfully set them free to fight crime. However, turning around the rest of our failing criminal justice system, while eminently achievable, will be much harder.
JUL5	The sooner we leave the unreformable and appallingly undemocratic EU, the better	During the opening remarks of a speech given this week by Antonio Tajani, the outgoing President of the European Parliament, he said: “Welcome to the House of European democracy.” The irony of his words was not lost on me and my 28 fellow Brexit Party MEPs and the collective laugh of disbelief which we gave earned us our first icy stare of the day. As all honest people know, the EU is not run on truly democratic lines, and over the ensuing 48 hours, any suggestion that the European Parliament is somehow in control of the EU was demolished. The Remain lobby likes to say that the UK should stay in the EU and reform it from within. Indeed, the new liberal group in the European Parliament, backed by France’s President Macron, has even renamed itself ‘Renew Europe’. But the idea of the bloc’s leaders showing any willingness to change in the way that Remainers think is possible is utterly naïve. This week, the various heads of EU nation state governments met in Brussels and over three days of horse trading decided between themselves who should run the EU for the next five years. That’s the way the game is played. Taxpayers and voters count for nothing. Ever since the 1963 Elysee Treaty – the pact of friendship signed by France and West Germany - the European project has been directed by the French and Germans. Events of recent days confirm that this is still the case, albeit the balance of power within that relationship now rests with the Germans.
JUL5	Good news for the UK car industry could be undone by a no-deal Brexit	There were two big pieces of good news for the UK auto industry over the last week in what has otherwise been a torrid year to date. The French automaker PSA said that Vauxhall Group was minded to build the replacement for its Astra model at its Russelheim plant in Germany and at its Ellesmere Port plant near Liverpool, beating off tough competition from PSA’s plant at Gliwice in Poland.   The new model will be built from 2021 onwards, and will secure further electric car production in the UK, a critical move as the sector shifts away from the internal combustion engine towards electrification.
JUL5	To beat Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson and Hunt will have to hope their housing plans work	As both Boris Johnson’s and Jeremy Hunt’s teams put forward new proposals left, right and centre to win over the Tory electorate, there is a benefit to the larger public – it gets ideas flowing again. The slog of Brexit has resulted in a dearth of the sort of domestic policies we need to revitalise Britain and improve the everyday reality of millions.  In between bumbling through suggestions around fox hunting, sin taxes, and licence fees, both candidates are claiming ground in the second most important policy space of the last decade: housing. Britain is facing a national housing crisis and the Tories are under threat from Jeremy Corbyn.
JUL5	Brexiteers show their gross ignorance by claiming the EU is oppressing Britain	Words matter. It’s an age-old maxim of politics, and indeed every aspect of life, but it is particularly true at this current time of political chaos surrounding the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Much attention has rightly been focused on the first sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg this week, probably far more attention than many other sittings of that formidable parliamentary body. The Brexit Party certainly made an impact or at least they gave the impression they did: the back turning, the incessant tweets laced with cheerful ignorance and a typically bolshy performance from Nigel Farage, to be honest, were all pretty standard. Seasoned European Parliament watchers have seen this all before from Ukip and the militantly eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party for over a decade, indeed the turning the back to a rendition of Ode to Joy is old hat, carried out by Farage and his then Ukip acolytes in 2014 also.
JUL5	Local leaders need to know how they can take back control of our money post-Brexit	Councils are at the heart of their communities and are responsible for hundreds of local services – from children’s and adult social care to homelessness services and housing. Between 2010 and 2020, councils will have lost 60p out of every £1 they had from central government to run local services, and faced with growing demand it is increasingly difficult for councils to deliver what their communities need and expect. This makes it even more important for the Government to act fast and replace EU funding for regeneration projects that support business, ensure our communities have the right skills, and upgrade our infrastructure, and to avoid councils and local partners across the country losing out on over £5 billion used to match vital investment in their communities.   This month we will see a new Prime Minister in either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, and one of them will have responsibility for the UK’s exit from the European Union. The next Prime Minister’s priority must be to set out its plan for a domestic replacement to EU funding post-Brexit.                                                                                                                                      
JUL5	Diary of a reluctant MEP: Au revoir, said Ann, but it's all too easy to get used to life in Brussels	In his EU diary, direct from the heart of Brussels, Brexit Party MEP John Longworth reflects on the absurdities of life in the European Parliament The EU truly is a smorgasbord of the absurd and the intriguing, a boullibaisse of autocracy and bureaucracy. There's a rich seam of mirth to be mined here in Brussels, although it appears to be recognisable only to an Englishman. We British MEPs are a friendly lot. We owe no malice to our European compatriots. Much though we deplore the EU's dull, anti-democratic, doctrinaire nature, we love Europe in all its diversity. I have found that many more of the MEPs in the Parliament than you might imagine also love us, they are just too afraid of their Stalinist masters to say it out loud. 
JUL6	The new EU leaders show that the Brexit Party aren't the only ones facing backwards	Where do people get the idea that Brexit is nostalgic? If you want proper château-bottled nostalgia, listen to Euro-federalists repeating their 1950s-era slogans about “more Europe”. Watch the EU pursuing ever-closer union while the rest of the world divides into smaller and more accountable units. Yet again, the people nominated to run the EU have one thing in common: they want to be citizens of a country called Europe. Here, for example, is Ursula von der Leyen, the German defence minister who has emerged as the successor to Jean-Claude Juncker: “My aim is a United States of Europe, modelled on federal states like Germany, Switzerland or the US”. Few European voters share that view, but it has been more or less compulsory in Brussels for 65 years. It is hard to imagine a more backward-looking slate of Eurocrats than the one just proposed. The nominees are backward-looking, obviously, in terms of ideology, longing for the federal superstate that Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman proposed after the war. They are backward-looking, too, in terms of geography. Eastern Europe is (again) under-represented, while the top jobs have gone (again) to people from the EU’s old, Carolingian core. They are even backward-looking in terms of ancestry. Mrs von der Leyen, the daughter of a German Eurocrat, grew up in Brussels. Charles Michel, who will take over from Donald Tusk, is the son of a European Commissioner.
JUL6	Boris could be our first pro-freedom prime minister since Mrs Thatcher	It is not quite true to say that politicians have stopped making the case for freedom. Tory MPs regularly trot out all the right words. We hear about the importance of “competition”, and “market discipline”. “Individual responsibility” gets a look in, normally as an argument against “hectoring” or “the nanny state”. Some of them expound on the superiority of “free markets” or a “low tax economy”. (But then ruin it all by saying tax cuts are good not because they are moral or fair, but merely because they can increase government revenues). The trouble is that it’s rarely convincing. A bit like Lefties who bang on about equality and climate change while living in big houses in Islington and taking two foreign holidays a year, it is a form of virtue signalling – but in this instance these Tories are telegraphing their “soundness” rather than their virtue. They mouth phrases they have picked up from the Eighties because that is what Tories are meant to do. They rarely have the self-awareness to realise that their actions (energy price caps, bans on this or that) contradict their rhetoric. And they end up sounding curiously old-fashioned, while struggling to apply the principles they claim to believe in to newer policy areas like technology. Late to the party, I have been watching the BBC's superb Margaret Thatcher documentary, A Very British Revolution. When compared to contemporary politicians, the most remarkable thing is the fluency of her arguments, made from first principles and informed by experience. Nobody in politics speaks like this today (from an interview Mrs Thatcher gave before she had become Tory leader): “The ordinary person wants really to be independent, doesn’t like being dependent on the state, doesn’t admire a person who always goes along to say the state must look after me… I believe I represent an attitude, an approach, and I believe that approach is borne out by the development of my own life.” 
JUL6	Bosses confiscating mobile phones at work? I just wish someone would do the same to me	When I first saw the remarks of General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress about banning mobile phones at work I thought I must be reading Private Eye. “Confiscating personal belongings is bad for trust and morale,” fumed Frances O’Grady. Down tools, comrades! That way, you’ll have both hands free for status updates. Surely, if an employer is paying someone for their labour, it is reasonable to expect them to actually do some work rather than spending all day on Instagram? The era when a mobile phone was just a communication device is long behind us. Now it is a portable entertainment system. Nothing wrong with being entertained, of course. But you should do it on your own dime. The issue was first brought to public attention by a professor of international history at the LSE who wrote to the Guardian to complain about the staff at the Last Word café in the British Library having to hand over their phones to a supervisor. “I wonder about the extent to which employers go in their desire to control those who have the misfortune to depend on them for their livelihood,” she said. Not sure about you, professor, but I prefer the people serving me hot coffee in the morning not to be texting their friends at the same time.
JUL6	Is First-Past-The-Post reform a conversation worth having?	Let’s end the week with a fun quiz. Of the four parties who jointly launched a campaign this week to change our existing First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system, which is the odd one out: the Brexit Party, the Greens, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats? Well, I thought it was fun, anyway. The answer, of course, is the SNP, because it is the only signatory to the “Good Systems Agreement” which is set to lose seats if the change actually happens. It’s all too easy – and extremely common – for parties to demand constitutional changes that will benefit them directly in terms of representation and influence. But to give the SNP its due, it is campaigning for a change that, even on its best electoral showing, could see it lose half a dozen seats. For example, in 2015, winning 50 per cent of the vote, Nicola Sturgeon’s party secured 56 out of Scotland’s 59 seats – 95 per cent of the total. Two years later it won 63 per cent of Scottish constituencies on 37 per cent of the vote. So either it is being remarkably self-sacrificing or it has signed up to the campaign simply to burnish its progressive credentials while hoping it comes to nothing.
JUL6	No-deal Brexit is not going to happen, whichever candidate wins the leadership race	Most of the contention in the Tory leadership race – let’s say 78 per cent for the sake of that mock precision that politicians love – is nonsense. The most clamorous, incendiary argument of all, about the prospective date on which the leader would be prepared to leave the European Union with no deal, is complete blather. We are not going to leave the EU without a deal, ok? That is because it would be in absolutely nobody’s interest on either side of the negotiation, to do so. In fact, a No Deal of the kind which most people imagine – an acrimonious, unmitigated flounce-off with maximum bitterness all around – would cause gratuitous damage of such dimensions to all the parties that no one in his right mind would contemplate it. The trash talk that has dominated the public utterances of both the Brussels negotiating team and the UK side is absurd. In the end, none of the major economic players in Europe – German manufacturers, French and Italian agricultural producers and Irish exporters – will be prepared to jump off a cliff for the sake of the Brussels centralisers’ death cult. It’s a non-starter. Never going to happen. This doesn’t mean that we should not, as everybody keeps saying, prepare for No Deal. Preparation is good. Preparation is indeed essential on both sides if negotiating interlocutors are to take one another’s positions seriously. And it is time that everybody got serious. The eurozone is in real difficulty with a rate of growth below that of the UK and the resentments of its more disfavoured members growing in organised force. So – dare I even write this? – it isn’t going to make that much difference to the final form of our exit from the EU which of the two candidates now busily parsing the distinction between absolutely-final-deadline and waiting-a-few-more-days to leave etc, actually succeeds to office. The details of whatever deal is reached will, it is true, depend on the resolve (or convincing bluster) of the man who conducts the operation and sets its tone. A determination to push the negotiation to its absolute limits, combined with astute diplomatic counter-moves (like Boris’s unilateral offer of a right-to-remain to all EU residents in the UK) will be absolutely essential. But these are tactical matters rather than substantive ones, which means that the personality of the leader is genuinely more important than the policy.
JUL6	Ban the 'bad boy' players who don't want to win Wimbledon	‘Do you regret going to the pub last night?” It was a fair question, seeing as Nick Kyrgios had just lost to Rafa Nadal at Wimbledon. Perhaps, one journalist wondered, things might have been different had he left the Dog & Fox before 11pm?  “You must have a really boring life,” replied the “bad boy” of tennis. Ouch.
JUL6	Behind every internet sensation like Simone Burns, there's a human life at stake	We may never know the truth about Simone Burns. What, aside from three small bottles of red wine, drove her to hurl racial abuse at staff on an Air India flight from Mumbai to London last year? If you saw that now-infamous four-minute clip of her foul-mouthed tirade at the time – during which she demanded more alcohol and spat at the cabin crew – you’ll remember how awful it was. In April, she was, quite rightly, sentenced to six months; on May 20, she was released on licence. Thirteen days later, she was found dead at the foot of Beachy Head. A friend – she did have some left – said her “world fell apart” after her drunken rant went viral and she became a target for trolls. If it all sounds horribly familiar, that’s because it is. Take your pick. How about 63-year-old Brenda Leyland, who, in 2015, was widely vilified for trolling Kate and Gerry McCann on Twitter. Using the name @sweepyface, she allegedly posted abusive messages about the couple, saying she hoped they would suffer “for the rest of their miserable lives”.
JUL6	It's time for tortured Labour to embrace its Remainer elite fate	In politics, what looks like the beginning of the end is often merely the end of the beginning. Take the paradox that is the Labour Party. It may seem to be on the edge of extinction, but in fact is on the cusp of reinvention – as a populist-bashing Remainer institution. On Thursday, for the first time ever, it fell to fourth place in an opinion poll. But just when you thought that this week would see yet another dismal chapter of Corbyn is Even More Useless Than the Useless Tories, in stepped the magnificent Ann Widdecombe. The energising power that this particular Brexit Party MEP has over liberal luvvies cannot be overstated. Every time she takes to the media, she acts as a sort of Thatcher-branded defibrillator for the deadened, divided Left. True to form, her controversial European Parliament maiden speech, which compared the UK leaving the EU to “slaves” rising up “against their owners”, briefly unified warring Labour in collective outrage. They professed their “disgust’” while smacking their lips with the sweet taste of their own self-important loathing. And they branded her a “bigot” and accused her of “white privilege” in tweets foaming with elated contempt. Meanwhile, of course, millions of traditional Labour voters agree with Miss Widdecombe. They see the EU for what it is – a nasty, crooked, global elite vanity project, sodden with petty bureaucratic control-freakery and tortured by nostalgia for empire.
JUL6	What Donald Trump can teach us about our history	Love him or loathe him, Donald Trump is never boring. I was especially gripped by the speech he gave this week to mark Independence Day. In the speech, he boasted that, during a key phase of the American Revolutionary War, the Americans “took over the airports”. The American Revolutionary War lasted from 1775 to 1783. I’m ashamed to admit that, up until now, I knew little about the American Revolutionary War. But, having heard the president’s speech, I’m not surprised that the British lost. After this crucial intervention by George Washington’s forces, the impact of the RAF – so critical to British success in later conflicts – must have been severely restricted. With our planes out of action, it’s disappointing that George III didn’t think to attempt drone strikes. Perhaps he feared that our drones would be detected by 18th-century radar, and shot out of the skies by a horse-mounted surface-to-air missile. 
JUL6	As the rest of the world introduces lower, flatter taxes, Britain is falling behind	The economics are simple: if you reward enterprise, you get more of it.” Then-chancellor of the exchequer Nigel Lawson wrote those words in 1988, in defence of the Thatcher government’s tax reforms. The same year his Budget took 2p off the basic rate and slashed the top rate of income tax from 60p to 40p. Now that’s a tax cut. But then, Lawson believed that low taxes were about far more than economic fine-tuning. As he put it, “tax reform... is in the end about changing the very culture of this country.”   More than 30 years on, much of the Conservative Party seems to have forgotten how to create a low-tax society, or why it matters. Many don’t even seem to want one. And while we dither, other nations are leaving us behind. In the Eighties, Lawson could boast that Britain was leading the world and helping to make tax-cutting “the new international consensus”. Today, enterprising nations are once again showcasing newly streamlined – and lower – levies, part of a global competition for capital, talent and business. It’s Britain’s tangled tax system that needs to catch up.
JUL7	There are two sides to the role of an ambassador, one public and one private. Our dual role must stay apolitical	There are two sides to the role of an ambassador, one public and one private. In public, you represent your country through the media, speeches, and events with the aim of making friends and influencing people. In private, you conduct delicate negotiations; and you report back, frankly, to your government on what is happening on the spot while offering honest advice on how best to pursue UK interests.
JUL7	University isn't for everyone – which is why we need more apprenticeships	I have no embarrassment in confessing that I was one of those kids that made Airfix models. I made planes –  Spitfires, Mosquitoes; and I made ships. The floor of my bedroom was turned into an impassable factory as I struggled, wheezing with concentration, to turn hundreds of tiny foot-stabbing plastic components into replicas of great naval vessels. I made HMS Ark Royal. I made a tiny HMS Cossack; and I remember staring at them in rapture when they were done. I was transported beyond the chaos of Humbrol paints and glue and debris and instructions – and I could see my ships in some storm-tossed Atlantic battle, with enemy torpedoes streaking towards them and fire spouting from their guns. No matter how incompetently I had glued them, no matter how sloppy the paint job, I always had that wonderful brain rush of completion: the unbeatable satisfaction that comes from making something with your own hands. So I perfectly understand why the six young apprentices I met on Friday were so transparently full of buoyancy and good humour. There were three young men and three young women – all from the Glasgow area – and they were working on the BAE Systems shipyard at Govan on the banks of the Clyde. They too were assembling a ship, but this one was no model; no kiddie project. They were making the real thing: HMS Glasgow, a Type 26 frigate.
JUL7	The real way to do American diplomacy is leader to leader – Thatcher and Reagan did it, and so can Boris and Trump	In leaked emails, the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Kim Darroch, describes President Trump as “radiating insecurity”, and speaks of his White House as a “uniquely dysfunctional environment”.  Sir Kim deserves a smidgeon of sympathy: it is no secret that dealing with the ever-changing Trump team can be tricky. But, overall, his memos raise a question: “What is the valued-added here?” We send diplomats abroad so that they can get closer insight into foreign powers. Sir Kim is effectively saying that he and his team cannot manage this. He blames Mr Trump’s shortcomings for their failures. The information contained in his missives is the sort of stuff you can read every day in posh newspapers and seems to contain nothing from the inside.  It is not true that no one British can get close to Donald Trump. I can immediately think of at least four people who have managed this in recent years. Three of them – Nigel Farage, Conrad Black and Piers Morgan – are outside the normal systems with which diplomats are familiar; but one was Foreign Secretary when Sir Kim first started writing his plaintive emails. Now that same man, Boris Johnson, is almost certain to become our next Prime Minister. 
JUL7	Why the sugar tax won’t stop people getting fat	One of my favourite pastimes at the Ladies Pond on Hampstead Heath is ogling the other women’s bodies. While there are a startling number of born bikini models, there are other types of bodies here, too, and of all ages, ranging from the shapely and plump to the downright enormous. My advice to those who were outraged last week at Boris Johnson’s idea of reconsidering ‘sin taxes’ on fatty and sugary food (and at health secretary Matt Hancock’s support for doing so) is this: spend a few summer afternoons at the Ladies Pond. You will soon see that whether a milkshake is £2 or £3 is a weird thing to obsess about. The Pond’s meadow, you see, presents a magical scene of vast numbers of near-naked women picnicking. Pay close attention to what the women are eating, as I do, and you see that it rarely maps onto body type.
JUL7	All the Nike flag row shows is that America has lost interest in the ideal of freedom	It’s the speed of the thing that is so unsettling. One moment, a word or image is completely safe – banal, even. The next, it has been declared off-limits by the woke Left, and everyone rushes to comply. Last week, Nike produced some trainers that had, on the back, an image of the first American flag – that is, the flag with stripes where they are now, but with thirteen stars in a circle in the corner. You might argue, I suppose, that it’s disrespectful to sport a flag on footwear, but that wasn’t the problem. The problem was that an American football player called Colin Kaepernick, who had earlier gained notoriety by refusing to stand for the national anthem in sympathy with Black Lives Matter, declared the image to be racist. What? What? The old flag has long been a symbol of inclusive patriotism. It flew, for example, at Barack Obama’s second inauguration in 2013. Yet, without hesitation, the cultural elites and politicians rushed to accept this absurdity. Nike, with predictable cowardice, withdrew the product. Beto O’Rourke, one of the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, sententiously declared “I think it’s really important to take into account the impression that kind of symbol would have for many of our fellow Americans.”
JUL7	Farewell to Christopher Booker, a man whose Sunday Telegraph column was THE one to read	I first met Christopher Booker shortly after I was elected to Parliament in 1997. Among his many accomplishments, he had already made his reputation as a courageous writer, determined to highlight the disastrous effects of excessive EU regulation on many rural industries, from abattoirs to cheesemakers. Christopher and I shared frustrations that increasingly damaging European regulations were being compounded by the ignorance of an urban Labour Government doing great harm to the countryside. The appalling failures of that regime were typified by the horrendous mismanagement of the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak, during which – as Christopher pointed out – 8 million healthy animals were unnecessarily destroyed. His weekly Sunday Telegraph article was the column to read. I was able to give him stories from my constituency which demonstrated the consequences of oppressive regulation and poor decision making. In the days before Twitter, this was a fantastic opportunity for a backbench MP to bring local issues of national consequence to wide attention. Combined with meticulous research from Dr Richard North, we made an effective triangle and won some important victories. One such success was the story of renowned balloonist Per Lindstrand, whose Oswestry firm was the leading manufacturer of “aerostats” – tethered helium balloons that carry 30 passengers up to 500ft. Lindstrand Balloons faced disaster in 2003 when the regulation of air safety was taken away from EU Member States and given to the European Aviation Safety Agency. A bureaucratic nonsense over the certification of the tethering winch meant that Lindstrand was suddenly forbidden to sell products in the EU.
JUL7	There's only one way for fashion to be sustainable, and that's for us all to stop buying new clothes	‘It’s not easy being green,” Kermit the frog was wont to sing – but many a chancing merchant seeking to flog cheap clothes to sensitive-skinned snowflakes would disagree. For years commerce has appealed to peoples’ desire to feel “special”, without having to go to the bother of actually achieving anything (which might take a bit of time and effort), by kidding them that the money being prised from their hot little hand isn’t just a basic transaction but rather a celebration of the buyer’s singularity (the trend for personalisation of products, whereby you can stare at your own face on a mug in the morning and fall asleep on a pillow printed with it at night has long amused me). But now you can go further than mere specialness when out on a tragic bit of retail therapy (rather than do something which might really boost your self-esteem.) With the advent of climate-panic and the understandable desire not to be strung up by Greta Thunberg and her barmy army, every last bargain basement has refurbished itself in shades of green; now you can buy righteousness and kid yourself that, as you shell out for yet one more pointless thing to plug the void, you’re actually saving the planet. The impact on the environment of the fashion industry – which depends on and defines itself by the buying of new garments with each new season – is calamitous; knowing this, and not wanting to lose Generation Woke, it has attempted to cover its back with a lot of flim-flam about “sustainability”.
JUL7	If the Tories really want to provide more homes, here's what they need to do	Housing is the Cinderella policy area in this year’s leadership contest – it’s simply disappeared from the ball. The public would be right to question the Conservative commitment to building more homes. Theresa May talked about her personal mission “to fix our broken housing market” but failed to deliver. Since 2010 the Conservatives have had eight housing ministers in eight years. And from the leadership contenders we know where they stand on fox hunting and “sin taxes”, but so far no sufficiently ambitious plan to solve the housing crisis, which has been festering for years. The Help To Buy programme has helped thousands achieve the dream of home ownership, but we are long way short of building the homes our country needs. I can imagine that spin doctors would advise their candidates to steer clear of the thorny issue of building more homes, and treat it as a third-term priority. But what is the point of being Prime Minister if you dodge, rather than deal with, one of the biggest challenging issues of our time? Brexit cannot be used as an excuse for indecision – urgent action is needed.

JUL8	The gloom is gone. This was the boyish Boris of old	Curious little snippet from the weekend. According to a poll by Lord Ashcroft, only 10 per cent of voters would let Boris Johnson babysit their children. Admittedly, it seems unlikely that Mr Johnson would ever offer this particular service – he already has slightly more lucrative ways of supplementing his backbench income – but, all the same, I think the public is being unfair. Personally, I would have no qualms about leaving my five-year-old son with Mr Johnson for the evening. I can picture it now. My wife and I, kissing our little boy goodnight, going to a lovely restaurant together, and then rolling home at about midnight, opening the front door as quietly as possible so as not to awaken the sleeping cherub.
JUL8	Team Sussex's demands for ever more privacy are alienating even committed monarchists like me	There is a growing tide of resentment against the couple for their secretive, high maintenance attitude Watching Serena Williams in action on Court 1 at Wimbledon, I was happily snapping shots of the superstar American powering down huge serves when I felt a tap on my shoulder. “Would you not take photographs of the Duchess,” a voice ordered politely. “She’s here in a private capacity.” The man, evidently a royal protection officer with his suspiciously bulgy blazer and highly-polished shoes, jerked his head to my right. I looked round. Scores of spectators had turned away from the court and were busy photographing a group of young women further along my row on their smartphones. Beneath a broad sunhat, I spotted a watchful, giggling face – Meghan Markle. No wonder the smartphones were out in their droves, just as they had been two days earlier when the Duchess of Cambridge arrived in the same section of the court with her entourage. 
JUL8	Our man in Washington was doing his job - no thanks to the leaker	We all benefit from being informed honestly of what is happening around the globe Britain has one of the largest diplomatic networks in the world, and each working day most of our 240 embassies and consulates around the world send in a report. Foreign Secretaries vary greatly in how much use they make of these ‘diptels’ – diplomatic telegrams – but since I love reading, I used to go through the whole lot every night. If everybody could read the foot-high pile of information received each day they would develop a pretty favourable impression of our diplomats. Usually well written, the reports are always candid, sometimes amusing, often prescient and add up to a daily crash course in world affairs. A regular reader of them should very quickly become one of the best-informed people on the planet.
JUL8	The West owes Iraq's persecuted minorities a lot more than just talk	Britain seems more likely to welcome returning jihadis than Christian or Yazidi refugees It says a lot about the condition of Iraq that the first person I meet tells me she is about to leave. The receptionist at the Classy Hotel – which has a swimming pool, a sauna and two guards with Kalashnikovs – says she’s going to Australia and she cannot wait. “Are you a Christian?” I ask. “Yes,” she says. Life, always difficult, has been hell for religious minorities since the 2003 invasion. In 2014, a band of fanatical Sunni Muslims called Daesh (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) conquered the Nineveh plains in northern Iraq and offered Christians the choice of convert, die or run.
JUL8	We cannot afford to be blasé about the risks of addictive video games	Gaming companies must realise the dangers, and act. The battle will be familiar to any parent of a school-age child – it happens in houses across the land every evening. “Dinner time!” you shout. Followed by silence. A repeat of the summons brings back, “but Mum, I can’t stop playing now, I’ll let my team down”. Small wonder that half of us with children this age worry that our offspring are becoming addicted to computer games. And before you scoff, it’s no laughing matter. Last year, the World Health Organisation recognised gaming disorder in its international classification of diseases. It is defined as impaired control over gaming that has had an impact on personal or family relationships, socialising, education or other spheres of life for at least 18 months. Sound familiar?
JUL8	The end of Corbyn spells the start of a whole new far-Left catastrophe	This week’s Labour Party crisis, however entertaining, feels too familiar. It’s like waiting for this summer’s blockbuster, then realising that the trailer over-hyped it, that it features the same old plot and the same old special effects. There are a few nuggets in there, of course, placed here and there to keep the jaded viewer interested. The non-disclosure agreement row is new and quite interesting, for example. And reports that John McDonnell and Diane Abbott have formed a Coalition of the Damned against Jeremy Corbyn’s closest advisers is intriguing enough to fill a few seats with popcorn munchers.  As for the rest of the plot, haven’t we been here before? And repeatedly? How often can anti-Semitism be relied upon to keep the fans’ attention? This is the fourth year in a row that that particular plot device has featured in Labour’s real-time biopic, and we seem no nearer a conclusion than we were in 2016. Even “The X-Files” accepted defeat and admitted that the “invasion” plot would never be resolved.
JUL8	The UK's aid budget must reflect the fact that global poverty and climate change devastation go together	The idea that we have to choose between people and nature is entirely false Every minute, 40 football pitches' worth of forest disappears. Our oceans are being polluted at such a rate that by 2050 they will contain more plastic than fish. In the last fifty years, global wildlife populations have declined by an average of 60 per cent. Whole species are disappearing at an unprecedented speed, with over a quarter of animals and plants threatened with extinction. These sobering statistics are just a glimpse of the environmental tragedy that the world faces. The erasure of iconic animals and the destruction of beautiful landscapes is a crisis on its own terms, but it represents an existential threat to people too. Nature is at the root of everything we rely on – from the air we breathe to the water we drink, from the soil we use to grow our food, to the places we go to relax. When we cut down forests, we deprive humanity of a source of clean air and income; when we pollute the oceans, we deny people access to fish to sell and eat; and when we degrade soil, it is humans who suffer as crops fail and food becomes scarce. 
JUL8	The civil service is consuming itself with anti-Brexit resentment	It’s widely-understood now that a Boris Johnson government seeking to accept no deal will clash heavily with Parliament. But what about with the civil service? For some time it has been thought that the Treasury civil servants and those in the Bank of England were extremely opposed to no deal. The Bank of England even put out a report suggesting that in a disorderly no deal, GDP might contract by 8 per cent within about six months — the kind of thing that happens in a civil war, rather than from an economic shock. The Treasury has not been much more enthusiastic, suggesting that no deal could induce a contraction in GDP of even more than 8 per cent over a few years and that it is absolutely imperative that there be a standstill “transition period” post-Brexit whilst the UK and EU negotiate a new trade deal. But these narrowly economic departments do not appear to be the only locus of civil service concern. Philip Rycroft, former civil service head of the Brexit Department, has told the BBC's Panorama that no deal is "fraught with risk" and everyone should be worried. This has led to concerns that a Boris Johnson government trying to embrace no deal might meet widespread resistance or non-cooperation from the civil servants that they would rely upon to implement their plans.
JUL8	Boris will need an ambassador Trump trusts in Washington. Why not send Nigel Farage?	What amazes me about Sir Kim Darroch's analysis of President Trump is not the fact it was leaked, nor the unflattering remarks he made, but how little insider knowledge he seems able to offer. One must hope the UK's ambassador to the United States has saved the real insights for memos seen by an even more discrete and narrow group across Whitehall as, judging by what has been leaked, he knows little more about what is going on in the White House than the average political commentator. Apparently, President Trump is a plain-speaking guy who likes glitz. He presides over a "uniquely dysfunctional environment" at the White House, according to Sir Kim, who opines as if no one else might ever reach that conclusion themselves. “The stories about White House knife fights are, we judge, mostly true: multiple sources and confirmed by our own White House contacts,” he warns, a view anyone would reach if they just follow the reports with a healthy scepticism. Perhaps those "multiple sources" are the media outlets he most likes to read. 
JUL8	Absurd feminist demands for equal pay will kill women's football	Was there any worse way for the US women’s football team to celebrate their victory in the World Cup than to start bleating about equal pay? No sooner had the final whistle blown than the leading goalscorer, Megan Rapinoe, was threatening to boycott a possible invitation to the White House.   The entire team is already suing US Soccer, claiming discrimination on the grounds that male teams can earn more than women's if they win their matches (although they earn less than the women if they lose, owing to a different bonus structure). Until the women's world cup descended into a political rally I was, like many people who have never watched women’s football before, just about starting to warm to it – in that I watched almost the entire first half of England’s semi-final against the US. I am not sure that I will be bothering again. Like most people, I have a limited appetite for watching sport on the telly, and when I do sit down to watch something I want to see some exciting sport – not a festival of gender politics.
JUL9	Point-scoring Hunt portrayed Boris as Mr Untrustworthy - and became Mr Annoying in the process	Nobody in his right mind expected any substantive new information to come out of this thing. After all those hustings we could have recited the stump speeches pretty much word for word as the candidates proceeded to do themselves. The interest was how the personalities were holding up - and there was some real news there. Jeremy Hunt had a clear choice. He could effectively give up the fight and play nice - thereby setting himself up for the partnership that may yet come. He could join in with the good-natured joshing of the soon-to-be prime minister who might well be considering giving him the deputy leadership, and keep it all good natured, making it clear that the unity of the party was now the top priority. But he didn’t.  What he did - with more and more desperation - was hector, interrupt and accuse Boris (often wrongly) of failing to answer questions. It looked peculiarly unattractive because it was so out of character: Mr Hunt now rails against his reputation as Mr Nice Guy because he thinks it will make him appear a weak negotiator with ruthless diabolical Brussels - but in truth, his civility and decent manner are his political strengths.
JUL9	Can the Civil Service survive Brexit?	To put it mildly, Nigel Farage didn’t hit it off with Sir Kim Darroch. When Our Man in Washington (for the time being) was Britain’s envoy to the EU, he came to see the then Ukip leader in his office and “compromised himself in a rather devastating way”, as Mr Farage described it in the Telegraph on Monday. “During our conversation, I said to him: ‘You’re a professional civil servant, aren’t you supposed to be neutral?’ He replied: ‘No. It’s our policy that the European Union is a good thing.’ I asked him to leave. I couldn’t see the point in even continuing to have the conversation.” With the greatest respect to Mr Farage, he got the wrong end of the stick here. It is not the job of the civil servant to be neutral but to carry out the wishes of the government of the day. At the time, British policy was that membership of the EU was A Good Thing. Sir Kim, whatever his other faults exposed by the vicious spat with Donald Trump, was merely reflecting that position.
JUL9	Theresa May has never got Donald Trump. For the sake of US-UK relations, the next PM must woo him	For all of Theresa May’s warm professions of friendship for Donald Trump, the cold reality is that her premiership has witnessed a noticeable decline of British standing in the affections of the White House. It is not simply that we struggle to muster sufficient numbers of soldiers, warships and warplanes whenever a global crisis arises that obliges the Government to deploy our Armed Forces, thereby requiring the Americans to make up the shortfall. The Trump administration has also been prepared to tolerate Mrs May’s insistence on pursuing her own agenda on key issues like the Iran nuclear deal and global warming. Ever since Mr Trump entered the White House, his administration has given Britain the benefit of the doubt on such subjects primarily because of the importance it attaches to sustaining US-UK ties. Maintaining the transatlantic relationship on key issues such as intelligence-sharing and military cooperation is seen as being far more important than policy disagreements over how to curb carbon emissions or preventing rogue states from acquiring nuclear weapons.
JUL9	It’s time Meghan was taught a well-known British phrase: ‘Get over yourself, love’	Diana would never have done it. That was my first reaction to the news that the christening of the baby son of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be conducted in private in a chapel at Windsor Castle, with no media allowed. The late Princess understood perfectly that the bonds of affection and loyalty between the Royal family and the British people stay strong because the Windsors share key moments with the public. A Royal christening is the first time we are introduced to a member of our extended national family. People look forward to it; it’s part of the sweetness in life. To disappoint them is churlish and rude. Nor, you can be quite sure, would Diana’s protection officers have been told to tick off members of the crowd at Wimbledon who took pictures of her on their phones because she was there “in a private capacity”. Astonishingly, this is what happened when the Duchess visited the tennis championships last week to cheer on her friend Serena Williams.
JUL9	The Remoaner sausage boycott shows the shape of things to come	Once reserved for heinous regimes, embargoes are now deployed on firms with the 'wrong' opinions Earlier this week, a group of hardline Left-wingers and Remainers chose to channel the fury they usually reserve for metaphorical “gammon” – middle-aged white men – towards something closer to the real thing; Heck, a family firm that manufactures gluten-free sausages. Its crime? Hosting Boris Johnson at its factory. Just hours after pictures surfaced of the leadership hopeful posing with a string of sausages around his neck, Heck’s Google review rankings had plummeted after being bombarded with one-star ratings from “customers” who had stayed strangely silent before the furore. The Twittersphere was flooded with such gems as “Anyone who supports a racist, arrogant, self-promoting, ruthless, Trump-loving arsehole deserves all they get. Hope Heck goes into liquidation now” – adding, hilariously, “although feel sorry for the workers”. Such is Boris’s power to enrage that anything he touches seems irreversibly tainted in the eyes of the Left. You’d – almost – predict boycotts of other initiatives he has championed, like the London Living Wage, or even the capital’s annual Gay Pride parade.
JUL9	Trigger warnings at the theatre are pandering to a PC, over-sensitive section of society	Friends are urging me to go and see Sir Ian McKellen in the one-man show marking his 80th birthday. The great actor, forever that impish lad from Bolton, delivers readings from Lord of the Rings and Shakespeare as well as reviving his uproarious panto turn as Widow Twankey. It got us talking about the best McKellen performances. I remember seeing him, back in 1979, in Bent at the Royal Court. McKellen and the equally wonderful Tom Bell played two homosexuals in Nazi Germany.
JUL9	Wimbledon officials are quite right - the patient art of queuing is what unites us in this country	
Follow your club now for first access to all our news, views and analysis
 Like democracy, queuing may not be perfect but it is the least worst option in any civilised nation. When my daughters were little I deliberately used to take them to the post office at lunchtime. Yes, you heard: peak parcel hour.  But there was method in my madness. Sometimes I would bring the dog for added complication and we would all stand for 40 minutes or more queuing. The children hated it.
JUL9	Debate: Should Kim Darroch be dismissed from his post as US ambassador?	The UK's ambassador to America is in hot water after confidential despatches in which he described the White House as 'uniquely dysfunctional' and President Trump as 'mired in scandal' were leaked. The President's furious reaction has presented a tricky conundrum for Number 10 which must balance maintaining cordial relations with an ally and showing loyalty towards a senior diplomat. So should Kim Darroch be removed from his post? Telegraph commentators Patrick O'Flynn and Mark Almond disagree... Has Sir Kim Darroch done anything wrong? This is the question many pundits are posing as they consider the future of our man in Washington DC. My assessment is, to quote the late, great Paul Daniels, “not a lot”. Sir Kim has been very unlucky to have his confidential despatches about Donald Tump and his administration leaked but also a little foolish not to have written them with that possibility in mind given that we are told more than 100 people in Whitehall had access to them. It was also rather disappointing that the despatches did not seem to amount to much more than a dull recitation of cliched liberal-left opinion as trotted out by the Washington Post or New York Times. But this is the wrong question to ask. Instead, we should be thinking: “Is Sir Kim Darroch the best person to be the UK’s primary diplomatic representative in Washington, charged with nurturing our special relationship with our most important ally?” And the answer to that is an obvious and resounding “no”.
JUL9	The cries of victimhood from NHS doctors asked to pay more tax are an insult to the public	No group of staff in Britain are more admired than the NHS workforce. In a secular society where worship of the health service has become a substitute religion, its employees are treated like a priesthood, revered for their dedication, self-sacrifice and expertise. Yet all this public adulation has only produced a mood of relentless victimhood across the sector. We are constantly told that morale has never been lower or stress higher. In this climate of permanent grievance, exhausted GPs are said to be leaving in droves, even though most of them now work part-time, while junior doctors have just settled a long-running dispute over pay and conditions.   Now the consultants are getting in on the act.  
JUL9	Nadiya Hussain has the right idea – life's too short for peeling spuds when you can get them from a tin	I have penned many a soliloquy on my long-standing love affair with tinned potatoes. We all have our kinks, our vices, our misunderstood longings, and baby potatoes, stripped of their skins and parboiled in briny water, is mine. I used them with such reckless abandon in one cookery column that my editor had to stage an intervention, directing me to more reader-friendly fare such as chorizo, lemongrass and osso bucco. I sulked, I was evangelical to the point of obsession about them, and I didn’t last much longer, after that.  Readers would comment below the lines every time, aghast, seemingly unaware that they weren’t essential. But in my opinion, there is something undeniably delightful about popping open a can of spuds and having a potato salad in front of you three minutes later.
JUL10	Wanted: A tax-cutting economic revolution to halt Britain's slide towards recession	There are bulls, there are bears and then there’s Boris, that great “peddler of optimism”. Far from being the withering put-down Jeremy Hunt intended it to be, the description encapsulates Johnson’s greatest strength. He is a can-do, fizzy, optimistic Tory, a believer in human freedom and ingenuity, an enemy of the stultifying, the technocratic and the boring. As a moonshot politician, he ignores the miserabilist experts who tell him nothing can be done – which is just as well, given that he is racing into an extraordinarily vicious and complex political-economic storm. There will be no honeymoon for PM Johnson, no settling-in period, just rage, chaos and a possible recession. The warfare has already started, with an apoplectic, almost deranged establishment seeking to blame him for Sir Kim Darroch’s resignation – even though our ambassador to the US was doomed from the moment his memos were leaked – and Sir John Major threatening to sue the next PM if he attempts to prorogue Parliament.
JUL10	Donald Trump knows Boris is the man to get Brexit done and resuscitate the UK-US alliance	It is perhaps unsurprising that the British ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, felt the need to resign after Donald Trump’s condemnation of comments he made in leaked diplomatic cables. But the ambassador’s critical views of the White House point to a wider problem. Despite the success of the president’s state visit to Britain, Trump and Theresa May have long been worlds apart in terms of vision, outlook and approach. There is no chemistry between them, and May has shown little interest in building a partnership with Trump, frequently siding with the EU over the US on foreign policy matters. The special relationship has been left weakened. This week’s diplomatic spat will not, however, alter the reality that the alliance will be in a far better place once May steps down. Here in Washington, the expectation is that Boris Johnson will be in Downing Street on July 24, and will immediately be America’s most important ally. For the US, a Johnson premiership represents a powerful opportunity to reignite the special relationship.
JUL10	It's outrageous that Len McCluskey and his Union mates are dictating Labour's Brexit policy	The Labour Party finally has a position on Brexit. It wasn’t decided by the party leader, or the shadow Brexit secretary. The shadow cabinet didn’t drive a collective decision on the biggest issue facing the country, nor did the parliamentary Labour party take a vote, nor even delegates at the Labour Party conference. No, this week – a full three years after the Brexit vote occurred – Her Majesty’s Opposition was strong-armed into its approach by the secretaries-general of the five largest affiliated trade unions. It’s a position suitably obtuse that you can tell it’s been written by committee. Labour will demand another referendum in which the party shall support Remain if either there is no deal or the deal on the table is negotiated by the Conservative party. In the event Labour magically wins a general election before Hallowe’en, forms the government and negotiates their own Brexit deal, there’ll still be a referendum and the party will then decide whether to campaign for or against the deal they’ve just negotiated. Or, in layman’s terms, Labour will support Remain for as long as people don’t vote for them; but if people do vote for them, they’ll support Brexit. Possibly. It is patently absurd. But putting the policy itself aside for a minute, how on earth did we get to a place where Len McCluskey and chums can lock themselves in a room, write a half page briefing note and give it to Jeremy Corbyn, who then takes it to his shadow cabinet for rubbing-stamping a day later? And how – given the amount of ink that is expended on Brexit coverage – can the UK’s news organisations just report this as if it was a normal route of policy formulation?
JUL10	Whitehall must find the sneak who betrayed Sir Kim Darroch	No doubt Sir Kim Darroch’s resignation is intended to put a lid on the controversy stirred up by the leaks of his unflattering portrait of the Trump White House – and the President’s tempestuous response. For all concerned it is an unfortunate development. The only winner is the malicious leaker and that sets a very bad precedent. The American President and Foreign Office could rue the day when a malcontent can set the agenda for far more than ambassadorial appointments. Anglo-American relations have been soured. After all, many of the sharpest critics of Donald Trump’s twitter-storm have been staunch Atlanticists. Since all diplomacy is personal and depends on an ambassador’s ability to charm and to soothe ruffled feathers to do the job, anything which antagonises the host government is bound to end badly. My main criticism of Sir Kim, otherwise the innocent victim of what should have been treated as a storm-in-a-teacup, is that he resigned too soon. Anyone familiar with Donald Trump knows that he  blows hot and cold but never Goldilocks-like. Eruptions of “You’re fired” are to be expected regularly and equally quickly the anger passes. Trump may soon be asking why did the Brits get rid of Kim, as he was helpful over the state visit.
JUL10	From the Caesars to Carrie Symonds, women are always pawns in the political game	Symonds and her glittering career have become collateral damage in the battle to bash Boris ‘Behind every successful man,’ the cliché runs, ‘there is a strong woman.’ So as Boris Johnson romps his way towards No 10, it’s perhaps not surprising that the character of his girlfriend is under intense scrutiny. But while our putative PM refuses to answer questions about his "loved ones" - while destroying their sofas with perfect impunity - it’s rather shocking to see how Carrie Symonds’ private life is being pulled apart publicly.  According to a succession of recent 'scoops' - or vicious personal attacks - depending on how you look at them - the 31-year-old was sacked from her last job because she was bad at it, ran up vast taxi bills and blamed them on her staff, while leaking stories damaging to Theresa May. 
JUL10	Do Remainer MPs really have the power to block no deal?	Yesterday, MPs – led by Dominic Grieve – launched another attempt to prevent no-deal on 31 October.  Targeting the Northern Ireland Executive (Formation) Bill as the nearest available piece of legislation, Dominic Grieve tabled amendments, which were meant to combine to create both rolling opportunities for MPs to intervene in the face of a no-deal scenario and explicitly prevent a new Prime Minister from using prorogation (suspension) of parliament to avoid that threat.  The prorogation element was not selected by the Deputy Speaker, and of what remained, MPs only approved – by one vote – a single element; a requirement that the Government must publish regular reports on progress towards the formation of an Executive in Northern Ireland. The first report must be on or before 4 September, a further report is then needed on or before 9 October, and then further reports every fourteen calendar days until 18 December or the formation of an Executive. 
JUL10	John Major's outburst will only quicken the screeching downfall of our elite	The former PM's nerve and hypocrisy is something to behold Three years after Britain voted to leave the EU by a million strong majority, John Major popped up on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme again. Having denounced the EU referendum result repeatedly, Sir John now announced that if Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, he – Major – would be prepared to take legal action to prevent the government proroguing Parliament. It takes some nerve for John Major, a man last elected to high office twenty-seven years ago, to try to get the judges involved in his anti-Brexit endeavours.
JUL10	Let's stand up to David Attenborough and the neo-Malthusians who want to control our lives	Attenborough and his ilk give a reasonable veneer to authoritarian and impractical ideas For someone who purports to be a national treasure, Sir David Attenborough’s select committee performance yesterday was more of a national disgrace. He should be applauded for educating millions about the natural world, yet he now wants to control our lives, cut down our choices, and shut us out from experiencing these same wonders. The broadcaster said that he wants people to pay more for airfares - removing the newly found opportunity to travel from millions of lower income families - and warned that other parts of life would have to be cut back for environmental reasons too. When asked about the greater effects of his proposals on poorer families he coldly responded: “Yes. I’m afraid that is the case."
JUL10	Harry and Meghan are playing a risky game with the monarchy's 'social contract'	Forget Wimbledon, or women's international football. Is the real sport du jour this summer turning out to be the diversion of Meghan and Harry bashing? Think about it. Anyone can play, the target is a soft one, and it's unlikely you'll suffer  little more than a spot of repetitive strain injury for jamming so hard on the keyboard. But are the Duke and Duchess of Sussex really deserving of all the opprobrium being poured on their heads?
JUL10	Boris Johnson showed true leadership by refusing to back Sir Kim Darroch against Trump	Jeremy Hunt may well be regretting his most high profile mistake of last night’s Tory leadership debate – accusing his opponent, Boris Johnson, of “peddling optimism”. But in hindsight, I doubt if that was the foreign secretary’s biggest faux pas of the evening.  Because in the sentence immediately preceding that rather odd accusation (voters tend to prefer optimistic politicians to the gloom-mongers – remember Gordon Brown versus David Cameron?), Jeremy Hunt said this: “Being prime minister is about telling people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear.” He’s absolutely right, and it has been a central part of my criticism of Jeremy Corbyn that he has spent his entire career telling his audiences exactly what they want and expect to hear. That is not leadership; in fact it’s the opposite.
JUL11	Boris will be expected to keep pressing the right buttons in support of the Union	It’s taken a while but slowly and surely the signs are that much of the Scottish Conservative hierarchy is shaking off its horror at the prospect of a Boris Johnson premiership. They’re still not exactly enamoured of the idea, but there’s no doubt that they’re, perhaps reluctantly, accepting that there’s no future in refusing to accept that Boris is still the man most likely to become UK Conservative leader, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, by the end of this month. Retreating into some form of massive sulk will do nobody any good and so the aim now is to find a way of coping with a new Prime Minister, a Cabinet stuffed with his placemen, as well as a new Downing Street regimen, where nobody appears to see - in spite of protestations to the contrary – the maintenance of the United Kingdom as the government’s top priority.
JUL11	British diplomats did not bother to find the method in Donald Trump's madness	Dysfunctional, clumsy, inept, insecure: it’s easy to apply all of these words to the Trump administration. Newspapers do so on a regular basis. Social media is full of it. But the diplomat’s job is different: to take a step back and try to solve the puzzles, or find method in the madness. For example: why, if Donald Trump is so awful, did he ever make it to the White House? If his presidency is an abomination, why does he stand such a good chance of re-election? How should British diplomats respond to the trends that Trump embodies which are changing politics (and diplomacy) around the world? Donald Trump’s treatment of Sir Kim Darroch has been abominable. For an American president to attack a British ambassador in such vituperative terms raises serious questions about how strong an ally we can ever expect Trump to be. But there are questions, too, about the quality of advice Sir Kim was giving in his memos back to London. To say that Trump “radiates insecurity” and is “mired in scandal” is neither new nor controversial. Nor is it useful or insightful. It suggests that, for some time, our officials may have been looking at Trump in the wrong way. The British embassy in Washington has long been famous for Gatsby-style diplomacy, holding lavish parties and drawing various people into its circle. Until Trump came along, this was all quite effective. British diplomats predicted the elections of Bill Clinton and George W Bush and were well connected with both campaigns. But they were blindsided by Trump. They kept throwing parties: Sir Kim’s anonymous "friends" say he attended an astonishing 700 various events last year. But these methods just don’t work as well with a Trump White House operating by very different rules.
JUL11	How to limit hateful content without curbing creativity? We at YouTube must strike the right balance	When Stormzy took to the stage at Glastonbury, I was blown away. Like so many of us, I was struck by his energy, his lyrics, his look. It was powerful and so... British. It made me think. In the creativity stakes, Brits have long punched above our weight. For a small island, we boast leading actors, musicians, writers, filmmakers and artists. I’m proud that, over the last decade, YouTube has played its part helping young artists go from unsigned hopefuls to global sensations. The same is true for creators of all sorts, from Geordie science teachers and Welsh market-gardeners to mental health vloggers and videos devoted to cooking, crafting or cycling. That’s why I’m passionate about the powerful role of open platforms in nurturing and promoting British creative talent. Taking the helm of YouTube in the UK, my mission is to give a platform to British talent and businesses, both established and new. Despite my optimism and belief in YouTube, as a father of four daughters, it would be impossible for me not to understand the concerns people have around the misuse of our platform. We have a responsibility to counter those dangers to ensure YouTube is and remains safe and inclusive. We need to get the boundaries right because, crucially, open does not mean that “anything goes”.
JUL11	During a witch hunt, the first casualty is common sense	You know how racist people tend to say things like “I’m not racist, but...”, and how shadow cabinet members mumble “I’m not anti-Semitic, but...” before going on to make outrageous statements that suggest quite the opposite? Well, I’m neither of those things. Nor am I transphobic. I do not care what consensual shenanigans people get up to in private, how they dress in public or where they worship. Seriously, knock yourself out. As long as your rights aren’t impinging on mine, there’s no problem. And if I need to budge up my ancient rights a little to make space for your modern ones, I’ll do that, too. It’s the British way. Live and let live. Mustn’t grumble. Keep calm and carry on.
JUL11	We can't succeed at Brexit without reining in our chaotic Foreign Office	The lead up to the Brexit denouement in October and the current hothouse atmosphere in Parliament, allied with the Conservative Party leadership battle and a 24-hour social media and newsgathering cycle, inevitably means relatively unimportant events are portrayed as seismic or epoch making crises. Such is the imbroglio over the resignation of our ambassador to the United States Sir Kim Darroch yesterday. Outside Westminster and Whitehall, no one really cares. The rumble over the Ferrero Rocher, the hysterical description of the events as a “national humiliation” and the identity of the eventual resident of the ambassador’s palatial home on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington DC will barely register with the electorate and certainly will have no impact on the Tory membership picking our new Prime Minister.
JUL11	This time it's different – why anti-Semitism could finally sink Labour	What is left to be said about Labour and anti-Semitism? The moment when a reconciliation could be effected by the party’s present leadership passed long ago. The majority of British Jewish community organisations and the leadership of Labour’s own affiliate, the Jewish Labour Movement, believe that Jeremy Corbyn is at best a facilitator of anti-Semitism and at worst an anti-Semite himself. According to the pollster Survation, which accurately predicted the result of the 2017 election, 86 per cent of British Jews believe that the Labour leader is anti-Semitic. There is division over exactly when the point of no return was reached. For some it was Corbyn’s defence of an anti- Semitic mural, for others it was his comment that two British Zionists  had “no sense of irony”,  for a few it was the repeated indulgence of Chris Williamson. But they are united on the important fact, which is that the moment of redemption has been and gone. As far as the struggle for power in the United Kingdom as a whole is concerned, the lesson of both the recent and the distant past, is that the row doesn’t really matter. The history of race relations is that majorities tend not to consider the fears of minorities when they cast their votes. Outside of the handful of constituencies where Britain’s Jews gather in significant numbers, there is no evidence that Labour’s anti-Semitism problem cost the party electorally in the 2017 election.
JUL11	In the face of anti-Semitism charges, Labour's flailing paranoia only proves their critics right	The Party's reaction taps into longstanding far-Left traditions of conspiracy theory and suspicion Let's start by calling anti-Semitism by its proper name - racism. The title of last night’s Panorama documentary should, therefore, have been “Is Labour racist?” Had the BBC presented its investigation as such, no doubt we would have witnessed an even fiercer pushback from the party establishment than we did. Being accused of anti-Semitism is bad enough (though tolerable), but racism is the Left’s ultimate, unforgivable sin. Even without deploying the “r” word, however, the programme’s findings were deeply worrying and distressing, not least for the former Labour Party staffers who agreed to be interviewed on the record about why they thought the party had let the Jewish community down in the last four years. Labour's response to the testimonies of these courageous individuals has been telling.
JUL11	Iran's game of dare on the high seas risks full-blown war with the West	Gibraltar’s seizure of an Iranian oil tanker bound for Syria has sent tensions between London and Tehran soaring. Harrying BP tankers in the Gulf is only a part of Iran's riposte. The Iranians see Britain as America’s closest ally but also as its link to the EU. The current imbroglios from Brexit to the Darroch Affair encourage the Islamic Republic to see the UK as a soft target. Donald Trump’s Twitter-spat with Theresa May looks to Iran like a trans-Atlantic split. Debates in the West about the wisdom of US sanctions and withdrawal from the nuclear deal have also encouraged Iran the probe for splits in the West. Already Spain’s foreign minister – and the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs in-waiting – Jose Borrell has queried the legality of Gibraltar’s detention of the Iranian tanker. The usually-hawkish ex-Swedish premier, Carl Bildt, from the Euro-right has joined in the chorus charging Britain with kow-towing to US sanctions on Iran which Brussels does not recognise. This provokes a nagging doubt about Western solidarity. But remember the dispute between Washington and the Europeans has been about how best to contain Iran, through sanctions or the nuclear deal.
JUL11	Harry and Meghan deserve sympathy, not our scathing judgment	We’ve had enough of spoilt royals, haven’t we? She’s got a cheek, that woman, to shout at the paparazzis who’ve made her a star: “Why don’t you grow up? You’ve been taking the same picture for three days.”? No, I’m not talking about Meghan. Didn’t I tell you we’d whizzed in an ancient DeLorean back to 1982 when “fiery Princess Anne” snarled at photographers for dogging her heels at the Badminton horse trials, telling them in no uncertain terms to “Naff orf!” Thirty-seven years later that very Princess is widely acclaimed as the hardest-working Windsor in the entire family, working tirelessly for good causes. The difference between 68-year-old Anne and her 32-year-old self isn’t just about added years and wisdom. In 1982 she was a competitive sportswoman and mother to a five-year-old and a one-year-old. If her temper was frayed and her tolerance low I’d suggest it might have had something to do with sleepless nights and the demands of parenthood, which tends to be accompanied by an innate demand for private family space. Anne famously didn’t want her children to be in the public eye and even turned down titles for them.
JUL11	Darroch has squandered the moral high ground with his undiplomatic resignation	Sir Kim Darroch has lost the moral high ground by turning his resignation into a cheap attack on Boris. His resignation yesterday was hardly a surprise. Rightly or wrongly, Trump had made the decision that he was no longer going to work with him, and Darroch's position was clearly untenable as a result. So who did "friends of Darroch" try to lay the blame on? The leaker? Donald Trump? No - of course it was all the fault of Boris Johnson. Within minutes of Darroch announcing his resignation, anonymous briefings went out to various journalists that Darroch had only made his decision to resign after watching Boris fail to give him his unequivocal support in the ITV debate the night before. That claim itself is plainly preposterous - we are being asked to believe that the ambassador would have quite happily served out his final six months in Washington while being frozen out of all official engagements with the Trump administration without once questioning his position, until he suddenly changed his mind while watching the Tory leadership debate. Wishful thinking doesn't even begin to cover it.
JUL12	Nothing to say here as Andrew Neil's bludgeon fails to hurt Tory rivals	The BBC rightly took a battering over its first Tory leadership debate last month, when it both displayed raw political bias and adopted a chaotic format.   Nor will the Corporation’s reputation have been full redeemed by Andrew Neil’s dual interviews with the final two candidates. The presenter, revelling in his reputation as an interrogatory rottweiler, had obviously decided that crude hectoring and point-scoring was the path to viewer enlightenment. But it was an approach that led to a boring, predictable programme that provided few real insights into our next Prime Minister.
JUL12	To prove Putin wrong, liberalism needs to rediscover its conservative roots	As she departs, Theresa May criticises those who want to become prime minister (no names named, of course) because “they think being prime minister is a position of power”. “Actually,” she says, “it is a position of service.” It is indeed a position of service, but how can you provide the service if you lack the power? By setting the one against the other, Mrs May is, I am afraid, exhibiting one of the tendencies which have made her premiership unsuccessful. She is displaying her virtue while misunderstanding her job. Compare and contrast with another interview, given by Vladimir Putin recently to the Financial Times. Like, one hopes, most British people, I judge Mrs May to be a decent person, and Mr Putin to be a bad one. He is cruel, cynical and despotic. He ordered the Salisbury poisonings. But I regret to say that whereas her interview was amateur, his was a masterclass. There are many reasons why the Putin interview is worth reading – to pick up his hints about how Russia and China together are gaining control of the world, for example – but I concentrate on one. This is his analysis of what he calls “the liberal idea”.
JUL12	The snobby French can keep their Michelin stars – nothing beats a good British cheddar	Camembert, Reblochon, Brie de Meaux, Pont l’Eveque, wheels of Tomme as wide as penny-farthings… On Sunday mornings last year, at the Marche Bastille in Paris, I would wander from fromagerie to fromagerie, each more flooringly fragrant than the last, and think to myself: “I could murder a good Wensleydale.”  The Michelin Messieurs would not approve. The men from the Michelin Guide, guardians of gastronomic standards, have taken a star from the French chef Marc Veyrat for the culinary crime of apparently serving cheddar – mais, non! – at his restaurant La Maison du Bois in the French-Swiss Alps. Our reputation – like the stench of a ripe Raclette – precedes us. To continental palettes, British cheeses are processed, plasticky and probably oozing out of a tuna melt.  Veyrat is outraged. “They dared say that we put cheddar in our soufflé of Reblochon, Beaufort and Tomme,” he cried. “They have insulted my region, my staff are furious!” To which the British reader can only respond with almost Pavlovian instinct: “Cathedral City, how lovely. Now where did I put the grater?”
JUL12	He calls himself a patriot, but the views of Tommy Robinson couldn't be more un-British	In a tolerant nation, the far-Right only survives by drawing help and inspiration from elsewhere Whatever else you might say about Tommy Robinson, jailed yesterday for contempt of court after he breached reporting restrictions on the trial of a grooming gang, he is no xenophobe when it comes to associating with like-minded extremists. In a sense, he is quite an internationalist. If you want to read his ramblings, it is a Canadian-based website, Rebel Media, that you need to visit. The site sponsors him as what it calls a Shillman fellow, after the businessman who funds it. Robinson is reported to have received help with his legal fees from a Philadelphia-based organisation, the Middle East Forum, as well as from the Australian Liberty Alliance. He has also looked to Germany for help, setting up a UK branch of the anti-Islamic organisation Pegida in 2015 – an enterprise which fizzled into nothing.
JUL12	Barcelona may be balmy, but neither London nor I are built for such heat	A charming young man from Thames Water – no older than 15, I’d wager, with spots and a fluffy chin – dropped round the other day. He fitted a water-saving device inside my tap, gave me a plastic hourglass timer to stick inside my shower door, and lectured me on the wickedness of leaving the tap running while brushing my teeth. “Do you know how much rainfall we get in London?” he asked, dramatically. “As much per head as Marrakesh.” That is dramatic, isn’t it? London, of all places, running out of rain. And this is just the beginning. In 30 years' time, according to a new study, London will be as hot as Barcelona is today. Leeds will feel more like Melbourne, and Manchester will be as warm as Montevideo. All cities in the northern hemisphere will, in climate terms, move 600 miles south. The study, conducted by the Crowther Lab at ETH Zurich university, anticipates that by 2050 global temperatures will have risen by 2C from pre-industrial levels. Under these conditions, three quarters of the world’s 500 largest cities will experience dramatic changes in climate. The worst hit, among them Singapore and Jakarta, will develop weather patterns so extreme that they don’t currently exist anywhere on Earth.
JUL12	Boris will be expected to keep pressing the right buttons in support of the Union	It’s taken a while but slowly and surely the signs are that much of the Scottish Conservative hierarchy is shaking off its horror at the prospect of a Boris Johnson premiership. They’re still not exactly enamoured of the idea, but there’s no doubt that they’re, perhaps reluctantly, accepting that there’s no future in refusing to accept that Boris is still the man most likely to become UK Conservative leader, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, by the end of this month. Retreating into some form of massive sulk will do nobody any good and so the aim now is to find a way of coping with a new Prime Minister, a Cabinet stuffed with his placemen, as well as a new Downing Street regimen, where nobody appears to see - in spite of protestations to the contrary – the maintenance of the United Kingdom as the government’s top priority.
JUL12	British diplomats did not bother to find the method in Donald Trump's madness	Dysfunctional, clumsy, inept, insecure: it’s easy to apply all of these words to the Trump administration. Newspapers do so on a regular basis. Social media is full of it. But the diplomat’s job is different: to take a step back and try to solve the puzzles, or find method in the madness. For example: why, if Donald Trump is so awful, did he ever make it to the White House? If his presidency is an abomination, why does he stand such a good chance of re-election? How should British diplomats respond to the trends that Trump embodies which are changing politics (and diplomacy) around the world? Donald Trump’s treatment of Sir Kim Darroch has been abominable. For an American president to attack a British ambassador in such vituperative terms raises serious questions about how strong an ally we can ever expect Trump to be. But there are questions, too, about the quality of advice Sir Kim was giving in his memos back to London. To say that Trump “radiates insecurity” and is “mired in scandal” is neither new nor controversial. Nor is it useful or insightful. It suggests that, for some time, our officials may have been looking at Trump in the wrong way. The British embassy in Washington has long been famous for Gatsby-style diplomacy, holding lavish parties and drawing various people into its circle. Until Trump came along, this was all quite effective. British diplomats predicted the elections of Bill Clinton and George W Bush and were well connected with both campaigns. But they were blindsided by Trump. They kept throwing parties: Sir Kim’s anonymous "friends" say he attended an astonishing 700 various events last year. But these methods just don’t work as well with a Trump White House operating by very different rules.
JUL12	How to limit hateful content without curbing creativity? We at YouTube must strike the right balance	When Stormzy took to the stage at Glastonbury, I was blown away. Like so many of us, I was struck by his energy, his lyrics, his look. It was powerful and so... British. It made me think. In the creativity stakes, Brits have long punched above our weight. For a small island, we boast leading actors, musicians, writers, filmmakers and artists. I’m proud that, over the last decade, YouTube has played its part helping young artists go from unsigned hopefuls to global sensations. The same is true for creators of all sorts, from Geordie science teachers and Welsh market-gardeners to mental health vloggers and videos devoted to cooking, crafting or cycling. That’s why I’m passionate about the powerful role of open platforms in nurturing and promoting British creative talent. Taking the helm of YouTube in the UK, my mission is to give a platform to British talent and businesses, both established and new. Despite my optimism and belief in YouTube, as a father of four daughters, it would be impossible for me not to understand the concerns people have around the misuse of our platform. We have a responsibility to counter those dangers to ensure YouTube is and remains safe and inclusive. We need to get the boundaries right because, crucially, open does not mean that “anything goes”.
JUL12	During a witch hunt, the first casualty is common sense	You know how racist people tend to say things like “I’m not racist, but...”, and how shadow cabinet members mumble “I’m not anti-Semitic, but...” before going on to make outrageous statements that suggest quite the opposite? Well, I’m neither of those things. Nor am I transphobic. I do not care what consensual shenanigans people get up to in private, how they dress in public or where they worship. Seriously, knock yourself out. As long as your rights aren’t impinging on mine, there’s no problem. And if I need to budge up my ancient rights a little to make space for your modern ones, I’ll do that, too. It’s the British way. Live and let live. Mustn’t grumble. Keep calm and carry on.
JUL12	We can't succeed at Brexit without reining in our chaotic Foreign Office	The lead up to the Brexit denouement in October and the current hothouse atmosphere in Parliament, allied with the Conservative Party leadership battle and a 24-hour social media and newsgathering cycle, inevitably means relatively unimportant events are portrayed as seismic or epoch making crises. Such is the imbroglio over the resignation of our ambassador to the United States Sir Kim Darroch yesterday. Outside Westminster and Whitehall, no one really cares. The rumble over the Ferrero Rocher, the hysterical description of the events as a “national humiliation” and the identity of the eventual resident of the ambassador’s palatial home on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington DC will barely register with the electorate and certainly will have no impact on the Tory membership picking our new Prime Minister.
JUL13	Theresa May's successor must make tackling dementia an economic priority	With a cure for dementia distant, mere  ‘lip service’ is being paid to proper care in Britain.  We need innovation, boldness and creativity alongside new training and accreditation schemes. We need to make specialised care a more attractive career path with suitable compensation levels.   A supportive new government should make the legislative timetable recognise the cost of aging and the pernicious financial and societal effect from growing numbers of dementia sufferers. This is a burden our country can no longer ignore.  Improved care for dementia sufferers is not an option. It is our duty.  As our country handles an ever-aging population and the ‘baby boomer’ bubble exacerbates the problems, it is only right to venerate our aging for what they have given us.
JUL13	It's the declinist Remainers, not the optimistic Brexiteers, who are the irrational ones	I sometimes ask myself whether I should be feeling more despondent about our present political agitation. The leaking of Sir Kim Darroch’s confidential reports seems only the latest sign of an unravelling of our system of government: “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold …” Britain has undoubtedly become a subject of concern, incomprehension and embarrassment to our friends, and of mockery and glee to the others. Yet I do not feel as depressed as many clearly do. So much of our present divide is the hysteria of a culture that seems to have lost the ability to reflect calmly, and which collectively stamps its foot in infantile tantrums. This itself is, admittedly, a cause of concern. That senior figures, even former prime ministers, should be willing to pull the political house down over such a relatively secondary question as leaving a dodgy trading bloc is bizarre, and tells us that something is wrong in our politics.
JUL13	Norman Tebbit’s cricket test was never xenophobic, but it could do with a liberal amendment	The sporting summer reaches a kind of crescendo today with half the country flicking three ways between the British Grand Prix, the Wimbledon men’s final and the cricket world cup final at Lord’s. It won’t exactly match the Olympic summer of 2012 and the way Team GB unexpectedly brought the country together in a happy embrace. For a start, neither Formula One nor tennis tend to evoke strong national sentiments in the way team sports do. Moreover, the cricket world cup did not see the whole country getting behind the English team, as many British Indians and Pakistanis backed their ancestral teams against England. And what was so remarkable was that this spectacular failing of the “Tebbit test”...
JUL13	It is the right time for an unashamedly political British ambassador to Washington	Britain’s diplomatic service is admired all over the world – and at the very top of the tree sits the ambassador to Washington, the most senior post of all. It’s hardly surprising, then, that Sir Kim Darroch, who has resigned from that position, is a talented diplomat with an extremely distinguished career behind him. I worked with him when he was the National Security Adviser in London and I was Australia’s High Commissioner; I can tell you that the plaudits we’ve heard are all deserved.  Sir Kim did the right and honourable thing in resigning, recognising that his position had become untenable. I doubt the notion that the Tory leadership debate was a major factor. You simply cannot continue as an ambassador to Washington if the President of the United States has stated publicly that he won’t deal with you. It is sad to see a diplomat’s career turned into a political football. But the criticism of Boris Johnson for supposedly not standing up for Sir Kim is unfair. The special relationship has survived worse than this episode, but circumstances changed when the leaks emerged, and no one person is bigger than the interests of the country.
JUL13	A parent's guide to teenage parties	My younger stepson recently turned twenty-one.  There was much to be joyful about: he has grown into a kind and decent adult. And once we’d cleared up the house, we were also able to celebrate that the days are gone when his father and I have to host student parties. The party scene is a much bigger part of teen life than it used to be.  This not a puritanical comment: quite the opposite. I went to a Northern Comprehensive in the late eighties and early nineties, where there was a culture of underage drinking and going to clubs. Some nights, a particular bar would look like an extension of the Common Room of my Sixth Form College.  Students got up to all sorts of things, but we didn’t expect our parents to host these events and provide the refreshment.  Teen parties are terrifying, and if you don’t think so then you’ve never hosted one, or else you have no imagination.  I recall vividly my elder stepson’s eighteenth, which we held in a hired hall.  Never mind that these young people were of a legal age to drink; they were still at school and we were very much the responsible adults. We were two hours into the party and there was still well over an hour to go, and we had run out of white wine, largely because a number of teenage girls were knocking back and insisting on more.  My other half did an emergency Sainsbury’s run at 9.37 pm. I’d have been happy for him to stay put and direct them to the soft drinks. 
JUL13	Iran knows it can't win a naval war in the Gulf, but it can provoke an accident	The formidable firepower at the disposal of a Royal Navy warship can often seem inadequate when dealing with the more rudimentary tactics employed by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard in the contested waters of the Persian Gulf. On paper, a Type 23 frigate such as HMS Montrose, the Navy warship currently escorting British-registered tankers through the Strait of Hormuz, has the ability to detect and destroy enemy ships and planes from a range of many miles. Yet when it comes to dealing with swarms of fast patrol boats operating within just a few hundred yards, and equipped with little more than machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, protecting one of the world’s most important shipping lanes becomes immeasurably harder.
JUL13	No, Boris and Brexit have nothing in common with that ignoramus Donald Trump	Let’s be clear, I do understand why Boris Johnson’s team is going along with the joke: the notion that their man is a spiritual twin of Donald Trump, that they are comrades at the front of the militant uprising of disenfranchised populations, two heroically like-minded leaders who will proudly say the unsayable and behave in outrageous ways that will give cheer to the angry, anti-establishment populace. Much supercilious amusement is being generated on both sides of the Atlantic at their physical similarities (blond bouffant hair, bear-like body, etc) with liberal media outlets in the United States taking a direct feed from sources over here who are determined to equate Brexit with bigoted, know-nothing Trumpism. As I say, the Johnson team is, with little ambivalence, letting this pass as credible even though it is utterly preposterous.
JUL13	Zara’s £40 polka-dot maxi is proof that dressing for yourself never goes out of fashion	Not since Elizabeth Hurley wore a gown stuck together with safety pins has a dress made such an impact on the social and cultural landscape. The Zara spotted frock – a simple white maxi dress with black polka dots that retails for just £39.99 – has officially gone viral, officially going viral being a modern-day marker of success, rather than a terrible indication that something is dreadfully wrong with you. So popular is the dress that I saw three women in it before I’d even sat down to write this column. It now has its own Instagram page, Hot 4 The Spot, which aims to document the many people who have been, um, spotted in it. The page has more than 5,000 followers, and features hundreds of women in the frock – often at the same time, in the same place and, in some creepy cases, completely unaware they are being photographed as they walk down the street. One suspects that the furore over the frock will have passed most men by, accustomed as they are to leaving the house in the same outfit as every other man – jeans and a T-shirt or a suit – without anyone feeling the need to take pictures and post them on the internet.
JUL13	Brexit won't make us Trump's poodle – it will inspire a new world order instead	The Foreign Office is one of Britain’s “finest” institutions, according to received wisdom. But the Sir Kim Darroch affair has shown it up for what it truly is: squeaking elite bewilderment enrobed in paper-shuffling pomp. One of the most interesting things about this week’s kerfuffle (or is that covfefe?) involving the British ambassador to the United States was the insight it delivered into the drab, snide conventionalism that dominates British foreign policy. Sir Kim’s “insights” into the US administration – which he says has been “uniquely dysfunctional” and “inept” under Trump – read like excerpts from one of the wearily withering columns that America’s liberal-Left newspapers sigh out on a daily basis. “We don’t really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy,” one of Sir Kim’s cables drones to the resigned, solipsistic rhythm of anti-Trumpism that is so de rigueur​ on the East Coast.
JUL13	Sorry Boris, but Britain won’t reunite after Brexit. If you want to know why, ask a cat	Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have both promised to “unite the country” after Brexit. This will of course be impossible, for a simple reason. The referendum didn’t just divide us politically. It divided us by personality type. You can no more unite Remainers and Leavers than you can unite cats and dogs. I say cats and dogs, because that, more or less, is what Remainers and Leavers are. Take dogs. Dogs love family and home, and feel a strong sense of loyalty and duty: their instinct is to protect and to serve. As a rule they’re happier in the countryside than in crowded, bustling cities. They’re sociable, but wary of outsiders. Essentially, their values are conservative. Dogs are Leavers. Leavers are dogs. Cats, by contrast, are solitary, aloof, and fancy themselves as elegant and urbane. By their own estimation, they are far more intelligent than dogs, whom they regard as dimwitted and easily led. They love cities, and insist on freedom of movement. Essentially, their values are metropolitan liberal. Cats are Remainers. Remainers are cats.
JUL14	We can improve mental health, save money and boost the economy all in one go	It is one of the most fascinating and consoling features of the life of Sir Winston Churchill that, for all his giant strengths of courage and resilience, he was also prone to bouts of depression. He called it his “Black Dog”. And there was only one means by which he really succeeded in chasing that Black Dog away. It certainly wasn’t alcohol. It was the same therapy that lifts the spirits of hundreds of millions if not billions of people around the world – and that cure is work. In Churchill’s case that meant the almost superhuman production of books, speeches and articles. He wrote more words than Dickens and Shakespeare combined – and that is before we have even considered his epic memoranda, or the industriousness of his oil painting. It was with work that he pitchforked off his depression; and what was true for Churchill is basically true for all of us: that to a very large extent we derive our self-esteem from what we do. It is often from our jobs – from being engrossed in our daily tasks – that we get that all-important sense of satisfaction.
JUL14	Why does Sir Kim Darroch, along with the rest of the establishment, love the Iran deal?	The second batch of leaked emails from Sir Kim Darroch, who resigned last week as our ambassador in Washington, has attracted less attention than the first. I’m not sure, however, that it might not be more revealing. Batch 1 contained plenty of insults about Donald Trump. President Trump duly insulted back, with fatal effect for poor Sir Kim. Batch 2 is still very rude about Mr Trump, but in relation to a specific policy. In May last year, Mr Trump prepared to fulfil his election pledge and pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran. Sir Kim privately accused him of being “set upon an act of diplomatic vandalism”, motivated by spite (“personality reasons”) against his predecessor, Barack Obama, for having done the deal. Sir Kim had been working flat-out to save the JCPOA, which also involves US allies – Britain, France and Germany – and China and Russia. He set up a series of meetings which ran over 26 hours in Washington so that the then foreign secretary, one Boris Johnson, might dissuade the US administration. Sir Kim’s contacts got Boris in to see everyone that mattered, except for President Trump himself. His diplomatic offensive failed. America removed itself from the deal.
JUL14	With any luck, the Labour nightmare will soon be over, for Jews and for the country	You just had to laugh (and cry). Here we have a Labour party, run by people who are on one hand avowed anti-racists, dedicated to rooting out every whiff of off-colour language where black and Muslim communities are concerned, but who on the other, in their frothing hatred of Israel, frequently make anti-Semitic comments, air anti-Semitic beliefs, and foster online communities littered with anti-Jewish tropes and sentiments. Their response to Wednesday’s hard-hitting Panorama investigation, in which former party members made allegations over the handling of racism complaints? Not "woe is us", but "blame the BBC!" Labour’s reaction to the claims is depressingly predictable - and the root of the problem.
JUL14	The state is abolishing privacy in its reckless embrace of new technology	The popular resistance to smart meters gives me hope. This fiasco of a project – millions over budget, meters malfunctioning, appallingly managed – was always more than a nifty new way for consumers to manage their energy bills. It is about rationing. The time will come when energy firms will adjust their prices minute-by-minute, rapidly increasing them at moments of high demand so as to force people to turn off their appliances, switch off their lights, and retreat into darkness or face an almighty bill. The information collected by such devices, ostensibly to make our lives better, can thus be used as a weapon against us. I fear that something similar will emerge from the NHS’s new collaboration with Amazon. The latter’s “smart” Alexa devices, internet-connected boxes with voices, will answer medical questions by reference to the NHS website.
JUL14	Sorry, Sir John Major, but Brexit is nothing like the English Civil War	Sir John Major spoke on the Today programme last week about the evils of proroguing parliament. It would be, he said, the first time since Charles I that such an abomination was perpetrated, with civil war the outcome. Those who make eager use of historical analogies are rarely exact in their grasp of the past. The last time parliament was prorogued to get a government measure through was in 1948, during the premiership of the sainted Clement Attlee – a less spine-chilling example, if Sir John had been aware of it. At various moments in our history, parliament has been treated rather – shall we say, cavalierly? – by governments when it tried to obstruct change. The Great Reform Act was only passed when William IV overcame procedural obstruction in the Commons by going in person to dissolve parliament and then he promised to create as many peers as necessary to overcome the Lords. The same threat was used in 1911 to change the constitution in the Parliament Act. Attlee’s prorogation was carried out for the same reason. What about Charles I? He was under attack from religious fundamentalists in parliament who were trying to foist their ideas on the country. It was they who were largely responsible for the worst civil conflict in our history. The same MPs, sadder and wiser, were brought back in 1660 to vote on the restoration of the monarchy, having become the most unpopular parliament in history: “Boys do now cry ‘Kiss my parliament’ instead of ‘Kiss my a---’,” noted Samuel Pepys.
JUL14	Boris Johnson needs the revolutionary, fighting Cabinet that Mrs Thatcher never had	After her 1983 landslide victory, Margaret Thatcher reshuffled her Cabinet (dropping the disloyal, lugubrious Francis Pym). Asked on television by Sir Robin Day whether she was a “good butcher”, she replied, “No, but I have had to learn to carve the joint”. Boris Johnson needs to be a more decisive butcher than she was, or he is the one for the abattoir. Most of the Thatcher reshuffles caused much trouble, with little gain. Only her dropping of the “wets” in September 1981 can be judged a strategic success, and it was a perilous move – they tried to oust her but failed.
JUL14	Anxious parents, not their cosseted children, spoil the British summer	The summer holidays are upon us and soon my hometown of Brighton & Hove will be over-run with families in search of a spot of wholesome fun; unlike London, where tempers flare as the mercury rises, hot weather brings out the best in us. At the shore – perhaps because the limitless beauty of the horizon facilitates less guarding of precious territory than land-locked rat-run cities – the usual rules of uptight non-engagement don’t apply. On the beach – even our stony one, which carries the threat of mild peril – children are allowed to run about, screeching as they teeter into the sea, gorge on sugary treats and even talk to strangers. Once in a while you see the odd wretched Vitamin D-deprived middle-class child covered from head to toe in something like a cross between a wetsuit and a Burkini, but on the whole even parents who lean towards neurotic ninny-hood relax their rules somewhat at the seaside. Head inland and it’s a different story. Parents terrified to let their children out of their sight (but not willing to stay at home with them because of the head-banging boredom of being incarcerated with non-adults) take them to environments which were designed for adults to enjoy pleasurable social intercourse – restaurants and pubs – and let them race around with a noisy fervour which can be charming in open spaces but extremely annoying in enclosed ones. It’s not the children’s fault – but when they’ve run by you screaming blue murder for the fourth time in an hour, it’s hard to restrain oneself from sticking out a sly foot and sending them sprawling, just to break the mega-watt monotony.

JUL14	Norman Tebbit’s cricket test was never xenophobic, but it could do with a liberal amendment	The sporting summer reaches a kind of crescendo today with half the country flicking three ways between the British Grand Prix, the Wimbledon men’s final and the cricket world cup final at Lord’s. It won’t exactly match the Olympic summer of 2012 and the way Team GB unexpectedly brought the country together in a happy embrace. For a start, neither Formula One nor tennis tend to evoke strong national sentiments in the way team sports do. Moreover, the cricket world cup did not see the whole country getting behind the English team, as many British Indians and Pakistanis backed their ancestral teams against England. And what was so remarkable was that this spectacular failing of the “Tebbit test” seemed barely worthy of comment.
JUL15	Boris has had to dodge and weave to get through these debates: it is a skill he will need all the more as PM	It was nice that the final debate between the two men vying to become prime minister ended in agreement, albeit the impossible agreement that Amber Rudd should win this season of Love Island.  Impossibility has been something of a watchword throughout this campaign, in that people have been studiously looking out for talk of it as some herald of the demise of any given leadership bid. Brexit, after all, means Brexit, and must be delivered no matter what. Talking down what is possible, then, is negativity, and not becoming of a PM. To lead Brexit Britain, you must want to believe, if not already be a true believer. That has, sadly, often resulted in more flights of fancy than grounded policy.
JUL15	Yes, we could have a bright no-deal future, but not with this Parliament	Leaving on October 31 with no agreement would leave the Tories without a majority to enact vital laws Let us imagine that it is the morning of Friday November 1, and that we have left the European Union without a deal. Whatever we think about such a scenario, it is something that could easily happen. Boris Johnson has said that if he becomes prime minister next week, October 31 will become the absolute deadline to leave the EU. The EU says it is not backing down on the deal Theresa May negotiated. And although quite a few Conservative MPs say they will block a no-deal Brexit, they don’t know how they are going to do that. So it is not a fantasy to think we might be waking up that morning to find we are suddenly free of all the EU’s rules but also deprived of all its benefits – blinking in the sunlight of freedom or crying in the darkness of isolation, depending on your point of view. Over the next three months, acres of newsprint and long hours of parliamentary debate will be devoted to whether that moment should happen. Yet, strangely, there is little discussion of what exactly ought to happen after that.
JUL15	Brexit isn't some imperial fantasy – it just means we want to be ourselves	What is Britain for these days? I hear it said that Brexit Britain has lost its mission in foreign policy, that we’ve cut ourselves off from the continent, that Donald Trump is abusing us, and so we splash about in the Atlantic like a drowning bulldog. We have no clear purpose because we don’t know if we’re European or American, conservative or liberal, imperial or in retreat. And we’re nothing without a purpose, right? Actually, if one listens to Vernon Bogdanor’s smashing history lectures on foreign policy – available on YouTube – one senses that Britain has always been as uncertain about its role as Selwyn Lloyd was when Churchill surprised him with a foreign ministry he didn’t want. “There must be some mistake,” said Lloyd, “I do not speak any foreign language. Except in war, I have never visited any foreign country. I do not like foreigners.” Churchill growled: “Young man, these all seem to me to be positive advantages.” Two key points emerge from Professor Bogdanor’s lectures. One is that we’ve long had a difficult relationship with the continent, caused in no small part by geography. We are a European country, undoubtedly, but the English Channel cuts us off physically and emotionally from the continent and, like any island nation, we must trade overseas to survive. Thus the argument was made prior to the First World War that if Germany conquered much of Europe it had nothing to do with us because we were all about Asia and Africa.
JUL15	Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s black, female 007 shows the new Bond will display the worst kind of virtue-signalling	It’s (semi) official: 007 is a woman. A black woman. According to a Sunday report, ending the years of conjecture prompted by Daniel Craig’s announcement that he was standing down as James Bond, British star Lashana Lynch will be handed Bond’s licence to kill in the 25th movie, to go on general release in April next year.  In what has pre-emptively been called “a popcorn-dropping moment”, the film is said to begin with spymaster M saying: “‘Come in 007’, and in walks Lashana who is black, beautiful and a woman.” And although Ian Fleming purists can breathe easy – it turns out she’s not the new Bond, but an operative who takes over the spy’s secret agent number after he leaves MI6 – we’re assured the script has been washed clean of mucky misogynistic dialogue, with the phrase “Bond girls” banned, and poor “new man” Bond now a stooped, obsequious-faced, handbagged figure who has swapped the tux for a “This Is What a Feminist Looks Like” T-shirt – and the microchipped cufflinks for a set of LGBT rainbow bracelets.
JUL15	Forget the sixes and thrilling Super Overs - anticipation is the real joy of cricket	 Celebrating yesterday's match purely for its chaotic finale misses the point I'm not going to say it wasn't exciting. Like the rest of the country, I was screaming at the TV, googling Super Overs, hanging on every twitch of Jofra Archer's magical shoulder. Makers of fitness-tracking watches will be studying the data, wondering why millions of Brits simultaneously decided to engage in moderate exercise last night. Not since the case of Inky, the octopus who eluded his keepers in Napier, had I found myself so involved in a story about plucky Kiwis.
JUL15	Sacred Mysteries: The duty to be joyful, despite everything	It sounds odd to say that joyfulness is commanded by Christianity, yet it seems to be true. “It is a duty for each one of us to be joyful,” says Sister Mary David at the beginning of a striking new book called The Joy of God. She was quoting a monk called Dom Paul Delatte, whose exile with the community from Solesmes in 1901 (in one of those sporadic outbursts of violence that the French state takes against peaceable religious associations) led to the foundation of Quarr Abbey on the Isle of Wight. Sister Mary David belonged to the contemplative community of Benedictine nuns inspired by Solesmes who set up St Cecilia’s Abbey on the island. But who was Sister Mary David? Before her death in 2017, aged 60, she impressed those who met her as clever, personable and warm. Born in Philadelphia of parents from Ramallah in Palestine (whose surname was Totah), she was, as a graduate student, among the first intake of women at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1985 she entered the monastic enclosure at St Cecilia’s and remained there for the rest of her life.
JUL15	From 1966 to 2019, why do British sporting triumphs always come by the narrowest of margins?	Yesterday's nailbiting victory at Lord's was just one in a series of rollercoaster wins Got any fingernails left? Me neither. Nor any of the 7.5 million people who watched England’s ludicrously tense, scarcely believable victory over New Zealand in the cricket World Cup Final yesterday. It was sport at its finest: two world-class teams at their absolute limits playing out a breathless finale. England are the only nation to have won the football, rugby and cricket World Cups. Lord’s 2019 is in the pantheon alongside Wembley 1966 and Sydney 2003.
JUL15	Old, rich white men make the best neighbours? Of course we do	Of all the challenging edicts of Christianity, the instruction to “love our neighbours as ourselves”, is the trickiest. Be honest, nobody loves us as much we do ourselves – it’s just not possible. There are so many unwritten rules to be observed; lending a cup of sugar or signing for a parcel is fine - but we draw the line at dog-sitting a pitbull terrier or jump-starting next door’s car at three in the morning.  So the latest research from a think-tank, with the upbeat nom de plume of Bright Blue, falls into the category of blindingly obvious. From it we learn that old rich white men in Saffron Waldron trust their neighbours eight times more than the long-term unemployed do in Haringey - obviously. In the leafy suburbs of a mansion in the shires your neighbour could well be two miles away – you might just hear their tea-dansant in the distance, Dean Martin crooning from across the valley. But it’s not the same as heavy-metal pounding through the paper-thin wall of a terraced house in London’s East End. The report also reveals that old people make better neighbours – of course we do. Unlike our grandchildren, we haven’t got headphones on all the time and aren’t blinkered by our hoodies -  yet we’re still driven by insatiable curiosity. We acquire our information not from the internet but from across the garden fence. My favourite opening sentence from any neighbour is, “Have you heard.....?”
JUL15	The penny has finally dropped for the political elite that Remain has lost	Some of the most prominent Remainers appear to be starting to believe no deal might actually happen. Amber Rudd now accepts that no deal is “part of the armoury going forward”. Gina Miller threatens to take the government to court if Parliament is prorogued to prevent no deal. But many Brexiteers remain doubtful that a Boris Johnson government can deliver. Nigel Farage says he’d “love to know what [Boris Johnson] really, really, really truly believes. Our attitude, as the Brexit Party, is why would we trust anybody?... Boris now tells us…that we’re leaving on October 31, and we are pretty sceptical about that.” Anti-no deal MPs plot and stir. We have efforts to block spending in the event of no deal. But is that credible? Why wouldn’t Boris simply take us out with no deal and then see how long Parliament continued to vote to block spending after the deed was already done — surely no more than days?
JUL15	If we can put a man on the moon, we can get to net zero	When Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon 50 years ago this week it was the culmination of a giant leap of imagination and engineering enterprise that remains breathtaking to this day. Today the challenge is different but requires equal focus and commitment.  When legislation was passed to target net zero by 2050, Britain made history. As the first major economy to enshrine in law our commitment to decarbonisation, we shouldn’t underestimate the task facing our society.  
JUL16	Electric scooters are the future of transport in our congested cities	Travelling to work the other day, I was nearly knocked down by a fellow commuter whizzing past on an electric scooter. Immaculately dressed, poised serenely on her two-wheeled chariot as she sped gracefully to work, she seemed the epitome of modern mobility, and I gazed at her rather enviously – even as I scuttled out of her way. But what should we do with her and her ilk? Exorcise them from the road – no more near-misses for pedestrians like me – or encourage them as they glide along our streets? It’s a question that is, or should be, exercising our transport mandarins, not least after the news this week of two serious crashes involving e-scooters, one involving a 14-year-old boy who is now critically ill in hospital, the other in which a woman died after being hit by a lorry at a roundabout.
JUL16	What we can all learn from The Squad's dignified response to Trump	The problem with political debate today - and the solution - can be seen in the aftermath of President Trump’s latest racially charged tweet barrage: he wrote on Twitter that four Congresswomen of colour should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came”.  We don’t need to argue about whether or not this was racist: the women are all American citizens and three out of four were born in the US, the other moved there as a child. "Going home" means New York, Cincinnati, Detroit and Minneapolis. President Trump has clearly never thought about going back to where he came from - if that means Germany, where his paternal family is from, or Scotland, where his mother was born. He continued on the offensive all day Monday, defending his comments and raging: “If they’re not happy here, they can leave”. He shushed female reporters who tried to ask questions. 
JUL16	Boris and Hunt agree that May's net migration target is toast. Here's why that's a good thing	The Tories have spent almost a decade failing to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands  If the definition of insanity is repeating the same action and expecting different results, the definition of political madness is continuing a failed policy and expecting voters to carry on believing you. Yet this is current immigration policy, where the Conservative Party has spent close to a decade and three manifestos pledging to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands but ended up further away than when it started. Last year, 253,000 more people migrated to Britain than left its shores by emigrating - equivalent to adding a city the size of Newcastle upon Tyne to the population in a single year.  In the nine years since 2010, net migration was 1.4 million higher than if the Government had delivered net migration in the tens of thousands every year. 
JUL16	Brexit Britain's first move should be a CANZUK alliance, not an asymmetric partnership with Trump's US	With similar-sized partners we should be able to achieve much more than we can working separately The EU has been the UK’s main geopolitical partnership for the past 47 years. When we finally get around to it, Brexit will bring that to an end. But what new geopolitical partnerships should we seek post-Brexit? Many believe a new partnership with the US is the obvious option. I don’t.
JUL16	In the dying embers of her premiership, Theresa May is still doing her best to harm Conservatism	The PM's poisonous and expensive legacy agenda is storing up problems for the future The misery is almost over. Britain’s worst post-war premiership is now drawing to its welcome close, as Theresa May enters her final days in Downing Street. After three years of posturing, pusillanimity and paralysis at the top, few will miss her.  Winston Churchill famously said of his wartime leadership that “history will be kind, for I shall write it”. History will not be kind to May. She had one task – to deliver Brexit – and she failed spectacularly. She leaves behind a country still governed by the EU, a broken Tory party without a majority and a Parliament gripped by stalemate.
JUL16	Boris Johnson is no Donald Trump - but he might just be the next Stephen Harper	In his politics and strategy, Boris resembles the former Canadian PM It appears that Boris Johnson’s leadership ambitions are about to be realised. He will probably defeat Jeremy Hunt in the members’ vote next week, and become the next Tory leader and prime minister. Many progressive commentators seem to think Mr Johnson represents the second coming of US President Donald Trump. At one point, there might have been some truth to this. The former Spectator editor, two-term Mayor of London and long-serving MP has always been a unique public figure. Like Mr Trump, he was seen as a fiercely independent politician, who marched to the beat of his own drum, and had almost no filter as a public speaker.  
JUL16	We hardcore Bond fans crave seductive escapism – not a morality tale of #MeToo and 'toxic masculinity'	Eon Productions should avoid torching too much of Fleming’s raw material In many James Bond films, the pre-credits sequence has very little bearing on the rest of the plot. Take Octopussy, where Bond deploys the smallest jet plane in the world (housed in a fake horse’s nether regions) to destroy a Cuban airfield, or Moonraker’s mid-air tussle over a parachute. Yet Casino Royale’s intro depicts a truly formative moment. Shot in grainy, Hitchcockian black-and-white, Bond gains his 00 status by confronting and killing two enemies - a turncoat MI6 section chief and his contact, in particularly gruesome fashion. After Pierce Brosnan’s final outing in the CGI’d monstrosity Die Another Day, Casino Royale’s intro indicated what kind of Bond Daniel Craig might be; cold, calculating and ruthless.  As a lifelong Bond fan, my heart sank when I heard the latest news from the set of the 25th instalment in the series. One insider told the Daily Mail about a “popcorn-dropping” moment, when it is revealed that Bond has retired and a female MI6 colleague, played by Lashana Lynch, has inherited this all-important codename. The source gushes over “a pivotal scene at the start of the film” where M says “‘Come in 007’, and “in walks Lashana who is black, beautiful and a woman.”
JUL16	Sacred Mysteries: Chopping down the wood under the roof	From the fire at Notre Dame in April we learnt something of the marvellous forest of great oak timbers hidden under the roof of a medieval cathedral. So it surprised me to learn from Cecil Hewett’s classic study English Cathedral and Monastic Carpentry that in 1985 he feared there was “very little time left” to save England’s historic timbers, since much of value had recently been lost – at Westminster Abbey, Norwich Cathedral and Worcester Cathedral. I am sorry to say that an heroic architect in other ways, Stephen Dykes Bower (1903-1994), was the villain at Westminster. The storm following the public discovery that he had replaced oak in the roofs of Westminster with steel and reinforced concrete was said by his biographer Anthony Symondson to have cost him a knighthood. Cecil Hewett made it clear from his hundreds of detailed drawings of medieval carpentry that we would be wrong to see this work from past centuries as crude, temporary (like scaffolding) or expected to deteriorate from the assaults of time, damp or pests.
JUL16	I swam the length of the English Channel to highlight threats to the ocean – now the UK leads in its protection	There is an old saying in English Channel swimming that most crossings are won or lost before the first stroke is taken. So last year, before I attempted to swim the length of the English Channel – from Land’s End to Dover – I made three promises to myself. The first was that I would leave all my doubts at the start in Cornwall. The second, that I would swim 10km every day. The third promise I made was that if it was too dangerous to swim on a specific day, the following day I would do a double session. These three promises steered me through the toughest swim of my life. I swam through storms, through injury, and through a number of large swarms of jellyfish. I was swept backwards around The Lizard, and I battled for three days to round Dungeness. Finally, after 49 days I touched the harbour wall at Dover.
JUL16	Police should be helping to uphold the freedom of the press – not shutting it down	Neil Basu was wrong to threaten journalists who publish leaked information. The Metropolitan Police’s Assistant Commissioner – who said on Friday that those who did so could face criminal charges – was wrong, not just because his comments risk deterring the media from publishing information that is in the public interest, but because the role of the police is to uphold the law. That includes those laws which protect free media. Seeing journalists only as troublemakers to be punished, rather than viewing media freedom as a right to be legally protected, is a threat to the public’s right to know. The freedom of the press is essential to safeguarding democracy. Just last week, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt stood shoulder to shoulder in London with some of the world’s bravest journalists who daily risk life and limb to report the news that those in power would rather suppress. Journalists like Maria Ressa, who faces relentless harassment from the government of the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duerte, or Ghanaian investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas, who wears a face covering to protect his identity. Their work, Hunt told an audience of diplomats and foreign ministers at his global conference for media freedom, was the lifeblood of free and thriving societies. Just a day later, one of Britain’s most senior police officers suggested that journalists who publish leaked information risk jail. Basu must realise that when the police seek to punish journalists for publishing embarrassing stories about the state, the results can be deeply alarming.
JUL17	Britain faces only two possible futures – Brexit with Boris or Corbyn as PM	It’s decision time, and the stakes are the highest they have been in 40 years. Theresa May’s grotesque interregnum will be remembered, if at all, for her failed attempt at pausing history, culminating in a debilitating political stasis. Her three miserable, wasted years in office will now be followed by a period of accelerated and possibly extreme activity, starting next Tuesday, as Britain’s pent-up appetite for radical change is finally satiated. The only question will be the scale and magnitude of our country’s frenzied transformation, and whether it is Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn who leads the revolution. The choice Britain faces is unusually binary, at once terrifying and exhilarating in its starkness. There are only two routes, and two camps; all other avenues keep returning to one of those two, as if the country were stuck in an infernal political maze. We can either opt for a radical reset via a meaningful Brexit, possibly without a deal – or hand power to Corbyn, a man committed to blowing up capitalism, society and the international order.
JUL17	It would be a huge mistake if the next PM does away with immigration targets	In 2010, as the Conservatives returned to government after 13 years in exile, George Osborne warned his colleagues. “Our promise to cut immigration is a big reason we’re here,” he said. “Support the Home Office in getting it done, or we won’t be sitting here much longer.” As time went on, ministers’ support for immigration control waned with Osborne’s. While the numbers came down at first, they soon went shooting back up. Yet when the Tories faced the electorate again, in 2015, they repeated their pledge: annual net migration would be cut to the tens of thousands. Today, net migration stands at 258,000 per year. And Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson want to drop the target. Boris refuses to promise to cut the numbers, and supports an amnesty for illegal immigrants. The target – and, perhaps, the Tory promise to reduce immigration – is no more.
JUL17	The farcical EU is a cushy retirement home for has-been politicians	Ursula von der Leyen has been confirmed as the next president of the European Commission. In a gripping one-horse race, she beat the odds to come out on top, winning the support of 383 MEPs, gaining a slim majority of nine. The process that led to von der Leyen’s appointment can only be described as a coronation. Although we took part in European elections just eight weeks ago, these had no bearing whatsoever on who would be handed the EU’s top job. In a normal, democratic election it is customary for a candidate or a party to put forward their programme before we vote. This allows us to pass judgement on all the terrible things they plan to do to us for the next few years. But von der Leyen was selected for the role six weeks after the elections. She then had just two weeks, and a single parliamentary speech, with which to sketch out a programme for government and convince MEPs that she should be in charge of an entire continent for the next five years. 
JUL17	Why I resigned my government position to oppose HS2	I simply could not vote in favour of this white elephant If Boris Johnson becomes prime minister next week – as I hope he does – one of his key tasks will be to encourage economic growth across all the regions. Some of our cities are major global successes but we need to do more to help other parts of Britain thrive. To do that, we need to spend taxpayers’ money wisely, which is why I cannot understand why any Government can support the High Speed Rail 2 (HS2) project. I certainly can’t and when an HS2 Bill came back to Parliament on Monday I refused to vote in favour of a white elephant. This meant I had to resign my position as a parliamentary private secretary and leave the Government. 
JUL17	Transgender 'motherlessness' is a chilly fiction to impose on children	What does it mean for a child to have no mother? For the journalist Fred McConnell, it would be a kind of ideal. A transgender man who documented his pregnancy and birth in a film called Seahorse (soon to be broadcast by the BBC), McConnell is arguing in court for the right to be registered on his child’s birth certificate as “father”. The child would be, as far as legal documentation goes, motherless. For McConnell, this is an issue of human rights: “All children should be able to have their legal parents correctly and accurately recorded on their birth certificates,” he said.  Well, yes, all children should have this. But it’s not at all clear whether McConnell’s action is for the benefit of the child, or the parent. The action is a tussle between two different versions of what a “correct and accurate” birth certificate should look like.
JUL17	Donald Trump's crass attacks on immigrants were not just morally wrong, but strategically short-sighted	The President's tweets will only make it harder to critique the intolerance of extreme Democrats President Donald Trump likes to tweet, and when he does, he expresses his opinion in no uncertain terms. On Sunday, he took to his favourite medium of communication to urge a group of four progressive Democratic congresswomen to “go back” to the countries “from which they came”. Leave aside for a moment the fact that three of the lawmakers are US-born citizens – Representative Rashida Tlaib, for example, was born in Detroit, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the Bronx, and Ayanna Pressley in Cincinnati – Trump’s firebrand comments were more than just a below-the-belt assault on his political rivals.
JUL17	It's no wonder young Brits are rejecting the deranged excesses of modern feminism	The movement has moved far away from its intellectual roots This week, Buzzfeed published the news that a third of young Brits hold "anti-feminist views"; and believe that feminism is “marginalising and demonising men”. Though this was presumably meant to be a problematic and shocking discovery, it met with a largely apathetic response elsewhere. Could it be that others had the same reaction as mine? One of total unsurprise.
JUL17	Not even Machiavelli could explain the deranged logic of Trump's toxic tweets	Some of my Trump-supporting friends have been defending the President’s racist tweets by claiming that they’re clever politics. By forcing senior members of the Democratic Party, including the leading contenders for the Presidential nomination, to defend the four hard Left Congresswomen known as “the Squad”, he is tainting them by association. If they’re willing to stand up for people like Ilhan Omar, the Democratic Congresswoman from Minnesota’s fifth district, even if it’s for noble reasons, it will look as though the entire party stands behind all the idiotic things she’s said, including her anti-Semitic remarks. I’m not convinced. First of all, that explanation attributes a degree of strategic calculation to the President’s social media activity that is just wishful thinking. As the American writer Jonah Goldbderg says, Trump tweets like an escaped monkey from a cocaine experiment. If he’d given the two tweets that have caused the uproar a moment’s thought, he wouldn’t have made the mistake of telling the Congresswomen to “go back” to “the broken and crime infested places from which they came”, given that three of the four were born in America. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was able to reply, that is precisely what she’s trying to do, only the “broken” society she’s trying to fix is the Bronx.
JUL17	Ursula von der Leyen is gearing up to be the most hardcore EU-federalist Commission President in history	Despite her questionable mandate, the new Commissioner proposes a raft of radical, federalising policies Ursula von der Leyen, one of the least popular members of the German government, last night received the backing of a small majority of MEPs to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as European Commission President. But what should we expect to see under her tenure?  By picking von der Leyen, European leaders discarded the so-called Spitzenkandidaten system, which meant they would have to select someone first nominated by one of the political groups in the European Parliament. "This angered many MEPs, so in response, von der Leyen has been reaching out to Left-wing MEPs through a string of ‘progressive’ and centralising policies, thereby upsetting many in her own centre-right European People’s Party (EPP).
JUL17	Fanatical Von der Leyen is the final nail in the coffin for shambolic EU 'democracy'	Ursula Von der Leyen, the controversial Defence Minister of the Bundeswehr, got the approval of the EU Parliament to become President of the EU Commission by just nine votes. She was the only candidate, selected by the EU Council, and will have a central role in Brexit negotiations with the the British government.  Here in the EU Parliament, where most deals are stitched up way before any vote, that’s as close as it gets and certainly not the ringing endorsement that Donald Tusk asked Parliament for two weeks ago. It comes after a days of intense wheeler-dealing, with Mrs Von der Leyen walking the corridors of Strasbourg and Brussels to lobby for the Presidency.  MEPs from all political parties had expressed serious concerns about the abandonment of their precious Spitzenkandidaten process, which in theory ties the choice of President to the results of the European election.
JUL18	There may well be an economic cost to no-deal – but plenty of people want it anyway	It is almost exactly 65 years since Darrell Huff published How to Lie With Statistics – a classic that is overdue an update, given the dazzling innovations in this field in the past decade. A new generation of politicians has lifted statistical lying into an artform, especially in the Brexit debates. We have seen new tricks whereby “fall” can be made to mean “rise”, 50p can be dressed up as £1, and so on. We saw the “disaster scenario” scam today, another classic of the genre. You might remember hearing (or reading) that the Office for Budget Responsibility has finally done the sums over a no-deal Brexit. And, behold! It forecasts disaster. Billions more in debt. A year-long recession. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the OBR has proven that “even the most benign” version of a no-deal Brexit will inflict “a very significant” hit to the UK economy. Chuka Umunna said the OBR has shown a no-deal Brexit “will result in recession”. But here’s the thing: there was no forecast. The OBR was quite explicit. It was not venturing an opinion about the effect of Brexit. It instead took an IMF scenario and said: let’s imagine that no-deal does trigger recession. What would then happen? It didn’t say that such a recession was inevitable, or even likely. By presenting it otherwise, Mr Hammond has his horror story. But punch in some different economic assumptions and – presto! – the recession vanishes. The latest  no-deal Brexit scenario from Oxford Economics does just that: a sharp slowdown, it says, but no recession.
JUL18	Stop telling obese people they're fat - it's not working	Is overeating an illness? Is being a bit fat and a bit lazy a clinical condition? Is even posing such questions an admission of craven defeat in our ongoing battle of the bulge? No. No. Yes. But. A big but. For (whisper it) big butts. Anyone already offended ought to keep reading. This is probably about you. And me and most other people “carrying a few extra pounds,” as the modern euphemism has it.
JUL18	How the Russians seduced me into handing over my facial fingerprint	Who can resist the opportunity to see into their own future?  My husband is so concerned about the dystopian possibilities of the data economy that he has closed down his Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram accounts. Yet even he was instantly seduced by the FaceApp craze. This app – actually two years old, but going viral now because of its much-improved technology – enables you to see what you will look like in your old age. You choose a selfie and let the robots work their “neural networking” magic. The results are incredibly plausible. My husband looks like a balder, jowlier James Caan. I have saggy eyes and skin so convincingly creepy that I can almost feel its tortoise dryness.
JUL18	Betrayed by Chuka the cad, Anna Soubry wallows in self-pity. But what of her constituents?	How does Soubry summon the nerve to talk about betrayal? It is hard to pinpoint when, exactly, Brexit ceased to be regarded as a public vote that it was their duty to implement and became an excuse for politicians to star in a political soap opera in which their egos run wild. But for those of us who tuned in, last night provided peak drama. There Anna Soubry sat, complete with anguished expression, trembling blonde tresses and lashings of mascara, confiding in us all her hitherto hidden and frustrated feelings for Chuka Umunna. It was all "very sad", she told ITV, "because [Chuka]… to me he was absolutely the future for our country." And yet it there were three parties in their political marriage: the ones they left because they simply had to be together, and those scheming whores, the Lib Dems. 
JUL18	With Brexit on a knife edge, Boris must banish Remainer saboteurs from government	“It’s a funny old world” Margaret Thatcher once mused. And so it is. Who’d have thought that Boris Johnson – ridiculed, undermined, written off and dismissed as a has-been by the media and Tory colleagues as recently as February – would now be on the verge of a landslide win in the Conservative leadership ballot? The Government’s defeat today on the potential option of suspending Parliament in the event of a failure to agree a new deal with the European Union, is a sideshow and hardly fatal to his cause. It’s the beginning of the end for Tory Remainer MPs who have run out of road in their increasingly desperate efforts to thwart the democratic mandate and the instruction of the electorate to leave the EU, back in 2016. Talk of “making a stand” to ensure Parliament is not “locked out” of the Article 50 process is dishonest humbug too. Parliament has voted three times in primary legislation – Acts of Parliament debated over hundreds of hours – to hold and abide by an in/out referendum, to trigger Article 50 and to leave the EU on a set date – and yet it wilfully refuses to honour the law of the land and in the process, tarnishes what little vestigial authority it retains.
JUL18	Debate: should the BBC scrap free TV licenses for the over-75s?	Free BBC licences will no longer be universally available to the over-75s, after the national broadcaster said it could no longer afford to take on the financial burden from the Government. From June next year, the entitlement will be restricted to recipients of pension credit. But was it the right move? Caroline Abrahams, the CEO of Age UK and the Telegraph's Madeline Grant give their response... The first and simplest reason why our over-75s should keep their free TV licence is because the Government is committed to it in their last manifesto. Benefits like a free TV licence really do matter to older people. For the Government to break their promise is a serious breach of faith. The fact that a previous administration passed responsibility for these licences to the BBC in a private back-room deal, with no public consultation, leaves a very bad taste in the mouth. Older people deserve a lot better.  The TV matters hugely to many over-75s, as they have told us in their hundreds of thousands. For those who are housebound, sick and/or lonely in particular it’s a lifeline and window on the world. Under the BBC’s plan, everyone aged over 75 who currently receives a free licence will lose it; it’s not that it will simply be unavailable to those reaching 75 from now on. In the case of the many thousands in their nineties and beyond it means they’ll have to buy a licence for the first time in twenty or more years. 
JUL18	Six reasons why the EU will call Boris Johnson's bluff on no deal	So, Michel Barnier has told the BBC in a Panorama programme that will air tonight that Theresa May never even bothered to pretend to him, in private, that the UK might leave the EU with no deal. All that “No deal is better than a bad deal” and “We stand ready” guff was purely for UK political consumption. Could that mean that if Boris really means it on no deal and conveys that to the EU, perhaps they could actually buckle and we’ll get a new deal, sans backstop, in time for October 31? No. Here are six reasons why not.
JUL18	Remainers just snatched a Pyrrhic victory that could cost us our democracy	So they got their way. That stalwart army of tireless parliamentarians who were determined that the new prime minister would not be able to ignore their great legislature have won the day, by passing a cross-party amendment to the Northern Ireland Bill that makes it virtually impossible to prorogue parliament, in order to ensure a no deal Brexit. Or at least they have won for a fleeting moment. Because their ultimate aim is to abolish the sovereign power of the British Parliament forever. So this is an odd sort of triumph. The amendment they have so valiantly struggled to pass for which some of them were apparently prepared to sacrifice their careers, was a bizarre logical contradiction. The self-appointed suicide squad of Irreconcilable Remain has seized for itself the right to hand over power for creating legislation to the unelected EU Commission. These are strange times. The irrepressible David Gauke who has played a particularly aggressive and accident-prone role in this campaign, spoke grandly of the UK being “a Parliamentary democracy and I don’t think the referendum was about thwarting parliamentary democracy.”
JUL18	Ursula von der Leyen is a fanatical European federalist – which could make her Boris Johnson's biggest ally	For years, I have warned of the EU’s desire to become a fully militarised entity in its own right. The response to this assertion from the Remain establishment has always been the same: outright denial. Indeed, every time I have advanced this idea, I have been accused of being a liar and scaremongerer. Most memorably, in April 2014, then-deputy prime minister Nick Clegg even claimed during a televised debate we had that my prediction was a “dangerous fantasy”. Yet now that Ursula Von der Leyen has been approved as the next President of the European Commission, it will be difficult for anyone to pretend I was wrong. Make no mistake: despite Von der Leyen being a complete unknown outside of her native Germany, her domestic political record confirms I am no liar. As German defence minister for the last five and-a-half years, she has argued more loudly than many for an EU army while refusing to support payment of the minimum contribution fee to NATO. Von der Leyen – known in Brussels as the Chris Grayling of German politics – is a fanatical federalist. Putting aside the sense that her main qualifications for getting the EU’s top job appear to be her nationality and her sex (the EU is boasting fatuously she will be the first woman to head the Commission when she takes up the post in November) it is clear her nomination was the result of a Franco-German stitch-up in Brussels two weeks ago. Christine Lagarde, of France, was put forward at the same time to run the European Central Bank. None of this happened by accident.
JUL18	Our innovative approach to global conflict is a vital part of standing up for British values	From retraining former rebels to tackling organised crime, I am proud of what the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund has achieved Over the last ten years, the nature of conflict and instability has changed dramatically. In today’s global landscape, conflicts last longer, involve more countries, and are further complicated by terrorism and serious and organised crime. While these crises stifle development and cause human suffering, they also affect the UK’s national security. These complex challenges require a bold approach. In response, the Government created a new fund to respond to conflict and stability across government departments – the £1.26 billion Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF). 
JUL19	Our new pro-Brexit Government must speak the language of liberty	For too long the Conservatives have failed to unpick the assumptions made by illiberal liberals Next week, we shall almost certainly have a government which is pro-Brexit. This has never happened before. My guess and hope are that it will make a big difference. Political leadership never works if it is half-hearted, as it has been throughout Theresa May’s three years. At last it can be whole-hearted. My guess and hope both feel confirmed by the pre-emptive strikes by Tory Remainer MPs, including several ministers, this week. Almost all of them voted, in February 2017, to trigger Article 50, which ensures that “no deal” is the default Brexit position. Since then, they have found ever wilder devices against the no deal they legislated for, but have always evaded the logic of their opposition which is to rescind Article 50. They are increasingly, comically desperate.
JUL19	Chris Packham doesn't care about the chaos he causes to rural lives	Earlier this year, I was chatting to Chris Packham. It was almost a month since his legal challenge had resulted in a ban on shooting pigeons and corvids. Across the country, shepherds had only been able to watch as lambs’ eyes were pecked out, and gamekeepers found themselves powerless to intervene as crows preyed on curlew. In a bid to find common ground I asked Mr Packham if he’d ever be able to work with gamekeepers to achieve conservation goals. Bafflingly, he said he’d been trying for 30 years, “but what would you do if someone killed a member of your family?” I’m still not sure what he meant, and nor have I been able to find a gamekeeper he’s tried to work with, but the outburst meant I wasn’t particularly surprised, this week, when he launched an attack on pheasant shooting. 
JUL19	Spare me the hypocrisy of the extreme Remoaners who would use the Queen to block no deal	I happen to agree with those who think it would be an outrage for the new Prime Minister to prorogue Parliament in the autumn in order to prevent MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit – something that the Conservative leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson hasn’t said he will do but hasn’t exactly ruled out either. When you have campaigned to save British democracy from interference by unelected EU officials it would be pretty bizarre to try to thwart that democracy.   But wouldn’t the anti-proroguers be just a tad more convincing if many of them were not simultaneously scouring the statute book for procedural wheezes which might allow them to get their own way? If proroguing Parliament would be an outrage I don’t know what word there is left to describe the scheme dreamed up by Tory MPs to make a humble address to the Queen, requesting that Her Majesty toddle off to the next EU summit, above the heads of her own government, to ask for an extension to article 50.     
JUL19	Will our next PM be bold enough to tackle the biggest challenge facing the NHS?	Our outdated health system is obsessed with treating diseases rather than preventing them in the first place The Tory leadership race is now coming to an end, after an extraordinary few months in which we’ve heard about citizens’ assemblies, the merits and demerits of proroguing Parliament and (literal) kippers. But what is perhaps most remarkable, given public sentiment, is that neither of the two remaining candidates has said much about the National Health Service. According to one recent poll, the public believe the NHS should be the next prime minister’s top spending priority.  When the next PM takes office, they should perform a simple thought experiment, and ask themselves the following question: “If I created the NHS today from scratch, what would it look like?” The answer would be - nothing like the monolith we have today.
JUL19	As co-founders of Extinction Rebellion, we've made many mistakes - but now is the time for collective action, not recriminations	Only by working together can we resolve the dilemmas facing our planet Earlier in the week, this newspaper carried a story about a report in which the author said he had uncovered evidence about one of us advocating revolution to overturn capitalism through mass protest and law-breaking. In response, we’d just like to say we got it wrong. In fact, the two of us have been getting it wrong for years. Until we co-founded what was to become Extinction Rebellion, we were individually engaged in one failing cause after another. We persevered because we want what most people want: a future for our children where they can prosper and live in peace. And so yes, we’ve railed against the Government because they are failing to protect the people that they are elected to represent.
JUL19	Voters don't want the green campaigners' extreme climate policies	The renowned naturalist and climate change campaigner Sir David Attenborough believes governments should face a reckoning for their failure to tackle global warming. Speaking recently about the US and Australia, he expressed a hope that the electorate would vote out governments who are not taking the climate seriously enough. The problem for Sir David and other campaigners is that, far from punishing politicians who pledge to scrap expensive climate policies, voters in Australia just backed them.  The Australian election was dubbed the “climate change election”. Pundits expected the climate-concerned Labor Party to cruise to an easy win, but didn’t count on a voter backlash against their drastic plans. One model estimated that the party’s planned 45 percent slash in carbon emissions would set the economy back by 264 billion Australian dollars (£149 billion) and claim some 167,000 jobs. Voters duly re-elected right-of-centre Coalition parties whose energy policy focused on driving down power prices and beefing up supply. Australians are far from alone in saying no to expensive green schemes. Americans elected Donald Trump in part because of his promise to boost manufacturing and fossil fuel industries by repealing environmental regulations he blamed for hurting blue-collar jobs. But even in Democrat states, voters dislike the measures being pushed by climate campaigners.
JUL19	There may well be an economic cost to no-deal – but plenty of people want it anyway	It is almost exactly 65 years since Darrell Huff published How to Lie With Statistics – a classic that is overdue an update, given the dazzling innovations in this field in the past decade. A new generation of politicians has lifted statistical lying into an artform, especially in the Brexit debates. We have seen new tricks whereby “fall” can be made to mean “rise”, 50p can be dressed up as £1, and so on. We saw the “disaster scenario” scam today, another classic of the genre. You might remember hearing (or reading) that the Office for Budget Responsibility has finally done the sums over a no-deal Brexit. And, behold! It forecasts disaster. Billions more in debt. A year-long recession. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the OBR has proven that “even the most benign” version of a no-deal Brexit will inflict “a very significant” hit to the UK economy. Chuka Umunna said the OBR has shown a no-deal Brexit “will result in recession”. But here’s the thing: there was no forecast. The OBR was quite explicit. It was not venturing an opinion about the effect of Brexit. It instead took an IMF scenario and said: let’s imagine that no-deal does trigger recession. What would then happen? It didn’t say that such a recession was inevitable, or even likely. By presenting it otherwise, Mr Hammond has his horror story. But punch in some different economic assumptions and – presto! – the recession vanishes. The latest  no-deal Brexit scenario from Oxford Economics does just that: a sharp slowdown, it says, but no recession.
JUL19	Stop telling obese people they're fat - it's not working	Is overeating an illness? Is being a bit fat and a bit lazy a clinical condition? Is even posing such questions an admission of craven defeat in our ongoing battle of the bulge? No. No. Yes. But. A big but. For (whisper it) big butts. Anyone already offended ought to keep reading. This is probably about you. And me and most other people “carrying a few extra pounds,” as the modern euphemism has it.
JUL19	How the Russians seduced me into handing over my facial fingerprint	Who can resist the opportunity to see into their own future?  My husband is so concerned about the dystopian possibilities of the data economy that he has closed down his Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram accounts. Yet even he was instantly seduced by the FaceApp craze. This app – actually two years old, but going viral now because of its much-improved technology – enables you to see what you will look like in your old age. You choose a selfie and let the robots work their “neural networking” magic. The results are incredibly plausible. My husband looks like a balder, jowlier James Caan. I have saggy eyes and skin so convincingly creepy that I can almost feel its tortoise dryness.
JUL19	Betrayed by Chuka the cad, Anna Soubry wallows in self-pity. But what of her constituents?	How does Soubry summon the nerve to talk about betrayal? It is hard to pinpoint when, exactly, Brexit ceased to be regarded as a public vote that it was their duty to implement and became an excuse for politicians to star in a political soap opera in which their egos run wild. But for those of us who tuned in, last night provided peak drama. There Anna Soubry sat, complete with anguished expression, trembling blonde tresses and lashings of mascara, confiding in us all her hitherto hidden and frustrated feelings for Chuka Umunna. It was all "very sad", she told ITV, "because [Chuka]… to me he was absolutely the future for our country." And yet it there were three parties in their political marriage: the ones they left because they simply had to be together, and those scheming whores, the Lib Dems. 
JUL20	Freedom is the answer to our housing crisis	Once Brexit is complete, Britain’s housing crisis will become the great challenge of our time. Our nation is uniquely short of housing. For over a generation, we have built more slowly than any comparable country. This has led to house prices rising beyond the reach of many people. Housing has become a synonym for generational inequality. Many young people are unable to move to better jobs because they cannot afford nearby housing. Britons are increasingly barred from their own capital city, with London high up among the most expensive major cities in which to buy a home. It is sadly inevitable that the proportion of our people needing housing benefit is also higher than almost anywhere else. If this continues, a whole generation will be barred from home ownership. I fear the consequences for our property-owning democracy. That is why my paper, Raising the Roof: How to solve the United Kingdom’s housing crisis, released by the Institute of Economic Affairs tomorrow, describes a programme to unlock home ownership for a new generation.
JUL20	The 'go home' scandal shows just how far Trump has strayed from the Republican Party of Reagan	The Party must rediscover its open, freedom-loving, entrepreneurial spirit Fairly recently, US presidential hopefuls in a primary debate were asked whether they believed illegal immigrants should be allowed to send their children to a state-run school for free, or be made to pay for their kid’s education. The candidate more concerned about illegal immigration called for a renewed policy to be “sensitive and understanding of labour needs and human needs.” Aware of the grave harm of denying six year olds the opportunity to become educated, he asserted: “I’d would reluctantly say they would get whatever it is that society is giving to their neighbours.”
JUL20	Brexit myopia and a fatal lack of foresight has enabled Iran to put Britain on the spot	For too long, Whitehall has neglected the growing crisis in the Gulf  The seizure of the Stena Impero by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards puts Britain on the spot. This is not just a crisis about the freedom of transit for oil through the Persian Gulf. It is about the rivalry between Iran and the West across the Middle East. The immediate background is the seizure of the Panamanian tanker, Grace 1, off Gibraltar for breaking EU sanctions by carrying 200,000 tons of Iranian oil to Syria. The West opposes Iran’s ally, Assad, and wants to squeeze the Syrian President’s regime economically. But the United States also wants to make Iran bow to its “maximum pressure” to accept a more comprehensive control on its activities than the nuclear deal negotiated by President Obama and abandoned by Donald Trump.
JUL20	The right to disagree passionately over Brexit is what makes Britain a free country	In years to come, we will look back on this period as a golden age of popular political engagement We are presently enduring the last twenty seconds of what has been one of the most dismal, depressing chapters in modern British political history. It is ending in the spirit in which it proceeded, with an obtuse, self-regarding statement from the outgoing prime minister and a descent into technical insanity on the part of the losing side in the national argument. And yet – there is another story to be told about this past three years.  Theresa May’s last testament was a predictably wrong-headed take on the conflagration that has consumed our public discourse during this era, in which she smugly condemned the crassness and extremism of the debate. In fact, the vituperation and passion which has dominated social intercourse and even domestic life in the country has been its great redeeming feature – the one candle in the darkness of this ghastly chapter. I will repeat here what I said months ago on this page – and which readers may believe that I had come to regret: some time in the not very distant future, we will look back on this period as a golden age of popular political engagement.     
JUL20	The failure to stand up for conservative thinking is leading us into a new cultural dark age	The intellectual scene always used to have room for great minds from the Right. Today they would be denounced for thought crime by a Left that cannot tolerate dissent British intellectual life has always made room for the conservative voice. From Burke and Hume to Maitland and Oakeshott, British philosophers have offered a continuous reflection on our social and cultural inheritance, with a view to understanding the fundamental idea on which conservatism has been founded – the idea of belonging. They have insisted that the goal of our earthly life is not to remake the world but to belong to it, and that the true political virtues are patience, understanding and humility rather than indignation or revolutionary rage.
JUL20	Growing old isn't a challenge - it's a gift	The latest craze to sweep social media involves people posting pictures of themselves as they might look in old age. Thanks to something called FaceApp, anyone with a smart phone and a willingness to apparently share their data with the Russians can now take part in the “age challenge”, which essentially involves adding a filter to your face to make it look elderly. It was spearheaded by celebrities such as Courtney Cox, Gordon Ramsay and Heidi Klum, who have this week offered us a glimpse into an alternate reality where Botox, fillers, and plastic surgery do not exist. Using filters to show the truth? Social media truly has eaten itself. There are concerns that the app, owned by a Russian developer, could be a global security threat, given that it requires users to allow access to all of their photos. In the US, the Democratic National Committee’s security chief, Bob Lord, sent an alert to all campaign staff for next year’s election, urging them to “delete the app immediately”, while in the this country the data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office, has announced it will be investigating the privacy issues. “We are aware of stories raising concerns about FaceApp and will be considering them.” My biggest concern about the app, though, is not for global cyber security, but global sanity. How have we got to this point, where wrinkles and lines and looking old is seen as something we must challenge ourselves to do?
JUL20	Why Brexit could save us from technotyranny and our own extinction	The coming tyranny creeps as well as flaunts. When we are relentlessy subjected to the grotesque pageantry of Brussels, it’s easy to forget this basic fact. The recent spectacle of the EU superarmy fanatic Ursula von der Leyen scraping a nine-vote margin in a one-horse election – like the deficient tyrant of some doleful banana republic – was so burlesquely, flesh-baringly totalitarian, it almost seemed like a vulgar joke. But, gripped by the Orwellian psychodrama of Brussels, are we neglecting the advance of an even more dark and dangerous strain of modern authoritarianism? The world is sleepwalking into technotyranny. If those democrats among us seethed with indignation at von der Leyen this week, they greeted revelations that Elon Musk is trying to hack the human brain with a chilly shrug – if they even registered the story. Musk’s company, Neuralink, has applied to US regulators to begin trialling a device that will connect the human brain to a computer interface. Although the firm says its focus is patients who suffer from neurological diseases, Mr Musk believes that the future of humanity is “superintelligence” – a final utopian cognitive state, which will merge our faulty, irrational minds with infinitely more capable and logical machines – thus potentially paving the way for the obliteration of our flawed species.
JUL20	Boris Johnson shouldn’t be afraid to upset Donald Trump – for a very simple reason	Our next prime minister needs to get one thing straight. If you want Donald Trump to respect you, don’t grovel to him. In fact, don’t even be nice to him. Insult him. It’s the only way. Trump is a school bully, and the only person a school bully respects is a bigger school bully. Look how he moons over Kim Jong Un. In 2017, the North Korean dictator released a statement to the world mocking Trump as a “mentally deranged dotard” whom he would “tame with fire”. Since then, Trump has happily shaken Kim’s hand, and hailed him as “very smart” and “a real leader”. Just a few months ago, Trump murmured dreamily, “I like him. Some people say, ‘You shouldn’t like him.’ I say, ‘Why shouldn’t I like him?’”
JUL20	Science alone wouldn't have put man on the moon. We mustn't forget the key role of faith	On Christmas Eve 1968, a message was broadcast to Earth from the orbit of the moon: “And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.” The words were spoken by Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders, as he and fellow crew members Jim Lovell and Frank Borman recited Genesis chapter one in a broadcast watched by one billion people. The moving footage reveals an often ignored fact of the success of the subsequent Apollo mission to the moon, which celebrates its 50th anniversary today: that it was one compelled by faith as much as science. Many of the 12 men to walk on the moon were Christian. Two moonwalkers, Charlie Duke and James Irwin, went on to devote much of the rest of their lives to their faith; another returned to Earth convinced of God’s existence, and a fourth was a Presbyterian minister.
JUL20	Our new pro-Brexit Government must speak the language of liberty	For too long the Conservatives have failed to unpick the assumptions made by illiberal liberals Next week, we shall almost certainly have a government which is pro-Brexit. This has never happened before. My guess and hope are that it will make a big difference. Political leadership never works if it is half-hearted, as it has been throughout Theresa May’s three years. At last it can be whole-hearted. My guess and hope both feel confirmed by the pre-emptive strikes by Tory Remainer MPs, including several ministers, this week. Almost all of them voted, in February 2017, to trigger Article 50, which ensures that “no deal” is the default Brexit position. Since then, they have found ever wilder devices against the no deal they legislated for, but have always evaded the logic of their opposition which is to rescind Article 50. They are increasingly, comically desperate.
JUL21	It's time for a bonfire of the regulatory quangos that are destroying our democracy	The case of Darren Grimes is another alarming example of blatant bias in our bureaucracy Darren Grimes’s court victory over the Electoral Commission is a win for David against the Goliath of the regulatory state in a war that democracy is otherwise losing against bureaucracy. The next prime minister must tackle the menace of regulatory quangos which have too much power, too little accountability and an apparently blatant bias on key issues. The Electoral Commission, some of whose commissioners are openly sympathetic to Remain, investigated Vote Leave and Mr Grimes three times. The third fishing expedition was at the behest of lawyers for the Remain lobby and eventually turned up the fact that Mr Grimes had ticked a wrong box. For this, a young man was going to be fined £20,000, saddled with legal costs, his reputation trashed, and he was even to be denied the chance to cross-examine the commission in court when he appealed.
JUL21	We need the ‘can do’ spirit of 1960s America to help us get out of the EU	They went to the Moon 50 years ago. Surely today we can solve the logistical issues of the Irish border I spent a few guilty minutes on Saturday watching the old footage of the 1969 Moon landing – and my word, I was wrung out by the end. They lose contact several times with Houston. The fuel in the Eagle is running so low that by the time they make their final descent they have less than 60 seconds’ worth left. They overshoot the landing place, and at one point they seem to be going so fast that there is a risk of a crash. In the final seconds, Neil Armstrong has to take over and fly the craft manually because they are in the wrong place and there are too many rocks about. You are left in awe of the bravery of those astronauts. But of course the whole mission was so spectacularly improbable.
JUL21	In an era of Photoshop, unfiltered images of long-dead strangers carry an indefinable magic	Recently my cousin put together a remarkable archive of family photographs. There were pictures from the Twenties of my eerily young paternal grandparents: my grandfather strikingly handsome, my grandmother dark-haired and vivid, scarcely recognisable as the diminutive, white-haired, rather severe figure of my childhood. If my grandparents were keen recorders of the fleeting moment, the habit lapsed in my parents’ generation: my childhood is recorded only in a handful of school photographs. But it began again when my son was born. I have hundreds of snapshots of him as a baby, a toddler, a toothy schoolboy. Unfiltered, sketchily lit, badly framed, each one is a poignant jolt of memory. I still have half a dozen undeveloped rolls of film from those early years. I have no idea what might be on them, but if I don’t get around to finding out, it seems likely that someone else will, for a keen market has recently arisen on eBay and other online sites for what is known as “mystery film” – the undeveloped film of strangers.
JUL21	Our feeble response to Iranian hostility stems from decades of government neglect	Failure to fund our military properly will not only leave our ships exposed but threaten the all-important umbrella of US defence  That the next Prime Minister will start his term in crisis is beyond question. But how ironic if the bigger emergency turned out to be not Brexit but another war in the Gulf. The past few days have had a surreal air to them. A foreign power has kidnapped a British-registered oil tanker and its crew in broad daylight. And yet still as a nation we seem more obsessed by what our likely Prime Minister-to-be got up to at Oxford 35 years ago. You could say that the Falklands War began with a whimper, too – involving scrap merchants on South Georgia – and that the Queen Mother’s 90th birthday celebrations went ahead unhindered when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. Yet there was an air of far greater seriousness in those crises. Iran has little reason to quake. The Foreign Secretary’s response sums it up: don’t worry, he told us, there were no Britons among the Stena Impero’s 23 crew. So that’s alright then – foreign powers are welcome to seize British boats so long as we have outsourced their crewing to the Philippines.
JUL21	The Conservative Party must now reject the vacuous centrism of Rory Stewart	The Conservative Party leadership contest last month is not the last we will see of Rory Stewart. Just yesterday Stewart tweeted that he would be holding audiences at the Penrith Show for the next two and a half hours with the hashtag #RoryWalksOn. Empowered by the chattering class, Stewart will no doubt use his time on the backbenches to challenge the next prime minister and prepare for another tilt at the top job. Roderick James Nugent "Rory" Stewart perfectly embodies a pernicious strand within Tory opinion: paternalistic, smug, and rudderless. There is nothing new or modernising about this approach. Similar tactics defined the Conservatives in the pre-Thatcher era, when the party worked cheek by jowl with Labour on the managed decline of Britain’s global status and economy. Stewart represents a position in the ongoing battle for the soul of the Conservative Party. On the one side, there are those who, in the spirit at Margaret Thatcher, are optimistic for Britain and promote a clear plan for prosperity based on proven free market principles. On the other side, there are those who think they are better than the rest of us and should therefore have the right to dictate how we live our lives.
JUL21	Sacred Mysteries: From revenge in Seville to a place in the Ark	  I did not expect to find in the writings of Jean Vanier (a champion of the value of every human being) an echo of the first great English writer about travel in Spain, Richard Ford. Ford, in his late 30s, active and of independent means, spent 1830 to 1833 living in Seville for his wife’s health, and making journeys by horse through the whole country. In his Handbook for Spain and Gatherings from Spain, a volume on the nation’s habits, he conveys a strong love for the people, mixed with contempt for aspects of their life.
JUL21	The next Chancellor could spark an economic revolution with a radical, tax-cutting budget	Revolutions about taxation have shaped our history. Magna Carta and the Civil War were about the power to tax. The American Revolution was sparked by a series of taxes and tariffs on tea. More recently, the Thatcher and Reagan “revolutions” were rooted in overturning the status quo - excessive taxation - to empower the individual and encourage a free society and prosperous economy. The establishment of a new government this week presents a once in a generation opportunity to inject a wave of new ideas and a renewed sense of optimism. After years of economic pessimism anchored in post-crisis low growth rates, the next government must embrace a radial liberalising programme. Over the last 25 years politicians have chosen to ignore the steady growth in the tax burden, which has reached crisis levels as across the country people and business are working harder than before but keeping less of what they earn.
JUL21	Ditching the licence fee could be the salvation of our pompous, anti-intellectual BBC	Market forces would leave less room for the patronising dross currently populating the schedules Addressing a parliamentary select committee examining BBC funding last week, its Director General, Lord Hall, observed that if the Government stopped them using the licence fee to raise revenue, the Corporation might have to consider a subscription system. This appeared to have been couched as a threat; we should hope it is a promise. If people paid per item for BBC services, the corporation would have to improve them. It insists its programmes are routinely excellent; but many have been cheapened in quality, for reasons of ideology rather than expense.
JUL21	Holidays reinforce my love affair with all things European - except its Union	I smile inwardly when people say Brexiteers are "anti-European". I’m off to "Europe" next week, and I confidently expect to have a very good time. First stop is Biarritz, to see my French family. One of the first things I look forward to is going to the superb covered market for some oysters and a glass of local white wine. I shall browse in one of the excellent bookshops to catch up on recent French novels and history. But of course the sea is the big attraction: a long curved golden beach with big Atlantic rollers. Having learnt to swim (more or less) late in life, I am going to plunge in and go far enough out to escape the crowd, despite my wife fearing I shall drown. But before self-indulgence, manners: the French are a courteous people (the flipside to their sometimes startling rudeness) and I learned on Biarritz beach that one has to greet and shake hands with the regulars, who occupy the same bit of sand year in year out. After Biarritz, we go to stay with friends near Pau. Later to other friends in Perpignan (more oysters, wine and sea), and a trek in the Pyrenees, sleeping under the stars. Finally to see Catalan friends in Barcelona, that great but now discontented city.
JUL21	What I'll miss about drawing Mrs May	As she lurches awkwardly into the footnotes of history, many people will claim that Theresa May’s legacy is simply that she failed to deliver Brexit. I, however, would like to lament the departure of a truly inspiring figure. The heroic woman who competed at the Winter Olympics, played for England in the World Cup, captained a pirate ship and blasted into outer space on a rocket. The fearless PM who posed naked for a calendar, piloted a spitfire and snogged Jeremy Corbyn. The noble leader who transformed before our eyes into a dormouse, a French Poodle, a palaeozoic tetrapod, Andy Murray, Donald Trump and a towel for Juncker’s bottom. It’s fair to say that the real Theresa didn’t have quite as much fun as the one in my cartoons. The flesh-and-blood Prime Minister did, however, provide several situations that proved too funny to ignore. Trampling over farmer’s crops, holding hands with Donald Trump, coughing her way through a party conference speech, and dancing like a robot. What she lacked in spontaneity and wit, she almost made up for in accidental farce.
JUL22	Dear Boris, here's how to survive in your desperately difficult new job	Dear Boris, The entire Conservative Party expects you to become prime minister. Congratulations – it’s not every day that a fellow Telegraph columnist is elevated to this position. You carry the hopes – even of those of us who didn’t vote for you – that you will defy the odds to keep both country and party intact and successful. But you face the most immediately daunting challenge on entering No 10 since Churchill, who you have studied so attentively, stepped over its threshold in 1940. None of us who have preceded you as Tory leader can claim perfect wisdom since we have all made mistakes. On the basis of observing several prime ministers at close quarters, however, here are some thoughts about what to do. It can easily become a lonely job, and there is an opportunity at the outset to prevent that. If you treat your senior Cabinet colleagues with respect and invite them in constantly to your inner counsels, they will respond with loyalty, commitment and developing a common bond. Most prime ministers neglect to do this, and end up hunkered down with advisers in a tightening circle of paranoia.
JUL22	We have the chihuahua-stealing seagull louts we deserve	Seagull steals chihuahua” is, undeniably, a sad story, at the end of a lovely summer weekend. Apparently, a gull swooped into a garden in Paignton, Devon and flew off with the miniature dog, called Gizmo, in its beak. Gizmo’s owner, Becca Hill, 24, said: “My partner was in the garden putting the washing out and saw it swoop down.” Poor Gizmo has not been seen since. Social media users can be cruel. Many have insisted that pet owners should be aware that a teacup-sized dog looks to a predator more like a rodent or a rabbit. “That’s not a dog, it’s an accessory,” was one common reflection. Incidentally, my very knowledgeable birder friend says: “I don’t think a gull would take a chihuahua. That’s not to say it didn’t happen but it’s very rare. Gulls are not natural predators and usually only become protective or aggressive when they have a nest nearby”. We may, however, be partly to blame for the bird’s aggression. We have a strange relationship with seagulls (a collective name, never used by experts who prefer the more accurate “gull”). Whether it’s a Lesser Black Backed, a Great Black Backed or a herring gull (the three most common types), their screeching “kee-yaaar!” shriek, as they wheel over the waves, is an iconic seaside soundtrack.
JUL22	If you can't share your money in a marriage, it's not a marriage worth being in	Before my husband and I got married 11 years ago, we did a marriage preparation course, which entailed filling out a questionnaire to see if there were any areas of incompatibility we needed to work on. We did absolutely fine bar one area: finance. He was worried I was going to spend all his money.  A decade-plus, and three children later, and it’s fair to say that, while neither of us have run off with the other’s savings, the issue of money – and to what extent it is shared – can still occasion some fairly heated discussions between us.  So I sympathise with the 31 per cent of young women who said they wouldn’t share their finances with a significant other, and would prefer to stay financially autonomous. Nevertheless, I also think they’re misguided. 
JUL22	If Britain won't use its naval might against Iran, it doesn't matter how many ships we have	Watching the oceans from the deck of a Royal Navy warship, it's all too easy to get the idea that Britannia still rules the waves. A decade ago, when I joined HMS Cornwall for an anti-piracy patrol along the Somali coastline, it took a full hour to finish a guided tour of the ship's arsenal, which included an attack helicopter, a 4.5 inch main gun, and missiles that could hurl half a ton of explosives 150 miles.  There was, however, a chink in this Cold War-era armour, especially when it came to escorting cargo vessels in the pirate-plagued Gulf of Aden. Quite simply, the Cornwall couldn't be everywhere, and if a fast-moving pirate skiff suddenly appeared in the busy shipping lanes, they had on average only 15 minutes to react. "Our window of opportunity is very short", one officer explained. "As soon as the pirates are on board, we have lost control of the situation as they have control of the hostages." I've been reminded of his words this week, amid the agonising over how Britain could have prevented the fiasco over the Stena Impero, the British tanker seized by Iranian gunboats in the Straits of Hormuz. All manner of armchair admirals have been claiming that if only Britain had more vessels assigned to guard duty, this sort of farce will not happen. The critics include the Foreign Secretary and prime ministerial hopeful, Jeremy Hunt, who pledged in an article in this newspaper to ensure that "our capabilities are up to 21st-century conflict."
JUL22	Boris is right: You don't need the backstop to keep the Irish border open after Brexit	Boris Johnson – who seems likely to win the contest for the Conservative Party leadership, and hence become the country’s new PM – has compared the difficulties we face on the Irish border with landing a man on the moon. I have often used the same analogy. Like the moon landings, resolving the Irish border issue will be difficult but not impossible. And many of the technologies and practices required to do so already exist.  We recently helped launch Prosperity UK’s Alternative Arrangements Commission Report and Protocols, which set out in a detailed, 273 page report precisely what is necessary to ensure alternative arrangements on the Irish border so the backstop is never triggered, or is replaced. I had the privilege of chairing the Technical Panel which consisted of some 25 global experts on trade, customs, the Good Friday Agreement (including people like Paul Bew and Graham Gudgin who were involved in crafting it) and international law. The report was the culmination of an intensive eight week period of study, and over 70 meetings with parties in Northern Ireland, Ireland and on the continent. Our suggested protocols, which could be used either stand-alone as part of any deal with the EU – or even as part of the current withdrawal agreement – were crafted with the help of the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.
JUL22	Only a brashly optimistic PM can make our belittled country great again	The United States of America has always confused British establishment types. A serious country doesn’t elect the likes of Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer; Ronald Reagan, a B-list Hollywood actor; or Donald Trump, a gold-tapped, orange-tanned hotelier as their political leaders. Such amateurs can’t compete with the type of PM Britain tends to prefer. Nearly all of our PMs went to Oxbridge. Most of today’s MPs have now spent all their life in politics. And the whole UK media has campaigned successfully for more women, gays and ethnic minorities to fill the Commons. They think this is absolutely and unequivocally brilliant. They haven’t noticed that this has been achieved by effectively replacing scores of working class MPs with - for example - women barristers, black stockbrokers and gay local government workers. They have not noticed or dwelt on this historic change in representation of the people because few sectors of UK society are so free of working class voices as our press. And if newsrooms have noticed in any way I’m not sure they are that bothered. They’re not bothered because working class voters do stupid things like vote Leave and nothing unites Britain’s expert class more than Remainia. Almost completely concentrated in London now, the people who run Britain’s biggest institutions hardly even know any Leave voters. When they do give Leave voices any platform it’s through the lens of seeing the whole enterprise as one of risk minimisation rather than opportunity maximisation.
JUL22	Why can't Jacob Rees-Mogg's children support Liverpool?	
Follow your club now for first access to all our news, views and analysis
 An ugly row over a photograph of the youngsters in club shirts has exposed the petty intolerance of many on the Left The legend emblazoned across the crest of Liverpool Football Club, "You’ll Never Walk Alone," rings a little hollow this morning. 
JUL22	It's time for a bonfire of the regulatory quangos that are destroying our democracy	The case of Darren Grimes is another alarming example of blatant bias in our bureaucracy Darren Grimes’s court victory over the Electoral Commission is a win for David against the Goliath of the regulatory state in a war that democracy is otherwise losing against bureaucracy. The next prime minister must tackle the menace of regulatory quangos which have too much power, too little accountability and an apparently blatant bias on key issues. The Electoral Commission, some of whose commissioners are openly sympathetic to Remain, investigated Vote Leave and Mr Grimes three times. The third fishing expedition was at the behest of lawyers for the Remain lobby and eventually turned up the fact that Mr Grimes had ticked a wrong box. For this, a young man was going to be fined £20,000, saddled with legal costs, his reputation trashed, and he was even to be denied the chance to cross-examine the commission in court when he appealed.
JUL22	Is Ireland really about to 'cave in' to Boris over the backstop?	The Irish Government will not change its position on the backstop in the face of threats of a no-deal on October 31. It may however, be open to a more reasonable approach. The idea gaining currency in some Brexiteer circles that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is under pressure to cave in on the backstop is based on a misreading of Irish politics and of the EU that has been unfortunately prevalent throughout the Brexit process. The apparent judgment of Boris Johnson and some of his supporters that the serious threat of a no-deal – such as was never convincingly conveyed by Theresa May – will prompt the callow Varadkar to crumble before the mighty Boris is wishful thinking masquerading as analysis. It is certainly not based on an understanding of what’s happening in Dublin or Brussels.
JUL22	The Left are abusing the English language in their attempt to make 'Right-wing' synonymous with 'racist'	A lame duck government is bad enough at any time, but in recent days we have witnessed the horror of a lame duck government in far from quiet times. The state-promoted piracy against a British registered oil tanker in the Persian Gulf has underlined our lack of those basic tools of naval power, the long range frigates. That should have come as no surprise to ministers since the rather splendid retired Admiral West, who served in Gordon Brown's government as a Home Office security minister, rarely misses (and often creates) a chance to remind the House of Lords. We have also seen the pro-abortion lobby claim that, as the Northern Ireland Executive which has devolved responsibility has ceased to function, Westminster should act to bring Northern Ireland into line with the mainland on that matter.
JUL23	Britain’s Trump? Boris Johnson will prove himself to be a cosmopolitan centrist	Here comes the sun, doo doo doo doo! Six long weeks ago, I told Radio 4 that Jeremy Hunt would be lucky to get 30 per cent. Since then, the Boris Bashing Corporation and the legions of Johnson-haters have done their damndest to derail him. BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg refused to concede defeat, announcing that there was “anecdotal evidence of a Hunt surge”. As if. Conservative members had been waiting for this moment since 2016. They wanted Boris. It was always Boris. Yesterday, their sense of elation and excitement tinged with a nervousness which was clearly felt by the man himself, they finally got him.
JUL23	The 'VIP paedophile' scandal is another disgraceful chapter in British policing	"I’m not a bad chap, am I?” That was the desperately sad question 95-year-old Lord Bramall recently asked his son, Nicolas. Let the record state that Edwin Noel Westby Bramall is the very opposite of a bad chap. In 1944, aged just 21, he led a platoon onto the Normandy beaches. Throughout a long Army career, he served with enormous distinction before becoming Chief of the General Staff. He has a battalion of the highest awards his country could bestow upon him, from Knight of the Garter to the Military Cross. He is tough, this old soldier – but nothing in his long life had prepared him for what happened when there was a knock on the door of his Hampshire home on March 4 2015. Lord Bramall was having breakfast with his wife, Avril, who suffered from Alzheimer’s, when a busload of police in white overalls descended and started tearing the place apart. At first, he assumed it was a security matter, but it soon became clear that officers actually thought the D-Day veteran had been part of a VIP paedophile ring that had raped and murdered children between 1975 and 1984. Other prominent names under investigation by Operation Midland included the former prime minister, Ted Heath, former home secretary Lord Brittan, Lord Janner and ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor. The whole thing – a £2.5  million (at the very least) investigation over 16 months – was triggered by the testimony of one man, Carl Beech, aka “Nick”, aka “Carl Survivor”. Beech, a former NHS manager, accused Lord Bramall of raping him in his office and at Armistice Remembrance Day parties where boys had poppies pinned to their bare chests. There was not a shred of evidence to support this grotesque story. But that didn’t stop the “abusers” being identified, or the Met Police’s Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald disgracefully announcing to the world that “Nick [Beech] has been spoken to by experienced officers... and they believe what Nick is saying is credible and true”.
JUL23	The Iran shambles proves Britain has had a lucky escape from Jeremy Hunt	To judge by Jeremy Hunt’s hapless performance as Foreign Secretary in recent days, it is hard to escape the conclusion that, with his failure to win the Tory party leadership, the nation has had a very lucky escape. It is not just that, as the minister with primary responsibility for the Iran brief, Mr Hunt has completely misjudged the ayatollahs’ mindset, with the result that they have successfully hijacked a British-registered oil tanker operating in international waters. He then compounded his error by promoting the utterly fatuous notion of creating a “European Maritime Mission” to afford better protection to shipping operating in the Gulf area. Mr Hunt, in common with other senior ministers in Theresa May’s outgoing government, clearly prefers the idea of establishing a European-centric naval force in the Gulf over the Trump administration’s invitation to join its own effort, Operation Sentinel. It has even been suggested that, had Mrs May accepted the offer Washington made last week to protect British shipping, we would not have suffered the national humiliation of witnessing the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero being boarded and hijacked by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. One more reason why Mrs May’s removal from Downing Street later today cannot come soon enough.
JUL23	The worst thing about hot weather? Being told the bleeding obvious…	Ooh, I say, isn’t it hot? Scorchio, in fact. We’re not complaining, obviously, because that might sound ungrateful and, as it’s courtesy of an African plume, possibly racist. But nor are we constitutionally suited to broiling heat and blazing sun in these sceptred isles. That’s what abroad is for. Even the most diehard Remainer would surely feel a little less anxious about leaving Europe if we get to keep the weather, which is the best bit. That and the wine. And the culture. And the skinny cats keeping the children amused at outdoor restaurants while we linger for hours over frutti di mare, imported from Cornwall. But mostly it’s the climate that we have historically envied. And now, after last year’s heatwave, we find ourselves yet again in the parched throes of a searing summer (a salutary reminder to be careful what one wishes for).
JUL23	Boris ignited Europe's tech capital, now it's Britain's turn	Today we received a definitive answer to one of the political questions facing the country that had not been causing high levels of uncertainty – Boris Johnson superseded Theresa May, becoming the 77th prime minister of the United Kingdom. Britain’s tech community is happy to get whatever concrete updates it can from Westminster these days, and this news could be cause for cautious optimism.  Johnson famously came to the fore of British politics with his gusto and exuberance whilst residing over City Hall, where he certainly made his mark on the burgeoning tech industry that had just taken seed in Britain.  Back in 2014, as Mayor of London, Johnson focused efforts on crowning the city as Europe’s capital of tech. He created the original cohort of London Tech Ambassadors, which I joined and I stood beside him for the opening of the inaugural London Tech Week.
JUL23	Cowardly Tories abandoned Sir Roger Scruton to a Leftist show trial. Their apology comes too late	Isn’t it charitable of him? The (presumably outgoing) Housing Secretary James Brokenshire has offered Sir Roger Scruton his job as a government adviser back, after he was a victim of a Left-wing witch hunt. Scruton had been appointed chair of the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission in November – a role that was going fairly well until he accepted an interview with George Eaton at The New Statesman. What was meant to be a gripping exchange on global politics turned out to be an epic stitch-up. Eaton asked Scruton’s opinions on a number of topics, such as China, Islam and George Soros, only to omit the context around the philosopher’s quotes, making him sound as offensive as possible. Within hours of the article going live, Tory MPs had called for Scruton to go. Scruton said that he had been “demonised” and “disowned” by Number 10 after the events, and it’s true. Without hesitation, the Tories abandoned him, never willing to hear his side of the story, and Brokenshire felt he had no choice but to sack him from the unpaid role. But soon after it emerged that Eaton had manipulated the interview, the Tories could not apologise quickly enough – culminating in the decision to ask Scruton back.
JUL23	Tom Watson put my family through hell. He must resign in disgrace	For six years, my family has endured a living nightmare. That’s how long it has been since the fantasist Carl Beech concocted his hateful series of lies about my late father, Lord (Greville) Janner, a gentle, kind and loving man who was never convicted of any offence and whose lengthy record of public service has been besmirched in the most evil way.  Beech, who as the witness known as “Nick” sparked a moral panic over establishment paedophiles, was convicted of fraud and perverting the course of justice on Monday. However, far from closing this sorry episode in British legal history, pressing concerns remain – not least why his absurd lies were treated by the police as if they were, in the words of one senior officer, “credible and true”. Much of the blame for that rests with one man: Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson. In October 2012, Watson used parliamentary privilege to say there was “clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10”. In the aftermath of the revelations about Jimmy Savile, this set off a witch-hunt for imaginary paedophiles. 
JUL23	Who should be in Boris Johnson's Cabinet? Our writers have their say	Boris Johnson is heading into No 10 today, but who should he have in his Cabinet? The Telegraph's expert commentators give their top picks for the Big Three: Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary. Read more expert opinion from Janet Daley Not only does he have a genuine understanding of the workings of finance through his own banking career, but his commitment to enterprise and free market economics is beyond question. Perhaps most important though is the understanding of the need to encourage aspiration and social mobility which he has gained from his own life experience. He has shown himself to be an effective Home Secretary at a difficult time for that department. And there can be no getting away from the point that his background - the son of an immigrant Pakistani bus driver - would make an excellent counterpoint to the old Etonian Boris Johnson.
JUL23	Boris, the country is crying out for leadership - but with my party's help, we can resolve Brexit	After 40 years of dreaming about becoming the British prime minister, this is not the start that Boris Johnson would have wanted. He takes over a bitterly divided party; he has no overall parliamentary majority; and he has just 100 days to deliver Brexit. Truly, this is a bittersweet moment for him. The Conservative Party’s position in the Commons is not about to improve, either. Next week, the seat of Brecon and Radnorshire, held by the Tories since 2015, seems certain to be gained by the Liberal Democrats in a by-election. Furthermore, I expect resignations from within the Conservative parliamentary party if Mr Johnson proceeds with his ‘do or die’ Brexit strategy. For the fact is that many Tory Remainer politicians don’t just dislike Brexit, they actively hate Mr Johnson as well. Exactly where these unfavourable conditions leave the new prime minister is an open question. The pressure on him to resist a WTO withdrawal is so great, I believe he may conclude the only way to survive in No 10 is to revisit the failed Withdrawal Agreement and ask Brussels to help change some of its words. In the unlikely event that such a rehash were to be passed by MPs in Westminster, Mr Johnson would buy himself some breathing space, but the bigger picture would be bleak. It would lead to more years of discord and anger.
JUL23	Boris Johnson's victory has reduced the infantile Remain resistance to dust	It’s all over. The phoney war is finished. The three miserable years of Theresa May’s pseudo consensus, defeatism, splitting the middle, duplicity, capitulation and surrender is over. It’s Morning Again in the UK, to paraphrase Ronald Reagan just before his landslide presidential win in 1984. The Brexit denouement is at hand. Boris Johnson’s landslide win in the Conservative leadership contest stands in favourable contrast to that of David Cameron in 2005 – a solid two to one vote. Specifically, he won an absolute majority of votes not just of his fellow MPs but of the nearly 160,000 Conservative Party members.
JUL24	From Walpole to Thatcher, chaos has been the making of many of our finest PMs	Strength of character and confidence of purpose will be essential What could be more challenging than the situation facing Boris Johnston today? How about becoming prime minister against the background of a collapse in financial confidence, a divided Royal family and party, and a Jacobite conspiracy? That was Robert Walpole in 1721 and he held office until 1742. How about gaining office in the context of a disastrous war in which a key part of the empire has been lost, with neither a majority in the Commons nor an ability to hold the new ministry together? That was William Pitt the Younger in 1783. He went on to win every general election he called and to hold office until 1801 and again from 1804 until his death in 1806. Or becoming PM with Britain facing a victorious Napoleon, a new war with the United States, and Luddite disturbances at home? That was the Earl of Liverpool in 1812. He served continually until a vicious stroke hit him in 1827.
JUL24	This 'Night of the Long Knives' has Dominic Cummings' fingerprints all over it	Boris Johnson isn’t messing about. With his record breaking cull of non-believers from the Cabinet, it’s clear that he is keen to stamp his authority over his administration from day one. The Cabinet has decidedly shifted in the direction of champions of freedom and democracy. The Remainers are leaving and the Leavers are remaining. Whilst Remainers and centrists like Rory Stewart and David Gauke ejected themselves before Boris Day, today saw the unprecedented expulsion of a further thirteen Cabinet level ministers from the Government. More than half the people who sat in the Cabinet this morning were out by the early evening. This bold approach has the fingerprints of Vote Leave supremo Dominic Cummings all over it. Famously effective (and abrasive), it is easy to see that his touch will make this administration one of conviction not capitulation. This will be a Government that keeps people in like by daring them to bring it down and usher in Corbyn. The May tactic of keeping Remain agitators in the Cabinet just so they don’t make life difficult on the back benches has been thoroughly ditched, and for good reason.
JUL24	Boris Johnson must spend, spend, spend to reunite the UK	Boris Johnson’s premiership begins with a paradox. Confronted by a Parliament of Remainers, he might need an election to deliver Brexit. But without delivering Brexit he is unlikely to win an election. A second paradox awaits him too. Boris has promised to deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn. But he cannot unite the country by delivering Brexit, because Brexit is a divisive act. The referendum gave us a binary choice – to leave the EU or remain a member state – and the choice Boris now faces is also binary. There is no such thing as a “half and half” Brexit. We will either leave the EU – and its laws and institutions in full – or we will remain in all but name. Either Remainers will be disappointed, or Leave supporters will feel betrayed.
JUL24	Boris Johnson has just staked his future on a dramatic Cabinet gamble	Boris Johnson is proving to be a risk-taker as Prime Minister if his first day is anything to go by - he is blazing a substantial trail already. His Cabinet reshuffle has both amazed his opponents and sucked the wind out of their sails. To date it has been a mesmerising, even though not totally unexpected, start to the new regime. As many will have told him, the risks are sizeable, but he knows all that. His dramatic reshuffle is a signal to Europe that he will not be stopped by a divided Cabinet and 31 October is the do or die headline. A Boris regime will be the antidote to the timid and directionless predecessors.  Boris's negotiation is a simple one with the EU, the UK means what it says this time and either it gives ground or its no deal - it will be the EU's fault if there is no deal. The risk he runs is that many in the Cabinet are new to such high office and are inexperienced for the big events that are going to unfold on their watch. Boris clearly means this EU negotiation to be one that he directs and Cabinet rubber stamps - which on this occasion may be the only way to deliver an outcome in the short time available.
JUL24	Does Chancellor Sajid Javid have what it takes for the second toughest job in British politics?	A looming global downturn. Capital fleeing the country as we depart the European Union. Sterling in freefall, trade seizing up, house prices collapsing and unemployment about to rise. The briefing notes the Treasury officials have prepared for Sajid Javid as he moves into Number 11 Downing Street are no doubt as gloomy as any they have ever put in front of a new Chancellor. A few ugly phases have probably been dusted off from the dark days that greeted Denis Healy when he took office in the middle of the miners strike of 1974 or Roy Jenkins in the immediate wake of the sterling crisis of 1967. The permanent secretary might even have helpfully attached a phone number for the IMF just in case we need a couple of trillion in emergency loans before Christmas.  And yet, in truth all Javid has to do is hold his nerve, ride through the turbulence of the autumn, and he can deliver a Brexit bounce. The economic hand he inherits is far better than most mainstream economic opinion is willing to admit. It is just a question of how he plays it. Sure, there are challenges. But there are some huge opportunities as well. 
JUL24	Sorry Donald but Boris Johnson is not 'Britain's Trump'	Nothing is more guaranteed to bring Boris enthusiasts out in hives than comparing him to Trump. It sounds like – and in many ways is – a typical Remainer smear. The new Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is witty and self-deprecating, not attributes that spring immediately to mind with the US President. What’s more, Boris has a thick mop of blond hair that Trump would kill for. But before we get too hot under the collar, it’s worth pointing out that the US President isn’t the caricature he’s portrayed as either. Those suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome portray him as a homophobe, a misogynist and a white supremacist. But that’s not a view shared by the American electorate. Fourteen per cent of LGBT voters in 2016 cast their ballots for Trump, as did a third of Hispanics, a majority of white women and more African-Americans than voted for Mitt Romney. And, for the most part, those voters have had nothing to complain about since. 
JUL24	All Labour MPs showed by refusing to clap out Theresa May is that they have no place in the Commons	In the House of Commons, precedents are created all the time. New traditions replace old ones, what were once merely custom and practice become hard and fast rules, right up until the point where they don’t any longer. Such is the joy of an uncodified, and therefore eternally flexible, constitution. Before 2007, for example, it was unheard of to give a departing prime minister a standing ovation. Such an honour had never been conferred on any of Tony Blair’s successors or, indeed, his immediate successor. Margaret Thatcher’s final appearance at the despatch box, at Prime Minister’s Questions on November 27, 1990, was marked by a higher than usual number of tributes from her Tory colleagues, but that was about it.
JUL24	Boris can win the Brexit war by smashing the Remainer enemy in a snap election	Now that Boris Johnson has become Prime Minister he faces the stark reality of overcoming an overwhelmingly Remainer Parliament if he wants to achieve the meaningful Brexit that he has repeatedly promised. Although in the immediate aftershock of the 2016 referendum Parliament voted almost unanimously to enact Article 50 to leave the EU, everything they have done since, by accident or design, has conspired to thwart it. As a result, we now have a paralysed Parliament which has blocked all outcomes. It has thrice rejected Theresa May’s so-called Withdrawal Agreement; rejected a second referendum; and rejected leaving the EU on WTO terms. So how can a new PM, with a fast diminishing majority, a hostile opposition, and a sizeable group of diehard Remainers in his own party’s ranks, possibly achieve the clean Brexit that the British people voted for in 2016? To change the Parliamentary arithmetic, this do nothing Parliament must itself be changed.
JUL24	Why we should all stop criticising the man who proposed at his girlfriend's graduation	Heard of the graduation proposal? Don’t worry if not, it’s not really a thing. Or it shouldn’t be a thing, at least. Proposing to your girlfriend just as she receives her degree? I know. Too much. No need. Calm down. Yet evidently some people think it’s fine to pile one big life event atop another, and get them all out the way in one go. Some think getting down on one knee before an audience of several hundred others - all dressed for the happy occasion in mortar boards and academic gowns - is the best and only way to do engagements. Take Edgaras Averbuchas, the man who popped the question to his girlfriend at the precise moment of her graduating with a Masters degree in English language. Behold, in the viral video of the moment, the fleeting look of bewilderment on the face of the unsuspecting Agne Banuskeviciute, as she struggles to comprehend the unexpected turn of events her graduation from the University of Essex has taken.
JUL24	Why a snap election would be a terrible mistake for the Tories	So the ball has indeed come out of the scrum and Boris Johnson has been able to claim it. The question he now faces is: "What should I do with it?" One option some are encouraging him to take is to kick the ball into touch – to hold a snap election in which his newly acquired premiership would be on the line but which might give him the safe overall majority that Theresa May badly lacked. At the moment, however, this does not look like a realistic option. For Mr Johnson has inherited as dire an electoral position as that facing any new Prime Minister. On average the Conservative standing in recent polls has been just 25 per cent, hardly a strong foundation for winning a majority.
JUL25	This isn't a Government. It's a perpetual campaigning machine breaking the old rules of politics	With the old order of caution, compromise and complaint swept away, a new reality is upon us “Do you feel daunted?” asked Boris Johnson in his first speech as party leader. The awkward silence that followed from the assembled Tory members said it all: of course they’re daunted. It’s the only sane reaction to the idea of negotiating and agreeing a Brexit deal in 100 days. To say nothing of his other pledges: that he’ll solve the social care crisis, abolish the north-south productivity gap, hire 20,000 more police officers, restore school funding and (of course) cut taxes. It doesn’t just sound tough. It sounds utterly, laughably impossible. At least, impossible under the old rules of politics – but these rules are being torn up by a new Prime Minister who has always preferred to write his own ones. It’s hard to keep up with the sheer pace of changes now underway. The old order – of caution, compromise, complaint and inaction – has been swept away and a new order, of radicals and liberals, has taken its place. For those of us who have been impatient for such change, it’s all quite exhilarating.
JUL25	This diverse Cabinet exemplifies the global-minded spirit which drove Britain to vote Leave	The quest for sovereignty which drove the Brexit vote has a universal appeal Boris Johnson has announced his Cabinet and mapped out the course of his premiership. Like Theresa May when she first entered Downing Street, he declared that his Government’s key priority is delivering Brexit. Unlike May, Boris has fewer than 100 days to accomplish this task. If he fails, he will have had a shorter honeymoon period than Anne of Cleves – very few can see how he can survive in his role a day beyond 31 October if the UK isn’t out of the EU by Hallowe’en. Will he succeed where his predecessor failed? To May, Brexit was solely about controlling immigration and nothing else. Brexit or no Brexit, cutting migrant numbers was almost an ideological mission. And the misfortune of those Brexiteers to whom immigration has always been a secondary concern – according to Lord Ashcroft’s poll, that is actually the majority of those who voted Leave – is that, for the last three years, this has been the only defining characteristic of Brexit. It is a die-hard Remainer’s view of leaving the EU: where 17.4 million Brits conspired to turn the country into an isolationist, mean-minded island, hell-bent on destroying the economy in order to establish an English nationalist dystopia.
JUL25	Why I’m torn about Natalie Imbruglia having a baby at 44	How poignant to discover Natalie Imbruglia is finally pregnant at 44, with the aid of IVF and a sperm donor. I say “finally”, because the singer has confided that, although she wanted a family and was married for five years, she put plans on hold while she pursued her career. Now apparently single, she has chosen – resorted – to extreme and, no doubt, expensive measures to conceive. It is the sort of cautionary tale deployed to reproach ambitious young women as they strive for success, thereby bolstering the pernicious perception that they are architects of their own fertility misfortune.
JUL25	By remaining resolutely pro-Union, Boris Johnson may yet unravel the torturous Irish backstop conundrum	If our new PM remains resolute, he may yet unravel the torturous Irish border conundrum There are, as yet, precious few signs of either the Dublin establishment or Northern Irish nationalists sharing Prime Minister Johnson’s sunny optimism about a renegotiated withdrawal agreement that can make everyone happy. For now they’re continuing to cling to the belief that he is a disorganised buffoon, as they would a comfort blanket. But that's not to say that this position will not change. The Prime Minister so far has done exactly what is required of him in trying to solve his pressing problems in Ireland, which is to speak softly and carry a big stick. If he can maintain the early momentum he has set in realigning the British Government towards Brexit at all costs, then Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and others will soon have to revise their positions. 
JUL25	I was a prostitute, and I know there is only one approach that can protect victims of the sex trade from harm	The Nordic Model recognises the sex trade's power dynamics and inherent abuse I am a survivor of the sex trade. I entered prostitution in my very early twenties, and finally left after turning thirty. I was not physically forced. My reasons for this apparent ‘free choice’ were, however, driven by an abusive relationship and a Class A drug addiction. I was also still suffering the long-term trauma of childhood sexual abuse. That a high percentage of child abuse survivors enter prostitution is no coincidence; we learn the limits of consent from a young age. 
JUL25	Why Carrie Symonds will give the shallow British public exactly what they want	Beauty bias is the unspoken prejudice of our age - and nowhere clearer than in our treatment of the political spouse Say what you want about Carrie Symonds, the one accusation you can’t level at her is that she is boring. Despite not walking into Number 10 with Boris yesterday, the cameras couldn’t help but linger on her in the crowd: dressed in pink and, without even uttering a word, already the centre of the story. Commentators may well pretend that they are interested in Carrie’s values: her environmentalism and veganism have been widely touted as a useful way for Boris to connect with younger voters. But, if we’re really honest, what we care about most is the fact that she is young and beautiful.
JUL25	Boris Johnson's blistering Commons debut has sent Labour into meltdown	Boris Johnson’s scorchingly self-confident debut as Prime Minister at the Despatch box in the Commons today was as unexpected as it was explosive. It can’t be said that he couldn’t work a crowd but having not been on the frontbench for a year, Labour were no doubt breaking one of the cardinal rules of politics: Don’t believe your own publicity. He naturally more than rose to the occasion. Boris was on turbocharge and had the demeanour of a revivalist preacher on a South Carolina stump, eviscerating Labour and vividly painting a picture of a better post Brexit-Britain in the most stunning shades with breathless enthusiasm.
JUL25	For an early win on global trade, Boris Johnson should look no further than Donald Trump	It’s official – the Johnson administration says it is committed to securing a global, outward-looking Brexit. But of course, saying something is not the same as delivering it. There are reasons to be optimistic. On the steps outside Downing Street, in the speech that laid out his vision for his premiership, the new Prime Minister paid lip service to the benefits of free trade, which, as he accurately noted, “has done more than anything else to lift billions out of poverty.” “Let’s start now on those free trade deals,” he proclaimed.
JUL25	Music to scare politicians: what the 2019 Mercury Prize list says about Britain	It is that time of the year when music obsessives briefly get agitated about who are the most significant, creative and boundary breaking artists in the British scene, whilst the rest of the nation goes on streaming American pop hits on their phones. The shortlist for the Hyundai Mercury Prize offers a fair snapshot of the state of British music. Or, rather, that part of it made by young musicians who still think music is a matter of life and death, attended to by people who still listen to albums rather than algorithmically arranged playlists. There is no room here (quite rightly) for the soppy acoustic ballads of Lewis Capaldi, the breakaway young British chart star of the year (in sales terms at least).
JUL25	The best thing about Boris Johnson's 'diverse' Cabinet is that its diversity is irrelevant	It is the brutality of Boris Johnson’s Second Night of the Long Knives which has captured the headlines, but the new Prime Minister’s Cabinet should go down in history for a far more profound reason – its diversity. That the appointment of a number of female and ethnic minority MPs to the top table of British politics – including two of the three great offices of state – should pass largely without comment on the Right is a sign of how much Britain has changed in the nearly 100 years since the first woman, Labour’s Margaret Bondfield, was appointed Minister for Labour in 1923. (It took another 80 years for the country to see its first black Cabinet minister in half-Ghanaian Paul Boateng.) But it is still worth remarking how inclusive Mr Johnson has been, even compared to his old school and university contemporary David Cameron.
JUL26	At last, we have a Brexit government – and one that is ready to win the battle	The noise of fetters breaking” is the phrase Kipling used. We have begun to hear it this week. Obviously, one must enter the caveats. The Government has virtually no majority and two or three dozen discontented backbenchers. Brussels wishes, as usual, to appear implacable. There could be a split between supporters of the free trade agreement that true Brexiteers demand and the tweaked version of Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement for which wobblier colleagues would settle. Our new Prime Minister has fewer than a hundred days to prevail. But what a difference the events of Tuesday to Thursday have made – better recognised, I think, by people in general than by commentators.
JUL26	ERG hardliners threaten to sacrifice Brexit at the altar of ideological purity	Back in 2015, Jeremy Corbyn’s astonishing rise triggered glee amongst Conservatives, who considered him both a liability and their greatest asset. Now, thanks to Brexit, the Tories have their own problem with ideological purists threatening to destroy the government. Rifts are already developing between the new prime minister and the ERG faction that backed his leadership bid. ERG Chairman Steve Baker turned down a ministerial role and told Mr Johnson that a job in the Brexit department would have left him “powerless”. The ERG has reportedly interpreted the offer as a deliberate snub. They blamed Dominic Cummings, the former head of Vote Leave and now the most senior adviser in Downing Street - who once described the eurosceptic group as “narcissist-delusional subset” and a “metastasising tumour” that needs to be “excised from the body politic”.
JUL26	The 'gender chores gap' is a home-wrecking injustice	Fighting over housework is a surprisingly common cause of divorce Writing in the 19th century, Friedrich Engels declared it “insane” for men to do housework. The decidedly “un-woke” Communists expected women to toil in the factories, before attending to their duties at home. By contrast, the advent of consumer capitalism, and with it the refrigerator and washing machine, freed women from domestic drudgery. But in one respect, little has changed. Although women graduate from university in ever-greater numbers, and the gender gap in labour market participation and earnings is narrowing, they continue to shoulder the bulk of the chores.
JUL26	Why I rejected the offer of a Ministerial post in Boris Johnson's glittering new government	BoJo's mojo is catching, but I simply could not oversee a Potemkin department ever again 48 hours in, and Boris Johnson is already proving a fabulous Prime Minister. His performance in yesterday's (extraordinarily long) Commons statement was superb. He is saying and doing all the right things to make our country the greatest and most prosperous in Europe, absolutely committing to our exit date and stating unequivocally that a time limit is not enough on the backstop. Conservative MPs, myself included, are elated by the prospect of following our brilliant new leader. BoJo’s mojo is catching. That’s why I was devastated to decline a ministerial position in his glittering new Government. I wanted to be in there, delivering on our promises alongside someone I support and admire.
JUL26	Can Priti Patel make the Tories the party of law and order again?	“My job is to make your streets safer,” declared Boris Johnson before entering 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister on Wednesday. Twenty thousand more police and a pledge to start recruiting forthwith.  I must admit, even for a cynical police officer like myself, the effusive Johnson has at least put a smile back on my face and some hope back in my heart. For the last decade has truly been a nightmare for British Policing.  In my own Force, we’ve lost over 2,000 officers, a quarter of our number. We’ve shut nearly 100 stations and community bases. Big provincial towns like Walsall have no main station nor a custody facility. Other significant towns like Sutton Coldfield, are set to lose theirs soon. 
JUL26	Boris Johnson be warned, Northern Irish Unionism isn't what it used to be	It’s no exaggeration to say that Karen Bradley did more to unite the people of Northern Ireland by being sacked as the province’s Secretary of State than she was ever able to achieve in office. A brief moment of cross-community celebration, usually reserved for sport, was extended to politics. Her successor Julian Smith should take heed. The politics of the province punishes those who fail to understand its intricacies. Rarely have those nuances been more important than they’ll be during the first 100 days of Boris Johnson’s premiership, when he will navigate Brexit, the Irish Border, and a little part of the United Kingdom that few in the Conservative & Unionist Party truly understand. Central among the misunderstandings is modern-day Northern Irish Unionism.
JUL26	Handcuffed tightly to a bed and kept in solitary - Boris Johnson must now end Nazanin's torture	In these turbulent political times, there are few issues that can unite our divided House of Commons. The case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, however, has managed to do just that. Over 230 Members of Parliament from across the political spectrum, of all Brexit-related persuasions, have joined to call for my constituent’s immediate release. We have written a letter to our new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, demanding that her case remains a priority for his new Government. This call for action followed a week of torture for Nazanin. Having been admitted to a psychiatric hospital, campaigners had hoped that she would finally receive effective medical treatment. It soon transpired that our hopes were misplaced. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard would treat her with their typical cruelty, pushing an already vulnerable woman to the brink.
JUL26	I've had enough of MPs being criticised for going on holiday. They deserve their break	Today should be a day of triumph, or at least relief, for our elected representatives as they kick the dust of Westminster from their feet and head, with families in tow, for sunnier climes. The weather isn’t the point, however. The point is that MPs, just like everyone else, need and deserve a break. I use the word “deserve” deliberately, knowing that in our cynical age, there will be many who begrudge them their six-week absence from the Palace of Westminster. I can hear the complaints already: no one forced them to do the job, they knew what they were getting into, they’re paid well enough… As befits our Brexit-era times, such statements are made with just a touch too much anger and indignation. And, in keeping with these politically polarised days (and as someone no longer subject to the tyranny of the ballot box), I am prepared to call out such criticisms for what they are: infantile nonsense.
JUL26	Priti Patel's approach is just what we need to win the war on crime	As knife crime and homicide rates have risen, the Conservatives’ reputation as the party of law and order has been shredded. Boris Johnson’s decision to appoint Priti Patel as Home Secretary, alongside his commitment to increase police numbers by 20,000, sends a clear signal that his government intends to restore that reputation. Proud of his record in reducing crime in London, the new Prime Minister wants to show that he will give the police the tools they need – including more freedom to stop and search – to get knives off our streets and make all our towns and cities safer. In these uncertain times, with an ever-present terror threat and an epidemic of fatal stabbings, you might expect broad support for such explicit emphasis on public safety. Yet the loudest response to Patel’s appointment so far has been from the human rights lobby, desperate to express their concern at the prospect of a Home Secretary who intends to make national security her priority and who has in the past called for stricter enforcement of immigration rules.
JUL26	Dear Prime Minister, please tread carefully in your handling of the Irish border	Now that the campaigning has ended and the governing must begin, I wanted to write to you about the matter of the Border on the island of Ireland, which is close to where I live. Indeed, the Diocese of Clogher, which I serve, includes all of County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland and County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that my Diocese transcends the Border. No doubt many others representing many people and interests will have communicated with you on this subject before. So I would first reassure you that I am writing as someone who has always recognised the almost impossible difficulties and stresses placed on those who have a vocation to public life, particularly politicians. I cannot claim to represent a huge electorate or to have any specialist knowledge. But sometimes an individual should say things which might otherwise go unheard in the cacophony of other, better-known voices; the alternative would be to simply wither in the silence of exhaustion.
JUL27	Boris Johnson knows Brussels better than anyone. He’s not bluffing about no-deal	Boris isn’t bluffing. Every action, every appointment, every word since he entered Number 10 signals the same thing: Britain is leaving the EU on 31 October. Among Brussels officials, there is still a lazy assumption that the new prime minister will be, as they see it, chastened by reality. The United Kingdom, Eurocrats believe, will not leave without a deal, however harsh and unreasonable its terms. Three years of dealing with Theresa May have convinced them that Brits always back down in the end. The new PM, fonctionnaires tell one another, faces the same constraints as the old one. He, too, will be boxed in by a Europhile Parliament and a civil service that is dead set against rupture. Boris is also, they believe, frivolous. Sure, he made all sorts of statements to get himself elected; but, now that he is in office, the theory goes, he will have to listen to the serious men, the experts, the mandarins. Au contraire, messieurs. There is nothing unserious about Britain’s new leader. I have known Boris for 25 years, and he is the cleverest man I have worked with. Sure, he is well-mannered enough to keep his sharpness under wraps, but don’t ever make the mistake of thinking that his Falstaffian persona implies intellectual levity. 
JUL27	At last we have a set of ministers with the ambition to create a 'responsibility society'	With the authors of Britannia Unchained at the heart of Government, a cultural revolution is afoot Britain is a young country nevertheless in danger of sinking into a decadent belief that its best days are behind it. Celebrity is prized over education, an entitlement culture has society in its grip, hard graft is disparaged, and risk-taking is viewed as a negative. But decline isn’t inevitable. Britain can restore its fortunes, and the dramatic rise of China, India, Brazil and the rest offers remarkable opportunities for the country if it is willing to put in the work necessary to secure long-term gains in our competitiveness. That, in a nutshell, is the argument of Britannia Unchained, a manifesto for an unashamedly thrusting, wealthy and free Britain written by a group of young Tory MPs in 2012. It achieved brief notoriety when it was published, largely because the Left was triggered by the suggestion that British people might want to work a bit harder.
JUL27	Leo Varadkar is wrong to disregard the ancient ties between Britain and Ireland	When we have so much in common with our Irish cousins it is deeply disappointing to see the Taoiseach intent on doing the EU's bidding Recent days have presented a paradox in Anglo-Irish relations. Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach, and his deputy, Simon Coveney, reaffirmed their desire to be weaponised by Brussels in the EU’s determination to force a no-deal Brexit.  Meanwhile, at Lord’s, England and Ireland played their first test match. England were bowled out for 85 by lunch on day one, causing a small earthquake, before recovering to win the match. The sweltering ground teemed throughout with Englishmen and Irishmen joking with each other and enjoying a shared culture in which the English were no longer inevitably the masters. It made one wonder what all the fuss was about the backstop.
JUL27	The defeatist establishment has got it wrong – nothing is impossible in politics	Mrs Thatcher's agenda was scorned by her critics but she proved them all wrong. Boris Johnson can do the same  Wading through the acid bath of hatred that the broadcast media poured over Boris Johnson’s election as leader brought on a vivid fit of déjà vu. His so-called policy on Brexit was absurd, his “bluster” (that was a word we heard a lot) was preposterous, the opposition to his position in Parliament was intractable and his stated goal was transparently unachievable. At one point, I heard a television news anchor (not on the BBC) say that a good many of the points Mr Johnson had made in his acceptance speech were likely to have been judged less than impressive before announcing – seriously, I am not making this up – a compilation tape of its weaker moments which presumably followed. (I can’t vouch for this since I changed the channel at that point.) Virtually everybody who appeared on the screen agreed: all of this phoney excitement was premised on a falsehood. What the incoming government was promising in terms of a new stance in our relations with the EU was either delusional or deliberately deceitful. The Brussels negotiators had already made it clear that there was no possibility of an alteration – under any circumstances – of the Withdrawal Agreement with specific reference to the Irish backstop provision which was, Leo Varadkar insisted, irreversible. Whatever the Johnson team might claim, their mission was impossible. 
JUL27	Why I rejected the offer of a Ministerial post in Boris Johnson's glittering new government	BoJo's mojo is catching, but I simply could not oversee a Potemkin department ever again 48 hours in, and Boris Johnson is already proving a fabulous Prime Minister.

JUL27	I thought I was above Love Island – turns out, I’m not	I didn’t want to watch Love Island. I didn’t want to watch Love Island for a multitude of reasons, chief among them the fact that it starts at 9pm, also known as my bedtime. I didn’t want to watch Love Island because to watch Love Island is to condone Love Island, and I didn’t want to condone a programme which is emotionally manipulative, which takes feelings and turns them into a game show. I didn’t want to watch Love Island because of the two people who had tragically taken their own lives, both of whom had previously appeared on the programme.
JUL27	Here's how Boris Johnson can use his popularity in the US to rebuild the Special Relationship	Boris Johnson’s premiership is a huge positive for Great Britain and the United States. In Washington, the news that he had won the Tory leadership race was warmly welcomed by the White House, and President Trump praised Britain’s new leader to rapturous applause in front of a conservative student conference. There is immense good will towards the new Prime Minister on this side of the Atlantic, and he is widely seen as a breath of fresh air after the stale Theresa May era. To Americans, Johnson is an exciting charismatic leader who wants to revitalise the Special Relationship. To say that May was unpopular with the present US Administration would be an understatement. She was viewed as hostile and unhelpful, as well as lacking any interest in cultivating the alliance with Washington. Johnson could be meeting with Donald Trump three times in his first 100 days: briefly in the US in August (but likely outside Washington), at the G7 Summit in Biarritz later in the month, and at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York in the final week of September. This sends the right message that Johnson is making strong relations with the US President a top priority. Downing Street must, however, add a fourth meeting to the schedule.
JUL27	To call the EU's bluff, Boris Johnson must grasp he is dealing with a bureaucratic psychopath	Great strategists are unpredictable strategists. So it has been exhilarating to watch Boris Johnson hurl the lightning bolts of shock-and-awe regime change through Britain’s May-grey political skies with such unexpected ruthlessness. Since becoming PM, he has surprised everyone from paranoid Brexiteers to complacent centrists by forming a serious no-deal Cabinet and bellowing for the “abolition” of the backstop from the despatch box. Of course, such unpredictability is anathema to homo bureaucratus, that snarling, slow-witted behemoth in Brussels that Mr Johnson must take on. True to form, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, responded to our new PM with the contemptuous raising of a single legalistic eyebrow; in a communiqué to EU members, he rejected our PM’s “combative” request for “unacceptable” concessions. Johnson’s strategy is ideal if he wants to leave without a deal on a wave of patriotism and resentment at EU intransigence. But it spells disaster if he hopes to call Brussels’ bluff. The “Boris hypothesis” seems to be that if we prepare seriously for no deal, the EU’s position will drastically shift. The story goes that greedy Brussels has overplayed its hand by drawing up such a debilitating contract, and that if we hold our nerve, member states will eventually pressure Brussels to crack.
JUL27	Sorry Stanley, there is such a thing as too much parental pride	Parents: they’re fonts of enduring support, no matter how many kippers you brandish or zipwires you get publicly entangled in. And they come no prouder than Stanley Johnson who, on his son’s ascension to political premiership this week, admitted to shedding a tear. So far, so typically pa. Where Johnson Sr has crossed the line of acceptable parental behaviour, however, is in his constant tuppence ha’penny worth-ing when it comes to his son’s work. Since Boris became Prime Minister on Wednesday, his dad has helpfully shared that our new leader will repair broken bridges with Iran “easy peasy” and that strong bonds will be formed with President Trump, as “they have the same hairstyle”.
JUL27	Sacred Mysteries: One man’s photographs of 9,000 rural churches	There’s an astonishing project in train, and I learnt of it on Twitter (the Devil’s rattle-bag). The aim is to photograph in detail every rural parish church in the country. If you visit a village in England, the church is likely to be the most beautiful and oldest building. Thousands of Telegraph readers share a love of church-crawling. There is plenty to see: of 16,000 Anglican churches, about 12,500 are listed as of architectural and historic interest by Historic England. This decade might be the one in which we see most churches in use and good condition. Many places cannot find the money to keep the rain out of their beloved churches. Some are put to secular use.
JUL28	I'm ready to make a US trade deal happen	Wednesday saw Britain turn the page to a new chapter of optimism and success. Our new Prime Minister embodies a nation with renewed self-confidence, one that’s not afraid to do things differently. And there couldn’t be a better example of that than trade. For too long, Britain has been tied to an inward-looking, protectionist EU bloc. When countries make it harder for products to come in from overseas, prices are kept high, which is bad for families trying to make ends meet. What’s more, other countries retaliate with high tariffs, making it harder for businesses to export and succeed. So as we leave the EU, we’re going to strike the free-trade deals that will open up new markets for our products, and give people access to a greater variety of goods and services from across the globe. I couldn’t be more delighted to have been made International Trade Secretary to drive forward that vital part of making Brexit a success.
JUL28	Leo Varadkar can blame Britain all he likes – but he is the real threat to peace	The Taoiseach's hardline stance on the backstop risks bringing back a hard border and destabilising the Good Friday Agreement He has backed himself into a corner. He doesn’t understand the Good Friday Agreement and he’s jeopardising the peace process. He’s risking a no-deal Brexit and a hard border on the island of Ireland. Yet Leo Varadkar attracts little criticism. He continues to defend his Brexit policy with a brave face but, like a poker player who has raised the stakes too high, he must surely feel his stomach churning as he contemplates the consequences of his gamble. When Varadkar became Taoiseach, back in 2017, the most pressing decision he faced was how to handle Brexit.
JUL28	When dawn breaks on November 1, what awaits the markets on the first day of no-deal Britain?	It is 6am, November 1 2019, and today is the day. Everyone is in the office early, prepped and ready to deal with all manner of contingencies. Some colleagues never went home. Last night’s statement from Prime Minister Johnson has been replaying across the global newscasts all night. Tick-tock: it’s the countdown to the all-important market opening at 8am and everyone is quiet with anticipation – even the doomsters, exhausted from weeks of shouting and fear mongering.  Does this scenario sound familiar? November 1 has been synonymous with doomsday of late; the threat of a no-deal Brexit debated in increasingly panicked tones. But hold the clock – we’re not quite there yet. 
JUL28	The People's Front of Extinction Rebellion points to a deeper divide within the Green cause	The Extinction Rebellion mob are the most visible example of what passes for political protest these days; the dialectics of dummy-spitting and scweaming and scweaming till you’re sick – more Violet Elizabeth than Vladimir Ilyich. This being so, I was delighted to find that they are already experiencing a People’s Front of Judea/Judean People’s Front moment with the splinter group XR Youth (motto: “Act Now, Do Homework Later”) interrupting an Extinction Rebellion meeting to demand that their elders drop plans to spoil people’s holidays by disrupting Heathrow with drones.  One of them, Robin Ellis-Cockcroft (aged 24 – swipe my shadow and call me Peter Pan!) said that the younger members had delivered a list of demands, a declaration, and a cake, telling this newspaper: “The planes might crash and people will be hurt.” He further objected to young people being excluded from positions of authority: “It’s become an organisation run by adults. We live in an adult world, made by adults for adults.” Of course, these youngsters have (suntanned) skin in the game when it comes to travel; a number of them have been accused of hypocrisy after boo-hooing about climate change while hopping on planes quicker then you can say “Instagram”. One of them, Robin Boardman-Pattinson (XR has more hyphens than the Almanach de Gotha), decreed “Air travel should only be used in emergencies” – despite having been on a number of skiing trips – while another, Zoe Jones, was shown in old photos on social media enjoying safari holidays in Uganda, boozing on the beach in New Zealand and bungee jumping over the Nile. That’s not a simple carbon footprint – that’s a carbon clown-shoe footprint.
JUL28	For Lefties, Boris’s new Cabinet represents the wrong kind of diversity	Last Tuesday, as Bojo was rocket-propelled into 10 Downing Street, my Left-wing chums went full melodrama with talk of black arm bands and the end being nigh. I can’t say I was thrilled either – I’ve never really trusted the man. Still, when Boris named his new cabinet, I looked with eagerness at my friends and associates to see if there mightn’t be just a tiny bit of grudging admiration amid the stormclouds. Boris had, after all, just appointed the most diverse cabinet in history and diversity is a cause to which most of them are vigorously committed. Almost one in five of the new cabinet are from ethnic minority backgrounds, so nobody can accuse him of tokenism. The new Chancellor, Sajid Javid, is the son of an immigrant Pakistani bus driver; the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, is the daughter of immigrant Ugandan Gujurati newsagents; Agra-born Salford graduate Alok Sharma is Development Secretary; and James Cleverly, the son of a Sierra Leonian immigrant, is Party Chair. Dominic Raab, foreign secretary, is the son of a Czech Jewish refugee.
JUL28	Decades of being soft on Iran has only emboldened the ayatollahs	Seizing another state’s vessel on the high seas is an aggressive act – arguably an act of war. Britain’s interception of American shipping in pursuit of its blockade against Napoleon, for example, led to the War of 1812, the burning of the White House and the Battle of New Orleans. So when Iran boarded a British-flagged tanker in the Straits of Hormuz this week, it was, at the very least, trampling on international norms and flouting maritime law.  The attack was evidently intended as retaliation for the detention of an Iranian vessel in Gibraltar – with the critical difference that the earlier seizure was carried out in Gibraltarian waters, was authorised by local law, and was ordered in pursuit of internationally recognised sanctions against Syria. Then again, the ayatollahs can hardly be blamed for trying their hand. From the moment they seized power in 1979, they have shown utter contempt for the accepted rules of national sovereignty, yet have paid little price.
JUL28	On my watch, the Treasury is ready to play a full role in delivering Brexit	In 95 days we will leave the EU. Of that there should be no doubt. Three years after the referendum, the countdown to delivering on the democratic will of the British people has well and truly begun. In three months’ time, we will be an independent nation once more. Free to set our own path to our own future. With the new Prime Minister, there is a new found optimism, and this, I believe, is also shared by the country. People are eager to get Brexit done – and that’s exactly what we are going to do. Yes, we want to leave with a good deal – one that abolishes the undemocratic backstop. That would be better for the UK, and better for the EU, and work is already underway to achieve this. As the Prime Minister said in his first speech in the House of Commons this week, we will approach these negotiations with the greatest energy and determination, and in the spirit of friendship, in the sincere hope and belief that the EU will reciprocate. But, we should not shy away from the fact that currently the EU is refusing to make any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. If they do not, we will of course have to leave the EU without a deal. If, for whatever reason, a better deal which our parliament will accept cannot be achieved, we must be – and are – prepared to leave on our own terms. Making sure Britain is prepared for no deal is the best way to get a great new deal.

Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach, and his deputy, Simon Coveney, reaffirmed their desire to be weaponised by Brussels in the EU’s determination to force a no-deal Brexit.  Meanwhile, at Lord’s, England and Ireland played their first test match. England were bowled out for 85 by lunch on day one, causing a small earthquake, before recovering to win the match. The sweltering ground teemed throughout with Englishmen and Irishmen joking with each other and enjoying a shared culture in which the English were no longer inevitably the masters. It made one wonder what all the fuss was about the backstop.
JUL29	Boris Johnson's strong no deal strategy sends a clear message to the EU	Early on in the Brexit process, the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis offered some advice to the UK government: do not negotiate with the EU. Greece did over the financial bail-out in 2015 and soon wished they hadn’t, he said. In his book Adults in the Room, published here not long after the 2017 general election, Varoufakis set out the anti-democratic, underhand and downright mendacious tactics used by the EU’s “deep establishment” to make the Greeks grovel. He predicted that, if the UK entered negotiations over Brexit, Brussels would seek to browbeat us in the same way and that we would do better just to walk away. Theresa May decided to stay at the table with the consequences we have all seen. Boris Johnson may or may not have read Mr Varoufakis’s book, but he has taken his message on board. The Prime Minister is letting it be known that he has no intention of engaging in talks with the EU ahead of the October 31 Brexit deadline unless they agree to negotiate an entirely new Withdrawal Agreement.
JUL29	Boris Johnson's greatest challenge is to deliver Brexit without breaking the Union	I will never forget campaigning for Boris Johnson when he first stood for parliament in North Wales in 1997, our designated photo opportunity being in the cab of the steam locomotive on the Llangollen Railway. Left alone by the train drivers to give photographers a clear shot, he and I suddenly realised we were in charge of an accelerating train with no idea of how to stop it. Thankfully, he has shown a clearer command of the levers of government in his first few days as Prime Minister than either of us had of the controls of a locomotive, and there is much for Conservatives to welcome irrespective of who we preferred as leader. First and foremost is his communication of a vision for the future of the country, and his identification of science, technology and environmental progress as fundamental aspects of that vision. For his opening sentences in the Commons to be about the country’s trajectory to 2050 was unusual, but it was also uplifting and correct.
JUL29	Putting a mini-golf course in a cathedral is an act of desecration	The Anglican leadership is making Christianity look ridiculous by turning cathedrals into fun fairs Emptiness can be rich with meaning. When the Romans captured Jerusalem in 63BC, or so says Tacitus, Pompey marched into the inner sanctum of the Jewish Temple and found it empty. No idols, no treasures, just God. To be in His presence was the greatest bounty. If Pompey besieged Rochester Cathedral today, what would he find inside? A miniature golf course. No joke. Located in the nave, this summer installation consists of nine holes with models of bridges – justified by the kind of silliness that parts of the Anglican Church have become famous for. “We hope,” says the Rev Canon Rachel Phillips, “while playing adventure golf, visitors will reflect on the bridges that need to be built in their own lives and in our world today.” Because contemplating the brotherhood of man is what we all do when playing mini-golf at the sea side. I believe Karl Marx composed Das Kapital at a Butlins in Skegness. No mean feat when trying to putt with one hand and eat a raspberry ripple with the other.
JUL29	Granny nannies need a holiday from the emotional blackmail of 'free' childcare	Grandparents are in demand during the Summer break, but at what cost? A new report has found that multi-generational holidays are on the rise “as parents de-stress by bringing older family members along to babysit”. Woah! How much of that sentence makes me want to punch the wall? It gets worse. The very appropriately named Stubborn Mule Travel declares that, “if you are paying [for the grandparent to come on holiday], then it’s generally acknowledged that mutually agreeable, free childcare comes part and parcel of this kind of multi-generational holiday”. Never mind that grandparents are, in my experience, the ones paying, they need to de-stress as much as the parents.
JUL29	There is no way Dominic Raab can be sure a no-deal Brexit would help us fix the backstop	Will it be ‘easier’ for the UK to get a deal with the EU after it leaves, as the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab claimed on Monday? In particular, he said that it would be ‘much easier’ to deal with the backstop issues than under the ‘undemocratic’ current arrangements. More generally, it would be easier to get a deal because the UK would be a non-EU country ‘less subject’ to the EU’s ‘demands and unilateral dictates’.  There are legal, political and economic elements to Raab’s claim. The legal issues are the clearest. At the moment, the withdrawal agreement is subject to Article 50 of the EU Treaty, which means qualified majority voting of member states and no need for ratification by their national parliaments.  After Brexit, it’s possible – but not certain – that a deal would need unanimous approval and/or national parliamentary ratification. That would depend on its content. For instance, an agreement only dealing with the movement of goods can still be approved by qualified majority and no national ratification. A treaty involving services might require unanimity, depending on the details. If the agreement included rules on aviation market access, or free movement of people for a transition period, then member states would have to ratify it, although sometimes the EU agrees to apply a treaty provisionally pending national ratification. 
JUL29	Ignore our London-centric political classes – cannabis legalisation is still a terrible idea	The Westminster bubble promotes drug liberalisation with little thought for those most affected by it London’s dinner parties have rarely been as united as they are around the cause of cannabis legalisation today.  The Adam Smith Institute, a free-market think tank based in Westminster, recently launched a pro-legalisation paper, alongside a gushing week-long campaign by the Evening Standard. Last month saw the creation of the Conservative Drug Policy Reform Group, also seeking to free the weed.
JUL29	The Duchess of Sussex's unabashed support for all things woke is fraught with risks	By aligning herself with the political Left, the Duchess threatens the Royal Family's neutrality Vogue's September cover, guest-edited by the Duchess of Sussex, was unveiled to much fanfare over the weekend. According to Vogue editor Edward Enninful, the Duchess believed that putting herself on the cover would be "too boastful" and has instead opted to feature a selection of female ‘change-makers’. But does her eagerness to flaunt her woke credentials amount to showing off by other means? The cover certainly goes to great efforts to jump through all the ethical hoops we have came to expect from public figures: Greta Thunberg ticks off climate change, Salma Hayek and Jane Fonda fly the flag for feminism; transgender actress Laverne Cox highlights the Duchess’s support for LGBTQ rights while models Adwoa Aboah and Adut Akech promote fashion diversity. It’s the perfect cocktail of political causes célèbres. With its symmetrical boxes and black and white images, the cover looks strikingly similar to a carefully curated Instagram feed.
JUL29	Unless we get Brexit, why should my fellow Brexiteer Scots stay in the United Kingdom?	As Prime Minister Boris Johnson visits Scotland today, sporting his new title of Minister for the Union and pledging to strengthen the ties between the United Kingdom’s four constituent parts, this is perhaps an opportune moment to consider a new and surprising threat to Scotland’s place in the UK. I find myself today contemplating a question that just a few years ago would have seemed unthinkable, as a pro-Brexit Scottish constitutional unionist with centre-right political leaning, and it is this:  If, as many pro-Remain Conservative and Unionist Party politicians at Westminster would seem to believe, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is no longer capable of standing on its own as an independent country outside the European Union with its own foreign, defence and trade policies, then what is the point of Great Britain? In recent weeks, Project Fear’s pro-Remain wing of the Conservative Party has surpassed itself in anticipation of a genuinely pro-Brexit government.  According to their latest bout of fear mongering, Mr Johnson’s determination to deliver Brexit by 31 October 2019 even if it means no-deal, threatens Scotland’s place in the Union.  Really! If pro-Remain Tory politicians want to see what currently threatens the UK’s constitutional integrity, they should look in a mirror.
JUL29	Leave Meghan's Vogue cover alone - you didn't bat an eyelid when Charles was a guest editor	The secret is out. Over the past seven months, the Duchess of Sussex has been guest-editing the September issue of Vogue. And now, naturally, she is being criticised for it. If one were to make a list of all the barbs that Meghan Markle has faced in the 14 months since her marriage to Prince Harry, there would probably be enough material to fill another issue of the fashion bible. This is just the latest stick with which to beat her. The September issue, entitled "Forces for Change", features 15 influential women on the front cover, from New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern to teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg. In the magazine, there is a candid interview with Michelle Obama, as well as promotion for grassroots organisations and charities. 
JUL29	Can Boris and Ursula seal the deal, or will they leave each other cold?	It’s going to take a very special kind of chemistry to resolve Britain’s relationship with Europe.  Do-or-Die Boris has promised his mates that he’s ending the affair and chucking the backstop. Vive-la-Europe Ursula is willing to give him time to change his mind, but only if he promises to obey her withdrawal method.  Both believe the other should foot the divorce bill.  Both believe the other is going to come crawling back.   In our hearts, we know there’s no chance of a reconciliation.  The lawyers have got involved, the language is hardening and there are 17.4 million reasons why the marriage is over.  But frosty relations after such an acrimonious split will be bad for both parties.  Too much water has passed under the bridge, the separation details remain unresolved.  It’s too late for conscious uncoupling, but can’t we still be best friends? That will depend on whether the two blond bombshells, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ursula Von der Leyen, the new President of the European Commission, can get past first base.  It seems an unlikely romance, but if it’s true that opposites attract, then there is hope.
JUL30	Facebook's encryption could stop our police doing their job properly - and I won't allow that to happen	We stand at an exciting but pivotal juncture for our nation. We have a fantastic opportunity ahead of us to change and strengthen our bonds with countries in Europe and around the globe. There is so much for the UK to be proud of – a world-class, modern economy and a free, fair and tolerant society. We are a global power, active and responsible on the world stage. This will never change. But the world around us is changing. It has become more volatile and competitive. Political and economic influence is undoubtedly more fluid than ever. Nowhere has this been starker than the rapid development of technology. Over the last decade, the technological landscape has transformed beyond all recognition.
JUL30	If the PM wants to save the Union, a radical new plan for a federal UK could be the answer	Tucked away in the Tate Gallery in London is a portrait of a magnificently bewigged 18th century politician, John Smith, Speaker of the Commons. He was one of the Commissioners charged with arranging the Union of the English and Scottish parliaments in 1707 and is shown by the artist Godfrey Kneller holding a scroll inscribed “The Union Act” which received the royal assent on March 6 that year. This was a big moment in the history of the two countries, well worthy of a fine painting to honour one of its architects. That this happened more than 300 years ago is testament to the resilience of the arrangement that Smith helped to broker. But the passage of time also suggests that it might need to be revisited if it is to survive. As he continues on his Grand Tour of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson will be followed by the taunt of the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford that he is “the last Prime Minister of the UK”. That is wishful thinking on Mr Blackford’s part; but keeping the Union intact is, as William Hague observed this week for the Telegraph, Mr Johnson’s greatest challenge as he prepares the country to leave the EU at the end of October. Nationalists across the UK see Brexit – especially a no-deal variety – as their best chance for secession.
JUL30	The Government needs to take back control of trade negotiations and realise Brexit's global potential	They must create a single, powerful team to set up global deals – and they must do it now The Prime Minister’s commitment to get the UK out of the European Union is clear and he has already developed political momentum at home. This is, of course, good news to those of us who both campaigned and voted to leave the EU and vital for the electoral health of the Tory party. But this is also a question of the integrity of our political system. I know many people who voted Remain who believe that a contract was made between Parliament and voters, and that it is a matter of duty for politicians to deliver on the result of the referendum. The Government remains bound by the commitments to leave the EU, including the single market and the customs union, that were made in the 2017 Conservative manifesto. And as it looks to the October 31 deadline, it will need to deal with some of the issues that have been put off for far too long.
JUL30	Why must victims of sexual violence live in fear of their attacker being released?	It isn't hard to imagine the relief felt by a woman when the man who attacked her is sent to prison. For many victims, however, the breathing space is all to short as a violent ex-partner or rapist is released back into the community - often without adequate notice or supervision. The extent of the problem has been highlighted this week by a no-nonsense report from the Chief Inspector of Prisons, which confirms that high-risk offenders are being released from a specialist prison without first spending time in an open prison or undergoing an up-to-date risk assessment by the probation service. Many people will be shocked to learn that this group includes sex offenders, who are being allowed to return to the community from HMP Ashfield in Gloucestershire, which has no facilities for resettling them. 
JUL30	Bringing back Foyle’s War would be a crime against creativity	The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there. When LP Hartley wrote that immortal opening to The Go-Between in 1953, he was ruminating on the nature of memory, not voicing his misgivings about a creative reboot of All Creatures Great and Small. But frankly his words have more chilling resonance than that time Tricky Woo almost died from a nasty case of flop bot. Or a relentlessly atmospheric episode of Foyle’s War, which has just been voted the most sadly-missed series on TV. Gone. But not forgotten. Still gone though, right? A fine programme if you like that sort of thing, although I’ve never been a huge fan of clumpy footwear and gravy browning legs. My husband enjoyed it. But please, let’s refrain from reviving it, not least because it’s all out there on repeat. If you scroll down your telly menu far enough, Foyle’s War continues to be fought on channels devoted to cheap – sorry, I mean, classic – scheduling, along with The Bill and Midsomer Murders. And that is surely the natural order of things?
JUL30	Carl Beech is the shameful symbol of an unjust state driven by political hysteria	Already reeling from the fallout of their botched investigation into the VIP child abuse scandal, the police have now suffered another savage blow to their reputation. In an almost unprecedented intervention, the former judge Sir Richard Henriques – who produced a scathing inquiry report in 2016 about official incompetence in this saga – declared that “the course of justice was perverted” by the police’s mishandling of false allegations made by serial fantasist Carl Beech against a host of distinguished figures, including former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, Labour peer Lord Janner, and former head of the armed forces Lord Brammall. Last Friday Beech was sentenced to 18 years for his crimes, but so far no police officer has even been disciplined. That must change, argued Sir Richard Henriques. “Criminal investigations should swiftly follow” he wrote, given that courts had been misled and warrants for raids had been “obtained unlawfully.” But how did the police make such a mess of this case, abandoning reason and the basic principles of justice? Why were they so desperate to give credence to Beech’s grotesque accusations? Part of the answer lies in the climate of profound concern over paedophilia that gripped this country in the wake of Jimmy Savile’s death in October 2011. Treated as a national treasure in his lifetime, Savile was exposed as one of the darkest predators Britain had ever known, perhaps responsible for more than 300 sexual assaults. 
JUL30	Diary of a reluctant MEP: With six weeks off, it's just like being at school	In his EU diary, direct from the heart of Brussels, Brexit Party MEP John Longworth reflects on the absurdities of life in the European Parliament  As the European Parliament breaks up for its long summer holiday, it's a good chance to reflect on how I ended up here. I will certainly have the time to do so. In fact, it feels a lot like the bucket and spade holidays of my childhood – the weeks stretching into the distance ahead seem endless. Deep into August the European beaches will likely still be teaming with MEPs and their thousands of flunkies. On the scale of eurocrat getaways, though, that barely registers as a long weekend. It is possible for officials in the European Commission to take sabbaticals of up to 10 years during which their pensions accrue as if they were still in post and then return to a guaranteed position on the same grade from which they left. Now that’s what I call a holiday! 
JUL30	It's time to quash the Remainer myth that 'nobody voted to leave without a deal'	It’s become commonplace in political debate and media discussions of no deal to assume and assert that during the EU referendum almost everyone assumed there’d be a “deal”. Earlier this week this claim was put to Dominic Raab in a Today Programme interview. Last night Newsnight had an entire debate based around this premise. But it simply isn’t true at all, and media commentators and politicians should not be allowed to claim, unchallenged, that it is. What does “no deal” mean? It means there will be no “Withdrawal Agreement”, that is to say, no new treaty with the EU covering the rights of EU citizens, the financial settlement, the Irish border, and a range of other issues including “non-regression” of social, environmental and labour legislation and “geographical indications” (eg “Scotch” or “Parma Ham”). So, did everyone assume there’d be such a Withdrawal Agreement Treaty during the EU Referendum? The answer’s pretty obviously no. Indeed, I’m not aware of a single interview by any prominent Leave campaigner predicting or promising that if we voted to leave the EU there’d be a Withdrawal Agreement treaty covering these or similar topics. I don’t know of a single Leave voter that assumed, at the time, that there’d be such a treaty and I think I can safely assert that not one of the 17.4 million people who voted to Leave the EU did so conditionally on the assumption that such a Withdrawal Agreement treaty would be made.
JUL30	Sorry Alastair Campbell, but there are far better reasons to leave Labour than its failure to back Remain	One of my biggest personal regrets of the last few years has been finding myself on the opposite side of the Brexit argument from people I have admired for many years, and still do. Chief among these, of course, is Tony Blair. But Alastair Campbell comes a close second. By the time I arrived in parliament in 2001, Blair’s chief spin doctor was, unbeknownst to everyone, including himself, coming to the end of his reign at Number 10. What many of New Labour’s critics failed to understand was that the reason so many of their attacks failed to hit home was because of the immense personal loyalty a lot of us felt, not just towards Tony but to those around him.  Alastair was a beneficiary of that devotion, often from anonymous back benchers like me, who could summon enough energy and determination, whenever necessary, to defend him and the team against all comers, whether they were the Conservative Party, the media, the Met or unhappy comrades in the Labour Party.
JUL30	One of the biggest Brexit prizes will be ditching the EU’s mindless precaution and innovation-crushing rules	We must enshrine an “innovation principle” to balance the precautionary one “Let’s start now to liberate the UK’s extraordinary bioscience sector from anti-genetic modification rules, and let’s develop the blight-resistant crops that will feed the world,” said Boris Johnson from the steps of 10 Downing Street. Britain was once the world leader in biotechnology for agriculture, but that all changed 20 years ago when the environmental movement led a successful campaign to scare people about it. The EU enthusiastically joined in the opposition to biotech crops, not by banning them but by strangling them in red tape. Since 2005, the EU has approved just one transgenic variety of crop for commercial use, a process that took 13 years, by which time the crop was outdated. Canada has approved 70 in that time.
JUL31	Harry and Meghan's Malthusian two-child pledge is no way to save the planet	In an interview in Vogue magazine, the Duke of Sussex has revived the debate about the burgeoning population by proposing to limit his family to two children. The pledge was made in the context of a discussion with Jane Goodall, the primatologist, about how the Earth’s resources and wildlife are being depleted. The Duke said his commitment to the planet had been strengthened by having a child, but he added: “Two maximum.” According to the most recent UN data, the world’s population is projected to grow by more than three billion people by the end of the century, increasing from 7.7 billion now to 10.9 billion. However, small changes in family size translate into a difference of several billion people. Just half a child less per couple on average would see the population peak well before 2100, before declining to 7.3 billion. None the less, the latest forecasts are a marginal improvement on previous projections.  
JUL31	Boris needs to channel Churchill, and take on the all-powerful housing monopolies	The big issue facing Britain, of course, is Brexit. Or is it? What millions of voters are really bothered about, whether the UK leaves the EU or not, is our chronic housing shortage. With politics in such flux, an election before Boris Johnson’s end-of-October Brexit deadline is entirely possible. But if the new Prime Minister doesn’t show signs of tackling our acute housing crisis – and soon – it’s an election he’s likely to lose. The average UK home now costs eight-times average earnings, over twice the historic norm. That crippling affordability multiple rises to 12-times across London and the South East. While house price rises have slowed, countless young adults, even well-paid professionals, are “priced-out”. Often spending half their income on rent, while enduring long commutes, their home ownership dream is slipping away. Back in the early 1990s, when I left university, 36 per cent of 16- to 24-year-olds owned their own home. Now it’s just 10 per cent. The share of 25- to 34-year-old owner-occupiers has plunged from 67 to 38 per cent over the same period. Well over half a generation is being denied the security of home-ownership at this crucial family-forming age. Some 78 per cent of 35- to 44-year-olds were homeowners in 1991, but just 56 per cent are now. The share of pensioner owner-occupiers has soared, but overall home-ownership has dropped from well over 70 per cent of UK households to around 60 per cent – below the EU average.
JUL31	Priti Patel is right. Tech giants cannot be allowed to put privacy above the safety of our children online	The new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has taken very little time to get her feet under the table before highlighting the online risks facing young people. We at the NSPCC think she is absolutely right to flag the growing risks of end-to-end encryption for online messages.   It will put children at greater risk of online abuse, and will make it harder – if not impossible – for social networks to prevent children being groomed. This is because it makes these messages inaccessible to law enforcement and to the social networks themselves.  This is not a theoretical debate. In recent months, Facebook announced that it intended to introduce end-to-end encryption across its messaging services. It’s happening. 
JUL31	Team Sussex has fallen prey to the wretched cult of eco-miserablism	How did we manage before virtue-signalling Royals? First came Prince Charles with his homeopathy and sporadic warnings of imminent environmental doom. Then royal sister-in-law Pippa Middleton added greatly to the gaiety of nations with her book on entertaining for special occasions, advancing such indispensable advice as “Flowers are a traditional Valentine's token, red roses are the classic symbol of romance” or “[Star-gazing] is best in pitch darkness on a very clear night".  But these delights pale in comparison with the extraordinary transformation of Prince Harry in recent years from louche spare to what one commentator described as “Harryward the Woke” - a born-again convert to the cause of virtue-signalling. His latest pronouncements, in the Vogue spread guest-edited by his wife, are a dramatic case in point.  The Duke of Sussex pledged to conservationist Jane Goodall that he and the Duchess will be limiting their family to "two children maximum”, for environmental reasons. “Surely, being as intelligent as we all are, or as evolved as we all are supposed to be,” he said, “we should be able to leave something better behind for the next generation.” He went on implicitly to accuse some of his subjects of quasi thought-crime, holding forth on the subconscious leanings that drive "racism". 
JUL31	It's a Remainer and Sinn Fein fantasy that Brexit will lead to a United Ireland	Irish unity has precious little to do with economics Never one to waste a crisis, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald is calling on the government in Dublin to appoint a minister tasked with getting ready for Irish unity. For those with long memories, there are definite echoes of Liberal leader, David Steel, telling his party conference in 1981 to “go back to your constituencies and prepare for government.”
JUL31	From jousting to Real Tennis, don't let gentlemanly sportmanship fall prey to the tyranny of VAR	What would Sir Lancelot say? Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology is being introduced even into that most chivalric and gentlemanly of sports, jousting – and in the heart of King Arthur country, Pendennis Castle in Cornwall. English Heritage is trialling a system during jousts there, like those used to monitor cheating footballers contesting goal-line decisions and petulant tennis players disputing line calls. (“You cannot be serious!”) I’m all for fairness, but jousting is a great medieval tradition where courtesy is key and the referee’s word is law. Why drag 21st century technology into a 14th century pursuit? No doubt we shall soon be rewriting Tennyson’s Idylls of the King and the stirring accounts of the ‘Last Great Battle in the West’ where Arthur’s uppity nephew, Modred, finally gets his comeuppance: “So all day long the noise of battle rolled / Amid the click of VAR machine…” I have spent happy hours watching jousting at Knebworth House, where dashing Lord Cobbold, a modern-day Lancelot to the tips of his gauntlets, would gallop out arrayed as ‘David of Knebworth’ to take on ‘The Black Knight’. Although banned from this thrilling sport in his mid-70s on the spurious grounds of age, he would abhor this newfangled approach as a slur on his honour. Neither he nor the other combatants would dream of claiming a bogus hit by subterfuge.
JUL31	The West has abandoned the people of Idlib to a murderous Assad and his jihadist enemies	As we sit in the blazing heat in the bizarrely tranquil rolling planes of Idlib, North-West Syria, just a few miles to our south in Maarat Numan, the Union of Syrian Medical Charities (UOSSM), which we support, is reporting up to 40 civilians killed in Russian and Syrian airstrikes. The Idlib Health Directorate, which we are working with on this trip, report 24 hospitals attacked in the last six weeks in this hell on earth.  Western governments seem to believe that the carnage is nearly over in Idlib, and that when it is Western millions will rebuild this shattered society. That may be the hope of mandarins sitting in ivory towers in Brussels, London and New York, but that is not the reality here at ground zero. It is far from over. The West doesn't fund hospitals in Idlib directly, only providing aid to those fortunate enough to have left Syria. And the situation could be about to get worse. The fear among the NGOs here on the ground is that the UN Humanitarian Chief, Mark Lowcock, a Brit, will carry out his threat to move humanitarian co-ordination from Jordan to Damascus. The NGOs all know that they get nothing from Damascus except "bombs and bullets" and that the aid will completely dry up – a bonkers proposal from every angle.
JUL31	The simple test that shows how few Brits are genuine Europhiles	Even the Remain portion of Britain has never really bought into the European Project How European are you? Here’s a simple test: ask yourself what counts as ‘we’. You probably have quite a few. A Glaswegian, for example, might use “we” to describe Glasgow, Scotland and possibly Britain. For me, “we” is my family, the city where I grew up (Birmingham), the town where I live now (Tunbridge Wells), my football team (West Bromwich Albion) and, without any doubt, my country (England). I also use “we” to describe the UK. All of those are important to me. So, they count as “we”. But I can’t recall using “we” to describe Europe. I am, undeniably, European, and right now, still live in the EU. I love visiting other European countries. France and Italy are particular favourites. Yet, I don’t feel a sense of belonging to Europe, still less to its Union. Simply, the EU fails my “we” test.
JUL31	Bought by Brussels, little Ireland's ridiculous leaders have landed it in a Brexit crisis	This is tough right now, being a proud and loyal British subject who has lived in, and loved, Ireland for more than 60 years. What is tough is watching the ridiculous behaviour of the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his foreign minister, Simon Coveney, trying to destroy, like wilful children, relations with an ancient and friendly neighbour. Whatever faults the British may have, they understand independence and freedom. I can understand why they mock the ridiculous behaviour of these two men. Varadkar and Coveney are both members of Fine Gael, a party that has its roots in the fight 100 years ago to secure independence and freedom for Ireland. Yet now here they are trying to block the UK’s path to the same independence and freedom. This is painful and embarrassing stuff.
JUL31	Dominic Cummings and Nigel Farage: the Brexit referendum rivalry that continues to rage	Nigel Farage has made clear he has yet to be convinced by Boris Johnson's efforts to win back Brexiteers, pouncing on his top aide Dominic Cummings as an "untrustworthy" official who was not a "true believer" in Brexit. 'He thinks we're all cretins and members of the lower order," the Brexit Party chief complained to the Times. "He has never liked me. He can't stand the ERG. I can't see him coming to any accommodation with anyone. He has huge personal enmity with the true believers in Brexit." Some readers may be surprised by Mr Farage's vitriol for the man who masterminded the official Brexit campaign. So it is worth dwelling on why there is such bad blood between both men.
AUG1	The 58 recycling symbols that shame us all	When I first saw the Rosetta Stone in the British Museum, I remember feeling awestruck at the clever minds who had pored over every mark and deciphered every letter to unlock the secrets of the ancient world. That would explain the overwhelming sense of déjà vu when I opened my Daily Telegraph yesterday and saw an entire news page detailing 58 recycling symbols that would surely unlock the secrets of our future world. They might, if the impenetrable signs made any sense to the lay person wondering what can and cannot be put into their kerbside collection. 
AUG1	Nothing exemplifies the BBC's complacency better than the departure of Moira Stuart	The elders of Radio 2 serve their listeners very well If it ain’t broke, the BBC will try to fix it. Never mind the problems that really do need solving: how to fund TV licences for the over-75s; the size of Gary Lineker’s salary; accusations of Brexit bias. In its infinite lack of wisdom, the corporation has decided that it must make young people listen to Radio 2. Thus nobody tried to keep Moira Stuart when, tired of being taken for granted by bosses, she handed in her notice at the end of last year and moved to Classic FM. They were too busy “refreshing” the schedule, spending untold amounts on the BBC Sounds app (so modern!) and launching Zoe Ball at breakfast. Who needed a 60-something like Stuart, when there are so many cool young voices out there?
AUG1	Mark Carney should be getting Britain ready for no-deal, not wallowing in Brexit gloom	Boris Johnson’s new Government is meeting every day to put in place plans for leaving the European Union without a deal. Major companies have started to prepare. The French have started thinking about what to do with all the trucks queuing up at Calais, and the Irish Republic has finally started to put together some ideas for its border with Ulster if the argument over the backstop isn’t resolved. Just about everyone is, quite rightly, war-gaming a no deal scenario. Except, it turns out, the one institution that will be among the most crucial. The Bank of England.  The Bank today managed to secure a few headlines with a re-hashed warning of a one-in-three chance of a recession if we crash out of the EU without any form of transition arrangement in three months' time. Maybe that will happen. Maybe it won’t. We will see. But at this critical moment, what the Bank should be doing is working out what it will do if that does happen.   Even by the fairly useless standards of its forecasts, the Bank was on particularly weak form with its latest round of predictions. In truth, it is virtually impossible to forecast what will occur if we leave the EU with no deal. No major developed economy has ever walked out of its main trade bloc before.
AUG1	Fighting for breath: how we can win the battle against childhood pneumonia	Most people reading this article will think of pneumonia as a threat to the lives of elderly people in rich countries. We invite you to think again. Today, pneumonia is the single biggest killer of children in developing countries - and it is time for the international community to come together and combat the disease Pneumonia claims the lives of more than 800,000 children every year, making it the biggest infectious killer of under-fives. Almost all these fatalities are preventable. Yet with relentless predictability, the death-toll continues – claiming more than 100 young lives every hour.  Most of the victims are less than two years old. Every death leaves grieving parents forced to watch helplessly as their children fight for breath against a disease that attacks their lungs and starves their bodies of oxygen. 
AUG1	No Deal has become a revenge tool in the stand-off between somewheres and anywheres	The intensity to which people want No Deal often reflects the intensity of their resentment towards the elite What does “No Deal” actually look like? Perhaps it's a little too late to be asking this question, but there's nothing like the distinct possibility of WTO terms in 91 days to focus minds. When I asked my Twitter followers, the most common responses were “it’s a fresh start” and “life will go on as it always will”. Will it, I wondered? Even as a journalist who follows politics closely, I struggle to picture the day-to-day reality. What will a trip to Sainsbury’s entail? What will paracetamol cost? Boris Johnson’s team is allegedly to spend £100m on a No Deal information blitz, but even they cannot foresee every banality.
AUG1	No Brexiteer will ever be 'pure' enough for Farage and his ERG tribute band	Some people just won’t take yes for an answer. Nigel Farage and his tribute band in the European Research Group (ERG) are a case in point. Farage has chosen to take aim at one of his favourite targets, Dominic Cummings, who ran the successful Vote Leave campaign three years ago. This is exactly the kind of playground politics for which Monty Python was invented: the People’s Front of Judea has accused the Judean People’s Front of betrayal. It is always thus when people whose entire identities are based on a single political cause, whether it’s Marxist revolution or Britain’s departure from the EU: they very quickly come to believe that they and they alone are the keepers of the flame, that they possess the definitive correct opinion and that anyone who differs from it is a heretic. Farage is particularly displeased with Cummings because not only was the latter, in Farage’s opinion, a Johnny-come-lately when it came to The Cause, the newly-appointed prime ministerial adviser actually won the campaign. And for that he will never be forgiven by the True Believers. I can’t help feeling that the Brexit Party leader’s latest public pronouncement – another rehash of “We wuz robbed!” – has its roots in his original criticism of Cummings back in 2016.
AUG1	Our woeful anti-terror laws leave us powerless to prosecute returning jihadists	Britain must work with the United States in helping the people of Eastern Syria get back on their feet Al-Hawl in Northern Syria is a secure refugee camp for the wives and children of Isil jihadists killed or captured by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Like Dante's First Circle of Hell, it acts as a kind of limbo - a place where people go to be forgotten. The 74,000 women and children held in the camp are not considered innocent enough to return home but nor are they deemed sinful enough to warrant the prison cells that hold the Isil men. After the fall of the so-called Islamic State in the dusty village of Baghous, the West was confronted by a vast number of captured foreign jihadists. More than 1,000 men and 11,000 women and children from across the world had to be processed by the SDF and then repatriated home - about 100 of whom are trying to get back to the UK.
AUG1	After Theresa May's deluge of leaks, Dominic Cummings is out to save Boris Johnson by plugging the dyke	Dominic Cummings wants everyone in government to know he will not tolerate any leaks, after telling ministerial advisers that anyone who improperly shares Cabinet papers will be fired under a "one strike policy". Aides were left in no doubt about the danger Boris Johnson's special adviser had outlined. "He was firm - if you leak you are gone," one told the Telegraph. Mr Cummings' words might seem harsh, but it is understandable given what the Prime Minister's predecessor had to put up with in office.
AUG1	To nail No Deal, this is what Chancellor Sajid Javid now needs to do	October 31 is approaching rapidly. Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced £2 billion more to “turbocharge” no deal planning. But what are the key economic preparations the government should be making? Let us think of five key areas: taxes, tariffs, trade deals. spending and regulations. First, taxes. If we leave with no deal there should then be an emergency budget (perhaps announced on November 1). The budget should cut various taxes, on a temporary basis, partly to offset the short-term impacts of no deal and partly to prefigure some longer-term structural changes in taxation to reflect the post-Brexit world. That could be done by a one-off one-year cut of £10 billion in each of corporation tax, VAT and employers’ national insurance (NI). That’s equivalent to cutting corporation tax by around five per cent, VAT by around 1½  per cent and employers’ NI by around 1¾ per cent.
AUG1	From Meghan to Greta, our 'woke' liberal elite is trapped in a backwards parallel universe	Among the most sanctimonious myths of our time is the one that, in a BBC gospel drawl, describes Leave voters as “left behind”. The lost souls of this country are, in fact, our bewildered liberal elite. Take the Duchess of Sussex’s decision to edit next month’s Vogue magazine. The act in itself is, of course, an egregious error: this metropolitan bible of gaunt aspiration, pored over with miserable reverence in hair salons across the nation, is one of Britain’s most retrograde luxury brands. But worse still is the edition’s cover, which celebrates 15 women who are “trailblazing change‑makers, united by their fearlessness in breaking barriers”. As suggested by the air-whipping rush of an empty blurb, the selection of females is depthlessly “woke”. It is an uncomfortable non-coincidence that most of the choices happen to be both ethnic minority models/actors/creatives, and mediocre “change-makers”. One can only deduce that this problem has arisen because the selections were made on the premise that achievement is uncompelling unless it can be adjectived by exotic origins (Somali female boxer; black ballerina) and comes with a marketable Instagram following. But the oddest thing about the cover is how it transports us, in a soft Californian hand clasp, to a strangely archaic parallel universe. In this ghoulish place – trapped somewhere between the King's Road during the Summer of Love of ’67 and the American Deep South – everyone is defined by their race, and fame-ravaged celebrities yearning for a spiritual calling are boundary-pushing “campaigners”.
AUG2	A justice system that allows an innocent man's reputation to be trashed is not fit for purpose	“Innocent until proved guilty” is – or was – one of the proudest legal doctrines of Western civilisation. It dates back to Roman law, and is particularly strong in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Why does it matter so much? I suggest two reasons. The first is about human nature. We are not always naturally fair. If we see a wrong done, we are often so angry that we wish to punish someone straightaway, without bothering to establish guilt. Society has to guard against that instinct. Otherwise, mob rule takes over. The second reason is about human dignity. If you do not presume a person is innocent, you presume he or she is guilty. If that is the way a society thinks, the authorities gain terrifying power over the individual. The burden of proof lies on him. If he faces hostility, that word “burden” is apposite. If you have to show you did not commit any crime of which anyone accuses you, how on earth do you do it? Following the conviction of Carl Beech (“Nick”), we have had fresh insight into the horrors of presuming guilt. Did you see the grainy film of Field Marshal Lord Bramall, then aged 91, being questioned by the police about whether he had abused and tortured boys, as “Nick” had alleged? He protests his amazement at the idea that “anybody should believe that someone of my career standing and integrity should be capable of any of these things”.
AUG2	Grief-stricken Remainers have unforgivably poisoned our politics with their Brexit despair	According to the Swiss-born psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, there are five stages of grief. They are – in chronological order – denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. If there is a reason why the last three years in British public life have been not just so tumultuous but so vicious, it is down to the simple fact that a portion of this country has not yet progressed to that final stage. Indeed, they seem nowhere near it. As a Leave voter I don’t blame them for the feeling of grief. I simply think they should have got over it. I had a tiny portion of the experience myself more than three years ago as I watched the early referendum results come in from Gibraltar and elsewhere. “Oh well,” I thought, as I ran a bath, “That’s a shame.” I was slightly glum that night. Morose even, as I prepared for an early bed. But at no point during those brief hours did I descend into a speckle-flecked rage. At no stage did it occur to me that I should call for the referendum to be recast or declared invalid. I did not start choosing to pretend that it was not clear what we had been voting for. Nor did I start to prepare a cull of my friends, cleansing from view all those who had voted Remain.
AUG2	The Reformation was the making of modern Britain. Brexit is a similar opportunity	In the early hours of June 24, just after the result of the referendum had been announced, I stepped out on to Lambeth Bridge. The sun was just rising over the city into a clear blue sky. I can still remember, as I basked in its early warmth, just how optimistic I felt. I allowed myself a smile as I thought how bright Britain’s future looked. Free at last after all those decades from the bureaucratic tyranny of the EU, I had no doubts that the UK would thrive. Sadly what instead followed was the aggressive and utterly negative attitude of some who voted Remain. Project Fear has continued relentlessly to describe its dystopian view of a post-Brexit UK. The Bank of England has yet again been carrying the torch for the “gloomsters”. That we now have a Government striking such an optimistic tone about our future and the opportunities of Brexit only made Mark Carney’s downbeat demeanour seem all the more remarkable. I am intrigued that despite the number of time our institutions have got their forecasts wrong (including, how they missed the banking crash in 2008) these fearful predictions just keep coming.
AUG2	The Brecon by-election proves the Tories must swallow their arrogance and do a pact with Farage	The Conservatives' pride and snobbery is endangering Brexit  The by-election result in Brecon & Radnorshire will be a disappointment to the Conservative Party but it can hardly be a surprise. It was predictable that the decision of the Brexit Party to field a candidate would deprive the Conservatives of a win. The Liberal Democrats won the seat taking 43.5 per cent of the vote and were undoubtedly significantly assisted by the fact that the Green Party and Plaid Cymru agreed not stand candidates in a so-called “Remain-alliance”. Had the Conservatives and the Brexit Party operated in a similar manner, given that their aggregated vote share totalled 49.5 per cent, it seems likely that the agreed ‘Leave’ candidate would have come out on top. 
AUG2	Myleene Klass's nude pregnancy selfie is a masterclass in insensitivity	Myleene Klass’s nude pregnancy selfie has gone viral, to the surprise of absolutely no-one. The 41-year-old, who is reportedly due to give birth any day now, posted a black and white picture of herself online, looking impossibly young and beautiful, with the caption: “Our bodies are incredible!” I can’t argue with that. Pregnancy is a bonafide miracle of nature, and as someone who’s also expecting, and currently feeling slightly like a big, sweaty hippo, I’m all in favour of celebrating the marathon that mothers to be endure.  Yet, despite being happy for Klass, the picture jarred with me. I’m fortunate enough to be having a baby, but know plenty of men and women who aren’t and wish they were - and having had a taste of that, I’d wager that for many, this picture will feel like a slap in the face.
AUG2	Giving prisoners the vote smacks of naive virtue-signalling	Crime is about to be dealt a killer blow, at least in Scotland. Recidivism rates are about to tumble north of the border, while our English neighbours, who continue to live in crime-infested swamps, can only look on with envious eyes. It has long been argued by penal reformers that giving prisoners the right to vote would restore to them a vital stake in their future. Others might point to the lack of community support for ex-prisoners, the handing down of short custodial sentences rather than more appropriate community-based punishments and the lack of employment opportunities afforded to them when they are finally given their freedom back, as the primary reasons for returning to a life of crime. But no, it’s the injustice of being prevented from voting for their local councillor that is the prime motivation behind career criminals’ self-destructive tendencies, apparently.
AUG2	The Boris Bounce is real, but the lesson from Brecon is: 'Vote Farage, Get Swinson'	The circumstances were particularly propitious. The outcome had long been anticipated. The margin of victory was relatively narrow. Yet that does not mean we should regard the Liberal Democrats’ success in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, only their second such victory in 13 years, as simply a little local triumph. Brecon has been a bastion of Liberal Democrat strength ever since the party successfully, if narrowly, captured the seat in a previous by-election in 1985. It held the seat, albeit often only narrowly, for all but five of the subsequent 30 years. The local Liberal Democrat AM, Kirsty Williams, has hung on to the equivalent Welsh Assembly seat for all of the last 20 years. Meanwhile, the party was helped by the decision of both Plaid Cymru and the Greens not to fight the seat. True, on past form, both parties could well have lost their deposits anyway, but their decision helped the Liberal Democrats present themselves as the principal advocates of the anti-Brexit cause. At the same time, Labour voters in the constituency have long demonstrated a willingness to back the Liberal Democrats in order to help defeat the Conservatives locally.
AUG2	Now's the time to finally get freeports right and reinvigorate the British economy	Hear the word freeport, and Pirates of the Caribbean might come to mind: loose morals, swashbuckling pirates and all the rum you want without any of the tax. The truth is a little more urbane but no less transformational. Freeports are areas where the world can come together to buy and sell their wares, without customs cosying their way in before trade is finished. Bureaucrats may have strangled the idea before, but this government is bringing the idea back into vogue. The concept of freeports is not a bolt out of the blue; this policy has been kicking around Westminster for a while. Only now – with Theresa May’s miserable managerialism replaced by Boris Johnson’s bold bounteous belief in the power of ideas steeped in liberty – are such proposals coming into the light. Here’s how freeports work: take a bit of land near a port or airport and treat it as if it were a foreign country as far as import/export trade is concerned. So, people can fly or ship in goods from abroad, store, consolidate, process, assemble, package or label them in the freeport, and fly or ship them out again. All this with no import tariffs, no VAT or any other taxes, and no paperwork when the goods leave. All plain and simple for the importers and exporters, and a nice generator of jobs, enterprise and investment for the local community.
AUG2	Mark Francois is demonstrating to the EU that the Tory Party has its own non-negotiable backstop	Having known him for a quarter of a century, having fought adjoining hopeless Labour seats in London in the Tories’ annus miserabilis in 1997, you’d be hard pressed not to select Mark Francois, the pugnacious Rt Hon Member for Rayleigh and Wickford, if you had to choose an MP to stand at your shoulder in the most vicious political firefight. Often mocked on social media by the sneering knee jerk Left and Remain EU cultists for his shoot from the hip, uncompromising style, Francois is nevertheless a rare thing in the Commons: A former Defence Minister and Opposition Spokesman on Europe, who battled the Labour Government’s subterfuge and duplicity on the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 and who actually understands how the European Union works, he is also also a man who - unfashionably – is imbued with ideological principle. He has the capacity to connect with ordinary voters and the courage to resile from the lazy communitaire received wisdom of the liberal Europhile classes who inhabit too much of the commanding heights of public discourse across the media, business, government and academia and to stick to a firm line, irrespective of the consequences.   History will record that he was among 28 so called “Spartans” who helped sink for a third time Theresa May’s pitiful Withdrawal Agreement on March 29 and in so doing, despite huge pressure from the whips and the Conservative Party machine, rescued the UK from perpetual supplication, economic stagnation and national humiliation as a de facto colony of whatever geopolitical behemoth the European Union is likely to become.
AUG2	Winning the cyber war is not a job the Army can do alone	Britain has not been legally at war since 1945. Despite this, we have been in perpetual conflict since then and, apart from 1969, have lost soldiers on operations every single year. Today the sphere of that conflict now very much includes the online world where our adversaries – from Russian disinformation disseminators to Isil’s terrorist cyber warriors – are a shadowy, but perpetual threat. In this increasingly antagonistic world, we must organise ourselves accordingly.  The attempt to rebalance the Army’s capabilites with the formation of 6 Division, a new unit giving weight and emphasis to cyber skills, is vital to fighting an information war that has already been waged against us by our enemies for a number of years. However, there are still challenges for the government, and how it responds to these will be crucial.  The first is how to coordinate UK efforts in cyberspace to ensure that their scope is suitably wide-ranging and that they are utilising the necessary breadth of personnel. Back in 2008, the first National Security Strategy produced under Gordon Brown stated that the challenges of modern conflict were beyond the capability of any single government department; what was required was a “comprehensive approach” across Whitehall. 
AUG3	Sacred Mysteries: St Peter’s relics given away to Constantinople	On the great patronal feast of Rome, Sts Peter and Paul, on June 29 this year, a delegation was at the Vatican sent by Bartholomew, the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, After Mass, Pope Francis accompanied Archbishop Job of Telmessos to the crypt beneath the high altar to pray before the relics of St Peter venerated there. Archbishop Job is a brilliant scholar, Canadian by upbringing and Ukrainian Orthodox by belief. The Pope asked him to wait as he had a present for his “brother” Bartholomew, The two drove in the Pope’s little blue Ford Focus to the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, which is where the Pope decided at the beginning of his reign not to live. There Pope Francis took a reliquary put there by Pope Paul VI (reigned 1963-78) and gave it to him.
AUG3	Harry and Meghan are talking nonsense: we'll soon be fretting about the falling population	The timing was unfortunate. The day after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex let it be known that, for environmental reasons, they would have no more than two children, the Office for National Statistics revealed that the birth rate in England and Wales had plummeted by ten per cent since 2010. In order to remain the same size, a population needs 2.1 live births per woman. In England and Wales, that number has fallen to 1.7, down from 1.8 the previous year. There is a perception lag when it comes to human population. Most people believe that the world is being choked by the viral spread of our species. Green politicians openly tell us that having children is a selfish act. You can spend an entire lifetime, they say, avoiding flights and car journeys, meticulously reusing and recycling, growing your own vegetables; but have one kid and all that conscientious behaviour is wiped out. Yet the counter-intuitive truth is that we are heading, sooner or later, for depopulation. Demographers disagree about when it will come, but almost all accept that it will happen during this century. A major study by Deutsche Bank suggests that the global population will reach 8.7 billion in 2055, before dropping back to 8 billion by the end of the century. The United Nations thinks the peak will be 11.5 billion – though it has a long history of overestimating population growth. Some outlying studies claim as much as 14 billion. But all agree that a peak is coming.
AUG3	It's time to stop blaming the elderly for the housing crisis	Who else is tired of the bitter little lie that the housing affordability crisis is all the fault of older people? Nestled in their overly-large homes, the argument goes, they oppose development while enjoying the “unearned” fruits of extreme house price growth. They don’t even plan to pass much of this on to their children, blowing it on cruises, golf club memberships, and the other delights of an early retirement. The generations are at war: lazy Marxist millennials versus complacent capitalist baby-boomers. And it’s all complete nonsense. Here are some facts. The Bank of Mum and Dad is now effectively the eleventh largest mortgage lender in the UK, according to Legal & General, and will generously help fund one in five home purchases this year.
AUG3	How dare Meghan tell us to be kind and help other people - send her to the Tower!	When I first heard the word ‘woke’ it made me want to ‘boke’, which is Scottish slang for vomit, of course. My objections to ‘woke’ – which means to be alert to social injustice – were purely grammatical (what, exactly, is so wrong with being awake?). But as I’ve watched the word be spat out of sneering mouths as a way to deride someone who cares about things that the sneerer doesn’t, I’ve come to feel strangely protective towards it – affectionate, even. Is being ‘woke’ really the worst thing in the world, when the world is, in part, run by a man who thinks it’s perfectly OK to grab ladies by their genitals or tell women of colour to “go back to where you came from”? Forgive me for bringing up the genital grabbing again and again and again, but I grew up in a world where groping a woman without her consent was sort of considered normal – it wasn’t particularly nice, and I don’t want it for my own daughter.
AUG3	We need radical action to reform our basket-case university funding system	Too big to fail institutions, widespread mis-selling, bailouts, privatised profits, socialised losses and huge bonuses despite poor performance. Sound familiar? No, not the causes of the financial crash – but the current state of higher education. To misquote literature’s most famous student, something is rotten in our university system. New Labour’s aim to crowbar half our young into university has backfired spectacularly, as has the naive assumption that the value of degrees would stay the same regardless of the numbers flooding the market. Like the homeowners flogged subprime mortgages in the noughties, a generation has been sold a fraud; many students are disillusioned and the system is creaking under the weight of debt. Vice chancellors still receive eye-watering payouts, despite heading failing universities. Just as taxpayer-funded bailouts “socialised” financial crisis losses, an estimated three-quarters of graduates will never fully repay their loans, with the remainder “forgiven” (i.e. covered by the taxpayer). Doubly unfairly, extortionate interest rates mean that high-earning graduates subsidise peers choosing “Mickey Mouse” degrees.
AUG3	At last, a way Boris Johnson can solve Brexit... and keep everyone happy	It’s incredible. It’s stupendous. It’s mind-blowing. Get the Prime Minister on the line at once. I need to tell him the good news. He’ll be ecstatic when he hears it. He’ll be hooting, he’ll be dancing, he’ll be weeping with joy. Because, after three years of misery and frustration, I’ve done it. I’ve actually done it. I’ve solved Brexit. Genuinely. I have. And as it turns out, it’s really quite simple. All we need to do is this.

AUG4	Will future generations really be poorer for the lack of a high street?	We tell ourselves stories in order to live,” wrote Joan Didion, suggesting (among other things) that humans are given to interpreting the chaotic present through the selective prism of the past. Our sense of who we are now depends to a great extent on who we were then – which can be any time from our own childhood to some long-distant event in our national history. The more uncertain the times, the more potent the charm of the past, and the more plangent the sense of what has been lost (it is the defining essence of nostalgia that it reimagines the past, not just as another country, but as a merrier, more sunlit and picturesque one. No one ever looks back with longing to the dear old days of smallpox, atrocious dentistry and non-existent mains drainage.). Recently a couple of intriguing new mutations have appeared: nostalgia for what you have never known, and vicarious nostalgia. A survey of 2,000 primary schoolchildren found that a third had never visited a traditional high street shop, while a quarter didn’t know what a high street was; yet three-quarters claimed that they would rather visit a “real” shop than buy online.
AUG4	I'd rather be a tat-loving tourist than a traveller on holiday	I nearly choked on my preprandial Slippery Nipple when I read that British holidaymakers – that monstrous regiment of boozers, brawlers and bangers regarded with shock and awe from the alleyways of Amsterdam to the beaches of the Costa Blanca – are becoming shy. A recent survey found that nearly a third of Britons balk at asking for a Slow Comfortable Screw or Sex On The Beach for fear of causing offence to foreign bartenders. Worse, British tourists have gone woke – 29 per cent had a problem with wearing indigenous clothing. Before long even getting a suntan will be seen as cultural appropriation and we’ll come back from foreign climes paler than we set out. Some of the results say something sweet about us, though; one in three thinks that talking only in English to locals is unacceptable and one in four suffers actual guilt over it. It’s a beach ball of confusion, and part of the discombobulation comes from the fact that lots of people these days don’t want to be tourists; they want to be  travellers. Airbnb is to blame for a lot of this posturing, with its monumentally presumptuous slogan “Live Like A Local”. Though only 19 per cent of us may be civilised enough not to haggle, favouring private homes over commercial hotels is a much more far-reaching way of doing over the natives, raising property prices and certifying that the offspring of said locals will find it difficult to stay in their city-centre neighbourhoods. It’s surely no accident that much of the anti-tourist sentiment in cities such as Dubrovnik and Lisbon has grown with the ascendance of Airbnb; in Barcelona a tourist bus had its tyres slashed and windows spray-painted while the sightseers cowered inside.  Tourists are far more user-friendly than travellers, stashed neatly away in hotels, providing steady work for a vast number of locals and leaving neighbourhoods as real communities as opposed to handy roosting posts for birds of passage on a bender. Far from being arrogant, acting like an honest-to-goodness tourist is an enlightened and gracious admission of ignorance; I like puzzling over old-fashioned maps in the street and tipping big like a fresh-off-the-boat rube just begging to be taken advantage of. It’s all part of the respect we pay for trampling over other peoples hometowns. Some self-deluded souls seem to think that if you call yourself a traveller rather than a tourist, locals will like you more. But we tourists don’t scrounge in the streets whereas travellers increasingly do, as seen in the rise of the gap-year “beg-packers” currently passing off pampered entitlement as roughing it  to the understandable disgust of many citizens of south-east Asia.
AUG4	The day I was mauled by Britain’s misguided dog owners	Last week, while swimming on Hampstead Heath, I overheard two fellow swimmers talking seriously about not seeing any “drowning today”. Drowning? I hadn’t heard of anyone drowning. I continued listening, concerned. A minute later it became clear they were actually talking about wasps. That’s right. Wasps. They had not seen any wasps drown that day on their swim. To be clear, I’m (almost) used to hearing people speak in grave tones about the “mood”, “personality” and dietary preferences of Ludo, Sprinkles and Daisypop, their dogs. I recently heard two mothers at the pond talking about their pups.
AUG4	We cannot trust AI to give us 'fairness' – yet we are beginning to treat computers as little gods	It is not, at first glance, what you would call a miscarriage of justice. You’ve been waiting at a bar for over 10 minutes. All around you people are shouting for attention as the bartender glides back and forth, as capricious as a Greek god. You watch them bestow their favour on those who arrived long after you, chatting for what seems like an aeon. And you wonder: what makes them more deserving than you? Small beer it may be, but this is a matter of justice – of the fair apportionment of goods, rights and privileges. Most people would probably agree that every bar customer has an equal right to be served. We would also agree that this right can be revoked for the under-age and the excessively drunk. We might differ as to what qualifies one person to be served before another, but we probably all think there should be a system for it. Which is what makes Thursday’s announcement from DataSparQ, a British technology company, so interesting. DataSparQ claims that the average British drinker spends over two months of their life waiting at a bar, so it has developed a face recognition system which tracks customers, assigns them a place in a virtual queue and lets bar staff know who to serve first – as well as spotting people who look under-25.
AUG4	The Tories must form an electoral pact with the Brexit Party – or else they risk being annihilated	After the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, one thing is very clear: the two-party political system has failed this country. Friday’s results showed just how much electoral trouble both the Conservatives and Labour are now in.  Labour almost lost their deposit, coming fourth, only just ahead of the Monster Raving Loony Party. That this could happen in Wales, a bastion of Labour support for a century, is extraordinary.  The Tories had the arrogance to field the same candidate whose recall by constituents for wrongdoing caused the by-election in the first place. It’s hardly surprising that he blew an 8,000-vote majority. 
AUG4	Trump has turned American politics inside out – as we'll see in the next election	At this stage in the last electoral cycle, Donald Trump was being dismissed as a joke. He had entered the Republican primaries in June 2015, and had taken a lead in the opinion polls by mid-July. But almost every pundit was still writing him off as an oaf – loud, obnoxious and utterly unelectable. Like previous celebrity newcomers, he would strut and fret his hour, but there was (all right-minded people agreed) no chance at all that he would win the primaries, let alone the presidency. Four years on, those assumptions have been turned on their heads. Now, most commentators take it for granted that Trump will be re-elected. With a booming economy and an opposition that seems simultaneously weak, woke and wacky, he is regarded as a shoe-in. The change in tone reflects the way in which Trump has turned American politics inside out. The Republican Party has been refashioned into an altogether more protectionist, nativist and isolationist movement. Conservative commentators who, only a couple of years ago, were denouncing Trump as an interloper who had come late and malevolently to their side are now cheering him as he expands the powers of the presidency and the size of the federal government.
AUG4	Sacred Mysteries: St Peter’s relics given away to Constantinople	On the great patronal feast of Rome, Sts Peter and Paul, on June 29 this year, a delegation was at the Vatican sent by Bartholomew, the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, After Mass, Pope Francis accompanied Archbishop Job of Telmessos to the crypt beneath the high altar to pray before the relics of St Peter venerated there. Archbishop Job is a brilliant scholar, Canadian by upbringing and Ukrainian Orthodox by belief. The Pope asked him to wait as he had a present for his “brother” Bartholomew, The two drove in the Pope’s little blue Ford Focus to the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, which is where the Pope decided at the beginning of his reign not to live. There Pope Francis took a reliquary put there by Pope Paul VI (reigned 1963-78) and gave it to him.
AUG4	Harry and Meghan are talking nonsense: we'll soon be fretting about the falling population	The timing was unfortunate. The day after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex let it be known that, for environmental reasons, they would have no more than two children, the Office for National Statistics revealed that the birth rate in England and Wales had plummeted by ten per cent since 2010. In order to remain the same size, a population needs 2.1 live births per woman. In England and Wales, that number has fallen to 1.7, down from 1.8 the previous year. There is a perception lag when it comes to human population. Most people believe that the world is being choked by the viral spread of our species. Green politicians openly tell us that having children is a selfish act. You can spend an entire lifetime, they say, avoiding flights and car journeys, meticulously reusing and recycling, growing your own vegetables; but have one kid and all that conscientious behaviour is wiped out. Yet the counter-intuitive truth is that we are heading, sooner or later, for depopulation. Demographers disagree about when it will come, but almost all accept that it will happen during this century. A major study by Deutsche Bank suggests that the global population will reach 8.7 billion in 2055, before dropping back to 8 billion by the end of the century. The United Nations thinks the peak will be 11.5 billion – though it has a long history of overestimating population growth. Some outlying studies claim as much as 14 billion. But all agree that a peak is coming.
AUG4	It's time to stop blaming the elderly for the housing crisis	Who else is tired of the bitter little lie that the housing affordability crisis is all the fault of older people? Nestled in their overly-large homes, the argument goes, they oppose development while enjoying the “unearned” fruits of extreme house price growth. They don’t even plan to pass much of this on to their children, blowing it on cruises, golf club memberships, and the other delights of an early retirement. The generations are at war: lazy Marxist millennials versus complacent capitalist baby-boomers. And it’s all complete nonsense. Here are some facts. The Bank of Mum and Dad is now effectively the eleventh largest mortgage lender in the UK, according to Legal & General, and will generously help fund one in five home purchases this year.
AUG4	How dare Meghan tell us to be kind and help other people - send her to the Tower!	When I first heard the word ‘woke’ it made me want to ‘boke’, which is Scottish slang for vomit, of course. My objections to ‘woke’ – which means to be alert to social injustice – were purely grammatical (what, exactly, is so wrong with being awake?). But as I’ve watched the word be spat out of sneering mouths as a way to deride someone who cares about things that the sneerer doesn’t, I’ve come to feel strangely protective towards it – affectionate, even. Is being ‘woke’ really the worst thing in the world, when the world is, in part, run by a man who thinks it’s perfectly OK to grab ladies by their genitals or tell women of colour to “go back to where you came from”? Forgive me for bringing up the genital grabbing again and again and again, but I grew up in a world where groping a woman without her consent was sort of considered normal – it wasn’t particularly nice, and I don’t want it for my own daughter.
AUG5	Britain should open its doors to the brilliant, the skilled and the bright	Whether you are for or against Brexit, it is important to recognise that there is one undoubted and unambiguous advantage of it: that the UK will be able to determine its own attitude to immigration. The Government will, provided it runs an efficient system of border checks, decide who comes to this country, why they are allowed in, and when they have to leave. Of all the reasons deployed in the 2016 referendum for voting Leave, this was the most powerful, and perhaps had the most justification. Europe will be fortunate indeed if it avoids a far more dramatic migration crisis in the years to come than anything seen to date, and when that happens the UK will have the advantage of being able to control its own frontiers. Yet it is crucial that this new power is seen not as a defensive measure and a chance to pull up the drawbridge, but as an opportunity to bring in the brilliant scientists, engineers, medical researchers, software writers and industrial innovators of the future. This is the way to define leaving the EU as global in its motivation rather than insular, internationalist not narrow, based on the needs of the future instead of an attachment to the past.
AUG5	What could be prettier and more cheering than an explosion of butterflies?	One of my earliest memories is of my gentle grandfather, head gardener at a boy’s prep school, taking me by the hand to look at the large buddleia that grew just outside his walled vegetable garden, which kept 120 pupils in greens. Instead of the familiar intense lilac, the bush was a jewelled riot of colour and, as we drew closer, I could see it was smothered with feasting butterflies. It was a vision straight out of Faerie: the hues shimmering and changing with the opening and closing of the magic creatures’ wings. Looking back, my entire childhood seemed filled with butterflies: trapped Red Admirals beating against the windows of my parents’ pub in Kent, requiring careful capture with a half-pint glass and beer mat slid under the rim. Or picnics on the hills above the villages of Shoreham and Eynsford in the Darent Valley, where delicate Chalk Hill blues could be caught, if nimble, with bare hands. That glorious abundance withered away in adult life. Butterflies are the early warning system of ecological change, sensitive to pesticides, urban sprawl, mild winters, loss of wild flowers and general changes in the environment. The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme has recorded long-term decline in almost two thirds of our native species since records began in 1976. But – hallelujah! – this summer is expected to mark a bumper year for flutterbies, after a strong showing last year.
AUG5	Message discipline matters. That's why Boris must immediately revive the neglected 'Global Britain' mantra	Deployed continuously, the use of certain phrases can have a tremendous impact Language in politics matters - especially when it comes from the Prime Minister, senior advisers or Cabinet members. At its clearest, it sets the tone for government, Whitehall and broader business, as Boris Johnson’s optimistic rallying cry of "Dude!" proved during his acceptance speech as Conservative leader. Or take Dominic Cummings’s uncompromising approach to no-deal, telling Ministers and officials that the Government would honour the October 31 pledge even if Remain opponents succeed in forcing a general election. Deployed continuously, the use of certain phrases can have a tremendous impact. Tony Blair's "Third Way" or David Cameron's "long-term economic plan" are obvious examples, not to mention Vote Leave's powerful referendum slogan 'Vote Leave, take back control'. But so too can dropping certain phrases send the government, Whitehall, the press and others in a wildly different direction. Just think how quickly Cameron’s poorly-communicated “Big Society” fell out of mainstream use, and public favour.
AUG5	America has a serious problem with angry white men - but the warning signs are being missed	Few people would deny that America has a gun problem. Last weekend there were two mass shootings, in Texas and Ohio, which left 29 people dead and dozens injured. They have prompted another row about the easy availability of lethal weapons and the reluctance of prominent politicians, including President Donald Trump, to do anything about it. What isn't so obvious, to mainstream commentators at least, is that the root cause of the problem is toxic masculinity. There have been 251 mass shootings in the US this year alone, according to the Gun Violence Archive, and we know a great deal about the men who carry them out.  Every time it happens, I wait for the same predictable stories to emerge - a history filled with rage against women, immigrants, Jews or Muslims, often expressed in alarming posts on the internet. These men are angry and they don't try to hide it; seeking out similarly-minded individuals online and sharing hate-filled conspiracy theories. 
AUG5	Bold reforms - not lazy cash injections - will save our politicised, chaotic NHS	Sensible discussions are impossible while we pretend the NHS and the US are the only two systems in the world One of my favourite platitudes about the NHS is that politicians should refrain from turning it into “a political football”. Healthcare is a matter of life or death, which is why the national health service should be “above politics”. Let’s focus on what works, they say, and “take the politics out of it”! You might as well ask a zebra to stop being striped. As long as healthcare is delivered by a national quasi-monopoly, every major healthcare-related decision is a political decision. You cannot “depoliticise” something that is inherently political.
AUG5	Labour MPs are fatally distracted by internal party squabbles as a general election edges closer	It is perhaps no bad thing that many of the Labour Party’s new recruits over the last few years have been young people with no real experience or knowledge of politics. Jaded cynicism might be more appropriate in the era of Corbyn, Johnson and Trump, but it doesn’t really get us anywhere. Still, when modern UK politics gives you little to smile about, it was refreshing to see, over the weekend, an interview with Laura Parker, who is the national co-ordinator for Momentum, Corbyn’s Left-wing shock troops. Speaking excitedly about what the organisation hopes will be a rout of sitting Labour MPs as they submit themselves for reselection (or not) as Labour candidates, Parker said: “Some members are demanding [trigger ballots] in seats where they don’t even have Labour MPs and have to be reminded that first they need to help elect a Labour MP and then they can worry about deselecting them.” Trigger ballots are unique to Labour and were introduced in the 1990s as a way of honouring the party’s commitment to keeping sitting MPs accountable to the membership while at the same time making it more difficult to get rid of them – a very New Labour reform. Previously, sitting MPs had been obliged to fight a full, open selection once every parliamentary term against all comers who fancied their chances.
AUG5	Incomprehensible, jargon-filled adultese plagues government communication. I should know...	I read thousands of letters of complaint from parents about schools during a recent job with the Civil Service. Our team’s task was to lift approved lines from policy documents and shape them into useful responses. It was what, in Politics and the English Language, Orwell called “gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable”. What was almost universal in the letters we received and in the material on which we based our responses was a certain type of language.  This jargon was not of the extreme kind found a generation ago, as in the draft National Minimum Wage Regulations of 1998, which explained: “The hours of non-hours work worked by a worker in a pay reference period shall be the total of the number of hours spent by him during the pay reference period in carrying out the duties required of him under his contract to do non-hours work.”
AUG5	Forget Brexit – the Tories need to focus on prisons, hospitals and the police to win votes	I am always fascinated by by-election results, especially when they follow some tumultuous event in politics or our national life. By that token the Brecon and Radnorshire by election last week was indeed fascinating. The sitting Tory member had been unseated by a constituency referendum over a wrongly made claim for expenses.    His local Conservative Association stood by him and he stood for re-election, which could hardly have attracted that many doubtful voters, especially as, if they were Brexiteers, they had the choice of a Brexit Party candidate (or even a Ukip one) to vote for.
AUG5	From Trinny and Susannah to Donald Trump, reality TV has ushered in an age of spite	MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and sport select committee are asking how reality TV became so spiteful that two Love Island contestants, and one participant of the cancelled Jeremy Kyle Show, are dead.  Of course it is too late to mourn the death of courtesy – and empathy – in public discourse; this is, in every sense, a post-mortem. Those same MPs may walk a gauntlet of screams as they go to work. Disagreement without rancour has become archaic, even semi-mythical.   The MPs heard a submission called Belligerent Broadcasting from the academics Angela Smith and Michael Higgins (who I name to be polite). They named Trinny Woodhall and Susannah Constantine, two semi-parodic Sloane Rangers who like cashmere neutrals, as one of the root causes of this madness: because of their show What Not To Wear (2001-2007), which I remember chiefly as Trinny and Susannah looking sadly at people’s batwings, and then styling them so they looked exactly like Trinny and Susannah, after which they looked happy again. “You look like a hunchback in that,” said Susannah to one contestant, which made me wonder if she went to a girls’ boarding school. (She did. I checked).  Could it really be something so prosaic that brought us here? Smith and Higgins think so: they placed What Not To Wear on a list of television shows that began this process of dehumanisation, and includes Come Dine With Me (really?), The Apprentice (I always thought the joke was on Sugar), Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares (likewise) and Top Gear (who knew?) They have all apparently created “a sphere of anger, humiliation, dispute and upset” on national television, which has leaked out into the public discourse, and so we despise not only people’s batwings, which is manageable in a liberal democracy, but their politics, which is not. 
AUG5	The Royal Navy has been decimated, but Iran's insolence shows why Britain must still rule the waves	Our best-known patriotic song is based on the idea that “Britannia rules the waves”. Not the world; the waves. Until quite recently, it was axiomatic that Britain’s greatness was sea-borne. The Army mattered greatly, but only sometimes. The Royal Navy mattered all the time. Since the 1990s, attitudes have changed, and now we are paying for it. Then, we had 45 destroyers and frigates; today we have 19. As seven former First Sea Lords pointed out in a letter in yesterday’s Sunday Telegraph, Iran has been able to capture and detain the British-flagged Stena Impero because there simply wasn’t a British frigate available to prevent it. We look almost as weak as we did in 2007 when Iran seized 15 British sailors and Royal Marines, forced the woman of the party into a hijab, and extracted abject and untruthful apologies from them before it would let them go. Last year, we had the wisdom to open a Royal Navy Support Base in Bahrain. Unfortunately, we did not think of having enough ships to park there. For 40 years now, Iran has specialised in humiliating Western powers by kidnap on land and at sea; yet still we let it happen. Britain clings to the deal with these people in a vain attempt to control their nuclear proliferation.
AUG6	Our doctors must be fairly rewarded for their work and not fear they will be hit by an unexpected tax bill	Doctors are extraordinary people. They save lives, bring hope, break bad news, console and comfort patients all in a day’s work. And then they go home and do all the ordinary things as well like raising children, looking after elderly parents, and balancing the domestic demands of running a household. Few people will ever experience the physical and mental pressures that frontline NHS staff face. They work nights and weekends, they miss important events because they always put their patients first. I know from NHS doctors in my own family, from friends and from speaking to staff across the country, that they do this with good grace as they accept it as part of the job. We can’t reiterate often enough how much we value them what they do. And it’s important we show that,  and we look after them. As we put an extra £33.9billion into the NHS - the largest and longest cash settlement in its history - we will need more staff - nurses, midwives, IT specialists, pharmacists - right across the board. And we will need more doctors.
AUG6	The voices of victims must be heard in court, or we will all face the devastating consequences	Attending court can be a traumatic experience for victims of crime – not least in that they may have to relive an experience that in some cases has devastated their lives. It is only right that they should be given the chance to make their voices heard, and that they should be put at the centre of the process. But it is not happening. Research I am publishing today shows that only one in seven victims recall being offered the opportunity to make a Victim Personal Statement (VPS), to explain how the crime has affected them, even though the Victims’ Code states that all are entitled to give such a statement. Among those who made a VPS, under half felt it was taken into account by the criminal justice system, a significant drop from a year ago. These disappointing figures raise two important concerns. First, it is clear that a large proportion of these victims of crime have no recollection of being offered the chance to make a VPS. Victims are being robbed of the opportunity to have their say in court.Second, it is worrying that the proportion of victims who feel they are being listened to has dropped so sharply. We need to understand the reasons behind this so that we can take steps to reassure victims that their voices will indeed be heard.
AUG6	There is nothing undemocratic about Northern Ireland's Brexit backstop	Writing for the Telegraph, Nick Timothy accused Leo Varadkar of not understanding the Good Friday Agreement and risking peace in Ireland. His attack on the Taoiseach is part of a syndicated assault on the backstop, which actually stemmed from the very red lines first spelled out by Theresa May, the prime minister Mr Timothy was then serving. The backstop was agreed in good faith as one part of the wider Withdrawal Agreement. A UK exit via this agreement would be followed by an implementation period and negotiation of the future UK-EU relationship. It is an insurance policy to guarantee no detriment to existing arrangements on the island of Ireland for cross-border trade and cooperation during or after those negotiations. Brexiteers portray the backstop in terms of EU control and now call it undemocratic. In fact, it is supported by a majority in Northern Ireland.
AUG6	If the people's Boris Johnson can't beat Parliament, prepare for Prime Minister Ken Clarke	Among the many unlikely aspects of Boris Johnson’s elevation to the premiership, beyond the fact that it happened at all, is that he is the first occupant of No 10 for 140 years to come from the Commons’ backbenches. Ever since William Gladstone became prime minister for the second time in 1880, all the others on taking office have either been in the government or were leaders of the opposition. To be pedantic, Mr Johnson became leader of the Conservative Party the day before entering No 10 because Theresa May stayed on for a final flourish in the House. But you get the point. Gladstone stepped down as leader of the Liberal Party after its defeat in 1874 by Disraeli, but its victory in 1880 was attributed to his relentless attack on Tory foreign policy during a successful campaign to win a seat in Midlothian. When Disraeli resigned, Queen Victoria invited the Liberal leader Spencer Cavendish, Lord Hartington, to become her new prime minister. But he declined, saying the majority in the Commons was a “Gladstone-created one” and she should send for him instead.
AUG6	Capable leaders would admit what has gone wrong with the Scottish education system	One of the challenges of commenting on the annual examination diet is that the ‘bottom line’ lies in the impact on the lives and futures of young people, rather than in the dusty columns of statistics or the hyped political statements which are published each August.   So what, if any, effect have the introduction of Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) and 'new' National Qualifications (NQs) to the examination system in 2013/14 had upon young people? This year, when compared to the last year of the old pre-CfE/NQ systems, 165,000 fewer course awards were made at Levels three to five (the S4 awards) than in 2013, 6,000 fewer Higher awards than in 2014 and roughly the same number at Advanced Higher as in 2015.  
AUG6	Donald Trump is right – however tempting it may be, we can't abandon Isil fighters to rot in hell	Now that the caliphate in Syria is no more, and many of its legions of fanatics have been killed, captured or forced to flee, it is tempting for countries, like Britain, that contributed to the military campaign against Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (Isil) to conclude that their participation in the conflict is over. After all, it is not as though there is any shortage of other challenges to contend with. Whitehall, for example, has spent the past few weeks wrestling with the dilemma over whether to join the US in mounting maritime patrols to protect merchant shipping in the Strait of Hormuz from attacks by Iranian gunboats. This followed last month’s seizure of the British-registered oil tanker Stena Impero by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which prompted the then foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt to call for the establishment of a European maritime force to operate independently of the Americans. Given the aversion of our European allies to causing Iran upset, this was always going to be an unlikely proposition. Now the new Johnson government has agreed to take the more logical course of action by deciding to join with American forces in the region to prevent further attacks, reaffirming the importance of the transatlantic alliance in safeguarding Britain’s security needs.
AUG6	Let's unite the Anglosphere and rally Brexit Britain with a bold CANZUK deal	If it is to make up for three years of stagnant Mayism, then Brexit must move beyond its name Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has chosen Canada as the first leg in his trip to North America this week. This is no coincidence. It shows to the world that Brexit is not just about the political union we are leaving, it is just as much, if not more, about opportunities for the future.  Few prime ministers can resist the lure of a bland, centralising mission. For David Cameron, this was the “Big Society”, for Theresa May, tackling the “Burning injustices”. In practice, such policies usually involve trying to make the electorate act in a certain way, rather than empowering them to behave as they wish. Very rarely do they achieve buy-in from the people who actually matter — yes readers, that means you.
AUG6	How Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings quietly took back control of the media narrative	Cast your minds back, if you will, to the halcyon days of November 2018.  After two and a half years of tortuous negotiations, a victorious Theresa May has returned from yet another trip to Europe brandishing a 500 page draft of an agreement to withdraw from the EU. The majority of her government, which is enjoying a period of relative stability (no one has resigned for a full four months), looks set to back it, and several Labour MPs in Leave-voting constituencies are also making encouraging noises. Yes, a few hardline Tory Brexiteers and a handful of Irish unionists are already grumbling about some technicalities - the inclusion of an “Irish backstop”, for example – but one way or another, it looks as though the deal will be carried through Parliament on a wave of optimism and relief before the Christmas holidays. 
AUG6	Underpaid, overworked and under constant attack – small wonder the police can't recruit	At the age of 16, I decided that I wanted to be a police officer. When the careers fair came to university, it was the only display stand I visited. After graduation, it was the only application form I filled out, the only interview I went for. My heart was set. Looking back, I realise that there were probably two things in particular that attracted me to the job. Undeniably, there was the sense of anticipated adventure (the prospect of driving at 90 miles an hour on the wrong side of the road certainly had its appeal) but, more than anything, there was the realisation that it was (and is) a job that matters. Because, when you strip it right down, being a police officer is just about as extraordinary as a job can be. It is to save lives, to find the lost, to comfort the broken-hearted, to protect the vulnerable, to defend the weak, to confront the dangerous, sometimes even to risk it all. If you ask most police officers why they joined they will tell you, simply, that they wanted to make a difference. Policing remains for me the greatest thing that any of us could ever choose to do with our working lives.
AUG6	Tinkering won't stop doctors from being forced out of the NHS by absurd taxes on their pensions	Amid the headline-scoring announcement of a £1.8 billion cash injection to invest in the crumbling NHS estate this weekend, Boris Johnson also slipped out a pledge to this week “fix” the pension crisis that is so threatening the health service’s staff and the patients they treat. Writing in a Sunday newspaper, the Prime Minister called the situation whereby doctors are forced to reduce their hours to avoid substantial tax bills on their pensions “perverse”, while the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he is “committed to making the pension system work” so that NHS staff are not penalised for taking on extra shifts. The British Medical Association, of which I am council chair and which has led the campaign on this issue, understands there is to be Government intervention this week. However, we are clear that this must include not only – as reports lead us to believe – short-term flexibilities, but also drastic reform of the pension tax regulations that are the root of the problem.
AUG7	When the moment comes, Boris Johnson should enlist the Queen's help in foiling the Remainers' undemocratic plot	Sir Malcolm Rifkind's Charles I comparisons simply do not stand up Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former foreign secretary, has stated that if Boris Johnson refused to resign as prime minister immediately after losing a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons next month, “he would create the gravest constitutional crisis since the actions of Charles I led to the Civil War”. Dominic Grieve has further suggested that the Queen might have to demand Mr Johnson’s resignation. If there is one thing that we can take for granted as we enter the new constitutional ground laid down by the (staggeringly ill-advised) Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011, it is that the Queen will act with perfect propriety. She is not about, in the sixty-seventh year of her reign, to play fast and loose with the constitution after having adhered to it with such punctilious respect for so long. Under the Act, the prime minister may call a general election on a date of his choosing after losing a confidence vote, and all that Dominic Cummings was saying in his press briefing was that Mr Johnson will do that, which takes us out of the European Union before a general election takes place.
AUG7	What would it take to give Britain a truly world-class pension system?	For a start, let's stop penalising those who wish to save The basic idea of pensions is simple – to make sure we can live comfortably when we no longer have a wage. In practice, however, they have become incredibly complex. Bureaucracy and tax rules mean it is far easier to get into debt than to save money in a pension. Meanwhile, few of us know what income we can expect in retirement. And even fewer have any idea how their money is being invested or what they are being charged for their pensions. So what would it take to give the UK a truly world-class pension system? The answer lies in three areas: tax, technology and transparency.
AUG7	Thank taxes for turning the golden age  of air travel into 'Colditz-with-wings'	The misery of modern air travel is a puzzle to anyone who believes in market competition Mile-long queues at security. Nothing to eat but overpriced, stale sandwiches, while the software crashes and the plane is delayed. Kids going crazy, staff walking out on strike and, at the end of it, a cramped orange/purple/magenta seat that doesn’t recline, has a strange whiff of beer about it, and is right next to a stag party from Middlesbrough. Welcome to the special kind of hell that is flying out of Britain on holiday. Cancellations and delays at British Airways, the airline that long ago gave up on trying to describe itself as the “world’s favourite” in case people started laughing, are just the latest episode of summer chaos at our main airports. Every year, the same sorry mess unfolds, as one airline or another, or one or more airport, is hit by delays, strikes and cancellations.
AUG7	The EU could easily offer Boris Johnson a better Brexit deal, but it is probably too irrational to do so	The Brexit negotiations have descended into a game of chicken, with the EU repeating that it is unwilling to reopen talks on the binding part of the deal Theresa May struck. This rules out pretty much any concession to the UK. It was predictable that the EU wouldn't simply change its tune the day after Boris Johnson became PM, but what will happen in the next few weeks? Will EU capitals look at the withdrawal agreement again, and perhaps change the terms of the Brexit negotiation mandate they have given to the European Commission in order to offer concessions?  Rationally, that's what they should do. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit would deliver much more of what Ireland is trying to achieve than letting a no-deal Brexit happen. After all, a no deal may hit Ireland's economy harder even than the UK's, and because the Irish government would need to put up a border of some kind, both the peace process and Irish relations with its EU partners may come under strain. 
AUG7	What could be more delusional than a 'Government of National Unity' led by hardcore Remainers?	The idea is conceptually, as well as strategically, absurd  At times, it’s hard not to feel sorry for die-hard Remainers. The latest straw they’ve been clutching at – paper straw, mind you, not plastic – has just been wrenched from their grasp by John McDonnell, scrumpled up into a little ball and then tossed, nonchalantly, into his mouth like a peanut. At the Edinburgh Fringe Festival yesterday, the Shadow Chancellor told Iain Dale that Labour “wouldn’t enter into coalitions or pacts” if the Government is brought down by a vote of no confidence when Parliament returns in September. In those circumstances, his Party’s priority would be to establish a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn. And if that proves impossible – as it surely would – the only alternative would be a General Election.
AUG7	John McDonnell and the hard-Left have always been prepared to sacrifice the Union for power	In a political landscape remarkably short of inspiring leadership figures making the arguments against Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon emerged long ago as a target of admiration and even adulation among a certain type of Remain supporter. Perhaps this shouldn’t be surprising, since the Scottish First Minister has – unlike her opposite number in the main UK opposition party – been consistent in her opposition to Britain’s leaving the European Union. But such tartan-tinted glasses should be disposed of right now: if Nicola Sturgeon’s campaign for Scottish independence had succeeded in 2014, Scotland would have departed the EU at exactly the same time that it left the UK – in March 2016, according to her own party’s manifesto for independence. Please don’t take my word for it – take the word of the then European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who said: “If part of the territory of a member state would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the (EU) treaties would no longer apply to that territory.”
AUG7	Eco-zealots and hardline Remainers are driven by their feelings, not facts	Earlier this week, a middle-aged Extinction Rebellion activist broke down in tears while defending himself in court against public order charges relating to a protest in London last April. “For 22 years I have been acting... in all aspects of my life, to combat climate change,” sobbed Dr Steve Melia, justifying his rule-breaking. “I realised that this is not enough.” The lecturer had “never even had a parking ticket before.” But the climate “catastrophe” was so grave as to force him to abandon all self-control. My first thoughts on reading this were: “Spare me the self-pity.” Melia’s punishment: a £500 fine plus costs, was small change compared to the price and inconvenience of bringing the capital to a halt. But given the absolutism that has engulfed the climate debate – with even those who agree that global warming requires urgent attention yet disagree on the precise solutions, branded “deniers” – it is hardly surprising to see visceral reactions combined with a sense of rigid moral certainty. But Melia is not alone. Politics – particularly among eco-zealots, Left-wing radicals, and hardcore Remainers – is becoming an increasingly emotional exercise. I first noticed this after the Conservative victory in 2015. Left-wing friends reported tears, horror, depression, behaving as though David Cameron, the triangulating heir to Blair, was a far-Right fascist. On election night, the writer Laurie Penny tweeted, with characteristic understatement: “Please everyone take care of each other tonight. So many are already close to losing hope. Reach out to that friend. I mean it.”
AUG7	Our doctors must be fairly rewarded for their work and not fear they will be hit by an unexpected tax bill	Doctors are extraordinary people. They save lives, bring hope, break bad news, console and comfort patients all in a day’s work. And then they go home and do all the ordinary things as well like raising children, looking after elderly parents, and balancing the domestic demands of running a household. Few people will ever experience the physical and mental pressures that frontline NHS staff face. They work nights and weekends, they miss important events because they always put their patients first. I know from NHS doctors in my own family, from friends and from speaking to staff across the country, that they do this with good grace as they accept it as part of the job. We can’t reiterate often enough how much we value them what they do. And it’s important we show that,  and we look after them. As we put an extra £33.9billion into the NHS - the largest and longest cash settlement in its history - we will need more staff - nurses, midwives, IT specialists, pharmacists - right across the board. And we will need more doctors.
AUG7	The voices of victims must be heard in court, or we will all face the devastating consequences	Attending court can be a traumatic experience for victims of crime – not least in that they may have to relive an experience that in some cases has devastated their lives. It is only right that they should be given the chance to make their voices heard, and that they should be put at the centre of the process. But it is not happening. Research I am publishing today shows that only one in seven victims recall being offered the opportunity to make a Victim Personal Statement (VPS), to explain how the crime has affected them, even though the Victims’ Code states that all are entitled to give such a statement. Among those who made a VPS, under half felt it was taken into account by the criminal justice system, a significant drop from a year ago. These disappointing figures raise two important concerns. First, it is clear that a large proportion of these victims of crime have no recollection of being offered the chance to make a VPS. Victims are being robbed of the opportunity to have their say in court.Second, it is worrying that the proportion of victims who feel they are being listened to has dropped so sharply. We need to understand the reasons behind this so that we can take steps to reassure victims that their voices will indeed be heard.
AUG7	There is nothing undemocratic about Northern Ireland's Brexit backstop	Writing for the Telegraph, Nick Timothy accused Leo Varadkar of not understanding the Good Friday Agreement and risking peace in Ireland. His attack on the Taoiseach is part of a syndicated assault on the backstop, which actually stemmed from the very red lines first spelled out by Theresa May, the prime minister Mr Timothy was then serving. The backstop was agreed in good faith as one part of the wider Withdrawal Agreement. A UK exit via this agreement would be followed by an implementation period and negotiation of the future UK-EU relationship. It is an insurance policy to guarantee no detriment to existing arrangements on the island of Ireland for cross-border trade and cooperation during or after those negotiations. Brexiteers portray the backstop in terms of EU control and now call it undemocratic. In fact, it is supported by a majority in Northern Ireland.
AUG8	Why a no-deal Brexit would weaken the case for Scottish independence	A clean break would give the Scots the hard choice between Britain’s internal market and that of the EU In its infancy, the Scottish National Party followed much the same pattern as most nationalist movements in Europe; it may always have been a broad church, but it was also a magnet for both strongly Eurosceptic and Right-wing voices. Prominent supporters spoke of the need for Scotland to stand on its own two feet, free from the dependency culture that had taken hold in this birthplace of enlightenment economics, and many of them were as dismissive of the EU as they were of rule by Westminster. Alex Salmond, the SNP’s former leader, was once expelled from the party for attempting to take it too far to the Left. As soon became apparent, however, the politics of the Right were not the route to power in this traditionally Labour-voting country. The switch to a centre-Left and pro-European outlook was therefore a natural progression.
AUG8	Don't believe the doomsters: A US-UK trade deal is on the cards for 2020	The pro-Brexit optimism on display in the halls of Congress should be a cause for celebration in London The doomsayers predict that Britain will be isolated after a no-deal Brexit. They warn of economic calamity, border chaos and an exodus of investment. Without a shred of evidence they also say that the UK will have less strategic value to Washington, no longer acting as a vital bridge across the Atlantic. And such baseless assertions are happily amplified by the BBC. This week a group of 45 US senators blew these fraudulent claims out of the water. Some of the most powerful men and women on Capitol Hill signed a letter from senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas congratulating Boris Johnson on becoming Prime Minister and offering full US support to the UK over Brexit. They pledged to back a US-UK free trade deal, and to work with the British Government to ensure that there is minimum disruption in the event of a no deal.
AUG8	Mollycoddled, militaristic millennials are yearning for a new age of enlightened dictatorship	But the joke will be on all of us when they are the ones in charge New polling from the think tank Onward has revealed some startlingly authoritarian tendencies amongst Millennials. Two thirds of those surveyed favoured strong leaders who can work without having to consult parliament. As many as a quarter believe parliamentary democracy is a bad political system in itself. This is not, necessarily, a sign that this much-maligned generation is exclusively drawn from the ranks of myopic, student union communistas, as the cliche goes. It is perfectly possible that a strong leader could come in the form of a monarch as a Jeremy Corbyn figure. The 36 percent who told the survey they would favour army rule could have been talking about a fiercely nationalist one as much as that of the red variety.
AUG8	The middle classes do all the complaining for the rest of us	Where’s the Equality and Human Rights Commission when you need them?  We live, as Voltaire’s Dr Pangloss might have said, in the best of all possible times. Two words alone are needed to defend this statement: posh bread. When I was growing up in the Sixties, most bread was white pap. White pap is still available for those who like it, but the sort of bread you can break your teeth on has joined a list of other culinary pleasures that were not available in my youth: decent beer (as opposed to the gaseous insipidity of Watneys Red Barrel), mozzarella (Elizabeth David suggested that creamy, foil-wrapped Bel Paese could be used as a substitute), and proper strength coffee. No wonder a shopper at Waitrose in Cirencester returned the uneaten portion of her seeded bloomer when she thought that the recipe had changed.
AUG8	Will deluded John McDonnell stop at nothing to realise his 'October Revolution' fantasy?	John McDonnell appears to be keen on instigating a coup. Not content with the maneuvers of Parliament against the people over the course of the last year, McDonnell has now suggested that his Party leader could effectively march on Buckingham Palace to assume power. Salivating over the idea at an Edinburgh fringe event this week, the Shadow Chancellor appeared practically giddy about the prospect of a no deal Brexit creating the chance for his own October Revolution: “I don’t want to drag the Queen into this but I would be sending Jeremy Corbyn in a cab to Buckingham Palace to say we’re taking over.”
AUG8	Labour moderates have given up the fight against the anarchy of John McDonnell	It is increasingly hard to apply the description of “moderate” to the majority of Labour’s MPs. The term is normally used to describe those centrist or centre-Left parliamentarians unhappy with Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership and broadly supportive of gradualist improvement to public services, tax and the availability of opportunity. They might also be relied upon to call out, publicly, any expressions of extremism or discomfiting language used by the party’s leadership. Sadly, this tendency to speak common sense to power has, in recent months, been confined to MPs’ obsession with halting Brexit. Just watch the outraged reaction from the likes of Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn whenever Seumas Milne, Corbyn’s spokesman, equivocates on Labour’s view of a re-run referendum. But when a senior Labour representative tells a public audience that the Conservatives are “social criminals” who must, one day (presumably shortly after the election of the next Labour government) be tried for crimes against the British people, you might have expected at least one Labour backbencher somewhere to have raised a nervous hand in order to question the wisdom of show trials for political opponents.
AUG8	Cornered by Boris Johnson, Remainers have decided to stop at nothing in their war on Brexit	Many people are mad about Boris Johnson, and I don't mean mad in a positive way. It did not take me long to find a case of "Boris Derangement Syndrome" in Westminster, as it made itself known to me the day Mr Johnson was confirmed as Tory leader and incoming Prime Minister. "Are you proud of this clown, Asa?" the costumed man captured in the photo above hollered. Without skipping a beat, he opened up his cardboard sign to reel off what he saw as the Prime Minister's key pledges (e.g. "Number four, the moon on a stick!"). There was little point in engaging, so I asked him where he had bought his costume (Amazon, it turns out).  Looking back, I should have tried to find out who had decided to traipse around London in a Johnson cut-out mask and clown suit, as it is not beyond question that it could have been a Tory MP like Dominic Grieve.
AUG8	No-deal Brexit spells trouble for British expats in Europe	If you’re heading over to the continent for your holidays (or there already) and find yourself wincing at the Brexit-weakened exchange rate as you cough up for your cerveza, please spare a thought for the 1.3 million Britons who live in the EU. While you’re kicking back enjoying a well-earned sunny break, they are sweating bullets about what will happen to their rights if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.  Theresa May’s thrice rejected exit plan was not without its faults, but it promised relief for Britons living in the EU27. It included a transition period of 21 months (until December 2020) during which EU free movement rights would remain virtually unchanged, even for new arrivals – enough time for Britain and the EU to agree a new arrangement for dealing with each other’s citizens. But Boris Johnson’s pledge to leave the EU “do or die” on October 31st has thrown a spanner in the works. No deal means no transition period –so Britons living in the EU would become third-country nationals on November 1st. From then on they will be at the mercy of the migration laws of the EU country they live in – and some are tougher than others. 
AUG8	Jeremy Corbyn will not stop no-deal, because he believes it's his only route to power	Why didn’t Jeremy Corbyn call for a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson’s government immediately upon Boris being appointed? The vote could have been held on July 25. Boris would almost certainly have lost. Then we would have been heading for an early September general election. If Corbyn had done this, we would not have had any of the complicated maths people are now debating about how many days there are between any early September vote of no confidence, just after the Commons returns from its summer recess, and October 31, when we are due to leave the EU. The long and the short of an early September no confidence vote is this. Unless it leads to an alternative Prime Minister, replacing Boris, then it will result in a general election that Boris can arrange to be held just after October 31, meaning we will have left the EU with no deal and Boris will win a landslide victory. The current favourite date is apparently November 1.
AUG8	To win an election, Boris Johnson must forget freedom – people want security instead	You don't have to agree with Vladimir Putin that liberalism is obsolete to see that it is in trouble. Across the West, populist movements are flourishing, and in some cases taking power, with platforms that take on the established liberal order - rejecting free market economics from the left and cultural liberalism from the right. With our own politics fragmenting and parties led by Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn - both leaders with extreme views - attracting significant amounts of votes, it might seem that the UK is falling prey to the same trends. Can we just attribute this to the polarising politics around Brexit, or is there something more profound happening? Are we entering, as some people claim, in a post-liberal era? For the last 60 years, the UK has experienced a long bull run of freedom-expanding politics. From Roy Jenkins’s reforms to divorce, abortion and the death penalty in the 60s to Margaret Thatcher's economic reforms of the 1980s and Tony Blair social policies of the 00s, we have been living in an increasingly liberal society. The themes of throwing off the shackles and abandoning tradition have dominated political discourse. But our research at Onward suggests, in Jim Callaghan’s famous words, a sea change is taking place.
AUG9	In exhorting us not to eat meat, green preachers place morality over reason	The headlines said things like “Eat less meat to save the earth, urges UN”. So naturally the public will believe this is what the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is saying in its latest report. But is it, really? The report’s wording is guarded, preferring to speak about how “diversification in the food system”, including things like “coarse grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds”, might help, rather than telling people to drop meat. Indeed, the title of the report is Climate Change and Land, with no mention of meat. If you google it under its correct name, up it comes, and no headlines about the eco-wickedness of meat appear. If you google it under variants of “IPCC report on meat”, you get headlines such as that above. Why this difference? I think it is because of the power of those who set themselves up as interpreters of what they over-confidently call “the science”. The most powerful of these in Britain is Roger Harrabin. He is called the BBC’s Environment Analyst, but really he is their in-house evangelical preacher. Each day, the Reverend Roger announces the environmental news, turning it into a covert sermon. He is the even more slanted green equivalent of the BBC’s “reality check” correspondent on Brexit, Chris Morris, whose real job is to explain why the Leave side is wrong.
AUG9	Just look at the chaos across the Channel and it's blindingly obvious we are right to leave the EU	For all the warning and carping that goes on about the internet there is one gift that always gives. I refer of course to YouTube. True, much of the site is tweeny “vloggers” updating their millions of followers about what they ate for breakfast. But it is also reliably, addictively informing. Perhaps its finest attribute is the frequency with which historic videos are “recommended” at just the right moment. Users will be aware of the YouTube holes you can fall down for hours after one such video is pushed on you. And this week I happily fell into one of these vortexes when some videos of Margaret Thatcher speaking about the EU were once again being promoted on the channel. If anyone worries about the dumbing down of our time they should witness the millions of views such videos get. Why would it be that videos of Margaret Thatcher “totally destroying the EU” keep going “viral”? Simply because they are the greatest possible reminder that this country’s present struggle to get out of the EU is just the latest phase of a struggle we have gone through for the duration of some of our lifetimes.
AUG9	No, of course Brexit won't damage British science	Europhile dogma has captured the scientific community Boris Johnson has pledged to make it easier for scientists to settle in Britain after we leave the EU. You’d assume that a fast-tracked visa system would be welcomed by Britain’s scientific community. Wrong. Establishment figures queued up to criticise the proposal. Nobel laureate Professor Sir Andre Geim accused the PM of “taking scientists for fools”, adding that his longtime collaborator Konstantin Novoselov had already left the UK to work in Singapore. “I think that tells you everything you need to know.’’ But why would Novoselov decide to move to the Far East, rather than, say, France or Germany, if the EU were such a centre of enlightened thought? Singapore has gone to great lengths to attract the best and brightest – an approach Mr Johnson and his team are thankfully aping.
AUG9	The outrage against Trump's illegal immigrant raids is divorced from basic reality	America is in the grips of an ICE age. ICE standing for Immigration Customs Enforcers, a government unit tasked with finding and deporting illegal immigrants, with a new Trump-ordered drive having started in Mississippi this week. Thus far, 680 employees of a chicken processing plant have been detained. Cue mass-hysteria and protests. Except it’s not new. It’s been going on since 2006, when the operation launched under George W Bush’s presidency and continued through Obama’s tenure. Obama, in fact, oversaw more deportations during his reign than any other president. The largest single raid, more than a decade ago, saw nearly 1,300 illegal immigrants deported. Why the furore now, over 680 arrests? Because Donald Trump is behind the wheel. According to Bernie Sanders, these drives - which seek to round up and deport specific criminal migrants from a list - are “evil”. Democrat and presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke says “the cruelty knows no bounds”. Senator Kamala Harris has branded them "a crime against humanity", and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last month took to Twitter and encouraged volunteers to keep their neighbors keep “safe from the threat”. Mayors of states including New York and Chicago are refusing to assist with arrests (not that anyone asked them to). But hold on. Since when has it been amoral to deport people who have entered a country illegally, in the full knowledge of the risks associated with the crime? These are not asylum-seekers. There’s a formal system in place for those fleeing genuine danger in their home country, as there should be. No, these are foreigners in search of a better life, and that’s understandable but it’s also not how the world works.
AUG9	The UK economy has not been damaged by Brexit, but by our failure to deliver it	Negative growth in the second quarter has been hailed by the continuity Remain camp as evidence of Brexit damage to the economy. It is instead evidence of a Brexit ‘failure bounce’. The first quarter bounced up with a lot of pre-Brexit stocking-up. When Brexit failed to happen, it duly bounced down again. To get a reading on the underlying growth rate, it is best to average the two quarters and compare them with a year ago; this gives an annual growth of 1.3%. This tells us the economy has slowed down recently. But so has the world economy and this has had a negative impact on the euro-zone too, as it has on China and many others. Year-on-year growth in the first quarter- all we have for others- was 0.7% for Germany, -0.1% for Italy, 1.2% for France and the same for the eurozone.  The story is simple enough: the world has slowed and so have we.
AUG9	I'm campaigning for menopause posters in GP's surgeries - we older women are fed up of being ignored	Sitting in the waiting room, ahead of a GP appointment, I could feel myself getting angry. Everywhere I looked were posters about the signs of a heart attack, or how to act FAST when a stroke happens; others about breastfeeding and ante-natal clinics and vaccinations. Not one was for the reason I was there: the menopause. Over the past four years, I’ve been to the doctors with palpitations, hair loss, anxiety, mood swings, aching joints – each a classic menopause symptom. Each time I’d be sent away with a prescription that worked short-term, or a blood test that showed nothing wrong. Once I was even given an ECG stress test, which I passed with flying colours. My periods were becoming irregular and I had hot flushes, so I knew I was peri-menopausal. But I had no idea everything else I’d been suffering was connected.
AUG9	A world-class education system is well within Britain’s grasp	With phonics in all our primaries, the Department for Education’s emphasis on the importance of pupil behaviour, the tightening of the GCSE curriculum, and the innovation coming from many free schools, academies and community schools, Britain has never been closer to having a world-class education system. But there is still much to do. So how do we ensure that all children receive an excellent education? First, it may sound obvious, but good quality textbooks are badly needed across the country. The education minister Nick Gibb has argued this for some time – pointing out in 2017, for instance, that only  10 per cent of teachers then used maths textbooks as the basis of their teaching, compared to 70 per cent in Singapore. Too many teachers spend far too much time having to create their own resources. Often school culture dictates that they should. This leaves precious little time for lesson planning, marking and relationship-building with the children. If we had good quality textbooks in all of our classrooms, we would at least be guaranteed that similar levels of knowledge were being accessed by every child. Worryingly, this is not the case. A child’s experience in the classroom in terms of what he or she can learn, and the knowledge he or she is exposed to, varies wildly, from excellent analysis to being taught stuff that is incorrect because the teacher isn’t knowledgeable enough. Government could fund groups of schools to create nationwide textbooks and really change things in our classrooms.
AUG9	Even by Labour standards, this internecine battle over indyref2 is breathtaking	The Labour Party may not have the word "Unionist" in its title but it is no exaggeration to say that without the staunch and continued support it has thus far given to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that entity  may well have been consigned to the history books by now. It is certainly the case that it was the Scottish Labour Party that prevented Scotland breaking away from England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the 2014 independence referendum. The money that kept the successful Better Together or "No" campaign going may well have come from the Tories and  their supporters, but it was Labour luminaries who were principally responsible for fighting off Alex Salmond and who won the day by 55 per cent-45 per cent five years ago. This is not to say that Scottish Tories, especially their leader Ruth Davidson, and Lib Dems with the late Charles Kennedy, played no part in the rejection of separation. They did, but it was Alistair Darling, Gordon Brown, Jim Murphy and many others from Labour’s cabinet ranks who provided the bulk of the offensive action.
AUG9	Why a no-deal Brexit would weaken the case for Scottish independence	A clean break would give the Scots the hard choice between Britain’s internal market and that of the EU In its infancy, the Scottish National Party followed much the same pattern as most nationalist movements in Europe; it may always have been a broad church, but it was also a magnet for both strongly Eurosceptic and Right-wing voices.

AUG10	Do young people really want tyranny, or just freedom from the tyranny of choice?	What do people want? A strong leader! When do they want  it? Whenever, as long as they don’t have to decide. In a world with everything at our fingertips, the power of choice has apparently become punitive – so much so that two thirds of those aged 25-34 would rather have a “strongman leader” who does not “have to bother with parliament”, according to research this week from Onward, a centre-Right think tank. A third of respondents were found to be in favour of military rule; a quarter said democracy is a bad way to run a country. If “shy Tories” exist, perhaps bashful authoritarians do, too. But  I can only imagine that this ostensible new appetite for fascism has found  its roots not in admiration for Erdogan, Putin, bin Salman et al but closer to home, where day-to-day choice has become more tyrannical than ... tyrants. Yes, the recent years of political stasis we have endured have likely strengthened our ardour for a bulldozer to run the country; someone willing to make calls – popular, unpopular, any at all – provided we don’t have to. But this sentiment is cemented further still, surely, by our ability to have, see and do everything whenever we like, a prospect so overwhelming as to create a kind of decision paralysis, whereby the peril of having to make (yet) another choice gives rise to a desperation to outsource it. Even to an autocrat.
AUG10	Jeremy Corbyn sees no-deal as the perfect moment for a Leninist revolution	Labour’s 'muddled' Brexit policy is chillingly clear-headed Try as he might, John McDonnell cannot keep up the Mr Avuncular act. Since Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader, the shadow chancellor has adopted the guise of a smiling, common sensical, friendly old-timer who is simply doing his bit for the nation. But having spent almost his entire political career in his true colours as a revolutionary who sees violence as a core political tactic, the mask regularly slips. This week in Edinburgh, Mr McDonnell casually confirmed that, were he and his fellow revolutionaries to take power, they would prosecute Conservatives. Confronted by interviewer Iain Dale with an old quote of his – “[The Tories] are social criminals and one day, I warn you, we will try them” – Mr McDonnell simply shrugged as if this was all very obvious. Mr Dale asked him under what law Tories would be tried simply for being Tories. “I might want to invent it,” he replied.
AUG10	Britain's universities are world-beaters – but they need to do far better at commercialising UK academic research	They are among Britain’s greatest national treasures and a powerful engine of ideas and innovation for the nation’s booming technology industry. But how good are UK universities at commercialising the research and expertise which springs from their laboratories and lecture halls? On one level, Britain’s university spinout sector seems to be thriving. 
AUG10	In exhorting us not to eat meat, green preachers place morality over reason	The headlines said things like “Eat less meat to save the earth, urges UN”.

AUG10	A toy gun has restored my faith in Britain and the free market	Wait. There he was. There was someone at the bottom of the garden. It was late on Boxing Day evening. The world was slumped in crapulous slumber; and there by the shed I could see the thing a householder dreads most – an armed intruder. Slowly, I brought my own gun to bear on his silhouette and rehearsed the options of a man in my predicament. Would I be hailed a hero for protecting my home and wasting a homicidal nocturnal trespasser? Or would I face prison and Tony Martin-style humiliation? Before my internal debate could proceed a second longer I realised my enemy could see me as well as I could see him. It was do or die. Kill or be killed. I remembered that it is better to squeeze off one thoughtful round than fire five frantic shots; so I aimed at what I took to be his chest.
AUG10	It's not posh to hand over your dosh	Many years ago, I was polishing off a bottle of wine when I had a startling phone call. It was a student from my former place of higher education, and he wanted my money. Would I make a donation to the old college? he asked. Wasn't my time there absolutely maaahvellous? And, because there was something slightly supercilious in his voice, I almost told him to go to blazes, and then I thought, hold on: he's right. I was transported back to my four-year stint of indolence, fuelled by taxpayer-funded champagne.
AUG10	The night in Beijing when I saw Damian McBride's true colours	It is a glorious morning. The daffodils are still pretty perky. The tulips are surging away. The birds are a-wooing and a-cooing all over the place, and it seems absolutely criminal on a morning like this – an April morning, when there is frankly nowhere in the universe more lovely than England – that I should be sitting inside and slaving over a computer and brooding about Damian McBride. I don't want to talk about McBride. I don't want to think about him. There is a large part of me that does not want to read another sentence about this lately exploded pustule on the posterior of the British body politic. But as I look at his rubicund face as it leers from the papers, and as I study his ludicrous emails, I feel it is my duty to history to share with readers my own experience of McBride and McBride-ism. It was a trivial enough episode in itself. And yet it left me convinced that this decaying, clapped-out, paranoid Labour government had finally forfeited the moral authority to rule, for one simple but decisive reason: they were patently more interested in themselves than in the good of the country.
AUG10	Face it: it's all your own fat fault	Just as I was cramming my mouth with another obesity-enhancing cheese 'n' mesquita-flavour kettle chip, preparatory to washing it down with a draught of life-giving milk chocolate, the phone rang. Whoaah! said my mole on the House of Commons health select committee. What are you writing about for your Telegraph column? I'm doing an elegy for Tracey Emin's bed, I said, crunching vigorously, and I meant it, since I am full of admiration for Charles Saatchi and what he has done for BritArt. Too bad, said my source. It'll have to wait. We've got some fantastic stuff here from these health-conscious MPs. And, boy, was he right. There used to be a saying that no politician ever attacked motherhood and apple pie. All that is over, my friends. There is a new threat to our little ones. Its name is apple pie, and it is making them less little all the time. With every groaning axle on our blimp-like people carriers, with every squeak of the midnight fridge, with every pop of our collar buttons, the nation is getting fatter and fatter, says the health select committee - and the Government is doing nothing about it.
AUG10	Snooty Europhiles should be forced to crawl in penitence	I think we deserve an apology. By “we” I mean all the Euro-sceptics, Euro-pragmatists, Euro-realists and Euro-hysterics who were alarmed by some of the optimism that surrounded the birth of the single currency. Do you remember the disdain with which we were treated? We were told that we were boss-eyed Little Englanders. They used to say we were a bunch of xenophobic, garlic-hating defenders of the pint and the yard and the good old bread-filled British banger. Whenever we protested about any detail of the plan for monetary union, we were told that we were in danger of stopping the great European train, boat, bus, bicycle or whatever it was. We were a blimpish embarrassment to our country, a bunch of idiot children who had to be shooshed while the grown-ups got on with their magnificent plans. So it gives me a tingling pleasure to report that everywhere you look on the map of Europe we have been proved resoundingly and crushingly right.
AUG10	Never mind all those badgers – we’ve got to save the Cleggster	Quick, before it is too late. It’s time to save Nick Clegg. I have just read the Sunday papers, and the anti-Clegg feeling rises off them like a sulphurous cloud. According to one reliable analyst, the ratings of the Lib Dem leader are currently standing at minus 62 per cent – lower than Osama bin Laden. Expert after expert steps forward to give the Deputy PM a kick in the pants, and the overwhelming view is that he should be defenestrated before the next election. He is not just toxic for the Libs, say these pundits – he is contaminating the entire Coalition. Some talk of Vince Cable replacing him, some of Ed Davey. So in the dwindling months we have available, it is time for us Clegg fans to echo those kindly folk who are trying to save the sweet furry badgers from the wrath of farmers. Never mind the badgers – save the Cleggster from extermination! Here are 20 reasons why everybody, not just Tories, should be grateful to the Cleggster, a man who has effectively laid down his political life so that the government of the country can be carried on, and who has endured the most protracted political humiliation since the emperor Valerian was captured by the Persian emperor Shapur, and turned first into a living footstool, and then flayed and used as a rather striking wall hanging.
AUG11	How did Michael Heseltine become the go-to Grandee Oracle on all things Brexit?	Michael Heseltine has somehow become the go-to TV Grandee Oracle on all things Brexit. As if the year were 1990, it has become nigh-on impossible to tune into a political programme without his almost medusarian locks finding their way onto our screens, tantalising some, although presumably stunning most of the audience cold. But why this sudden ascendance to become the face of a weekly televised winge-a-thon? Heseltine’s influence in the Conservative Party peaked thirty years ago with his second place finish in the leadership race. It has been on a steady decline ever since. The man pops up every other second, be it Sophy Ridge or Newsnight he’s always there to give his increasingly unrepresentative opinion. Arguably far more senior ‘grandee’ figures in the mainstream of their party barely get a look in. Big beasts like Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont held far more pivotal Governmental roles in the run up to and fallout from the formal creation of the European Union in 1992, but their insights on the European question – far more in line with the 70%+ of Conservative Party members who voted to leave the EU – feature much less frequently.
AUG11	Am I the only one to find grotesque, dull trainers  hard to love?	That shapeless and malodorous article of footwear, the trainer, is having a moment. Last month, Sotheby’s New York held its first ever auction of rare trainers. The collection of 100 pairs of the “rarest sneakers ever produced” included two pairs of limited edition, self‑lacing Nike Mags, four pairs of the unreleased version of Travis Scott’s Air Jordan 4 “Cactus Jack” design (no, me neither), and a pair of 1972 Nike Moon Shoes – the only unworn example of an edition of a mere dozen. The entire collection was snapped up for almost $1,300,000 (£1,080,000) by a Canadian businessman, Miles Nadal, who plans to exhibit it in his private museum in Toronto, where visitors can admire the waffle sole of the Moon Shoes. Their creator, Oregon University track coach Bill Bowerman, poured rubber into his wife’s waffle iron to create a prototype (history unaccountably fails to record Mrs Bowerman’s reaction). In June, fervent trainer-fanciers crashed websites and camped outside stores across the UK in the hope of bagging a pair of Adidas Yeezy Boost 350s (a design like the love child of a carpet slipper and a bicycle tyre).
AUG11	Who would be best placed to lead this Government of National Surrender?	We need someone with a real track record of trying to make the United Kingdom unworkable I am enjoying this talk of a Government of National Unity as the solution to our Brexit ills. What would the nature of that unity be? Ken Clarke, the current favourite, could say “We’re against the referendum. We’re against the result of the referendum and against the promise we MPs made to implement it. We don’t agree with the 17.4 million people who voted Leave and we don’t think that the biggest vote for anything in our history should be respected. Parliament, including many of us, voted for Article 50 and for the Withdrawal Act, which ensure that we leave if no deal is made; but we’re against them all the same. Unite!
AUG11	We have a right to know the total cost of the state	Some very clever Tories have talked themselves into a very silly corner on tax cuts. They think the party is a victim of its own success: increases to the personal allowance have taken so many people out of income tax – 43 per cent of adults don’t pay it, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) – that a tax-cutting agenda would have little electoral appeal. Why vote for lower taxes, they wonder, if you don’t pay taxes anyway? It isn’t a very logical view: are they suggesting that the tax burden on the poorest will need to rise so that those same voters can support reducing that burden? It is also perfectly rational to dislike a tax even if you don’t pay it. Inheritance tax is not levied on many estates and yet is overwhelmingly unpopular because it is unfair. And you are unlikely to stay stuck on the same income throughout your life anyway. That IFS study, for example, found that a quarter of those in the top one per cent of earners in a given year will not be there in the next.
AUG11	I’ll take old Hollywood’s magic over a new Home Alone	The growth of nepotism in showbusiness has been one of the most repulsive minor cultural degradations of recent years. Because showbiz was until recently considered no better than it should be, those with nothing to lose flocked to it. Who could have predicted it would become so respectable that we’d reach a stage where the odd successful working-class actor talks sadly of how few of their fellows there are? Rags-to-riches stories have been replaced by riches-to-richer stories and with the next generation of celebrity spawn already smeared all over the cultural landscape, it shows no sign of stopping. This being so, it seems drearily appropriate that another smug and unadventurous development – remakes of films which are just a decade or two old – is well under way. Just as Marc Jacobs hiring Cindy Crawford’s lookalike teenage daughter as the face of his perfume may trigger memories to be monetised, so remaking one generation’s favourite film may lead them to take their own children to see it, instead of some unknown quantity. We’ve already had The Lion King – inflicting the season-in-Hell soundtrack that is Hakuna Matata on a new generation – now Disney has announced that Home Alone will be “reimagined for a new generation”. An overexcited Macaulay Culkin Tweeted: “I hope the Space Jam reboot kicks off a whole slew of 80s/90s sports movie remakes” but I’m pretty sure this opinion isn’t shared by many who won’t be expecting cameos in these wretched projects. There’s a reason why the third Home Alone narrowly lost out on the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Sequel to Speed 2: Cruise Control in 1998 and after that was good only for two straight-to-TV features; people grew weary of the same old same old. It’s interesting that Culkin uses the terms “remake” and “reboot”; invariably the dullards behind these projects think of themselves as Rebooters, doing something cool and techy and futuristic rather than mere Remakers, with the make’n’mend implications of dragging out some old rag and zhushing it up a bit. Reimaginers, of course, go to the top of the pile; bringing their limitless creativity to a project that seemed definitive at the time. In fact, all three are cultural rag-and-bone men.
AUG11	Theresa May gave the EU all it could have hoped for – now it risks losing everything	These intransigent Eurocrats would rather a juddering rupture than see Britain succeed on its own Are Eurocrats, I wonder, starting to feel the tiniest batsqueak of doubt? A year ago, they had the UK where they wanted it. Our officials were pledging to adopt EU social and employment laws unilaterally and to pay for the privilege. Had any other country made such an offer, Brussels negotiators would have snapped its hand off like ravening hounds. But, still bruised by the referendum result, they instead demanded more. Result? A change of management in Britain, and the sweeping away of concessions that the previous administration placed on the table. Theresa May approached the talks as a supplicant. The EU laid down the terms, set the preconditions and ordered the protocols. Every meeting took place at the European Commission rather than in London: a token attempt to hold one press conference on British soil at the Brussels embassy was rejected out of hand. Desperate to come back with something that could technically be labelled “Brexit”, the former PM signed up to every EU request.
AUG11	Millennials might think they want a 'strongman' leader - but they've never lived under one	What is sensed at the edges, comes closer. Evidence is here, from a report called 'The Politics of Belonging' by the conservative think tank Onward – or Backward, if you want to be droll and, having read the report, I need a laugh. It is accompanied by polling – of 5,000 British people – that says the following. The idea that “freedom is security” has passed out of fashion. Two-thirds of people want a society that “focuses on giving people more security”, rather than a society that “focuses on giving people more freedom”. Some 71 per cent think too many people live in cities; 66 per cent think that too many of people – do they mean themselves? – are over-educated; 63 per cent of people think that marriage has fallen due to a “decline in family commitment and values”.  Backward did not ask the question: “Would you, personally, like to live in Downton Abbey if it was real?” I wish they had. I forecast 82 per cent wanting to live in Downton Abbey if it was real, and 98 per cent if it wasn’t.

AUG11	The War on Meat has begun, and there are many reasons to join the resistance	What starts out as a suggestion then becomes ostracism and ends in state coercion The BBC, misreporting a United Nations report, wants us to switch to a mostly plant-based diet in order to alter the weather. Would it work? No. A recent “meta-analysis” of all the peer-reviewed papers on this topic found that if the average westerner gave up meat altogether it would cut her total emissions by just 4.3 per cent. This is because food is only a modest part of our emissions. And since vegetables are cheap, the savings would almost certainly be spent on other things with emissions attached, so the actual reduction would be even smaller than that. The effect on the climate would be unmeasurable. “Eating carrots instead of steak means you effectively cut your emissions by about two per cent,” says the environmental economist Bjorn Lomborg. “As a vegetarian for ethical reasons, I will be the first to say that there are many good reasons to eat less meat. Sadly, making a huge difference to the climate isn’t one of them.”
AUG11	Wayne Rooney's Derby transfer has kick-started a misplaced moral panic	It’s incredibly short-sighted for other fans to bemoan the novel approach the club has taken Former sports minister Richard Caborn described it as “crass.” Deputy Labour party leader Tom Watson says it “prioritises profit over fan welfare.” Leeds United and Nottingham Forest supporters are having meltdowns on Twitter, some even urging the league to intervene. The Bishop of St Albans, Dr Alan Smith, has slammed the player, accusing him of “selling his soul.” Suddenly, everyone is talking about Derby County Football Club, the team I support. This week, the Rams completed the unexpected signing of England’s greatest goalscorer, Wayne Rooney, after his brief US spell. The high-profile addition has thrown fans of rival clubs into a state of apoplexy.
AUG12	At last, here's a Home Secretary who's prepared to terrify criminals	Priti Patel, if you are reading this, please be the Home Secretary we need. Ignore the liberal lobbyists and the Left-wing civil servants, chuck identity politics out of the window: be a Home Secretary for the people. I ask not only for myself but on behalf of Noel Gallagher. Yes, that Noel Gallagher. The former Oasis frontman says he’s leaving London, selling up and moving on, because his lovely mansion is squeezed between two housing estates. “They are currently at war,” he told a newspaper. “One guy was stabbed in the middle of the... day and an air ambulance had to come and land in the middle of the street.” His brother Liam has said separately on the BBC: “Every morning you wake up there’s some 16-year-old being knifed to death ... That freaks me right out.” Me too. You know things are bad when the Gallagher brothers think the city’s gone downhill. But where to run to? Knife crime rose 50 per cent in rural areas in 2018/19. Across England and Wales, there were 43,516 offences involving a knife or sharp implement, the highest figure since comparable records began. Two hundred and fifty people were killed.
AUG12	Spare me the rural ignorance of Labour luvvies from posh London postcodes	The press release detailing the Labour Party’s proposed review of grouse shooting deserves a place in the National Archives. It will speak to generations to come as an example of how policymakers living in posh London postcodes can get so many basic facts about the countryside spectacularly wrong. Exhibit one. It claims that grouse moors are putting the environment at risk by drying out moorland. Only one problem with that: gamekeepers make huge efforts to keep the moors wet, because grouse love the heather that flourishes in damp conditions. A basic Google search reveals dozens of expert sources on how grouse moors are being “rewetted”. And if Labour’s environment team doesn’t trust experts, they should try walking on a grouse moor. Every time their Islington loafers plunge knee-deep into the boggy ground, they can consider it evidence that they have been misled. The moors were drained 50 years ago because the government told moor owners to do this. Then the policy was reversed. Labour is merely a few decades out of date. Exhibit two. Labour says that grouse moors receive £3 million of taxpayers’ money for grouse shooting. Not so. The vast majority of this money is for the sheep farming which takes place on moorland used for shooting.
AUG12	Caroline Lucas's all-female Cabinet shows how desperate Remainers have become; but at least it's provided light relief	Make no mistake, this ‘dream team’ is a daft rearguard action to try to thwart Brexit First Ghostbusters, then Doctor Who, a female 007, and now, perhaps the most ambitious, gender-flipping reboot in history – an all-women cabinet. Caroline Lucas has invited 10 politicians to join her in forming an “emergency Cabinet” to fix Brexit. The Green Party MP claims her group could “bring a different perspective” to politics. Women, she added, “are able to reach out to those they disagree with, and cooperate to find solutions”. If only we’d had a lady leading the process until now, eh? But these won’t be any old women setting the “vagenda”. Though Lucas’s unifying overtures extend to Emily Thornberry, Jo Swinson, Anna Soubry and even Nicola Sturgeon – whose sole political aim is, literally, separation – this is a selective sisterhood. All share her uncompromising belief that Brexit must be halted in its tracks.
AUG12	There's nothing regressive about promoting tough justice	The Government's latest proposals have been greeted with outrage on the Left – even though it's the poorest who stand to benefit most The Prime Minister’s declaration that prisons can and should form a key part of any government’s plan to cut crime is eminently sensible – and a welcome rebuttal of the fashionable belief that society can and should do without incarcerating criminals. The announcements of additional prison capacity and a review of the approach to sentencing will undoubtedly play well on the doorstep. Polling carried out by the Centre for Social Justice in April found that 70 per cent of the public said the Government should build more prison spaces and recruit more prison officers to reduce overcrowding and improve staffing levels.
AUG12	What's wrong with being a pointy-elbowed middle-class parent? No one wants their child to be a loser	Welcome to this year’s Pointy Elbowed Parenting exam. No conferring. No texting. No sexting (the house master’s wife is all over his Samsung since last year’s “misunderstanding”). Gouging, biting and moving house to a better catchment area are perfectly legitimate as long as you don’t get caught. Ditto offering the principal access to your wine cellar, Algarve holiday home or pension fund. Just don’t leave an incriminating digital footprint.  Former chief examiner Tony Breslin has highlighted how the end of AS Levels has made predicted grades much more important in securing pupils’ university offers. As predictions are made by teachers, this has brought the issue of “negotiability" (aka wheedling, persuading and threatening) to the fore. Hence the need for parents to really hone their middle class manipulation skills in the Pointy Elbowed Parenting test. You can, of course, sod this for a game of soldiers but be aware that your final grade will decide whether your child ends up reading PPE at Christ’s College Cambridge or Love Island studies at the University of Life. Exam conditions apply. Use both sides and any other means necessary. Show your (net) working. You may turn over your paper now. 
AUG12	Thank the Lib Dems that Boris Johnson is all but guaranteed to deliver Brexit by October 31	Nothing gets the Liberal Democrats more excited than the prospect of constitutional change. You name it, they’ve campaigned for it: direct elections to the Lords, votes for children, UK federalism and, of course, proportional representation. By 2010, another obsession – removing the right of the incumbent prime minister to dissolve parliament and call a fresh general election at a time of his own choosing – was pretty high up the agenda. The convention was unfair to opposition parties and allowed governments to set an election date that suited them best, it was (accurately) claimed. And so Liberal Democrats up and down the country agreed unanimously that a radical change was needed. Like local government elections, general elections should be held on a strict timetable. No sooner had the last election taken place than the next one could be written in your diary. In ink. It probably seemed like a good idea at the time. And when David Cameron, following the 2010 general election, made his “big, open and comprehensive” offer to the LibDems to join him in government, they saw their chance. Nick Clegg’s party eyed three major constitutional wins: reform of the Lords, a new electoral system for the Commons and fixed-term parliaments.
AUG12	I've voted Labour all my life but their latest attack on the countryside is a step too far	The latest eco-illiterate policy has permanently fractured the relationship between field sports enthusiasts and the Labour Party It’s hard to believe but once upon time, carrying a Labour party membership card in your hunting breeches or tweed plus fours, wasn’t uncommon.  After all, Engels regularly wrote to Marx about long days in the saddle with the Cheshire Hunt and one imagines, during the season, he’s up there looking down on the likes of the Banwen Miners’ foxhounds with a comradely smile. Meanwhile, I’ve heard old countrymen say the only good thing about the miners’ strikes is that it meant there was more time for fishing.
AUG12	No wonder they're worried about exams - we've robbed our children of the gift of independence	Helicopter parenting has created young people who are neurotic about failure and struggle to deal with it The A-level results come out this week and, naturally, many young people are feeling anxious. But maybe it’s not the high-stakes tests, or the students themselves, that are to blame. Maybe it’s not even the parents, though we love blaming them for most things. Maybe the real problem is that society has all but eradicated childhood independence, leaving young people no way to build the confidence that comes from handling some problems and pressures on their own.
AUG12	You thought the backstop was bad, but the rest of the Brexit deal is worse	The overlooked document would tie us to EU laws, and being overseen by the ECJ, in perpetuity The European Union has trade agreements with countries as distant as Canada and Korea, as small as Panama and Peru, and as poor as Ecuador and El Salvador. Yet for the United Kingdom – on the EU’s doorstep, the world’s fifth-largest economy, and the continent’s most capable military power – Brussels refuses to negotiate a trade deal unless it can control our laws. This is the reality of the humiliating Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by Theresa May. The backstop – or the “anti-democratic backstop”, as Boris Johnson calls it – is effectively a customs union. It can be applied to the whole of the UK, killing off an independent trade policy, or it can be applied only to Northern Ireland, imposing an internal border between the province and Great Britain.
AUG12	How did Michael Heseltine become the go-to Grandee Oracle on all things Brexit?	Michael Heseltine has somehow become the go-to TV Grandee Oracle on all things Brexit.

But why this sudden ascendance to become the face of a weekly televised winge-a-thon?

Arguably far more senior ‘grandee’ figures in the mainstream of their party barely get a look in. Big beasts like Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont held far more pivotal Governmental roles in the run up to and fallout from the formal creation of the European Union in 1992, but their insights on the European question – far more in line with the 70%+ of Conservative Party members who voted to leave the EU – feature much less frequently.
AUG13	Can your children trust their A-level results? I used to think so until my son opened his...	This scandal is not about my child, although he was one of its casualties. So I’ll begin with his story – but I want it to speak for the thousands of young people who are betrayed every year by our appalling, dysfunctional examination system. According to the exam regulator, Ofqual, two out of five teenagers taking certain A-levels will open their results tomorrow to find they have been given an “unreliable” grade. My heart goes out to them. I know all too well the pain that they and their parents will feel. Exactly 12 months ago, we were enjoying a family holiday in Italy with my son and his friend. As A-level results day approached, there was a slight static of apprehension in the air, but no real cause for concern. Both boys had worked hard and were expected to do really well. A dropped grade here or there would make no difference to their university prospects. It felt like one of those blessed weeks when you are glad to be alive.
AUG13	Fifty years on, the Troubles should be consigned to the past, not revived in the courts	Fifty years ago today saw the start of Operation Banner, the deployment of troops to Northern Ireland to stop Protestants and Catholics killing each other. Initially, 300 men from 1st Battalion The Prince of Wales Own Regiment were sent to Londonderry to quell the rioting known to history as the Battle of the Bogside. Harold Wilson, the prime minister, on holiday in the Scillies, liaised with James Callaghan, the Home Secretary, over what would prove to be a momentous decision, albeit one they had anticipated for some time amid worsening sectarian strife. At the end of April, Wilson told the Cabinet that “if it became necessary for the troops to intervene... the constitutional consequences might be very grave, and once we were involved it would be difficult to secure our withdrawal.” That was to prove prophetic; but Wilson still hoped that any deployment would be temporary. After the troops went in on August 14 at the request of the beleaguered Northern Ireland administration, the government declared it to be “a limited operation” lasting only as long as it took to restore order in Londonderry. That night, however, violence flared in Belfast with five people, including a child, shot dead in gun battles that raged across the city. Homes were set alight and mobs roamed the street. The province was on the brink of civil war.
AUG13	The jobs boom means the British economy is ready for anything	Britain’s jobs boom has once again produced another brilliant set of results. Regardless of the political debates, whatever the predictions and despite the global economic uncertainties, UK employment is going strong. New data show that we have a record high level of employment, with 32.8 million people in work, an increase of over 3.7 million people since 2010 which is more than the entire population of Birmingham. It is true that there has been uncertainty, and like other nations the UK is facing global economic headwinds. But the fact remains that we are well braced for that – our economy is still predicted to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan.
AUG13	If we're going to ban mobiles in cars, why not ban squabbling children in the back too?	The publication of the Transport Select Committee’s Report on the use of mobile phones while driving is well-timed. At the end of July the Administrative Court decided that a driver who used his phone to film the aftermath of a traffic accident as he drove by had been correctly acquitted by the Isleworth Crown Court. The case confirmed what Telegraph columnist Fraser Nelson recently discovered through bitter experience: the existing law on use of a mobile phone by drivers is obscure, inconsistent and ridiculous. The upshot is that the law now states that you will get a £200 fine and 6 penalty points if you are caught using your hand-held mobile phone to make a call while driving; but not if you are “using” it as a camera, a calculator, a recording device, a word-processor, or any of the almost unlimited things that a modern smartphone can be used for which do not involve an “interactive communication function.” I won’t trouble you with the definition of that unlovely phrase, not least because the judges themselves more or less admitted that they didn’t know exactly what it meant. They weren’t even sure, for example, whether composing a text message (as opposed to sending it) counted as such a function, and I’m not sure whether it covers using your hand-held phone as a SatNav, as many people do, generally with considerable benefit to road safety.
AUG13	What could be more sexist than believing gender determines behaviour?	Send for the women! So goes the Amazonian-esque battle cry from Caroline Lucas who has asked 10 female politicians from all parties to join her in forming an "emergency cabinet" in a bid to stop a no-deal Brexit. It's an idea that is as fantastically preposterous as it is extraordinarily sexist. For apparently, according to Ms Lucas, it's gender, not integrity, experience or humanity, which determines behaviour. Let's set aside the fact that campaigning against a no-deal Brexit ignores the democratic will of the people – 50 per cent of whom are women and many of whom voted to leave Europe.
AUG13	The PM is siding with the people over the elite – no wonder his poll ratings are soaring	On both crime and Brexit, rejecting liberal orthodoxies has been a boon for Boris Johnson Is it any surprise that voters – as revealed in a poll commissioned by the Telegraph – are rejecting the synthetic outrage of parliamentarians who have plotted for months to undermine Parliamentary democracy and instead are now emphatically prepared to countenance the temporary suspension of the House of Commons in order to get Brexit done? It is difficult to blame the electorate for feeling angry and frustrated at how out of touch MPs are, but an estrangement between the governing classes and those in whose name they govern is hardly new. After all, crowds gathered on the south bank of the Thames in October 1834 to cheer on the conflagration that engulfed the Palace of Westminster by fire, so it’s plus ca change.
AUG13	Only in Remainer fantasyland would the British people want more dither and delay	It is safe to say that the Telegraph's latest survey, conducted by ComRes, should make sobering reading for the political class. The vast majority of those surveyed (89 per cent) feel that MPs ignore the wishes of voters over Brexit to push their own agendas, that Parliament is out of touch with the public (88 per cent), that it is not more in tune with voters than the avowed Brexiteer Boris Johnson (62 per cent) can claim to  be. What's more, they are right behind the Prime Minister's pledge to deliver Brexit "come what may" by October 31, with 54 per cent agreeing that he needs to deliver Brexit by any means, including suspending Parliament to prevent MPs from stopping it. Such findings should have provided a wake-up call for Remainers in their tireless efforts to keep Brexit at bay. Instead, their response to the suggestion that their anti-Brexit crusade is only disenchanting voters has been to assume that the poll's conclusions must be wrong.
AUG13	Don't our woke universities have better things to do than debate the ethics of beef stroganoff?	As someone who hasn’t eaten meat for 16 years due to the childhood anguish of watching Babe, it might surprise people to know that I do not support Goldsmith University’s recent campus ban on beef. The institution has awoken to the calls of Greta Thunberg and the Extinction brigade, and is taking a series of measures to cut its carbon footprint. Some of the university’s moves are really quite fine. Goldsmiths plans to increase solar panels across its New Cross premises, for instance, and has donated non-perishable food to charities once every term. Vive la (climate change) résistance, I say.  But the issue is when climate change activism starts to infringe on individual liberty, which is exactly what taking beef off the menu does. Universities are one of the first places where teenagers around the country get to experience freedom; where they don’t have Mum and Dad breathing down their necks, or telling them to finish their greens. It is not for academic institutions to take up the baton through dictating what students should eat, any more than they should decide what time they go to bed at night.
AUG13	The Conservatives must capitalise on free schools' remarkable success and make school choice a reality for all	We are still stuck with too many chronically poorly performing schools A decade ago I founded the New Schools Network – the charity that helps teachers, schools, and communities launch new Free Schools. At the time, the Conservatives were still in opposition and Free Schools weren’t government policy. Two things stick in my memory. First, the latent demand for new, better schools. Despite being a tiny charity arguing for a policy that the then Government hated, we uncovered hundreds of groups around the country that wanted to provide a better local education.
AUG13	Can the BBC save me at last from the secret shame of never having read Proust?	What a relief to leave reading all 3,200 pages of the French novelist's masterpiece to Radio 4's star-studded cast instead “For a long time I used to go to bed early.” Here we go. Limber up. Flex those reading muscles. It’s the annual attempt to read Marcel Proust. “Sometimes, when I had put out my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say ‘I’m going to sleep.’” And just like that, within two sentences, I’m flagging, eyes closing, book drooping. Maybe next year… I’ve tried, really I have. Last year I got almost the whole way through the first chapter. That was after a trip to Trouville where Proust used to stay at the Hôtel des Roches Noires. Inspired by the spirit of Marcel I once again opened the first volume of Remembrance of Things Past and started the latest doomed crack at Swann’s Way.
AUG14	Tory arch-Remainers will soon find they have no place left in their party	A split is imminent, but the likes of Philip Hammond are unable to see that they’ll be on the losing side It’s Brexit by Hallowe’en, do or die, as Boris Johnson so rightly put it. After a spectacular few weeks during which our new Prime Minister has dramatically reset the centre of gravity of British politics and confounded all of his sceptics, the shell-shocked forces of Remain are finally lumbering back into action. They are being led by the increasingly ludicrous Philip Hammond, who as chancellor blocked no-deal preparations, vetoed crucial Brexit spending plans and was more responsible than anybody else for Theresa May’s catastrophic treaty. The new team at No  10 keeps uncovering fresh, shocking evidence of his handiwork. His strategy, shared with John Bercow and Dominic Grieve, appears to be to signal to Brussels not to compromise: the rebels will neuter the Government, so the Eurocrats should stick to their guns.
AUG14	Guinness World Records should reward the weird, wacky and relentlessly committed – not honour dictators	I broke a literary world record, in a gruelling ordeal  The Guinness Book of Records was designed as authoritative compendium of extraordinary human achievements and superlative natural facts, from the grotesque (“Fattest Person Ever”) and downright wacky – like the man who balanced a 10 stone refrigerator on his teeth – to the truly breathtaking (the exquisitely, minutely carved tree trunk which holds the record for the world’s longest wooden sculpture). The theme tune for the BBC TV show Record Breakers, written and performed by my good friend Roy Castle sums up the Guinness mentality perfectly: "If you want to be the best, if you want to beat the rest, dedication’s what you need". 
AUG14	Brexit in a blaze of no-deal glory would leave the climate, consumers and the Tories worse off	Since the referendum, I have long disagreed with my friend Boris on the nature of our future relationship with Brussels, not to mention the European market’s vital economic and regulatory importance for the UK. At present, I view Brexit as an unfolding travesty for which an extension of Article 50 to reach a workable deal or – failing that – a second referendum, are the sole remedies.  As for Mr Johnson, he appears inextricably tied to promises made to a narrow circle of arch-Brexiteers and primitive no-deal scaremongering which has already worn thin with EU leaders. Yet as we career towards a dangerous “no ifs no buts” showdown on 31st October, I believe it important to address the critical implications for business and society. No industry serves as a better case study for the imminent dangers of no-deal than energy.
AUG14	With Brexit looming, this year's silly season is the most serious one yet	Party politics occasionally, and far too rarely, throws up unexpected alliances. Not many, for example, have noticed the Tweet from Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, in defence of his former foe, Philip Hammond: “Johnson’s advisers have said ‘Everyone knows that the ex-chancellor’s real objective was to cancel the referendum result.’ Actually this is untrue. I was in the cross party negotiations & Hammond worked desperately hard to secure a deal that might carry.” But why would McDonnell support Hammond’s bid to delay Brexit, a delay that would plunge the Conservative Party into an almost certain death spiral of chaos and division? It’s a mystery. Journalists and politicians have different views about the so-called silly season that descends on Westminster after MPs pack their swimming trunks and head to sunnier climes. What snippets of news emerge during this period are usually exaggerated and blown out of all proportion, just to fill space. Caroline Lucas’s mad scheme for an all-woman cabinet to sort out Brexit is a perfect example of such a story.
AUG14	Sexist adverts like these need to be banned - even if no one's complaining	Rousing classical music, slow motion camera work, a slogan appears on screen... “When we learn to adapt we can achieve anything.” So far, so standard for a car advert. It goes on: men float around in space, camp at the top of sheer cliffs and take part in para-athletics. Amazing feats of human endeavour. The women? One sits on a bench, next to a pram, drinking coffee. The other is asleep - presumably trying to dream bigger. 
AUG14	The Chinese regime may be brutal, but it cannot simply crush the Hong Kong protests	Chinese media have been showing intimidating video of columns of Armoured Personnel Carriers and military trucks massing on it southern border, just across the water from Hong Kong, as the news reports speak in increasingly doom-laden tones of the “crimes” and “terrorism” taking place on the island. Fears have been raised, both in Hong Kong and here in Britain, that this is Beijing laying the propaganda groundwork for a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown. Key differences, however, separate us from the brutal events in Beijing in 1989. The hard choices that China's leaders face today are very different from those of 30 years ago. 
AUG14	Hating a no-deal Brexit won't stop it  — is Philip Hammond ready to do whatever it takes?	Philip Hammond may no longer be Chancellor, but he wants everyone to know today that it does not mean he will not sit silently as the Brexit process unfolds. He has taken his message across Twitter, the pages of the Times newspaper and the airwaves of BBC Radio 4. And there is much he said in his media blitz that will bemuse Brexiteers. Mr Hammond breezily pronounced on the Today programme that leaving the European Union without a deal would be "just as much a betrayal of the referendum result as not leaving at all", despite being ill-equipped to hold forth on how best to honour the Leave vote given he zealously campaigned for the opposite result.
AUG14	Remainer Bercow isn't just demeaning his office, he's damaging our entire political system	With the clock running down and the possibility of Parliament intervening to stop the Government delivering Brexit on October 31 much reduced, increasingly desperate Remain MPs are, once again, looking to an unlikely hero to save them. Right on cue, John Bercow has puffed out his chest, raised himself up to his full height and roared defiantly that he will not allow the Prime Minister to sideline the Remain-heavy Commons. Politics is both extraordinary engaging and profoundly dark at the moment. It is hard to know where to begin, but perhaps with a question: which other Speaker in our history has made a national intervention such as the one made from a stage at the Edinburgh Fringe by the ever-theatrical Bercow? 
AUG14	Remainers lack the courage to defend the EU's dangerous plans for a federal Europe	The Remainers who want to override the democratic wishes of the British people are getting into full swing as they once again try to find a parliamentary means of blocking Brexit. There is a consequent danger that those of us who campaigned and voted to leave the EU will be drawn into procedural arguments rather than those of substance. So it is worth reminding ourselves why staying in the EU would be bad for Britain. It is also worth remembering that, in the referendum itself, the Remainers only ever made the case against Brexit and never had the courage to make the case for staying in the EU. Their reasons were clear: they knew that the one thing that was not on offer in 2016 was the status quo. Either we took control of our own future or we would be incorporated into a Europe that was determined to press on with ever-closer union. And nothing that has happened in the EU since suggests that the outcome will be anything other than we predicted. From the French President to the new Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, political, economic and security integration show no sign of slowing down.
AUG14	Philip Hammond got us into this mess. How dare he lecture Boris Johnson now	Imagine being on an aircraft coming in to land when the captain and her co-pilot abort touchdown at the last minute. Then imagine them aborting it again shortly afterwards.  Mercifully, there is another crew on board. So the captain is carted off, the co-pilot also removed and the new team in the cockpit calm the passengers by making an unequivocal promise that this time they will land. From first class to steerage, the passengers feel their stress levels subside thanks to the new pilot’s obvious assurance. Suddenly the former co-pilot stands up and shouts: “You are doing it wrong, give me back the controls!”
AUG15	Fifty years on from Woodstock, the times are a-changing again	It’s half a century since Woodstock took place and its legend seems to grow with every year that passes. At the time, it was a spectacular music concert marked by cheap drugs, free love and (once the fences collapsed) free entry. But Woodstock has been remembered as a social big bang: the moment where the young rebelled against dogma and authority and started to shape a new, more relaxed world order. A party that started in August 1969 but never really stopped, eventually dragging politics and culture along with it. In truth, any number of events in the late Sixties could be taken to symbolise all this – but Woodstock is as good as any. It marked the end of a decade where social norms had changed forever, reshaping the world for future generations of politicians. The guitar-strumming Tony Blair and the saxophone-blowing Bill Clinton were both examples. Their “third way” politics morphed into the “modernisation” of David Cameron and George Osborne – which was, in truth, quite dated by that time. Politicians have a harder time changing the records that are playing in their heads. This became obvious when new questions – about identity, vulnerability, nationhood and community – started to be raised by voters. The Woodstock mindset is to dismiss this as nostalgia for the Fifties, rather than justified concern for what the 2020s has in store. But this not only alienates voters, forcing them into the hands of populists, but risks blinding governments to deep-seated problems piling up in front of them.
AUG15	Bypassing Parliament is an authoritarian step too far, even to secure Brexit	Had someone told you, three years ago, that in the aftermath of voting to leave the European Union, British people would awake to the sight of riot police beating members of the public for defending their democracy and their right to protest, you would probably have condemned it as a smear tactic; another facet of ‘project fear’. We haven’t reached the stage in the UK where British citizens are the ones being beaten up. But from Hong Kong to Paris, it has become as regular an occurrence as night following day. And it is all over the media. These bastions of liberal thought and tolerance have descended into miniature warzones, as authorities have cracked down on people for having the wrong opinions, and wanting things to deviate from paths set by political masters. We are beginning to see the first glimmers of similar discontent across the anglosphere — what began with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump has been followed by increasingly frequent climate protests and pro-Remain and Leave demonstrations in London, to running battles between MAGA and ANTIFA protestors in the US. 
AUG15	If we really want to be able to trust A-level results, we need a single exam board	It is appallingly cruel to suggest to the hundreds of thousands of young people who received their A-level results today that the examinations they worked so hard for are losing their credibility quicker than the melting of the polar ice cap. Yet sometimes one has to be cruel to be kind. There is something rotten in our examination system, and government action has not gone to the root of the problem. The symptoms are easy to see. Nearly 76,000 students received unconditional offers from universities this year, in a clear rejection of the value of A-level. Leading universities are more and more tending to set their own examinations, bypassing A-level. The value of A-level was further hit by the news that, for some boards, only 14 per cent was required to pass A-level Mathematics, and an A grade was secured with just 54 per cent (in other words, the student getting nearly half the answers wrong). How would we have reacted if the scientists in charge of the moon landing had got half their maths wrong? A contributing factor to the declining value of A-level is the pressure the Government places on universities to allow disadvantaged students the offer of a place with low grades – a worthy aim, but a classic illustration of the law of unintended consequences. Not only does it devalue A-level, but it also encourages schools not to improve standards and to ensure that disadvantaged students are as well taught as everyone else.
AUG15	This pointless row over a 'caretaker' government just highlights Labour and Lib Dem weaknesses	News is like an ideal gas: it expands to fill the available space. This is why in August, when most MPs are either working on their tans or pressing the flesh in their constituencies, the political news tends to get increasingly silly and shrill in an effort to fill the available space. The latest Brexit row, which if you are lucky enough to be on a desert island you may have missed, is about a formation of a government of national unity, whereby various big names from across the party divide, united only by a shared aversion to a no-deal Brexit, would form a temporary government to seek an extension of the Article 50 process and a fresh election. The idea started life as a ruse by allies of Ed Davey, the defeated candidate in the Liberal Democrat leadership election, to subtly talk up their man’s credentials to be leader. Unlike Jo Swinson, who defeated him, Davey was a Secretary of State in the coalition government. The argument failed to move Liberal Democrat activists but has enjoyed a strange second life as a way to prevent Brexit.
AUG15	Greta Thunberg may be annoying, but at least she isn't a hypocrite	For all her youthful zeal Thunberg is at the coal-face, valiantly attempting to do her bit Personally I blame the pigtail. Set against today's pouty teenagers who preen on Instagram and worship at the altar of Love Island, Greta Thunberg's worthiness, her earnest expression and unflinching delivery are a little hard to place. But is the absolutism, the zeal and purity of her message really worthy of the opprobrium currently being heaped on the 16 year-old activist?
AUG15	I'm all for MPs changing their minds, but does Sarah Wollaston believe in anything at all?	God save us from a world in which our politicians cannot change their minds. Time and again I have found that ordinary voters not only respect MPs who publicly switch position on one issue or another – they positively welcome it. And yet our political culture is in thrall to the worship of consistency: “Ah, but ten years ago on Twitter you said something entirely different to your views today!” The ultimate political slam-dunk is to prove that someone has, presumably after considering the evidence, changed their views. To those who not only change their minds but change their parties as well, the consequences are bleak. Political apostasy, like the spiritual kind, is the unforgiveable sin. If you joined a party at the age of 15, then obviously, 30 years on, you must have exactly the same views and principles. 
AUG15	Remainers' dream of a 'national unity government' is doomed to fail — and rightly so	If Boris Johnson's Remain opponents persuade the House of Commons to declare no confidence in his premiership, and confidence in someone else, they could catapult them into Downing Street. Remainers are awfully excited about that thought, as they have been busy imagining who they could send in with a mission to delay, if not cancel, Brexit. After her offer to lead an "emergency Cabinet" staffed entirely by female Remainers was roundly rejected and mocked, Caroline Lucas had to admit that she was merely trying to "start a debate". That debate has certainly taken off, with Remainers considering a flock of fantasy alternative Prime Ministers, such as the backbenchers Ken Clarke to Yvette Cooper. 
AUG15	Orwellian health policies could drive our favourite treats off the shelves	The food we eat everyday – whether it be bought from supermarket shelves or high street cafes – is being silently changed by an Orwellian public health policy called “reformulation”. The government, through Public Health England, is setting targets for the salt, sugar, and calories contained in everyday food items. For most items, sugar and calories must be reduced by 20 per cent. The programme covers not just “unhealthy” foods like crisps and chocolates, but also foods that people would consider healthy, such as boxed salads, nut butters, or olive ciabatta. Very few items escape their grasp. Officials even made recommendations for the amount of milk that should be in tea, and are monitoring the sugar content of whole fruit juice.
AUG15	Rising fares, domineering unions and passenger angst spell existential crisis for public transport in Britain	Declining customer numbers and domineering unions spell disaster for franchise operators Rail industry panjandrums like to claim that we are living through a golden age for the train. Shiny renovated stations, sleek modern carriages, everything automated and high speed: while there is much still to do, rail is on the brink of a “renaissance”, they say, after the dark ages of nationalisation. And it is true that the semi-privatisation Jeremy Corbyn so despises has delivered where the state could not. Investment is up, and car-driving pensioners in Derbyshire are no longer expected to subsidise the daily commute of stockbrokers from Surrey, or at least not to such a great extent. Never mind the occasional fiasco, such optimism is based on what might be seen as a virtuous circle: the idea that ever-increasing passenger numbers will pump ever-more money into an ever-better system. Thus, there was little regret among officials and ministers at the announcement yesterday that fares will rise by 2.8 per cent in the New Year. It is all part of the plan – commuter grumbles be damned.
AUG15	The robotic middle class is trapped in The Matrix, but is there a way to escape?	The biggest elite lie fed to the middle class in modern history is that 'progress' is linear. In fact, steroidic globalised innovation is dangerously circular. Medievalism is not some 600-year-old blood spatter fading into forgottenness in the history hardbacks that British students increasingly spurn. These days feudalism wears a white lab coat and is using technology to destroy capitalism.  The internet is a backwards plutocracy where human value does not derive from profit-driving labour but from personal data, seized by our tech masters in the shadows without any payment in exchange. From accounting to brain surgery, AI robots are elbowing the middle class out of the jobs market on a scale that will eventually lead to unprecedented unemployment. To bastardise Francis Fukuyama, we are heading towards the end of capitalism: the final chapter is a tragic tale of consumerism’s collapse (as we’ll all be on the dole), the scientific discrediting of libertarianism (as neurologists peddle the bogus claim that free will is a biochemical illusion) – and the crushing of the aspirational middle-class spirit is the ethereally clinical concluding sentence. 
AUG16	Book festival audience asked: who believes in angels?	In an increasingly secular society with church attendances apparently plummeting everywhere, how come people – even atheists – believe in angels? That was one of the posers that Richard Holloway, the former Episcopal bishop of Edinburgh, put before what he reckoned was a predominately Presbyterian audience at the International Book Festival yesterday. I’m not at all sure that he was correct in the latter assumption but there is no doubt that the belief in angels transcends all Christian denominations, as well as those of Judaism and Islam.
AUG16	Sacred Mysteries: Why is Anne a familiar name, but not Joachim?	I don’t quite know why Joachim is such an unusual name in Britain when Anne is so familiar and often taken by royalty. The names are those given by convention to the mother and father of the Virgin Mary. Plenty of parish churches are dedicated to St Anne (one in Belfast having been elevated to a cathedral), but I know of none dedicated to St Joachim, apart from Catholic churches such as the one in Wick, where the patronal feast took place in mid-August, during the herring season. The source for their names is an apocryphal work from the second century called the Gospel of James, which provides prequels to the Gospel accounts of the birth of Jesus. The popularity of St Anne and St Joachim gained a big boost from the inclusion of their story from the Gospel of James in the compilation of saints’ lives called The Golden Legend, edited by Jacobus de Voragine in the second half of the 13th century.
AUG16	Talking about the beauty gap in business stops us discussing the real problems that exist for female entrepreneurs	Clarissa Farr – former headmistress of two prestigious girls’ schools – came under fire this week for suggesting that success in business is in some way linked to a woman’s appearance. It is frustrating that someone with such unique insight into young women’s attitudes towards business or career aspirations has kicked this particular hornet’s nest.  “When you google the word CEO, the images are all white men with grey hair,” Farr remarked. “Our idea of authority is still male. There are certain woman whose personal beauty makes their leadership acceptable who wouldn’t be able to hold the sway they do if they didn’t look the way they do.” By way of example, she cited Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and British financier Helena Morrissey.  One can only imagine what her Paulinas – some of whom will have just received their A-Level results – make of the remarks.
AUG16	The tragic death of one of my officers must be a wake up call for our soft justice system	I speak for everybody at Thames Valley Police when I say that I am deeply shocked and saddened by the death of PC Andrew Harper while on duty. He was a young officer, only very recently married, and looking forward to a long and successful career within policing. Today, assaults on police officers have become far too commonplace, as have assaults on prison officers, and I am concerned that attacks on police officers are no longer regarded within some communities with the same level of seriousness as they were previously. In the past most criminals were careful not to attack a police officer. They realised that the penalties were severe. But as sentences across the board have become more lenient, so the number of assaults increased. There would seem to be a clear correlation between the two.
AUG16	The Remain ultras are playing straight into Boris Johnson's hands	Although reportedly a fan of Bismarck, the Prime Minister’s canny strategist Dominic Cummings seems to have been listening this week to the works of another military guru, the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu, author of The Art of War and the man responsible for the maxim: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” From Downing Street’s point of view, the erratic, panicked response of the Remain refusenik rump in Parliament to the impending and likely irreversible EU exit on October 31 is exactly what they expected and have planned for. Theirs is not the tone-deaf operation of the May regime but a tight, focused and ruthless team effort which will take no prisoners and use every mechanism available to get the job done. It’s no wonder that many civil servants, special advisors and most MPs feel the smack of firm government is a refreshing change of style.
AUG16	Pets aren't like children, and it's ludicrous that people behave as if they are	My primary school teacher’s cat Sooty went missing. When his body was found under a hedge, I gave her a plastic brooch I’d bought on holiday. She looked pleased but a little later put her coat on and disappeared. We’d no idea where she’d gone and it wasn’t until I was an adult that my mother told me she’d been so moved by my gift that she’d had to go home for the afternoon. No one spoke about it and she was back the next day as if nothing had happened. I also remember a friend on a hard-bitten newspaper going home early after the death of her cat. It was understood that she was hors d ’combat.   So I was annoyed to read that teenager Emma McNulty, from Glasgow, was sacked from a fast food outlet for taking a day off after the death of her family dog. She claims management did not accept the death of her pet as a valid excuse.  What a hard world we live in I thought, but also a mad one; Ms McNulty has decided to try to change the law. Her petition – to introduce pet bereavement leave – has attracted nearly 10,000 signatures. She’s received a wave of support. One such, Louise Stephen said, “I don’t have children, I have chosen a dog instead. She is my world. If something happens to her, I’m not allowed time off to take her to the vet and not entitled to leave when she passes away. Yet if I have a child I can do these things.”
AUG16	Having a single exam board would make no difference to A-level results	Every August brings complaints about A-levels. The latest suggestion is that there should be a single national awarding body for schools examinations. This idea has been around for years: Michael Gove, for instance, considered nationalising exams. Complaints mainly seem to focus on the unreliability of results (manifested by high numbers of appeals) and on apparently falling standards. But is the existence of competing boards really the problem here? As with calls to renationalise railways, utilities or Royal Mail, we should be wary of simplistic solutions. Many of the problems faced are either intrinsic to the services involved, or the result of ham-fisted government regulation.
AUG16	Stop telling us you'll do "anything" to stop no deal, Remainers – it simply isn't true	Leavers have many reasons to be grateful to their Remainer opponents. It really isn’t a good look for any politician to be caught quite so red-handed when they perform a u-turn over any major policy. But on the Labour side we have Tom Watson, Sir Keir Starmer and Jeremy Corbyn all having pledged to honour the 2016 referendum, only for a few months later to claim that doing so would be unforgiveable and that another referendum is needed. On the Tory side we’ve seen a similar state of affairs. Dominic Grieve, the arch Remainer-in-Chief, promised his constituents he would respect the referendum result. Two years later? Not so much. Chuka Umunna, the Liberal Democrat MP, warned back when he was a Labour MP not only that there should not be a second referendum but that we should even be prepared to sacrifice membership of the EU single market in order to end freedom of movement. As with the case of Dr Sarah Wollaston, about whom I wrote yesterday, we are left with the difficulty of judging which of these positions is the one that most accurately reflects the position of the politician in question. Boris Johnson is still, to this day, castigated by angry Remainers (the “angry” may be a superfluous descriptive) for writing two opposing articles on the issue on the eve of his decision to support the Leave campaign. And yet the same people invite us to trust the word of politicians who have publicly and shamelessly reversed their position.
AUG16	A triumphant Brexit can spell the end of the EU by showing Europe how to save itself	The EU can only cope with one existential crisis at a time. This autumn, it could well face two. The threat of a no deal Brexit, of course, is one. The other is an election in Italy. Make no mistake, in seeking to trigger fresh elections, Matteo Salvini wants a mandate from Italian voters to destroy the EU’s growth and stability pact. At this point, it’s hard to see any reason why Italians would turn down Salvini’s wish to free Italy from the fetters of the EU’s fiscal rules. Set out in the Maastricht treaty’s excessive deficit procedure limiting eurozone governments’ freedom to spend and borrow, the pact’s fiscal rules were crucial to Germany accepting the euro. Germans would never have agreed...
AUG16	University should be a place for intellectual challenge, not virtue signalling	Excitement at the prospect of starting university must be somewhat tempered for those unfortunate enough to have a place at Goldsmiths, University of London. Plans unveiled this week reveal that burgers will no longer be served in any Goldsmiths’ outlet. The ban on beef is is intended to cut carbon emissions and help the institution go green. But the message to those picking up their A level results is clear: forget impressive exam passes, at Goldsmiths we think you are far too stupid to be left to decide for yourself what to have for lunch. It’s not just Goldsmiths - every university seems to be desperately rushing to brandish its green credentials. Universities across the UK have been divesting in fossil fuels; reinvesting in low carbon technologies; banning straws, carrier bags and disposable cups; turning lights and heating off, and reducing car parking spaces. Each measure is, of course, accompanied by a fan fare of publicity. But each measure also reduces the scope for personal decision making and for staff and students to think through environmental concerns and reach their own conclusions.
AUG17	I'll make sure our heroic police officers get the protection they deserve	The brutal and mindless killing of Pc Andrew Harper on Thursday was an appalling and sickening act. It has shocked the nation. I have written to Pc Harper’s family to express my condolences and I know his death will continue to cause immeasurable pain for his loved ones and colleagues in the years to come. That is why I have instructed the Home Office to urgently explore what we can do to better support the families of our brave police officers who are seriously injured, or worse, by criminals. Pc Harper began his career as a volunteer police officer. He was the very best of British policing. The bravery he showed by heading towards danger to protect the public is extraordinary. He is a hero.  Our police officers are on the front line of a battle to maintain control of our streets. Like Pc Harper, they put their lives on the line day in, day out, every time they go on patrol. They act with extraordinary courage, professionalism and dedication.
AUG17	Spare me the peace and love mythology of Woodstock – there's nothing more phoney than a festival	It was fifty years ago this week that Woodstock stopped the Vietnam War and ushered in a new era of peace, love and understanding – sorry, that should read when 400,000 hippies sat in mud sharing one toilet for every 800 people like a bunch of huge overgrown toddlers staging a dirty protest. They had turned their backs on conventional society but when it turned out that they couldn’t even feed themselves, the ladies of the local Jewish community centre prepared 30,000 sandwiches which were handed out by local nuns. Despite their railing against authority, more than 300 off-duty policemen were drafted in to keep order along with several hundred State Troopers and personnel from a nearby airport base to airlift the precious performers. One hopes they were being paid more than the onsite workers who were on a miserable $1.60 per hour minimum wage compared to, say, Santana, who were getting $2,000 per hour. But at least none of them were amongst the three deaths that occurred including a man run over in his sleeping bag by a never-identified tractor driver and an 18-year-old Marine who had survived Vietnam but overdosed on some of the nasty drugs circulating, many of which were laced with rat poison. 
AUG17	The EU’s devout belief in the doctrine of integration is pushing us towards no deal	I’m running out of ways to say this so I’ll just have to repeat, in slightly different words and in a more exasperated voice, what I have written before on this page. It is the European Union, not Boris Johnson’s government, which is making a no deal Brexit more likely. The Withdrawal Agreement signed off by Theresa May has been rejected comprehensively, overwhelmingly, with record-breaking majorities, by the UK Parliament three times. It is inconceivable that a new prime minister – this one or any other – could regard it as viable. It is definitively, unalterably, irrefutably dead. The Johnson government has asked for further negotiations to remedy this stalemate. The EU says that there can be no further negotiations. Ergo this deal is the only one that is now, or ever will be, available. Ergo there is no other possible way for the UK to leave the EU except without a deal. So I ask you: who is being unreasonable here? (Oddly, I have not heard a single BBC interviewer pose this question.)
AUG17	Reducing sky-high aviation taxes will help the economy take off	As the new Chancellor considers his inaugural budget, his focus will rightly be on ensuring that our economy continues to grow and that businesses are free to make the most of a truly global Britain. To achieve this, he must look with urgency at our sky-high taxes on aviation. Driven on by past Treasury ministers, Air Passenger Duty (APD) has increased by 680 per cent for long-haul travel and 160 per cent for short-haul since its introduction in 1994, leaving us with the highest aviation taxes in Europe by some distance.  The UK’s world-class aviation sector is vital to our post-Brexit future. The recent Hainan Airlines service from Manchester Airport to China saw UK export values from the airport increase by 265 per cent to £200 million a month and inward investment in Manchester double. But too few game-changing routes like this are being created. For the past two years, the UK has been the only major economy in Europe to suffer a decline in direct air connectivity. For an island nation this is simply not good enough. A study last year by Frontier Economics examined how the tax influences the way airlines choose, develop and maintain routes. It showed that, by increasing the price of a ticket by up to £78 for long-haul economy travel, the Government is directly contributing to fewer connections at UK airports and lower frequency on existing services. As a consequence, we are currently missing out on at least 60 new routes, including long-haul connections to emerging markets.
AUG17	So, you didn't get the A-level result you wanted - it could be the best thing that happens to you	Like many people, I remember the day I got my A-Level results like it was yesterday. And like many people, that day was categorically not yesterday - in my case, it was 21 years ago. Still, the memory of that traumatic period of my life is etched deeply into my brain, unlike any of the information I obsessively memorised in preparation for my exams. It was 1998. Tony Blair was banging on about ‘education, education, education.’ I had just been put on antidepressants for the first time, a wreck burnt out from exam stress. We always think that depression and anxiety in young people is a new thing, a modern phenomenon bought on by social media and an uncertain political future, when in fact it is as old as the hills. Or at least as old as me. Even then, standards were slipping. Commentators in newspapers boiled with indignation about how easy A-Levels were becoming, the pieces were illustrated with pictures of pretty young girls clutching results and hugging each other. I am pretty sure that if you were to find a newspaper from A-Level results day 1998, the reports on the declining standards of our youth would be identical to the ones we have seen this week, and the only thing that would have changed is the stories around them. The parlous state of the youth of today is a subject that never gets old, unlike the people discussing it.
AUG17	India and Pakistan must look beyond Kashmir	It’s not often that either of us would agree with the Russian assessment of a major geopolitical issue. But on India and Pakistan’s rekindled dispute over Kashmir, we believe the Kremlin has it right: the changes made by India last week to the status of Jammu and Kashmir have been made within the framework of India’s constitution and the long-standing territorial dispute should be resolved bilaterally by Pakistan and India in accordance with relevant UN resolutions. The permanent members of the Security Council appear to have little appetite to interfere in this issue. One of the reasons for this caution is serious misgivings about Pakistan’s motivations, particularly the concern that Islamabad is trying to internationalise the issue of Kashmir to distract attention from its domestic failings. The prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, would be well advised to stop expending precious diplomatic and financial capital on the Kashmir issue in order to focus instead on the development of his country, which stands on the verge of bankruptcy, as it negotiates yet another multibillion-dollar bailout from the IMF. What Pakistan has long resisted accepting is that the country’s most serious existential threat is not India; it is internal extremists – together with inadequately developed economic opportunities. The strategic fixation of Pakistan’s military and intelligence services on the perceived threat from India has been useful to them domestically – and maddening to its friends overseas; however, it has for far too long led governmental agencies to pursue the wrong priorities.
AUG17	Before Brexit, we lived in an age of political apathy. God, I miss it	Tell you what I miss about being young. Not the music, or the friendships, or the parties, or the sense of hope and freedom and optimism. None of that nonsense. What I really miss is the political apathy. Twenty years ago, when I was in my late teens, political apathy was all the rage. The public, by and large, no longer seemed to be interested in politics. And this made politicians worried. Political commentators, too. They were constantly fretting about it. In newspapers, practically every political column was about the lack of interest in politics.
AUG17	Sacred Mysteries: My shameful sojourn in the Ringing Chamber	Cheryl, the tower guide, called down the spiral stairs to her assistant: “Put him in the Ringing Chamber.” It was I who was put in the Ringing Chamber, and it was a kind act. I had bitten off more than I could chew by attempting the turret stair to the top of the central tower of Winchester Cathedral. We were warned of views down from heights and shoulder-narrow passages, as on the turret stair. I hadn’t reckoned on the shallow treads of the steps and my knee gave out. It was humiliating, but the guides could not have been kinder or more professional in minimising risk. The Ringing Chamber was full of interest – a big room as square as the tower, with well preserved Norman arches on each side, a clock that whirred and chimed at the quarters and boards recording peals of 5002 Stedman Cinques in 1938 or 5280 Cambridge Surprise Maximus rung in 2006 in four hours 11 minutes.
AUG17	Our anti-capitalist, anti-Western universities no longer care about excellence	I always took some persuading to believe that Goldsmiths, University of London, actually existed. For years I had assumed it to be a fictional creation, possibly of Peter Simple’s invention. It seemed fired into being solely as a means by which to highlight the great comedy of British public life.  The institution’s announcement this week that it plans to ban beefburgers in order to tackle climate change only served to bolster this long-held prejudice. And yet, with some regularity, people claiming to be from Goldsmiths appear in public, insisting that they are real. Last year this occurred when The Guardian published a letter purporting to come from “40 senior academics”. Naturally it was in support of Jeremy Corbyn. Specifically it was an effort to “Stop Jeremy Corbyn’s trial by media over anti-Semitism”. There are some things so embarrassingly dim-witted that only a group of academics would pin their names to it. Such an occasion was this. And every aspect of the letter, when excavated, magnified the horror.
AUG17	Book festival audience asked: who believes in angels?	In an increasingly secular society with church attendances apparently plummeting everywhere, how come people – even atheists – believe in angels? That was one of the posers that Richard Holloway, the former Episcopal bishop of Edinburgh, put before what he reckoned was a predominately Presbyterian audience at the International Book Festival yesterday. I’m not at all sure that he was correct in the latter assumption but there is no doubt that the belief in angels transcends all Christian denominations, as well as those of Judaism and Islam.
AUG18	Letters: There can be no national unity if the referendum result is not honoured	SIR – How is any “national unity” government going to explain to 17.4  million people that in fact “national unity” means ditching the majority and imposing the minority view? Is this not how revolutions start? Alastair Muir Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire
AUG18	The West has become too reliant on its economic links with China	Take a moment and contemplate the bravery of the demonstrators in Hong Kong. Yesterday, confronted by mounting Chinese intimidation, 100,000 people took once more to the streets to defend democracy and civil rights. Ominously, video footage has emerged of a Chinese military buildup in nearby Shenzhen, and Beijing has begun to refer to the demonstrators as terrorists. This week, a senior Chinese diplomat said, “if Hong Kong’s situation deteriorates… the central government will not sit by and watch.” The central government, of course, is not queasy about oppressing civilians in the name of order. It has imprisoned around one million Uighur Muslims in detention camps. It is reportedly separating Muslim children from their families, religion and language, and there are claims that Muslim women are being sterilised against their will. Helpless minorities are not the only people in Beijing’s sights. Across the whole of China, the state is using mass surveillance, big data and internet technologies to build a social credit system to judge people’s civic worth. This Orwellian horror will allow the authorities to monitor and then either punish or reward individuals and businesses as they see fit. Even hardy British spooks – no strangers to surveillance – return from China shocked by the penetration of the state into everyday private life.
AUG18	He pleads ignorance, but Brexiteers fear Clarke still has half an eye on Number  10	The Remainers’ plan to replace Boris Johnson with Ken Clarke appeared to hit a snag when it seemed like the last person to learn about it was the veteran MP himself. Returning from a holiday in Norway, the former chancellor declared on Friday: “I haven’t been taking part in any talks with anybody for the last fortnight. I’ve been on the phone to one or two people in the last couple of days just to find out what the devil’s going on.” But the 79-year-old’s claim to having been out of the loop regarding plots by his fellow Remainers does appear, at the very least, curious.
AUG18	From gene editing to robotics, Brexit will free us to build the farms of the future	Boris Johnson’s unequivocal message that the Withdrawal Agreement is “dead” is good news for the UK’s farmers. Its dire ramifications would have all but ceded control of UK agriculture to the EU. We would not even have been free to decide the levels of financial support for landowners; the terms of the Agreement would have forced the UK to keep support for British producers pegged at the 2019 level while allowing EU competitors to increase theirs, handing them an enormous advantage. Abandoning this punitive Agreement, the UK can now build a bespoke system of agricultural support tailored to the needs of British farmers at or above the level which they receive under the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). To expand into new markets, we need to move away from production subsidies, but these can be more than replaced by a system of financial rewards for environmental and public goods – maintaining the cultural landscape, promoting soil quality, improving biodiversity, and providing effective water management.
AUG18	Keep your audiobooks, nothing beats the intimacy and joy of words on a page	It was while I was being read to that I first realised I could read. As a child I looked forward to the moment before bedtime, when I would look at the pictures in a storybook while my father read the words. One day I found that I was ahead of him. I had got to the bottom of the page while he was still intoning the list of things that Phyllis Krasilovsky’s Very Little Girl was smaller than. From that moment, I was launched as an independent reader – a transition as dramatic and liberating as that from crawling to walking. Being read to as a child is wonderful in many ways: you are introduced to storytelling – that most beguiling of human survival stratagems – and you experience the deep satisfaction of being safe and warm indoors while Mole and Badger are lost in the snowy Wildwood.
AUG18	The teaching unions hate them, but low-cost private schools like mine are here to stay	The low-cost private school that I co-founded in the north-east of England, the Independent Grammar School: Durham, has just successfully completed its first year. Fees are less than £3,000 per child per annum, the equivalent of 60 per cent of the per capita funding in state primary schools and less than a fifth of the fees in an average independent school. Every commentator said it couldn’t be done. The teaching unions were particularly vociferous in their opposition. It was, they said, “impossible to provide a quality education on such a low budget”. At our open evenings last summer, attendees had to run the gauntlet of union pickets as members foisted glossy leaflets on parents saying that we would cruelly deprive the children of essentials such as hot water and central heating. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), opined that it was “unbelievable” that you could run a school with such low fees. Well, unbelievable or not, we’ve done it.  No doubt Courtney was relieved when the Department for Education reminded everyone that, like all new independent schools, we would be inspected during our first year of operation and that if standards were not being met, the government would take “appropriate action”.
AUG18	Quangos will always be in the grip of the Left. There's no choice but to scrap them	Do the quangocrats never sleep? While the rest of us have been on holiday, the public bodies, executives and authorities that have assumed responsibility for overseeing swathes of national life have been busy preparing their latest barrage of pettifogging interference. The Advertising Standards Authority announced the first two “sexist” adverts banned under its new gender stereotyping rules. The Institute of Economic Affairs, meanwhile, released a paper finding that targets drawn up by Public Health England to cut sugar from the national diet will make it all but impossible to manufacture parma violets, Liquorice Allsorts and (my favourite) sherbet lemons. Steam train operators may need to spend millions in order to comply with health and safety rules ordered by the Office of Rail and Road after a passenger was killed on the (non-steam) Gatwick Express. Not to be outdone, the head of Natural England suggested that grouse moor owners should be prosecuted for the deaths of hen harriers on their land, even if they were not responsible.
AUG18	The Queen is a silent screen superheroine for our times	The trailer for the third series of The Crown, which will star  Olivia Coleman as Elizabeth II, was released this week. It has been a triumph for everyone involved: for Netflix, who bank-rolled it, for Peter Morgan, who wrote it, for Claire Foy and Matt Smith, who played the young Elizabeth II and Philip in the first two series. But it has mostly been a triumph for Elizabeth II herself; for The Crown.  The Crown was not created in some Clubland drawing room, by the sort of man who, if starring in The Crown would be played by Mark Gatiss doing his (quite wonderful) Mycroft Holmes schtick: the courtier keeping a nation safe. It is made by artists and progressives. And if progressives imagine their Elizabeth II is the real Elizabeth II - and they must - her reign can be judged a complete success.  Hollywood - likewise progressive - sees Elizabeth II as an entirely benevolent thing, and they have sanctified her with their own coronation. They awarded Helen Mirren with an Academy Award for her performance as Elizabeth II in The Queen - likewise written by Peter Morgan, who has dedicated his career to honouring her. (Her father George VI was also ennobled Hollywood-style, in the person of Colin Firth, for The King’s Speech, as was Helena Bonham-Carter as her mother Queen Elizabeth). 
AUG18	Woke professors are failing in their duty to teach students the value of open-mindedness	People keep asking me what I plan to do after Brexit. To be honest, I’ve always wanted to have a go at teaching. I have spent the past three weeks at a summer school in Normandy, tutoring, lecturing and marking essays for teenagers from around the world, and I have discovered two things. First, this is incredibly satisfying work. Second, and of more general interest, the censoriousness that has descended upon young people over the past five years – that odd blend of intolerance and grievance known as “the great awokening” – is largely a product of how they are being taught. I am here with the John Locke Institute, which prepares teenagers to go on to Oxford, Cambridge and elite US universities. This year, it is hosting 107 students from every continent (except, as far as I can tell, South America). They are a truly diverse cohort. I don’t mean diverse in the BBC sense of “people who look different but think the same”. I mean there is real heterodoxy – yes, of ethnicity and sex; but also of outlook and opinion.
AUG18	I'll make sure our heroic police officers get the protection they deserve	The brutal and mindless killing of Pc Andrew Harper on Thursday was an appalling and sickening act. It has shocked the nation. I have written to Pc Harper’s family to express my condolences and I know his death will continue to cause immeasurable pain for his loved ones and colleagues in the years to come. That is why I have instructed the Home Office to urgently explore what we can do to better support the families of our brave police officers who are seriously injured, or worse, by criminals. Pc Harper began his career as a volunteer police officer. He was the very best of British policing. The bravery he showed by heading towards danger to protect the public is extraordinary. He is a hero.  Our police officers are on the front line of a battle to maintain control of our streets. Like Pc Harper, they put their lives on the line day in, day out, every time they go on patrol. They act with extraordinary courage, professionalism and dedication.
AUG19	Boris Johnson can help bring some coherence to an incoherent West	A new British PM has the world’s attention and the goodwill of America When Boris Johnson arrives at his first G7 summit, in Biarritz this weekend, he will surely reflect on what an odd gathering it is. Recent annual meetings have ended in acrimony. The seating plan will reveal that there are not seven leaders but nine, since the heads of the EU Commission and Council are both permanently invited. Indeed, on this occasion there will be 12 for much of the time, since India, Australia and Spain have all been included, for very good reasons in each case. Most of the world’s media will be focused on whether 12 global leaders can get through 36 hours or so without a diplomatic disaster. Given the laudable themes chosen by the French hosts of fighting inequality, addressing the powers of the big tech companies and promoting biodiversity, can a meaningful communiqué be agreed on these issues with President Trump? Will the new British PM look as if he has any worthwhile relations with President Macron and Chancellor Merkel? Can this group agree on anything about how to handle Iran? In short, there is huge scope for the leadership of the western world to look more divided by the end of the meeting than at the beginning.
AUG19	Greta Thunberg is selling the rich an eco-lifestyle the rest of us will never be able to afford	I don’t understand all this fuss about Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old who’s sailing to America on a zero-emissions yacht (well, anything’s better than flying United). The Left hangs on her every word; the Right can’t stand her. Why? She’s just a kid. Because I’m an adult, I have absolutely no interest in what children have to say about anything, even if I agree with them. If Greta told me the Moon was made of cheese, I wouldn’t say “wow, tell me more!” or lose my temper, I’d just say, “That’s nice dear” and suggest she go and play outside. I might be old-fashioned, but so is Greta. Has it only occurred to me that Miss Thunberg is essentially a girl guide – zipping off around the world, collecting badges? I did all that stuff when I was a boy, too. We were forever going on nature rambles and learning the names of trees, and I could do more things with a pen knife than was strictly healthy. The only difference is that my scout troop never sailed to America because no newspaper round on earth could’ve paid for it. What Greta is selling – and I use that word on purpose – is an upper-middle-class lifestyle. She belongs precisely where you can find her: on the cover of GQ magazine. Environmentalism is as much a way of living as the Atkins diet or Kundalini yoga. Some of the Royals are in on it. No one can deny the admirable passion that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle feel about the environment – so much that Harry said he would probably only have two babies “maximum”. In July he wrote on Instagram, “With nearly 7.7 billion people inhabiting this Earth, every choice, every footprint, every action makes a difference.”
AUG19	Don’t ask Jeremy Corbyn this awkward question about Brexit... his fans hate it	It would probably be possible for MPs to avert a no-deal Brexit – if only it weren’t for two types of people. One: Remainers who would rather have a no-deal Brexit than make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister. And two: Remainers who would rather have a no-deal Brexit than make anyone except Jeremy Corbyn prime minister. Fortunately for Boris Johnson, both groups appear to be strong in number. Especially the second, judging by the behaviour on Monday of Mr Corbyn’s supporters. During a speech in Corby, Northamptonshire, the Labour leader pledged to do “everything necessary” to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Journalists attempted to put this promise to the test. If Mr Corbyn failed to form a caretaker government of his own, asked Andy Bell of 5 News, would he be willing to help another opponent of no-deal form one?
AUG19	Here’s why we can survive No Deal far better than the pessimists fear	Free markets are brilliant at adapting to change The M20 turned into a snarling car park. The shelves at Tesco emptied off everything apart from a few root vegetables. Doctors running out of medicines, the army patrolling the streets to prevent rioting, and the government re-opening its Cold War nuclear bunkers as it desperately tries to keep some kind of administrative machinery operating as the country is plunged back into the dark ages. Any of us reading the leaked details of the slightly James Bond-sounding ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ over the weekend will probably have been re-watching Mad Max II for tips on how to survive in the post-apocalyptic wasteland Britain will have become after leaving the EU without a deal. 
AUG19	How dare the parents of 'Jihadi Jack', who funded and abetted him, accuse Sajid Javid of 'cowardice'	With breathtaking audacity, the parents of ISIS fighter “Jihadi Jack” have branded former Home Secretary Sajid Javid a “coward” over his decision to strip their Muslim convert son of his British citizenship. In a cynical betrayal of reality, the perpetrators – from Jack Letts to Shamima Begum and other individuals who chose to travel to Syria at their own free will and proudly joined a genocidal terrorist organisation – are now being shopped around as victims, abandoned by a ruthless government and deprived of their basic human rights. Cry me a river, enough of it already!
AUG19	My trip to Poland left me more convinced than ever that we are right to leave the EU to fulfil its superstate ambitions	Brexit is a wise choice - not just for the UK, but for our friends in Europe too I’ve just returned from a few days at a literary festival, brilliantly organised by the Municipal Public Library and the city of Sopot, a pretty coastal resort in northern Poland. Our panel, co-ordinated by the Academy of Ideas, featured one Remainer and two Brexiteers, whom the predominantly Polish and overwhelmingly Europhile audience viewed with a mixture of bemusement and suspicion. We discussed the benefits of the nation state and opportunities for democratic renewal after Brexit, stressing that though most Brits love Europe, few are particularly enamoured of the EU itself. I argued that many Brexiteers would have been content to stay in the EU, but for its irresistible post-Maastricht descent into ever closer union, tax harmonisation, consolidated military structures and so on. 
AUG19	Boris should welcome an early General Election after Brexit, and the chance to eject the no-deal wreckers once and for all	Senior Tory MPs are reportedly calling on Boris Johnson to trigger a snap election rather than wait to be voted down on a No Confidence motion. Yet the PM is said to be adamant that an election is a bad idea; arguing that there have been many elections in recent years, and that the public now expects politicians to get on and complete Brexit — which he says will happen, "do or die", on October 31. His Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay has even been photographed signing the “commencement order” formally ending our membership as of that date. The PM is surely right in principle. A General Election that occurred before 31 October would expect Brexit Party voters to trust the Conservatives not to betray Leave voters yet again, after the Party had blatantly and repeatedly lied to them over Brexit for decades, most recently under Theresa May. Some such voters have already felt the pull of Boris’ charm and optimism, but in a pre-Brexit General Election that Boris himself had chosen, many Brexit Party supporters and officials might well feel that whatever they thought of Boris himself, his fellow Tories could not be trusted further than one could throw them. Jeremy Corbyn is going through the motions in asking for Parliament to be recalled. But Parliament has had countless opportunities, over the past three years, to pass a deal, revoke Article 50, call a Second Referendum or whatever else it wanted. It’s absurd to suggest that it is somehow being denied an opportunity to debate the issues by having its usual summer recess, and there is no chance Johnson will agree to recall it before it is due to come back in September.
AUG19	Far-Left hyper-partisan Corbyn has some front to lecture anyone else on the virtue of cooperation	There is much to disparage in Jeremy Corbyn’s speech in Corby today, so let’s crack on, shall we?  First, like Richard Leonard, the embattled Scottish Labour leader, he misdiagnosed his party’s demise north of the border. In Scotland, following the independence referendum of 2014, Labour tried to change the public discussion by talking about zero hour contracts, the NHS and public transport. And no one in Scotland gave a stuff. All they really wanted to talk about was independence. Labour refused to take part in the conversation and so millions of Scots, on both sides of the argument, turned their backs on it. So it’s remarkable that in large swathes of his speech today, Corbyn was determined to “do a Leonard” and talk about socialism and the economy, when all anyone reporting the event wanted to know was what the party will do about Brexit. He eventually got onto it, of course, resurrecting his demand that he should become a “caretaker” prime minister on a temporary basis. That was the third weak point of his performance, to which I shall return.
AUG19	Why not raise the pension age? Most people would rather retire a little later	When the state old age pension was introduced in 1909, the retirement age was 70. In 2019, when people live on average about 15 years longer, it is 65 (rising to 66 next year). This is silly, not to mention punitively expensive. The state pension was not supposed to create a whole new era of doing nothing, but to relieve the want of those no longer capable of working. The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), a conservative think tank, has noticed this. It thinks the pension age should rise to 75 by 2042, by which time a quarter of the adult population will be over 65. In return, far more effort should be made to retrain older workers and make them central to the workforce, instead of trying to shuffle them off.  I consider myself a bit of an expert on the ageing process, having interviewed about 500 people for my biography of Mrs Thatcher, almost all of whom are over 60. The great majority, I have found, fit the CSJ view.  Such people do not want full retirement until they are truly old – which nowadays usually means 80 plus.
AUG19	The West has become too reliant on its economic links with China	Take a moment and contemplate the bravery of the demonstrators in Hong Kong. Yesterday, confronted by mounting Chinese intimidation, 100,000 people took once more to the streets to defend democracy and civil rights. Ominously, video footage has emerged of a Chinese military buildup in nearby Shenzhen, and Beijing has begun to refer to the demonstrators as terrorists. This week, a senior Chinese diplomat said, “if Hong Kong’s situation deteriorates… the central government will not sit by and watch.” The central government, of course, is not queasy about oppressing civilians in the name of order. It has imprisoned around one million Uighur Muslims in detention camps. It is reportedly separating Muslim children from their families, religion and language, and there are claims that Muslim women are being sterilised against their will. Helpless minorities are not the only people in Beijing’s sights. Across the whole of China, the state is using mass surveillance, big data and internet technologies to build a social credit system to judge people’s civic worth. This Orwellian horror will allow the authorities to monitor and then either punish or reward individuals and businesses as they see fit. Even hardy British spooks – no strangers to surveillance – return from China shocked by the penetration of the state into everyday private life.
AUG20	Boris Johnson needs to take on the Left's false prophets of hope	Hope is a powerful word in politics. Margaret Thatcher famously used it when she took office in 1979, quoting the prayer of St Francis of Assisi: “Where there is despair, may we bring hope.” Barack Obama used it all the time, so much so that he was portrayed in a 2008 campaign poster with the word “HOPE” emblazoned in capital letters beneath his image. I was recently wandering around the wonderful Watts Gallery in the Surrey village of Compton and came across the painting Hope by the Victorian visionary artist GF Watts (another version hangs in the Tate). This is the work that inspired Obama and, before him, Martin Luther King, who based a 1959 sermon on the theme of the painting. In 1990, the Rev Jeremiah Wright, Obama’s controversial pastor, also preached on the subject “The Audacity of Hope” and awakened the future president’s interest in the canvas. Watts’ allegorical painting has gained mythical status. It is often asserted that Nelson Mandela kept a facsimile in his prison cell on Robben Island and that the Egyptian army issued a copy to its troops after their defeat to Israel in the Yom Kippur war of 1973, although there is no firm evidence for either claim. It depicts a blindfolded girl sitting atop a globe, plucking at a wooden lyre with one remaining string, the others having broken. Where is the hope there? An unconvinced GK Chesterton said Watts might more accurately have called his painting “Despair”.
AUG20	If Boris can survive September, the EU may rethink its stubborn stance	It was always predictable how the first few weeks of Boris Johnson’s premiership would play out. It would have been astonishing to see him abandoning his demands to “scrap the backstop” right after entering office. The same can be said about the EU side, which has repeated ad nauseam that the binding part of the Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May is non-negotiable.  Now, ahead of the Biarritz G7 Summit, and as the Prime Minister prepares to meet his counterparts in Paris and Berlin, things are getting more interesting. Johnson has come out with a document detailing – to an extent – how his Government wants to renegotiate the binding part of the deal. This was swiftly followed by the EU side – including Ireland – ruling out any renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement, with the EU Commission arguing that the Government’s “letter doesn’t provide a legal operational solution to prevent the return of a hard border”. In other words: the European side is telling Boris Johnson to explain how he would solve the border conundrum. It’s the EU’s view that this may well take up to 15 years. At least that’s what Austria’s leading diplomat charged with Brexit estimates. The UK Government does admit that “alternative arrangements” may not be ready by the end of the transition stage, on 1 January 2023, but Boris Johnson vows in his letter to "look (...) at what commitments might help" so to reassure the EU that he is interested in a solution.
AUG20	I hope I'm wrong about Boris Johnson, but I fear a great Brexit stitch-up is coming	It was good while it lasted. For several weeks, Boris Johnson gave the impression of being a true Brexiteer – so much so that some people even began to ask: “What is the point of the Brexit Party?” Most no-dealers in the country cheered every statement the Prime Minister made and this week the Government even announced that free movement of people would end on October 31. At last, it seemed, the referendum vote was being acted upon. But don’t be fooled by the PR blitz. For this week, in his four-page letter to Donald Tusk, the EU Council President, we have also seen the other Boris Johnson; the man who, in March, voted for the Withdrawal Agreement and the Northern Ireland backstop at the third time of asking. Some might say this is the “real” Johnson.
AUG20	Diane Abbott just made Labour’s most bizarre pledge on Brexit yet	It wouldn’t be easy to make a bigger mess of Brexit than the Tories have. Labour, though, could yet manage it. In fact, Labour’s current plan for Brexit is so magnificently mad, I almost want them to get in so they can try it. If nothing else, it would be spectacular to watch. This morning on Radio 4, the Today programme’s Justin Webb attempted to make sense of Labour’s plan by interviewing Diane Abbott. Throughout, the shadow home secretary was her usual queenly self, greeting each question with an air of amused tolerance, as if she couldn’t quite believe how silly her interviewer was, but was much too polite to say so. “I’m grateful to you, Justin, for putting words in my mouth, but I’d rather stick with what I was saying…”  To be fair, there was no need for Mr Webb to put words into Ms Abbott’s mouth. The words coming out of it were extraordinary enough. 
AUG20	Boris Johnson's goodwill, and no backstop, is not enough to stop a hard border in Ireland	Yesterday evening, the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had his second phone call with the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. The call lasted about an hour, twice as long as their previous call in July while they both agreed their first face to face meeting will be in Dublin this September. The main substance of the call, of course, related to the ongoing Brexit stand while both leaders condemned the very worrying bombing by dissidents that took place earlier in the day in Fermanagh. The Taoiseach laid out, again, the very clear position of the European Union that the Withdrawal Agreement is closed and that the backstop, while an insurance policy that no one ever wants to see kick in, is a vital part thereof.
AUG20	The EU has shown it is willing to gamble everything to preserve its theological attachment to the Single Market	The days of grovelling supplication and begging for scraps from Brussels’ table are over As the Prime Minister prepares for this week’s G7 meeting in Biarritz and bilateral meetings with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, he will reflect that for the first time in several years, that the UK, while not in an unambiguously advantageous position, is back in the diplomatic game on Article 50 negotiations. Jeremy Corbyn’s speech yesterday surely removed some political domestic pressure from the PM too. Nine years out of office, the Labour Party are polling at historically low levels, are bitterly divided and on the cusp of civil war. Meanwhile, Corbyn’s leadership ratings are embarrassingly poor, his party is shedding members and their funding is under pressure just two months before a potential General Election – and Labour’s Brexit policy is inauthentic, confused and unintelligible to the wider electorate outside the hard Left Corbynista cultists.
AUG20	Boris Johnson is leaving Brussels in no doubt about what he wants as a Brexit deal	European leaders knew the most damning way to dismiss Theresa May's demands was to act like they had no idea what she actually wanted in the Brexit negotiations, as it suggested she was failing to make her mark.  Jean-Claude Juncker repeatedly affected to be in the dark about what the United Kingdom was seeking. There were early claims that he spent only 30 minutes a week thinking about Brexit, with his routine culminating this February in his notorious stare-off with Mrs May after he dismissed her demands as "nebulous". Once the then Prime Minister had agreed a deal, her European counterparts ladled on the praise. Mr Juncker waxed lyrical after the backstop had been hammered out about how "tough, smart, polite" she was, while Michel Barnier called her "courageous". Given the political grief the Irish protocol ended up causing her, Monsieur Barnier must have meant "courageous" in the same sense Sir Humphrey Appleby does in Yes Minister.
AUG20	Here are five ways to make the civil service ready to deliver Brexit by October 31	The recently leaked Yellowhammer document - which highlights nothing but problems - illustrates how deeply ingrained the Brexit cannot-do-spirit is among many civil servants. As if it is practically irresolvable to return to a sovereign nation status, regardless of the fact that this was the norm only a few decades ago.  Jumping up and down in anger – against the way of the world - will not help. What we are experiencing presently – obstruction politics carried out with the zealotry of those acting in good faith – is precisely how things play out during times of transition. That is why most institutionalised civil servants, a century back, were fighting the Labour counterrevolution against right-wing overstretch. With roles reversed, the same story played out again in the 1980s, when most civil servants resisted the Margaret Thatcher counterrevolution against left-wing overstretch.
AUG20	Why do we take seriously the pig-ignorant radicals who masquerade as animal lovers?	Before turning to more controversial matters, I should like this week to mention the unusual dilemma of the controller of a major charitable fund. Air Vice Marshal Murray, the controller of the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund, recently explained to me that since almost all of the huge numbers of those who served in the RAF during the Second World War are now dead and before long so too will be those conscripted during the Cold War, there is now a rapidly diminishing cohort of potential beneficiaries. Some of those are in real financial need, unable to afford the care which they require, but his problem is finding them.
AUG20	The humourless French will never 'get' Boris Johnson	Can you come on our show?” The France 5 TV booker sounded frazzled. “Would you explain why we should be afraid of Boris Johnson?” “Er,” I said. “That’s our title tonight. Pourquoi faut-il avoir peur de Boris Johnson? You write for the same paper, yes?” This was the start of my new and improved television career, which I entirely owe to Bojo. I have become, by default, the French Boris Whisperer, because, to my compatriots, the PM is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. They see him as the exact opposite of what a politician should be: it’s hard to imagine someone more different from Emmanuel Macron while still belonging to the same species. Now the two are meeting on Thursday at the Elysee, and my only advice to Macron is: take an interpreter. I should confess that I’ve met Boris Johnson only once, at a Spectator summer party, where he was holding court next to a fountain of Pol Roger, and probably did not even register my presence. He was having fun, and people enjoyed seeing him having fun. “It’s one of the reasons he is so popular,” I recently told a radio host, who looked at me as if I’d sprouted fins or spoken Székely Hungarian. “It’s been three years of bumbling and gloom, and voters like a bit of optimism.”
AUG21	Our GCSE reforms are restoring confidence in a system undermined by grade inflation	Today’s results reflect our endeavour to create a world-class system for the opportunities ahead This morning over half a million 16-year-olds will be on tenterhooks as they wait for their GCSE results. Add in half a million anxious families who are sharing the wait and you’ve got a sizeable chunk of Britain all biting their fingernails at breakfast. Astonishingly, I am only the second Education Secretary to have gone to a comprehensive but I can tell you, it doesn’t matter what kind of school you go to, getting your GCSE results is a big deal. Today marks the culmination of years of hard work by not just all those pupils but their teachers too. All of them have not only had to tackle preparation for public exams but have been adapting to new, more rigorous qualifications. These are part of the reforms to bring confidence back into a system which had been undermined by grade inflation. And I’m delighted that many of those anxious pupils will be getting good news. The reforms to the curriculum and qualifications we began in 2010 are starting to bear fruit.
AUG21	Theresa May snubbed this brilliant plan for Brexit. Is Boris Johnson taking it seriously?	Where the Telegraph sketch leads, Downing Street follows. Six months ago, in this very column, I proposed a radical but at the same time eminently reasonable solution to the problem of Brexit. It was this. Germany, France and our 25 other neighbours should quit the EU, and become part of the UK instead. At last: a plan to satisfy everyone, no matter which way they voted in 2016. First, it would suit Leavers, because all laws would be made in Westminster, and immigration figures would be slashed (for the simple reason that all Poles, Bulgarians, and anyone else entering Britain from the continent, would now officially be British, and therefore not immigrants). Second, it would suit Remainers, because they would get to live in a vast centralised superstate (the newly expanded UK) boasting its own army (the British one) and a single currency (the pound). 
AUG21	The West is sitting on its hands as Assad destroys Idlib - and we will come to regret our cowardice	Ignoring this atrocity will empower dictators, despots, rogue states and terrorists to kill with impunity Idlib, in north-west Syria, is being subjected to a scorched earth assault reminiscent of the medieval era, with Syrian and Russian forces incinerating and killing everything in their path. This week they captured the town of Khan Sheikhoun from the rebels. They have even been prepared to attack the forces of a Nato member, Turkey, in their pursuit of total victory. How has it come to this?  Today marks six years since the devastating nerve agent attack by the Syrian regime in Ghouta which killed 1,500 people. Weeks after this event, the British Government and then the US Government decided not to punish Assad for crossing the red line on using chemical weapons. As a result, such appalling weapons have now proliferated globally, and we have seen up to 500 documented uses by the Syrian regime, alongside atrocities perpetrated by Isil in Syria in Iraq, North Korea in Malaysia, and the Russians in the UK. 
AUG21	We baldies can still take a joke – even if it's a bargain basement gag like Gary Lineker's	When you lose your hair, you don’t lose your sense of humour or your ability to be teased Ever since Gary Lineker stopped being a brilliant England striker and became a megasmug TV presenter, I haven’t liked him. I don’t care for his sanctimonious opinions, the artful facial hair and the huge overpayment by the BBC which has made him their highest-paid presenter, on £1.75 million a year. But, even as a bald man, I didn’t bat an eyelid when the over-indulged crisp salesman said on Match of  the Day, “It’s a strong start to the Premier League season. Real hair-raising stuff at times… unless you’re Alan Shearer and Danny Murphy.” The former footballers Shearer and Murphy, needless to say, are bald.
AUG21	EU leaders have got it wrong, there are plenty of solutions to the Irish border problem	Boris Johnson has made a strong opening bid in his negotiations with the EU. During this process, several things are strikingly different from the previous government. First, there is no requirement to achieve “frictionless trade”, only “as frictionless as possible” which is the goal of every free trade agreement. The EU recognises that completely frictionless trade can only be delivered by the Customs Union and Single Market, which is why Theresa May’s government was heading in that direction. By changing this, the Johnson administration is seeking a new settlement which is more readily understood by the EU (and indeed all trading partners). In the words of Michel Barnier himself, it is a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the whole of the UK with Irish border facilitations, customs facilitations and regulatory cooperation. Since both parties want this, it should be relatively easy to amend the political declaration to reflect this fact by removing references to single customs territories and to the need to build on the backstop.
AUG21	Why is Boris Johnson really wasting time meeting Angela Merkel, to discuss an issue they can’t agree on?	Britain has consistently overestimated Germany’s clout within the EU Why is Boris bothering to go to Berlin? That’s the question Germans are asking today. Well, not all of them. Actually, not even most of them. Bild, Germany’s biggest tabloid, has a piece about the PM’s visit, but the most prominent British story on the paper’s website is about Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein. Whisper it in Whitehall, but Germans aren’t actually that bothered about Brexit. They regard it as a nuisance, not a catastrophe. A lot of Germans outside the political bubble assume we’ve already left.
AUG21	Until every British abortion clinic has a buffer zone, women will be called 'murderers'	All women deserve the right to make their own pregnancy choices in privacy and dignity. And the lengths one London council is being forced to go to in order to enable women to access abortion care free from harassment shows exactly why nationwide action is needed. The Court of Appeal this week ruled that a buffer zone introduced by Ealing Council is legal. It forces protesters to stand 100m away from the area's Marie Stopes abortion clinic - which, for years, was beset by anti-abortion activists brandishing religious pamphlets and shouting "murderer" at the women going through its doors. The judges' decision to uphold the buffer zone, which was first introduced in April 2018, unanimously dismissed the challenge against it brought by anti-choice campaigners.
AUG21	Recalling parliament would be a pointless gimmick. No wonder Remainers are keen on the idea	It is hardly a revelation worthy of Woodward and Bernstein that politicians enjoy the sound of their own voices. Indeed, a fondness for one’s own oratory is a primary motivation behind any individual’s decision to stand for parliament. Which is why the five-week summer recess of parliament presents such difficulties for them. Voters may well feel fairly relaxed about turning on the radio and TV and not seeing or hearing an MP pontificate about the latest crisis du jour. But the MPs themselves always find this period of purdah most trying. They face the prospect of sitting on a beach with family members – who aren’t even fellow politicians, for goodness sake! – and using the dodgy 3G signal in Majorca to keep the world updated on their latest thoughts via Twitter. The alternative? Demand a recall of parliament, of course!
AUG21	The voters will punish anti-democratic Remainiacs who think they know better than the people	Over the three years of the May government, every official statistic, survey and report seemed to take the most negative view possible of the UK, its economy and place in the world. Under Philip Hammond, the Treasury became the “Eeyore” of Brexit, undermining every effort to take a proactive and positive view of our future. Now it appears that the former chancellor was actively working against proper preparations to leave the EU.  As Boris Johnson heads to Berlin to meet with Angela Merkel, he must be wondering how far British politicians will go in their attempts to undermine his Government’s policy to leave the EU by 31 October. There is certainly some quite disgraceful anti-democratic game-playing going on in Parliament, designed to keep the UK from making its decisive move to leave, which is undoubtedly the major reason the EU won’t offer the UK a better deal. We will see in early September what the Remainiacs are really made of. It will be their very own "do or die" moment. The Prime Minister has accused these anti-democratic hard line forces of collaborating with the EU. It is hard for them to deny the charge, as they are working against their Government in support of Brussels. After all, the end game of the Remainiacs is clear: they do not want a new relationship with Europe, they simply want to overturn the referendum and stay in the EU contrary to the expressed will of the British people.
AUG21	The fact we have the healthiest packaged food in the world and an obesity crisis proves the folly of the war on sugar	A study recently evaluated the nutritional quality of packaged food in twelve countries. It may surprise you to hear that Britain came top and the USA came second. The least healthy food was found in two of the world’s least obese nations: Hong Kong and India. According to the research, average sugar content of packaged food in the UK is 3.5 grams per 100 grams; the lowest of the twelve countries studied and less than half of the 7.7 grams found in China. The overall energy content of Britain’s packaged food was also the lowest. With 252 calories per 100 grams, our processed grub is much less calorific than that of India, where the average is 380 calories per 100 grams. These findings may strike you as counter-intuitive. After all, Britain is one of the fattest countries in Europe and the USA has the highest obesity rate in the western world. But crude averages don’t tell us much about the diet of individuals. In the UK alone, the researchers found 68,153 different packaged food and beverage products to study. In the USA, the number was 162,297. Taking an average from such a vast range of options is almost meaningless.
AUG22	Is Mackay 'on manoeuvres' for top Nat job?	It may not have been the question that purists interested in Scotland’s economic present and future would have asked, but it was probably the issue that most fascinates the electorate. Derek Mackay was presenting his country’s annual tax and spend account and, if truth be told, trying to look and sound optimistic about figures that were pretty dire. And so, someone asked, would this performance help the finance minister succeed Nicola Sturgeon at the top of the SNP? Not that he’s trying to oust Ms Sturgeon – perish the thought – and in answer to the reporter’s question this week he was loyalty personified, insisting: “There’s no vacancy.”
AUG22	The EU cannot afford a no-deal Brexit. Luckily, it has a parachute handy	Behind the scenes, European officials have been working hard on a series of mini-deals that will keep disruption to a minimum It’s easy to sympathise with Emmanuel Macron. Britain is leaving the EU club but wants to keep the benefits of membership (free trade) without agreeing to the obligations (the diktats). If we get away with it, where would that leave Europe? He once admitted that even France would “probably” have voted to leave the EU if given the chance: Marine Le Pen, his great antagonist, has talked about giving them that choice. Understandably, M Macron needs to put people off this idea. So he must show that the EU does not bend when threatened and that countries who break away face isolation and political ruin.
AUG22	Ignore the anti-military propagandists. There are few better opportunities for the young than the Army	GCSE results day is a time of celebration or sorrow for thousands of teenagers. It is also a day exploited by various NGOs and activists to have a go at the Army, who they accuse of luring disappointed 16-year-olds to sign up. True to form, this year it was the turn of Child Rights International Network to publish their report on results day.  CRIN say they’re worried about children’s rights being infringed by the opportunity to join the forces. But their real anti-military motive is betrayed in their press release that says young people “deserve better: meaningful civilian opportunities for education and employment”. There can be few better opportunities for 16-year-olds, especially those from impoverished backgrounds who lack academic prowess, than junior military service that takes them seamlessly through education to life-long employment if they want it. The Army is the biggest apprenticeship provider in this country. But how would CRIN have a clue about this? I doubt any of them have served. They are Left-wing university graduates who could not contemplate the challenges facing youngsters lacking the advantages they themselves enjoyed.
AUG22	Britain's over medication epidemic is making tens of thousands sick. The Government must act	Those in their seventies and beyond are by far the major beneficiaries of modern medicines that vanquish (or mitigate) the physical trials and tribulations of later life – arthritic joints, impaired mobility, heart failure, and much else besides. Many troubled by more than one such ailment will need to take a combination of medicines, so called “polypharmacy” (literally many drugs). But caution is necessary. The late professor D R Laurence in his classic textbook Clinical Pharmacology – required reading by medical students for many years – summarises the eight separate reasons for the increased tendency for drugs to cause harm in later life, concluding unassailably: “Drug therapy in the elderly should be kept to a minimum.” In recent years, this cardinal principle of sensible prescribing has been reversed with serious consequences reiterated yet again in yesterday’s report from Age UK with its self explanatory title “More Harm Than Good”. The relevant statistics could reasonably be described as awesome.
AUG22	Macho Macron tried to boss Boris Johnson... but the bumbling bulldog fought back	For Boris Johnson, today’s meeting with Emmanuel Macron must have been painful. Never mind the Brexit talks. I’m talking about the handshake. It’s always the same, when Mr Macron welcomes a fellow leader. No matter who his guest is, the French president is determined to show the cameras that he, Macron, is top dog. His body language is fascinating. It’s so aggressive – even when he’s being friendly. He shakes hands aggressively. He smiles aggressively. He laughs aggressively. With restless, angry energy, he bobs up and down on the balls of his feet, like a boxer. At every opportunity, he thumps his guest on the back, as if the guest is choking on a fishbone, and heroic Mr Macron is calmly swooping in to save the poor sap’s life.  It’s all so extravagantly, theatrically macho. He makes Putin look like Niles Crane.
AUG22	How can anyone place their faith in a migration system that is divorced from reality?	ONS failures should not obscure the huge gulf between politicians and the public over immigration The public will rightly approach the new immigration figures, which estimate that 226,000 more long-term migrants moved here than departed in the year ending March 2019, with a healthy dose of scepticism. That is only natural in the wake of an admission by the Office for National Statistics that they underestimated net arrivals from the EU by nearly a quarter of a million, while overestimating non-EU net migration by 170,000. As Ministers make various announcements, for instance on ending free movement and bringing in an Australian points-based visa system, it is worth remembering that just 17 per cent of the public trust the government to tell them the truth on this issue either all or most of the time. It is in everyone’s interest that the measurement of immigration be accurate, not least to allow for proper planning. For this reason, work by the ONS to use an array of sources (including tax records, NHS data, exit checks and visa records) to gain a more complete picture is very welcome.
AUG22	Britain has a troubled history with the railways. HS2 was never going to be any different	Britain has a long and troubled history with railway projects Britain, and in particular its politicians, has a difficult relationship with its railways. Maybe that’s at least partly because on the first day of operation of the country’s first inter-city line – Liverpool to Manchester – a train was responsible for ending the life of a former cabinet minister. William Huskisson, a former secretary for the colonies in the government of the Duke of Wellington, was one of the VIPs invited to join the prime minister at the opening of the new line in 1830. Having resigned from the cabinet after a disagreement with Wellington, Huskisson was keen to repair his relationship with him. At the first opportunity, he left the carriage in which he had been riding to join the duke on the railway track during a stopover to replenish the steam engine with water. 
AUG22	Harry Maguire's right – you should need ID to access social media	
Follow your club now for first access to all our news, views and analysis
 The Manchester United dressing room isn’t where one would normally look for public policy ideas – but perhaps that ought to change. Step forward the team’s centre back, Harry Maguire, whose intervention has been hailed by MPs. He believes the big social media firms should be made to ensure that everybody on their platforms has had their identity verified. This, he says, would cut down on online trolling, including the racist abuse handed out to his teammate Paul Pogba following their draw on Monday night against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
AUG22	My deal with South Korea is great news for Global Britain	Today I signed my first trade continuity deal as Trade Secretary with Korea. This is an exciting moment for both of our countries and demonstrates this Government’s commitment to maintaining existing trade agreements with our allies. More than that, it is a first step towards enhancing those relationships and sets down a marker of intent that the UK will be open for business when we leave the European Union on October 31. Once we leave the rules and regulations of the European Union, we will be able to establish our own independent trade policy for the first time in forty years. This provides us with the opportunity to realise new gold standard trade deals with our existing allies and like-minded countries such as Korea; nations who embrace freedom, value democracy and respect the rule of law.  South Korea has become a beacon of freedom, despite facing threats from the oppressive, totalitarian regime just across the border. It is a country that is full of ideas, that is innovative and entrepreneurial, and allows its talented people the freedom to flourish. 
AUG22	Don't mistake German politeness for weakness — Merkel is as much a Brexit bad cop as Macron	Back when he was Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt was fond of warning his European counterparts not to "mistake British politeness for weakness". The same could be said about Angela Merkel, after the man who beat Mr Hunt to become Prime Minister attracted praise for apparently getting her to indicate she could be persuaded to bin the backstop in the next few weeks.  That purported concession has led knowing pundits to conclude that the German chancellor is playing "good cop" to Emmanuel Macron's "bad cop". The French President has played up to that reputation by telling reporters, before meeting Boris Johnson today, that his demands to renegotiate the backstop were "not an option" and pointedly reminding him that he could still revoke Article 50 "up to the last second" before the October 31 deadline. But it would be wrong to think that Germany's so-called Iron Chancellor has gone soft. The "very blistering timetable of 30 days" Mr Johnson latched onto in his desire for alternatives to the backstop was not as solid as he might have hoped. Mrs Merkel had simply restated her position that the backstop would be replaced once an alternative way to stop a hard border had been agreed that everyone - especially Dublin - found credible.
AUG23	If we are to pay reparations for slavery, why not for the persecution of Catholics?	Glasgow University has decided that it took money from slavery, and so ought to find some way of paying it back. Put like that, it sounds a reasonable proposition. If you profit from a great wrong, should you not restore the money to the victims?  But should it be put like that? By Glasgow’s own account, the university itself took no part in slavery. Its connection, it says, derives from the fact that many of its great industrial and commercial benefactors in the 19th century had grown rich from the trade in or products of slaves. It has somehow calculated that the slave-based value of their donations was worth, in modern money, anything between £16.7  million and £198  million, a range so great as to make the calculation almost meaningless. Glasgow’s answer to this problem of its past is to donate £20 million to a joint project with the University of the West Indies, setting up a Glasgow-Caribbean Centre for Development Research. The university has denied that this money is a form of reparations, but Sir Hilary Beckles, vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies, yesterday told the BBC that it was.
AUG23	Remainers at home and leaders abroad have all underestimated Boris Johnson	Whilst no one would claim Boris Johnson’s bilateral meetings with Chancellor Merkel and President Macron this week were “game set and match”, as John Major once hubristically proclaimed following a tense meeting with his EU counterparts, they have at least reset the negotiations between London and Brussels. There’s plenty of media crowing that the Merkel and Macron good cop, bad cop schtick has forced Boris onto the back foot but the bigger tactical advance has been achieved by Team Johnson in shattering the myth that in all circumstances the Northern Ireland backstop is non-negotiable. Not only that, EU officials are already working on significant changes to the backstop and at the same time are continuing their detailed proposals for a slew of temporary and limited bilateral “side agreements” in the event of no agreement being reached with the UK by October 31.
AUG23	Immigration levels after Brexit should be decided by the Cabinet, just like we do in Australia	Australia's system has won widespread public support for immigration. Boris Johnson should follow our lead for Britain Over the years, Australia and the UK have copied many of each other’s policies. Australia has taken much of Britain’s counter-terrorism legislation, Britain has emulated the Australian university fees system, the two tax codes are similar and financial regulation is closely aligned. What remains somewhat different is immigration policy: Australia has a points-based system; the UK has something quite similar for non-EU immigration but very open borders with the EU because of freedom of movement. Now that can change.
AUG23	We must cut foreign aid until Brazil faces up to its duty to protect the Amazon	As record-breaking forest fires continue to devastate the Amazon, Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro remains defiant. The whole thing has nothing to do with his lax environmental policies and clear enthusiasm for opening up the rainforest to commerce – it’s all a plot by dastardly NGOs to discredit him. What’s more, he says, foreign nations are interested only because of their “colonialist mentality”, the sort of lazy blame-the-West rhetoric typically associated with “woke” student unions. Bolsonaro, as is so often the case when somebody invokes colonialism, is simply wrong. The Amazon, although its care is rightly entrusted to the Latin American nations in which it sits, is a globally significant site. As well as being important as a carbon store, it is home to an astonishing array of unique and irreplaceable plants and wildlife.
AUG23	The backstop is the most vital part of the Brexit deal that Boris must fix	Boris Johnson is right to challenge the European Union to start negotiations on a withdrawal agreement that not only can get the support of members of the House of Commons but also create an agreement that is good for Britain in the long term. The European Union is beginning to take the risk of no-deal more seriously now that we have a Prime Minister that believes that no deal is better than a bad deal. Perhaps European leaders will only really begin to recognise that a no-deal Brexit could well happen once the possibility for the House of Commons to block it is finally removed. The irony is that those in the Commons who are actively trying to subvert the Government and block no-deal are themselves stopping the negotiation of a better deal that might get through Parliament.
AUG23	Boris is right to defy the US-phobes by turning to America	This weekend, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump are set to meet for their very first time as Prime Minister and President at the G7 Conference.  And the anti-American Twitter war in Britain will start afresh.  Yet from a US perspective, the Anglo-American alliance could not be stronger. Last Sunday, I was strolling along the lakeshore in Chicago with a friend. Suddenly, loudspeakers clicked on and we were welcomed to the Annual Festival of the Air and Water. My attention was then riveted by the next unexpected – by me - announcement “And to open the Festival, we present the Red Arrows of the Royal Air Force from the United Kingdom: our closest friend and ally”.

AUG24	We will do everything in our power to help businesses seize the vast opportunities of Brexit	October 31 will be a historic day for the United Kingdom – the day we finally act on the will of the people and leave the European Union. As a truly Brexit-backing Business Secretary, my number one priority for the 67 days ahead is to ensure that businesses are well prepared. My message to them is clear: prepare for Brexit, and the superb opportunities that lie ahead will be yours. One of my first engagements as Secretary of State was to meet with businesses from across the country to talk about the potential for UK growth, jobs and opportunity.
AUG24	Boris is serious about a deal, but the Brussels Eurocrats still want to punish the British ‘deserters’	Even the civil servants seem suddenly to be standing straighter. After three years of immobilism, dreariness and funk, the Government is again exuding purpose. I spent a couple of days this week with some of the officials preparing for Brexit – all of them, as far as I could tell, Remain voters, all of them ready to find fault with the new PM. Instead, to their palpable surprise, they found themselves energised by the waves of determination and leadership pulsing out from Downing Street. EU leaders, too, can feel the difference. They were all keyed up to loathe Boris Johnson, the man they blamed for swinging the 2016 referendum. But look at the body language on display at the PM’s meetings in France and Germany. Where Theresa May was wooden, passive, unable to deviate from a script, Boris is funny, charming, in control of the situation. Heads of government are human, too. They are as likely as anyone else to respond to warmth. Will warmth be enough to secure a deal? It is possible, but unlikely. On paper, the EU has every reason to look for a compromise. Britain has put vast concessions on the table which will be whipped away if no agreement is struck: a continuing role for EU judges, a lopsided arbitration mechanism, a £39 billion payment that no international tribunal would uphold and, not least, two years of non-voting membership.
AUG24	Why shouldn’t single women be able to have IVF on the NHS?	Since it is funded by the taxpayer, there will always be a degree of rationing in the services the NHS offers patients for free at the point of use. The debate over which services it provides, based on which criteria, is therefore a constant in our public discourse. There are few areas more sensitive than the provision of IVF. The NHS limits access to IVF in all sorts of ways in different parts of the country, but the reports that NHS South East London is to bar all single women from receiving funding for such treatment were startling. In justifying its decision, which is now under review, the authority controversially cited a document which declared: “A sole woman is unable to bring out the best outcomes for the child”. In a country where nearly a quarter of families with dependent children have a single parent at their helm and – according to the charity Gingerbread – 90 per cent of those are women, this is an extraordinary statement. A stable, loving, two-parent family is undoubtedly an ideal environment in which to raise a child. But there are around 1.6 million single mothers in the UK who are bringing up their children alone for myriad reasons. In fact, Gingerbread reports that the “proportion of families with children headed by single parents has remained at around 25 per cent for over a decade”, over which period the proportion of single fathers has also remained around 10 per cent.
AUG24	The EU has stepped back from the brink because it knows it cannot risk a no-deal Brexit	Is it all about semantics now? In Paris, at that meeting in which nothing very encouraging was supposed to happen, Emmanuel Macron stated with splendid philosophical subtlety that there could, after all, be amendments to the Withdrawal Agreement – but that this process could not result in a “new” Agreement. So how many amendments would it take to qualify said document as a New Agreement? Or to put it another way, how much can the Old Agreement be amended without risking it being transformed, unacceptably, into a New Agreement? Students of philosophy may be familiar with this metaphysical dilemma: how many bricks can you replace in a house before it becomes a different house? Perhaps inevitably, this is where we are. Because the leaders of the EU have bound themselves irrevocably to the principle that this Withdrawal Agreement is the only possible one – ever – even though it has been rejected by the UK Parliament three times. But at the same time, they cannot risk the UK taking the only possible alternative path and leaving with no deal at all. So everybody has to retreat from the brink, while somehow managing to save face. Hence, linguistic miracles must be performed. This is not to say that these feats of verbal dexterity are without value. It may be true that a hard Irish border would never have been erected because no one would have wished to be responsible for erecting it, but the claim that one would be necessary was a very real – and until now, immovable – obstacle to an agreement. For the parties involved to be able to announce that a viable solution to an entirely hypothetical but totemic problem has been found would be a substantive move toward resolution. Sometimes finding an acceptable form of words constitutes real progress.
AUG24	Unconventional Boris has a chance at the G7 to use his unorthodox approach to serve the world	Boris Johnson is making his debut on the world stage as Prime Minister at the annual gathering of G7 leaders in Biarritz. Even after dinner with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and lunch with France’s President Emmanuel Macron, his first international outing could still be unconventional. Alongside US President Donald Trump, we can expect Boris Johnson’s first G7 to bring surprises. Last year in Quebec, we got a taste of summit diplomacy to come. President Trump’s first gathering with other world leaders led to some unorthodox behaviour best captured by the enduring image on – appropriately – Angela Merkel’s Twitter account. A photograph showing world leaders huddled together in a seemingly intense stand-off with an isolated-looking US leader said all you need to know about the meeting that was dubbed the G6+1.
AUG24	It's a scorching Bank Holiday - so why am I panicking?	Where were you last August bank holiday, when the heavens opened? I ask because a number of people have told me their tales of woe over the last couple of weeks, as this year’s all-but-inevitable annual washout approached. It sticks in the mind, a particularly devastating downpour over the last three-day weekend of the year. We happened to be at a wedding which, after a summer of blistering heat, the bride and groom had quite reasonably assumed would find us all dripping with sweat, not rain. Cue a sodden marquee (no heaters because, hello, heatwave), flooded electrics meaning the band couldn’t play, and a hog roast that was moist for all the wrong reasons. Everyone had a rip-roaring time – nothing a few whiskies and a mouthful of hot crackling couldn’t solve. But when it came to planning this year’s August bank holiday weekend we thought, well, why bother? 
AUG24	Bring back child labour. It's for their own good, you know	Devastating news. I’m sure I speak for everyone of my generation when I say we are heartbroken. The goblet of hope has been dashed from our lips. Cruelly, the Government has rejected a plan to make us work until we’re 75. Talk about a kick in the teeth. After all, the people behind the plan – Iain Duncan Smith and his aptly named Centre for Social Justice – were only suggesting it for our own good. Look at the thoughtful and considerate language they used in their report.
AUG24	The rage of the Remainers will be awesome when Brexit isn't the disaster they are praying for	Among the most painful sights of recent years has been observing people one used to slightly respect descend into howling, foaming, teeth-gnashing furies. A C Grayling, for instance, used to be a recognised atheist with a fine head of hair and an equally fine mind for elucidating complex philosophical problems. But his calm persona did not survive the Brexit vote. Today he can be witnessed on film going to Brussels trying to persuade EU officials to punish Britain in order to help the Continuity Remain campaign back home. And on Twitter his name is now “AC Grayling #FBPE #PeoplesVote &/or #Revoke50/”. The Prime Minister’s trips to Berlin and Paris this week did not pacify him. Indeed, like a lot of other British devotees of the EU, the sight of Boris Johnson actually speaking with his foreign counterparts sent him into a fury. Commenting on the video of Johnson at the Elysée, the philosopher formerly known as AC Grayling wrote: “Look at him. Gesticulating, blustering, posturing, a windbag & charlatan, mere noise and distraction.” With little self-awareness, Grayling made even 280 characters seem like an eternity, typing (still in the same tweet, miraculously): “Our hopeless constitutional order has allowed a chimpanzee into Downig [sic] Street.” So it isn’t just the British PM that Professor Grayling now deems to be hopeless, but our whole constitutional order. How strange that he should have spent his career expounding the gospel of reason, only to become a stranger to it in later life, while preaching the gospel of Guy Verhofstadt.
AUG24	If we are to pay reparations for slavery, why not for the persecution of Catholics?	Glasgow University has decided that it took money from slavery, and so ought to find some way of paying it back. Put like that, it sounds a reasonable proposition. If you profit from a great wrong, should you not restore the money to the victims?  But should it be put like that? By Glasgow’s own account, the university itself took no part in slavery. Its connection, it says, derives from the fact that many of its great industrial and commercial benefactors in the 19th century had grown rich from the trade in or products of slaves. It has somehow calculated that the slave-based value of their donations was worth, in modern money, anything between £16.7  million and £198  million, a range so great as to make the calculation almost meaningless. Glasgow’s answer to this problem of its past is to donate £20 million to a joint project with the University of the West Indies, setting up a Glasgow-Caribbean Centre for Development Research. The university has denied that this money is a form of reparations, but Sir Hilary Beckles, vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies, yesterday told the BBC that it was.
AUG24	Remainers at home and leaders abroad have all underestimated Boris Johnson	Whilst no one would claim Boris Johnson’s bilateral meetings with Chancellor Merkel and President Macron this week were “game set and match”, as John Major once hubristically proclaimed following a tense meeting with his EU counterparts, they have at least reset the negotiations between London and Brussels. There’s plenty of media crowing that the Merkel and Macron good cop, bad cop schtick has forced Boris onto the back foot but the bigger tactical advance has been achieved by Team Johnson in shattering the myth that in all circumstances the Northern Ireland backstop is non-negotiable. Not only that, EU officials are already working on significant changes to the backstop and at the same time are continuing their detailed proposals for a slew of temporary and limited bilateral “side agreements” in the event of no agreement being reached with the UK by October 31.
AUG25	A free school army will end the Left’s stranglehold on education	Eight years ago, Katharine Birbalsingh was poised to achieve her dream. Her application to set up a school was lodged with the Department for Education. And government officials had found her a building: a former secondary school around the corner from the Oval, in Lambeth, south London. Everything was ready to go. Lambeth needed a new school, and Birbalsingh’s ambition – to help underachieving black kids – suited the local community to a tee. But she had not counted on the ideological hatred of free schools from her opponents. Lambeth council sold the plot of land to a property developer, and she was forced to take her proposal elsewhere. After more difficulties finding a site in Wandsworth, Birbalsingh eventually got what she wanted. At the third attempt, Michaela Community School opened in September 2014, a stone’s throw away from Wembley Stadium.
AUG25	Boris has brought a miraculous change to the political weather, as the Remainer world order falls apart	While everyone else was looking at Donald Trump and Boris Johnson as they complimented each other across the table at the G7 meeting in Biarritz yesterday, my focus was two places to Mr Johnson’s right. I was studying the face of Her Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador to the French Republic, Lord Llewellyn of Steep. As plain Ed Llewellyn, Lord Ll was David Cameron’s chief of staff, and also his closest aide on all EU matters. Most particularly, he advised Mr Cameron on how to win enough concessions from the EU to secure a Remain vote in 2016. The concessions offered by Mrs Merkel took no tricks. The referendum was lost. Mr Cameron resigned, ennobling and promoting Mr Llewellyn as he left. And yesterday our ambassador was sitting with our new Prime Minister, smiling tightly as he watched the whole diplomatic world that he had fought to defend falling apart. When Lord Ll was in 10 Downing Street, the then President of the United States said that Britain would have to “go to the back of the queue” for a trade deal if it left the EU. Yesterday, the now President of the United States said that a deal could be done “pretty quickly” and told Britain that the EU was “the anchor round its ankle”. (An odd phrase, but we know what Mr Trump means.)
AUG25	Sacred Mysteries: The sad business of stealing the lead from the church roof	The roof of the 15th-century church of St Mary, Furneux Pelham, Herts, is adorned within with carved wooden angels. After one weekend this summer, the sky could be seen through the timbers, for thieves had spent two nights removing 90 per cent of the lead roof that kept out the rain. “Today has been a very challenging and upsetting shift,” tweeted East Hertfordshire Rural Police, above a tearful emoji face. “Churches are the hub of the community and they should not be subjected to this sort of behaviour.” Of course not, but one security company, VPS, puts the number of lead thefts at 37 a month. The National Crime Agency found that metal theft had increased by 25 per cent in a year.
AUG25	We will never save the rainforest until a living tree is worth more to Brazil than an incinerated one	The G7 should not make room for the crisis in the Amazon, it should be clearing the agenda for nothing else. Without rainforest we wouldn’t even have economies to launch trade wars. The attention that world leaders are giving to the sharp acceleration in rainforest destruction in Brazil is long overdue. President Macron and Prime Minister Johnson nonetheless deserve praise for their genuine concern and insistence that it be placed on a busy G7 agenda.  Our world is indeed burning but we must go beyond the headlines if we are to permanently put those fires out. 
AUG25	The Europeans always knew we Brits were too swashbuckling for Brussels	It was with mixed feelings that I read that thousands of people will be attending a beach party to mark our departure from the European Union on October 31 at a seaside village near Amsterdam. This will involve “sitting in a deck chair with Dutch chips, French wine and German beer, watching Britain as it closes itself off,” according to the organiser, one Mr Toekook, who added spitefully: “It will be a nice goodbye to a good friend who is going on an exciting adventure, but is perhaps not too bright.” On the one hand I felt pleased by this, seeing it as proof that Europe is no longer in denial about Brexit. On the other hand, there was the familiar flare of modernist superiority that anyone with an ounce of love for pop culture must have when they regard mainland Europe; not so much “If not for us you’d be saluting the swastika, sonny!” but “If not for us you’d be doing clog dances to oompah bands, mate!” I don’t particularly feel proud of my country – it seems foolish to be proud of something one was born with, like having green eyes – but I prefer it to most other countries, especially the European ones whose behaviour throughout the 20th century bears very little examination.
AUG25	Older people have more to teach us than Instagram 'influencers'	Some young, or youngish, people love nothing more than a raging night out on the tiles - sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll. I love nothing more than tea and cake with someone over the age of 80.  Old people, so often patently disrespected and ignored, can be irascible, it’s true. But as well as having astonishing stories of the past, many are charming thanks to real manners and a (now) long-forgotten sense of the decorous that was drilled into them. It makes me ashamed when I see members of my own rude generation complacently sitting on public transport playing Candy-Crush, while an old person hovers nearby patiently hanging on with shaking hands – and not being offered a seat. It’s clear that this country has a problem with ageism – a patronising, blinkered and plain rude exception in our otherwise furiously correct culture. After MeToo, plus ongoing campaigns to root out anti-female discrimination and a new extreme dedication to annihilating racism, ageism seems to be the final frontier. Eighteen per cent of the British population is over 65, according to ONS figures, so this is a problem on a grand scale. 
AUG25	Boris should scrap our archaic Sunday trading laws, and let people choose when to shop	The Sunday Trading Act 1994 came into force 25 years ago this weekend, allowing shops to open but restricting the opening times of larger stores – those over 3,000 sq ft – to a maximum of six consecutive hours between 10am and 6pm. This compromise legislation from the Major administration followed the defeat of the Shops Bill 1986, Margaret Thatcher’s only defeat in the House of Commons, which would have brought Sunday trading hours in England and Wales into line with Scotland, where shops can open at any time of day. A lot has changed in Britain over the past quarter of a century and we are this weekend calling for Boris Johnson to lift these old-fashioned restrictions and allow every shop to open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year. The current rules were supposedly designed to protect small, family-run stores from the growth of the major supermarket chains. They have done no such thing. The supermarkets have moved on to the street corner anyway, and towns are awash with their “Express”, “Local” and “Little” stores, designed to get around the rule on square footage.
AUG25	Michael Gove is vindicated: state schools are finally catching up with private schools	Take a moment to salute a heroine. Five years ago, a teacher called Katharine Birbalsingh overcame the local bureaucracy to start a free school named Michaela in a Wembley office block. Birbalsingh wanted kids from ordinary homes to have the sort of education that private schools offered. Not in terms of resources, but in terms of discipline, ethos and ambition. She had no time for the idea that children might underperform because they were poor or black or had tough home lives. She expected the highest standards and, by heaven, she got them. Last week, her first cohort got its GCSE results, and they were among the best in Britain. It turns out that a measure of strictness – her pupils are not allowed to run in corridors or turn around in lessons, for example – makes for better grades. Who knew, eh?
AUG25	We will do everything in our power to help businesses seize the vast opportunities of Brexit	October 31 will be a historic day for the United Kingdom – the day we finally act on the will of the people and leave the European Union. As a truly Brexit-backing Business Secretary, my number one priority for the 67 days ahead is to ensure that businesses are well prepared. My message to them is clear: prepare for Brexit, and the superb opportunities that lie ahead will be yours. One of my first engagements as Secretary of State was to meet with businesses from across the country to talk about the potential for UK growth, jobs and opportunity.
AUG25	Boris is serious about a deal, but the Brussels Eurocrats still want to punish the British ‘deserters’	Even the civil servants seem suddenly to be standing straighter. After three years of immobilism, dreariness and funk, the Government is again exuding purpose. I spent a couple of days this week with some of the officials preparing for Brexit – all of them, as far as I could tell, Remain voters, all of them ready to find fault with the new PM. Instead, to their palpable surprise, they found themselves energised by the waves of determination and leadership pulsing out from Downing Street. EU leaders, too, can feel the difference. They were all keyed up to loathe Boris Johnson, the man they blamed for swinging the 2016 referendum. But look at the body language on display at the PM’s meetings in France and Germany. Where Theresa May was wooden, passive, unable to deviate from a script, Boris is funny, charming, in control of the situation. Heads of government are human, too. They are as likely as anyone else to respond to warmth. Will warmth be enough to secure a deal? It is possible, but unlikely. On paper, the EU has every reason to look for a compromise. Britain has put vast concessions on the table which will be whipped away if no agreement is struck: a continuing role for EU judges, a lopsided arbitration mechanism, a £39 billion payment that no international tribunal would uphold and, not least, two years of non-voting membership.
AUG26	Donald Trump needs to act more like a populist if he wants to win again	Donald Trump is on course to lose the 2020 presidential election. His approval rating hasn’t cracked 45 per cent for over two years and he trails key Democrats in the polls. If he loses, a lot of people will blame his populist politics. The Right will say: “Here’s what happens when you depart from free-market capitalism.” The Left will say: “Populism was really just white racism and there aren’t enough whites to keep Trump in power.” Populism, it turns out, isn’t that popular.  But there is an alternative reading of the Trump presidency, one that says the real problem is that Mr Trump hasn’t been populist enough. Before I explain, a word in defence of the president. However low his ratings may be, the journalist Justin Fox points out that he was actually the second most popular leader at the G7 meeting in France. Mr Trump has an approval rating of just 41.6 per cent, but Emmanuel Macron – globally celebrated as the nemesis of Right-wing populism – is on 28 per cent.  This is a tough time everywhere to be in charge, similar to the late Seventies and early Eighties. At this exact point in their administrations, Jimmy Carter was on 32 per cent and Ronald Reagan 43 per cent.
AUG26	Modern TV takes viewers for idiots. No wonder it can't do 'big ideas' any more	There's a desperate need for greater class diversity if TV is to live up to the issues of the day Few outside of the world of television had heard of Dorothy Byrne before last week. She doesn’t use social media and has never cultivated a public profile. As head of news and current affairs at Channel 4, though, she is among the UK’s most powerful media executives, and last week, giving the annual MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival, this self-confessed “old lady” of factual television launched a volley of rhetorical barbs at both our political and media class. Reactions to the stinging speech have, depressingly, split along party lines. Many on the right slammed her for calling Boris Johnson a “known liar”, as well as “a coward” for failing to appear on Channel 4’s recent Tory leadership debate. Downing Street has since retaliated, apparently refusing Channel 4 News a planned interview with the Prime Minister at the G7 summit.
AUG26	Now that robots can fake handwriting, what value will a love letter have?	Sometimes a new technology appears whose uses are clearly varied and complex. It could be a tool of great evil; it could be a tool for good (case study: face recognition technology). Sometimes, though, a new technology appears where it's actually slightly difficult to figure out whether there are any ethical uses at all. Today my colleague James Cook reports on an amazing start-up, founded by a 23-year-old who has just received £400,000 in investment. The company is called Scribeless, and it uses AI to generate realistic fake handwriting which is "indistinguishable" from real script. It is, apparently, already being used by banks, political parties, and religious groups. But is that... good? Far be it from me to denigrate the effort of British tech entrepreneurs, especially ones who are only 23. This is impressive technology. It uses software to look at real handwritten script and then recreate its variations and inconsistencies, so it transcends mere fonts.
AUG26	It's a scandal the Royal Mint refused to put Enid Blyton on a coin. She was a genius, not sexist	There was something grimly unsurprising about the Royal Mint’s decision not to issue a commemorative 50p coin to mark the 50th anniversary of Enid Blyton’s death last year. Without even being told, you know why the advisory committee – whose minutes were obtained this weekend by a Sunday newspaper – sucked their teeth and decided they wouldn’t want to go there: “she is known to have been a racist, sexist, homophobe and not a very well-regarded writer”. More to the point, they registered “concern over the backlash that may result from this”. In other words, because they were worried that there’d be a big deal about it from Twitter (and, with Twitter, Caliban has found his medium) they chose not to acknowledge the extraordinary contribution that this remarkable writer made to the enjoyment of reading and the spread of literacy around the English‑speaking world. I’d argue, myself, that Enid Blyton was one of the greatest forces for social mobility in the 20th century. Because reading books and enjoying books, which starts as a child, means you’re at home with stories and words. One of the most dispiriting differences between prosperous homes and poorer ones is that the middle classes tend to have books – of varying quality; the poor tend not to. Whether you read or you don’t matters for your life chances, and still more for your stock of pleasure.
AUG26	Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra risks falling apart before it has even started	At the start of this summer, Facebook invited me to the old San Francisco Mint, a building that symbolised the original California Gold Rush, for an early look at the company’s plans to enter finance.  It had been rumoured for months that the social network was planning to release its own cryptocurrency, digital-only money designed to pounds and dollars as a means of exchange. But the plan that Facebook’s crypto chief David Marcus laid out was not what many people had been expecting.  While Libra, as the cryptocurrency will be called, has been designed and spearheaded by a small group of Facebook employees, and it will be accepted as a method of payment within its apps, Marcus insisted that Facebook would not be in charge of it.
AUG26	We can bring justice to victims of the Troubles without hounding blameless British soldiers	Many politicians rightly take plaudits for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Yet without the contribution and, in too many cases, sacrifice of members of our Armed Forces and the Royal Ulster Constabulary, that agreement would never have happened. For me, they will always be the true heroes of the peace process. Of course mistakes were made, and where this occurred it is right that the state apologises. It is also the case that some members of the security forces at times acted unlawfully. There is no excuse for this; it should always be investigated and the law should take its course. From my long experience in Northern Ireland, however, including working there during the Troubles, I am in no doubt that the vast majority who served did so with tremendous courage and professionalism. The legacy of the Troubles continues to cast a dark shadow over Northern Ireland’s present. Across Northern Ireland there is a general view that the current mechanisms for addressing the legacy of the past are not delivering satisfactory outcomes for anyone. Taken as a whole, they also disproportionately focus on former soldiers and police officers.
AUG26	A free school army will end the Left’s stranglehold on education	Eight years ago, Katharine Birbalsingh was poised to achieve her dream.

AUG27	Britain will be better off as a junior partner of the United States than an EU vassal	President Emmanuel Macron of France has stated that closer Anglo-American ties post-Brexit would come at the cost of what he has called “a historic vassalisation of Britain”. Is he right? In stark contrast to the EU, the United States has never attempted to overrule British laws, interfere in British immigration policies, or foist its currency upon us. Macron’s following remark was, “I don’t think it’s the will of the British people to become the junior partner of the US.” Here, too, he is wrong. It was as the junior partner of the United States in terms of men and materiel that this country was on the winning side of the Second World War and the Cold War, and is presently fighting Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. The United States contributes 70 per cent of the resources of Nato, so Britain is the junior partner in the organisation that has kept the peace in Europe for 70 years.
AUG27	Iran's belligerence towards Israel is more likely to provoke war than a rapprochement with Trump	To judge by the sharp escalation in hostilities between Israel and numerous Iranian-backed proxies in the Middle East, the recent flurry of optimism at the G7 summit in Biarritz about a possible diplomatic rapprochement with Tehran was wildly misplaced. During the past few days, details have emerged of the Israeli military’s involvement in actions against targets linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. In the most recent, an Israeli drone struck the base of a Palestinian militia linked to Iran in eastern Lebanon, prompting the Lebanese government to accuse Israel of committing an act of war. This intensification of Israeli military activity is certainly at odds with the suggestion that was doing the rounds at the end of the G7 summit that Iran might be prepared to re-enter negotiations over its controversial nuclear programme.
AUG27	Cricket bosses are squandering a golden chance to entice the next generation	Nobody knows the first thing about prejudice, wrote Paul Johnson, unless they are a red-haired, left-handed Catholic. Ben Stokes is certainly red-haired, bats left-handed and, from the evidence he has presented to the world in his 28 years, he is pretty catholic in his tastes. He would be ill-advised to complain about prejudice, though. The man who could have been booted out of top-level cricket following an incident in a Bristol bar two years ago is now the king of all he surveys. Whether or not Stokes played the innings of our lives at Headingley on Sunday, carrying England to an improbable victory by a single wicket, it was unquestionably the innings of his life. As Ian Botham found out 38 years ago, when he batted no less heroically on the same ground, taking England to a victory in a Test even more topsy-turvy, the all-rounder is now marked for the rest of his days.  We shouldn’t pretend that English cricket is in rude health, though, just because a gifted player laid claim to immortality. Indeed, there is no sport quite like cricket for prompting overwhelming morning-after questions. One of them is whether the sport’s governing bodies will come to regret this superb summer of cricket as a missed opportunity. 
AUG27	Diary of a reluctant MEP: Should we shut down Brussels to save the environment?	In his EU diary, direct from the heart of Brussels, Brexit Party MEP John Longworth reflects on the absurdities of life in the European Parliament As the EU continues with an interminably long holiday I almost feel a pang of “absence makes the heart grow fonder” for the death star in Brussels, but perhaps not! What the recess has done is provide some space for creative thinking during the silly season. How about these for future, post-Brexit Britain policies? There has been much talk over the summer of doing away with the humble penny and two-penny piece. It occurs to me that it would be strange to be left with a lowest denominator coin that is a five pence piece, when there are no pence. It makes no sense (not that it would stop the EU pursuing any policy). I have a solution dear reader - “the shilling”. 
AUG27	Corbyn knows that the Brexit debate is turning him into an irrelevance	The Labour leader's latest attack on Brexit is a desperate attempt to convince Remainers that he's one of them – before they move on without him Most people would probably agree that Jeremy Corbyn has not had a good Brexit. Known before he ascended to his party’s leadership as a committed Eurosceptic, he has tried in vain to convince both the public and his party that he is, in fact, a supporter of Britain’s EU membership. The problem for Corbyn and his supporters is that they see everything through the prism of an epic battle between socialism and capitalism. Virtually every position he’s ever taken has been founded on this perception. Which is unfortunate, because he justified his previous mistrust of the EU on the basis that it was a “capitalist club”. And now, today, he claims to oppose Britain’s departure from it because it would leave us at the mercy of… you guessed it – capitalists.
AUG27	Floundering against a no-deal Brexit, the best Remainers can come up with is yet more fudge	Trumpeting his talks today with opposition party leaders, Jeremy Corbyn said that Labour would "do everything necessary" to stop a no-deal Brexit and would not rule out anything that "could stop this no-deal disaster in its tracks". There is one option that would prevent a no-deal while allowing them to show they genuinely respected the referendum result: passing whatever Boris Johnson manages to renegotiate and put to Parliament. But there is no sign that opposition party leaders are prepared to consider that,  leaving them to work out instead what the most pro-Remain manoeuvre they could pull off. The Labour leader's offer to delay Article 50 and hold a referendum has crashed and burned, understandably so given that his fellow Remainers needed to agree to him becoming Prime Minister for that to happen.
AUG27	The EU's innumerate claim that we should pay £39bn for no-deal does not add up	The question of how much of the £39bn estimated "financial settlement" the UK will make in the event of no deal has once again resurfaced, following Guy  Verhofstadt's tweet yesterday claiming that "if the UK doesn't pay what is due, the EU will not negotiate a trade deal", and payment in full would be the "first condition" of any talks following a WTO exit.  Let’s think about that. Here's the Treasury's estimate for the breakdown of the financial settlement (from January 2018 - some other estimates have tweaked it slightly since then but the points I want to make remain unchanged regardless of the estimate used). Many people seem to imagine that the £39 billion (or €45 billion) was for paying EU staff pensions or other similar liabilities the UK took on as a member.
AUG27	From 5G to full-fibre broadband, we'll fix rural Britain's internet woes	Our rural communities are a thriving hotbed of industry and technology and for them resilient digital connectivity is vital. They must not be forgotten as we continue to improve Britain’s digital infrastructure. That’s why the PM has made this one of his early priorities – and rightly so. In his first few days as Prime Minister he recognised the need to provide world-class digital infrastructure across the UK so that, together, we can continue to compete and grow in the global economy. This will see every corner of the UK being provided with full-fibre broadband, so that every community has the same opportunities. We’ve invested £650 million for fibre rollout in the three years to 2021 and are prioritising rural areas – including their schools, hospitals and other public buildings – to make sure they get a gigabit-capable connection first.
AUG27	Sunshine, Stokes and Sanditon. Was this the best Bank Holiday Britain has ever had?	It’s the morning after the bank holiday before. The grass is damp and cobweb-strewn in the morning, the nights are drawing in and it’s time to head back to school and work. So why are so many of us still smiling? Bank holidays usually mean television pictures of umbrellas blowing inside out on rainswept promenades, but last week forecasters were beaming as they shared the good news: coast-to-coast sunshine! Could it be true? Yes, we were sunblest, and most of us agree that this was, indeed, the best bank holiday ever. The end of August can be tinged with melancholy. As we know, summer’s lease hath all too short a date – especially in Britain – and this summer has been a bit “four seasons”, to put it mildly.
AUG27	Fixing Mrs May's deal won't be easy, but Boris deserves a chance to try	How are the mighty fallen. Two weeks ago, ardent Remainer MPs began their attack on Boris Johnson with threats of stopping a no-deal Brexit in any way they could. A group of Conservative MPs even appallingly agreed to enter talks with Jeremy Corbyn about an alternative stop-gap administration. Then, right on cue, there came the leak by a supposed disgruntled ex-minister of a report codenamed “Yellowhammer” on the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. Full of doom and gloom, it inevitably told us that we are all, as Private Frazer from Dad’s Army would have said, “Doomed I tell ye, Doomed!” Perhaps the high point of this absurdity came with the former chancellor Philip Hammond claiming that he knew the British people didn’t vote to leave with no deal. He alone it appears, knows what motivated people to vote for Brexit. Really?
AUG28	The ecstatic outrage of Remainer MPs can't distract from their bizarre failure	Just when we thought we were heading for another wretched round of ear-straining speculation about whether the mood music in Brussels is changing, the smell of the political air in Britain has been decisively transformed. The dull tang of caution has given way to acid self-resolve, as No 10 seeks to show the EU that it is capable of pushing through a no-deal Brexit. But, perhaps more interestingly, the rot is really starting to set in among the hypocritical and cowardly Remainers. Boris Johnson’s move to finally call the bluff of Remainer MPs by asking the Queen to suspend parliament is a game changer. And the whirlwind of outrage has been quite a spectacle to behold. While Ruth Davidson is set to resign as Scottish Tory leader, Jeremy Corbyn, Jo Swinson and Anna Soubry have demanded to meet the Queen. John Bercow – the man who has reduced the role of Speaker to a paradigm of law-bending goonery worthy of Putin’s Russia – has claimed that shutting down Parliament is “an offence against the democratic process” and accused the PM of committing a “constitutional outrage”.
AUG28	This is Boris's Falklands War, and he will do everything he can to win it	When Winston Churchill was asked whether Downing Street personnel could have a week’s holiday for Christmas, he declined immediately. It was 1940 and Churchill, “surprised” by the request, explained that he planned to work “continuously”. Staff were only allowed time off to attend Divine Service, and Churchill wished them “a busy Christmas and a frantic New Year”. He only took eight days’ holiday between the start and end of the war, and even then had cables delivered on at least some of those days, as Andrew Roberts recounts in his wonderful biography. Assistants would go home at 6am, before being back on duty by 10am; Cabinet meetings were routinely held well after midnight. There was a war, and it had to be won. It is no secret that Boris Johnson admires Churchill: he, too, wrote a paean to the great man, and (perhaps too obviously) would love, in time, to be seen as his 21st-century incarnation, a thought that used to amuse his opponents but now infuriates them.
AUG28	The PM's prorogue move could end up biting Brexiteers in the backside	Is Boris Johnson’s decision to ask the Queen to suspend Parliament for a few weeks really a “coup” or “constitutional outrage”? Hardly. A tactical use of long-established rules is a more accurate description. Many Brexiteers will support him for acting decisively, in an attempt to stymie the anti-democratic efforts of parliamentary Remainers. But I can’t help worrying that we may come to regret it. One day he, or another Tory, might find themselves sitting in the Leader of the Opposition’s place in the Commons confronting Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell or Rebecca Long-Bailey.
AUG28	An election is coming — Boris can only win it by being brave enough to go for a clean Brexit	The government's announcement today that a Queen’s Speech will be held on October 14th (proroguing parliament in the process) makes a confidence motion now certain, a general election more likely and is seen as a positive move by Brexiteers. This comes as a clear message was sent to the heart of Westminster on Tuesday when we announced that we have 635 approved candidates in place across the country. The Brexit Party stands ready to fight the next general election. In fact, we are more prepared than any other party in British politics today. As was the case in May, when we won the European elections so decisively, we have selected a wide range of men and women from all backgrounds and from every walk of life. They share one common purpose: to fight for democracy. Every single one of them is willing to put their country ahead of any other political ambitions or considerations. It is heartening and humbling to know that so many figures of this calibre are willing to act in the interests of the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit, because we need them now more than ever.
AUG28	Canada survived proroguing parliament – and Britain will too	Is Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament really, as Speaker John Bercow put it yesterday, a “constitutional outrage”? If the experience of Canada is anything to go by, the answer is a resounding no. We went through the same process a decade ago and you can rest assured that parliamentary democracy in the UK is not about to be destroyed. It started in Canada in October 2008, when prime minister Stephen Harper of the Conservative Party was re‑elected with a second straight minority government. His administration then immediately announced a controversial policy proposal: eliminating public financing for political parties. At the time, Canadian parties earned Can$1.95 for every vote they received in a federal election, costing the taxpayer roughly Can$30 million in total. The Tories would have taken the biggest hit from scrapping it but, as the most successful party at fundraising, they would have survived. The Liberals, socialist-oriented New Democrats and separatist Bloc Québécois all relied heavily on this slush fund and could have been in huge financial trouble. So the opposition revolted, in what could be called a political coup d’etat.
AUG28	Boris Johnson's unprecedented decision is indeed a threat to our democracy	The government’s proposal to prorogue parliament for approaching five weeks until October 14 disregards the basic principles of our constitutional system. That should concern us all, whatever our view of Brexit. The centrepiece of the constitutional system is our democratically elected parliament. The government holds office only so long as it maintains the confidence of the House of Commons. During that time, it is subject to scrutiny by MPs and peers. Such scrutiny, imperfect though it often appears, is vital for properly democratic government. Without it, governments, once in office, could pursue their agendas largely unchecked. We could fall into demagoguery, rather than democracy. A referendum does not alter the need for parliamentary scrutiny – particularly when it’s a referendum like the Brexit one, that leaves all the details still to be worked out. Proper democratic accountability is needed throughout the process, and, in the absence of another election or referendum, only parliament can provide it.
AUG28	Brexiteers may not like the backstop, but it is a necessary compromise	Since I retired last summer after four decades as an Irish diplomat, including as Ambassador to the UK and the EU, I have contributed to public debate about Brexit. I am motivated to do so by my deep affection for the UK and by the importance I attach to the relationship between our countries.  The warmth of our relationship is reflected in the mutual affection and admiration between our peoples as well as in the personal friendships which bind us. For me, our friendship also means the years I spent at a British university, a career working closely with British diplomatic colleagues in pursuit of our uniquely shared interests, and my years as Irish Ambassador in London at a time when the teenage daughter of an Irish friend of mine could be envied by an English schoolmate because it was “cool to be Irish”.  Regrettably, Brexit has set our countries on diverging paths. It was not Ireland’s choice although we respect it. What saddens me is that a minority in Britain increasingly seems to misunderstand Ireland largely because an even smaller minority misrepresents Ireland’s motives. 
AUG28	This isn't a 'constitutional outrage' – whingeing Remainers need to grow up	And so it comes down to the courts, as was always likely to be the case. The Prime Minister’s announcement that he would prorogue parliament in September in advance of the long-delayed Queen’s Speech has been met with predictable howls of anguish and inevitable accusations of outrage. Johnson’s move has left the Continuity Remain camp in something of a panic. After yesterday’s historic meeting at Church House, at which a few dozen MPs turned up to sign the pretentiously entitled Church House Declaration committing them to supporting as many petitions as necessary to let everyone know just how cross they are about a no deal Brexit, they perhaps felt they were on the front foot for the first time since Johnson entered Downing Street. There’s no doubt that if Theresa May were still prime minister, those opposed to Brexit in any form (and the signatories to the declaration are exactly that) would have every reason to believe they were winning the fight. After repeatedly insisting that we would be leaving the EU on October 31, she would no doubt have repeated her action from earlier this year and sought yet another extension to Article 50 even before the Commons had got its act together to demand one.
AUG28	Boris Johnson is giving Remainers a taste of their own medicine with his Queen's Speech gambit	Remainers have had a painful reminder of what happens when they forget Mike Tyson's cardinal rule:: "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth." They have been busy congratulating each other after opposition parties gathered yesterday at Church House to declare their dislike of a no-deal Brexit and party leaders met to agree that legislation was needed to avert it, with little regard as to what the Government might do in the meantime.  Indeed, Remainers have been behaving as if victory was already in the bag, even though getting over 200 MPs to sign the "Church House declaration" saying they want to stop a no-deal is hardly a great achievement given that 400 voted against one in March's indicative votes round.
AUG28	Boris Johnson is gambling that he has left Remainers too little time to stop a no-deal Brexit	The PM has acted decisively to throw the gauntlet down to his critics, announcing that there will be a Queen’s Speech on 14 October.  Instead of debating bills on circus animals, we can expect to see a "bold and ambitious" domestic agenda focusing on crime, education and the NHS. Any new PM should be able to set out their plans for Government, but it could not come at a more controversial time. For a Queen’s Speech also means that the current session must come to an end, with Parliament prorogued, or closed down, until the new session begins. This will happen in the second week of September, meaning that Parliament won’t be sitting for four weeks until the new Queen’s Speech.  This week MPs from a range of Opposition parties met in Church House to discuss how they planned to stop a no-deal Brexit. Over the summer the talk was of a vote of no-confidence in the Prime Minister when Parliament returns next week. The problem with this is that no-one could agree on who the alternative PM was to be. First Jeremy Corbyn was rejected by Conservative rebels, before other backbenchers such as Caroline Lucas and Ken Clarke were put forward and vetoed. 
AUG29	Could Ruth Davidson's departure be Tories' loss but Unionists' gain?	To an extent some of us expected melancholia; after all, giving up what has been an incredibly successful tenure as leader of a once almost extinct political party would surely have provoked feelings of...what?Regret? Perhaps. Sorrow? Maybe. Disappointment at a job not completed? Certainly. However, none of these were the case when Ruth Davidson ended what had been days, if not weeks, of speculation - by politicians and those of us in the fourth estate over the future of this extraordinary political leader - by telling us where her future lies. Instead, the predominant impression Ms Davidson left us with was one of relief.
AUG29	Do these media luvvies really believe it's time to man the barricades?	Remember this. When the coup came, it was the media luvvies, actors and literati who led us to the barricades. “You will not destroy the freedoms my grandfather fought two world wars to defend,” the hero and known kerb-crawler Hugh Grant wrote on Twitter. “Weep for Britain,” wrote Stephen Fry. “A sick, cynical brutal and horribly dangerous coup d’état.” (“Ya-boo sucks to you, Frenchie,” he no doubt added, offline). Philip Pullman, the author, suggested dryly that he’d like to hang the Prime Minister from “the nearest lamppost”, but when challenged, amended his preference to deploying “the axe and the block”. Perhaps we should try The Not-So-Subtle Knife? @metpoliceuk adding a screenshot of his tweet where Philip Pullman is clearly inciting to violence. Please take action against this vile individual. pic.twitter.com/usTjLbOXQE
AUG29	Where was the Remainers' constitutional outrage when Bercow broke the rules?	It’s not a common word, usually the preserve only of constitutionalists and those strange practitioners of the abstruse parliamentary arts, Commons and Lords clerks. For weeks it was whispered about, then spoken at increasing volume. Would he? Wouldn’t he? And now we know: the Prime Minister has asked Her Majesty The Queen to prorogue Parliament by September 12, to be re-opened with a fresh Gracious Address on October 14. Her Majesty has agreed. So that’s that. Let’s be clear right at the outset. This is not a coup d’état. It is not a breach of parliamentary rules. It is not, in that critical word for Westminster wonks, disorderly. By strict letter of the law, there is nothing to see here, and anyone who tells you differently is simply misinformed. However, the decision to prorogue Parliament for nearly a month, with the UK’s departure from the European Union looming on (so we are told) October 31, is a striking and controversial one. We were due a three-week recess anyway, to cover the party conference season, so one could argue that the legislative days lost amount only to four or five: but prorogation is rather more solid than a recess.
AUG29	The hard Left could seize on this febrile moment to spark a poll tax-style revolt	The 'luvvies' have gone beserk, since Boris Johnson announced his prorogation of Parliament. Stephen Fry, Hugh Grant and Simon Schama are just a few of those who have ranted and raved on Twitter, whilst children's author Philip Pullman went further, tweeting: “When I hear the name ‘Boris Johnson’, for some reason the words ‘rope’ and ‘nearest lamp-post’ come to mind as well”. This is deeply irresponsible behaviour following what happened to Jo Cox, but these theatrical Remainers seem oblivious and immune to their shrill voices and nastiness. That politics has turned ugly and more violent is nothing new; it has been a trend for some time, fanned by social media.  But there is much more to this than a few metropolitan 'luvvies'. The militant Left is now on the march to a far harder, one might say more revolutionary, tune. Unfortunately, all the indicators are there for 1990-style poll tax confrontation. The Marxists and others from the hard Left have the conditions they have been waiting for: an issue that motivates extreme passion, even hatred, in Brexit; a single event in prorogation of Parliament to focus peoples’ ire and whip up resentment; an “illegitimate” Conservative leader and Government; and people holding positions of power to give them political cover for their actions. It’s a highly combustible combination.
AUG29	Amazon has ruined my daughter Alexa’s name	“What’s your other child called? Siri?” These were the actual words of a man behind me in the queue at Sainsbury’s some months ago, as I bellowed at my rampaging toddler, Alexa, across the checkout. What I ought to have replied was: “I’m sorry, I didn’t realise it was now acceptable to sneer to a stranger’s face about the name she has chosen for her daughter.” In fact, I responded with a surprised laugh, and spent the rest of the day thinking of better retorts.
AUG29	It is hysterically inaccurate to suggest that Boris Johnson has just staged a coup	One of these things is akin to a coup. A) Refusing to implement the largest democratic vote in favour of anything in British history. B) Treating this year like almost any other, as a consequence of which MPs end up having three or four fewer days to spend debating a matter they've debated endlessly for three years. Which? Back in March, Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out that on its normal schedule, Parliament would have shut down before MPs got around to voting to postpone our March 29th EU departure date. He argued that the government was not obliged to artificially extend the Commons’ sitting period to make things convenient for its opponents, but should instead shut down according to the usual schedule, in formal terms “proroguing” Parliament until after March 29th. This idea returned in a more radical form during the Conservative Leadership election. Dominic Raab said he would not rule out proroguing Parliament from the point he became PM until after November 1, to force through a no deal Brexit. That “prorogation debate” was specifically not about the normal, routine prorogation that happens in the Autumn virtually every non-election year, ahead of the Queen’s Speech. It was a much more radical plan of shutting down Parliament for perhaps five months, specifically to impose the will of the Executive to resolve a crisis. It was noted that the current Parliament is the longest sitting since the Civil War, and that there was recent precedent for proroguing to resolve a crisis, with the Canadian government having done so only a decade ago.
AUG29	Ruth Davidson's parting speech revealed the only possible route to stopping no deal	Ruth Davidson's resignation statement was raw with emotion: not just when the outgoing Scottish Conservative leader explained why she wanted to spend more time with her family, but when she explained how important it was for Parliament to pass a Brexit deal. You would be forgiven for thinking in light of the fervent talk in Westminster of prorogation, no-confidence motions and Brexit-averting legislation that Boris Johnson had committed to pursuing a no-deal Brexit. But he has made clear to Brussels chiefs that his "highest priority" - to the chagrin of Nigel Farage - is to hammer out a satisfactory deal. That was what Ms Davidson sought to highlight, citing "long conversations on this point" as proof of his commitment, revealing that she had been assured by him just last week in Downing Street "categorically" that he was still trying to get a deal and that he believes his recent efforts at the G7 had "helped open the door a crack". The prospect of a deal is what is keeping ministers like Matt Hancock and Nicky Morgan in the cabinet, with friends of Amber Rudd telling my Telegraph colleagues that she would not leave "while there is still a chance of a deal" being done.
AUG29	The luvvie elite's mass hysteria over prorogation is astonishing	Hospitals are said to be stockpiling medicines in case of a no-deal Brexit. I wonder whether this has less to do with the prospect of modest hold-ups at Dover and Calais than with the huge surge in demand for tranquilisers and mood-stabilisers among the frustrated luvvies of the Remain establishment. Hugh Grant alone could do with a bucketful, to judge by his tweet yesterday: “You will not f*** with my children’s future.   You will not destroy the freedoms my grandfather fought 2 world wars to defend….”  By the way, it was me who put in the asterisks. Steady on, Hugh. Admittedly, you knew your grandfather better than I did, but are you sure he would have been so pro-EU? It is usually those who lived through the Second World War – the over 80s – who are accused of seeking to ruin their children’s future. You will not fuck with my children’s future. You will not destroy the freedoms my grandfather fought two world wars to defend. Fuck off you over-promoted rubber bath toy. Britain is revolted by you and you little gang of masturbatory prefects. https://t.co/Oc0xwLI6dI
AUG29	No 10's ingenious prorogation move has all the hallmarks of Dominic Cummings	There is a famous clip of the 1970s footballing genius Johan Cruyff baffling an opponent with an audacious new manoeuvre. He shields the ball on the wing with his back to the opposition full back, then leans his upper body infield, as if he is about to start dribbling it across the pitch. As his opponent shadows the move, taking a pace infield, Cruyff suddenly drags the ball back down the wing behind his standing leg and bolts, leaving a befuddled opponent wrong-footed in his slipstream. What Westminster witnessed yesterday with the Government announcing the proroguing of Parliament was the political equivalent of the Cruyff turn. It is ostensibly to prepare a Queen’s Speech but with the helpful effect of drastically compressing the time available to Brexit-blocking MPs.
AUG29	At last, we have a cabinet that will stand up to EU lawfare	The latest edition of Project Fear came late last week when Ireland’s Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, claimed that more than 60 years of cooperation between law enforcement agencies in the UK and Europe would “fall away” post-Brexit. This was closely followed by a joint-report by academics in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland which claimed a No Deal Brexit would disrupt cross-border policing cooperation with the EU with “serious consequences”, warning the UK against playing “fast and loose with issues of human rights or criminal justice”.  Naturally, Remainers are gleefully seizing on their comments – conveniently ignoring the reality that the EU’s cavalier attitude to human rights and criminal justice has put UK security and our criminal justice system in jeopardy for over a decade.  One of the biggest scandals of Theresa May’s government was the hopelessly naïve approach it took towards EU law enforcement and judicial assistance. May’s team wanted cooperation, such as the highly dangerous European Arrest Warrant (EAW), to continue unchanged from the EU’s system of no-questions-asked surrender of suspects and blind faith in each other’s legal systems.
AUG30	Delivering Brexit is the only way to end the performative rage of the Remainers	Prorogation is the new backstop. There’s an ugly little sentence. And one that no one in history had cause to write until this week. But “prorogation” is indeed the latest thing that a portion of the country has decided to become instant experts on in order to expend all their available fury over. Those of us who lived through the “backstop” years can recognise the signs. As it happens, I spent a portion of my life focusing on Northern Ireland. A decade ago I wrote a book on the province and, while the subject has always fascinated me, the signs that not everyone shared my enthusiasm were always there. The way people used to look at their watches was one. As was the way in which they claimed their glasses needed refilling, and never returned. There were also the steps backwards – imperceptible at first, but often ending in a crazed dash for the door. Over the course of years these, among other subtle and not-so-subtle indicators, persuaded me that chat about Northern Ireland was one way to empty a room in record time. So the instant expertise on border arrangements that emerged in recent times always struck me as suspect. People who had never been near the Irish border began to say: “Ah, but what about the backstop.”
AUG30	One month of Boris in charge has totally reinvigorated the Tory Party	Almost unbelievably, it’s only a little over a month since Theresa May left Downing Street. It feels like a lot longer. The legacy of her time in office lingers on, throbbing like an unjust hangover afflicting a sufferer who didn’t get to enjoy the party beforehand. But, none the less, it’s remarkable how much has changed since her departure. Remember those dreary months earlier this year, in which the Parliamentary Conservative Party muttered about getting rid of her but kept failing to do so. Her last dogged defenders argued to anyone who would listen that changing leader wouldn’t change a thing. The Parliamentary arithmetic, they said, would remain the same, as though the Commons numbers would somehow compel any prime minister to adopt May’s woeful approach. The arithmetic matters, of course, but it’s now obvious for all to see that it is not the only force in politics. Changing leader has already changed a great deal. This is partially because in the British system a government can do a lot of things without needing to navigate Parliament, but also because Boris Johnson is so utterly different from his predecessor.
AUG30	Dangerous smart motorways are a cynical attempt to save money	Is there any greater misnomer than a “smart motorway”? It is a typical piece of Whitehall Orwell-speak, dressing up an obviously dumb idea with a word that invites us to think there must be some terribly clever piece of counter-intuitive modelling behind it. If you have never come across a smart motorway, it simply involves turning the hard shoulder into an ordinary running lane. That and installing overhead gantries with variable speed limit signs – a thinly veiled excuse to sneak in extra speed cameras. Your first reaction may well be to ask: what are motorists supposed to do if their car starts spluttering and there is no hard shoulder on which to shelter? That is what Highways Agency officials are still trying to answer, 13 years and several billion pounds of taxpayers’ money later. A report from the organisation has found that motorists are three times as likely to find themselves breaking down in an active running lane on a smart motorway than they are on a motorway with a hard shoulder – often, sadly, with predictable results. Two motorists have been killed on the M1 in the past year alone as they struggled to get clear of other traffic.
AUG30	Has Boris's prorogation move spooked Brussels into scrapping the backstop?	With the prorogation of Parliament, and Boris Johnson’s chief negotiator David Frost now due to meet twice a week with his European counterparts over the next month, the big question is whether the EU will now soften its position, and make concessions around the backstop. Boris Johnson and his allies have been very transparent with their strategy. The idea is to make sure that there are only two options left: a deal acceptable to the UK, or “no deal”. The whole point is to therefore rule out all the other options: extending UK membership, a second referendum, revoking the request to leave the EU or deposing the current government. As Jacob Rees-Mogg, a staunch ally of Boris has put it: "If you seek a deal prepare for no deal." But will the EU play ball?
AUG30	Labour is plotting its path to power through a wave of revolutionary strikes	As Remain-supporting campaigners come to terms with their latest court defeat and the startling revelation that even judges have a better grasp of politics than some of our MPs, it might be informative to consider events in a parallel universe. Just imagine if a Corbyn-led government, acting entirely legally and within the limits of our uncodified constitution, were to embark on a course that seemed, to its opponents, morally repulsive and politically cynical. Now imagine how members of Momentum and the prime minister’s strongest supporters might feel if legal action aimed at reversing the government’s course was launched. Cue many renditions of (the only verse they can remember of) “The Red Flag” and howls of indignation by various mouth pieces of the far left as they see a threat to their ambitions. “You see? This is how the establishment always fights back against democracy!”
AUG30	Only Whitehall stands in the way of our Gatt 24 'get out of jail free' Brexit card	It was supposed to be a “gotcha” moment. During the Conservative leadership election, Andrew Neil sought to ambush Boris Johnson, challenging him on his claim that a World Trade Organisation (WTO) deal called GATT Article XXIV (GATT24 to the layman) could be used to smooth a ‘No Withdrawal Agreement/No Deal’ Brexit. But it wasn’t Boris who was wrong; it was, most uncharacteristically, Mr Neil. WATCH: Boris Johnson's car crash interview with Andrew Neil!!This awful, arrogant and incompetent man will be in charge of the UK on 23rd July!! 😲😓#BrexitShambles 🇬🇧🇪🇺#GeneralElectionNow ❌#BBCOurNextPM pic.twitter.com/0VCKLHsqFU  The exchange is worth going through in some detail: first Boris stated that we could leave the EU while still leaving a current zero tariff and no quotas agreement in place. He had in previous statements explained that this could be accomplished by an agreement between the UK and the EU to use Clause 5b of Article XXIV of the GATT.
AUG30	If there's anyone we can trust with our constitution, it's the Queen	The frenetic moves afoot in the Brexit political situation are so intense that inevitably the Queen has been drawn into it. However, it is not the Prime Minister whom we should be blaming for this, but Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson who asked her to act beyond precedent by very publicly requesting a meeting. The arrival of three privy councillors at her Balmoral retreat was given a slightly sinister import by the Government’s attempts to keep it under wraps. This may have given the impression that what they were doing was somehow constitutionally dubious or that there was a possibility that Her Majesty might refuse their request. However, there was never any question of that. The Privy Council met in the library, the request was made and the Queen simply said: “Approved.” We don’t know what else she may have said after the meeting, and probably she said nothing on the matter at all. She has had a lifetime’s experience of avoiding difficult questions. Sometimes if faced with one, her reply is a radiant smile and silence (a lesson which we could all follow with profit). The monarch must stay aloof from the political fray. Years ago, the Duke of Edinburgh got it right when he stated: “The advantage of a monarchy is that it doesn’t enter into the political arguments of the day. It makes a very good division of responsibilities: the prime minister does all the political business, and this means that those people who oppose him politically don’t have to oppose him as head of state. The monarchy is above politics.”

To an extent some of us expected melancholia; after all, giving up what has been an incredibly successful tenure as leader of a once almost extinct political party would surely have provoked feelings of...what?Regret? Perhaps. Sorrow? Maybe. Disappointment at a job not completed? Certainly.

AUG30	Ruth Davidson citing motherhood in her resignation only reinforces the stereotype that women must choose	The whining. The tantrums. The throwing of toys out of the pram. It’s hard enough dealing with the Brexit baby, let alone a real one. Yet the latter is one of the main reasons Ruth Davidson has said made her quit as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. In her resignation letter, the 40-year-old - who returned from maternity leave in May - wrote that "much has changed over the years of my leadership”. The biggest of those changes, she emphasised, was having a baby, Finn. “The threat of spending hundreds of hours away from my home and family now fills me with dread,” she wrote. “The party and my work has always come first, often at the expense of commitments to loved ones. The arrival of my son means I now make a different choice.”
AUG30	Do these media luvvies really believe it's time to man the barricades?	Remember this. When the coup came, it was the media luvvies, actors and literati who led us to the barricades. “You will not destroy the freedoms my grandfather fought two world wars to defend,” the hero and known kerb-crawler Hugh Grant wrote on Twitter. “Weep for Britain,” wrote Stephen Fry. “A sick, cynical brutal and horribly dangerous coup d’état.” (“Ya-boo sucks to you, Frenchie,” he no doubt added, offline). Philip Pullman, the author, suggested dryly that he’d like to hang the Prime Minister from “the nearest lamppost”, but when challenged, amended his preference to deploying “the axe and the block”.

AUG31	Parliament must give Boris Johnson the space to secure a better Brexit deal	At times in the last three years it has seemed that Parliament will do anything but the one thing it promised. To honour the democratic vote to leave the EU. Instead of coalescing behind a deal to get us out, Parliament has quibbled, prevaricated, delayed and disappointed. The Commons has repeatedly said what it won’t accept but has never accepted that we are here to serve the people and respect their decision. The Labour Party, in particular, have been guilty of the most spectacular bad faith. They promised on page 24 of their 2017 election manifesto to honour the referendum result but then, with some honourable exceptions, have consistently voted not to.  The Prime Minister has made clear that we will, at last, honour the referendum decision. We will leave on October 31, deal or no deal. And, already, that resolution is helping us secure a solution. EU leaders are now ready to talk about a different way forward.  As of next week we will be in talks with the EU to try to find a new deal which can command the confidence of the Commons. The EU knows that a deal which has failed to pass the Commons three times cannot be brought back unamended.
AUG31	The Establishment's legalistic rage over Brexit harks back to Britain’s pre-democratic era	We have entered the realm of fantasy politics, as if Lewis Carroll had written the script. “When I use a word”, Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more not less.” Absolutist. Totalitarian. Dictatorial. Fascist.  Do those flinging these words about know what they mean? Are they careless of how they demean those who really suffered these horrors? “Off with his head”, cries the Red Queen – or is it Philip Pullman? The nastiness and verbal violence that die-hard Remainers have wallowed in since 2016 have reached new depths. Oh, but we don’t mean it literally, they say, as if that makes it less deplorable. I recall Albert Camus, who knew what he was talking about: “I abhor comfortable violence. I abhor those whose words go further than their deeds.” This verbal incontinence is contemptible, and also rather comical. It is a sickness of our present political culture, but in Marx’s phrase, an infantile disorder. Infantile tantrums of those with identikit opinions who want their own way: the Violet Elisabeth Bott tendency – “I’ll thcream and thcream till I’m thick”. Senile tantrums of the ageing League of EU Loyalists, apoplectic as their old certainties dissolve. Let us hope that they are, in Burke’s words, like half a dozen grasshoppers who make the field ring with their importunate chink. Let us hope too that their verbal extremism is not taken literally by people less dainty than themselves.
AUG31	Middle England has thrived on the high street chains it so likes to demonise	The people of Totnes have finally allowed a Caffè Nero owned outlet to open in their High Street. Such is the town’s aversion to chains that Costa Coffee earlier backed out after locals threatened a boycott. The locals’ disdain for large businesses seems confined to coffee shops: after all the cafe will replace a Barclays Bank, itself obviously part of a chain. And, if there is one industry in dire need of break-up, it probably isn’t catering: as I remember, the collapse of the world economy in 2008 was not precipitated by the overexpansion of Pret A Manger. It may surprise you to know that there is nothing new about this debate. In 1939 George Orwell decried the growth of the J Lyons chain and ABC tearooms as evidence of the industrialisation of once homely practices. As early as the mid 1920s those two chains between them had over 500 outlets in London alone, double what Starbucks has now. The relationship between chains and independent operators is never easy. But we should perhaps be more sympathetic to large catering operators than our natural instincts incline us. For a start, many of Totnes’s 24 other cafes may only exist to serve a market created by the larger players: before the advent of the big brands in the 1990s, anyone trying to charge £2.80 for a coffee would have been ridiculed.
AUG31	Protesting just isn’t what it used to be in this vapid snowflake age	Observing the thoughtlessness with which the word ‘coup’ was reduced to a hashtag this week, I had an epiphany about why I dislike those shrill young people we hard-hearted types like to call snowflakes and who like to call themselves Social Justice Warriors (SJWs). It’s not because I find them Left-wing, as many Snowflake-baiters do - but because I find them not Left-wing enough. They are bleeding heart solipsists whose hearts bleed only for themselves. That the lily-livered SJWs of Twitter dare to apply ‘coup’ to being outfoxed by someone who pulled the rug out from under their two left feet made me see red - and indeed remember the time I used to be Red. I may be a church-going Hove-dwelling sexagenarian Telegraph columnist now, but in my youth I was forever carrying placards which generally read ‘Down With This Sort Of Thing’. I’d march for dolphins being slaughtered by the Japanese and foxes being bothered by the burghers of Berkshire, but anti-fascist demos were my favourite by far; facing down the National Front on the mean streets of Lewisham, crushed between a Rastafarian and a posh old man who waved his walking stick and shouted “Jew-baiters! Damn Jew-baiters!” I was having the time of my teenage life.
AUG31	Hysterical Remain is redolent of the bilious anti-Thatcher brigade	Words have never mattered more than this. It is fair to say that what the government has decided to do is irregular and tactically ruthless. But it is not – I think we can all agree after days of meticulous argumentation – unconstitutional, and it is certainly not undemocratic. Even its irregularity and ruthlessness seem pretty mundane after all the arcane legal contortions of the Irreconcilable Remainers who have tirelessly manipulated parliamentary procedure over the past months. (I wonder if they have any idea how much furious exasperation these antics provoked among real people.) And it is certainly right to describe the antagonistic response to that government decision as absurd, hysterical and largely opportunistic. But it is not true to say that it is unprecedented. Those old enough to have been politically sentient during the 1980s will recall that the anti-Thatcher bile of that time could give this current frenzy a run for its money. In fact, today’s histrionics are, thus far anyway, a rather effete impersonation of the often violent resistance to Thatcherite trade union reforms and clamp-downs on local government which were reinforced by the knowledge that such protest had successfully brought down elected governments.
AUG31	Please don't turn the Great British Bake Off into a Love Island clone	Do you remember the first time you were made to feel like a proper grown-up? When a mother on the bus said to her child, “let the lady go first” and you realised that lady was you. Or perhaps when you tuned into the new series of the Great British Bake Off this week and heard 20-year-old contestant Jamie say that his favourite flavour from childhood was salted caramel. Sorry? Salted caramel? I’m certain that wasn’t a thing until about five minutes ago. My favourite flavour from childhood was e-numbers. Jamie, who looks like he’s just got off the coach back from Reading festival, is part of the youngest batch of bakers to ever grace Bake Off, as the show enters its tenth series. “Does your mum know you’re here?” asked Paul Hollywood, probably not for the first time.
AUG31	The futility of juggling work and family is the dirty little secret of modern times	Before she gave birth to her son Finn last year, Ruth Davidson talked about her pregnancy. “This is about our family. This is not about my job,” she said of her imminent motherhood. She seemed to believe that the two things could be separated. But this week, with her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, it seems Davidson has had an awakening. “I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend,” she wrote in her official missive to the Scottish party chairman. She didn’t add “mother” to that list, but those of us who have similarly been forced to make “different choices” hear it anyway. Davidson has now experienced, first hand, how hellishly complicated it is to do a highly pressured job and have children – and how untangling work and caring is often impossible, especially when the former suddenly gets more demanding.
AUG31	Sacred Mysteries: The Cambridgeshire gallows of deadly sins	Something strange was hanging in the old church of All Saints and St Andrew in the rural Cambridgeshire village of Kingston when I visited it on Wednesday. The scene looked like the opening of a P D James crime novel. It was a perfect English summer’s day and at the gate of the grassy churchyard swung a heavy wooden sign announcing “Church open”. It was. The north and south doors were open to a gentle breeze. No one came. But at seven of the pillars of the nave chasubles hung from little wooden gibbets, like hanged martyrs. One bore the image of a pig’s head with large letters reading: “The pig of temperance.” Another, of a different colour, had a goat’s head: “The goat of chastity.”
AUG31	The last thing we need is another Brexit tongue twister	Pity the lexicographers, who have truly had their work cut out this week. As if the process of proroguing hadn’t caused so much head scratching as to leave nail marks all but visible on the nation’s skulls, the word itself has had a similar effect, forcing us to verbalise a tongue-twister of a term we didn’t know existed until a few days ago. But the halcyon days of proroguing our understanding of discombobulating parliamentary terminology are done. Between knowing the intricacies of Article 50 and the Withdrawal Agreement, of the backstop and BRINOs and red, white and blue Brexits, post-referendum dithering has mangled political language beyond recognition. Which a cynic might view as a diversion from the fact no actual politics has been done. Just as “leaving the EU” can be defined in many ways, so language has become similarly slippery, not just in the offices of Westminster but our kitchens, too, where regular words have been given a rebrand. New research from BBC Good Food magazine has found a glut of culinary terms that didn’t exist when it was launched 30 years ago, with “soggy bottoms”, “wonky veg”, “hangry” and “small plates” embedding themselves in our vernacular.
AUG31	Delivering Brexit is the only way to end the performative rage of the Remainers	Prorogation is the new backstop. There’s an ugly little sentence. And one that no one in history had cause to write until this week. But “prorogation” is indeed the latest thing that a portion of the country has decided to become instant experts on in order to expend all their available fury over. Those of us who lived through the “backstop” years can recognise the signs. As it happens, I spent a portion of my life focusing on Northern Ireland. A decade ago I wrote a book on the province and, while the subject has always fascinated me, the signs that not everyone shared my enthusiasm were always there. The way people used to look at their watches was one. As was the way in which they claimed their glasses needed refilling, and never returned. There were also the steps backwards – imperceptible at first, but often ending in a crazed dash for the door. Over the course of years these, among other subtle and not-so-subtle indicators, persuaded me that chat about Northern Ireland was one way to empty a room in record time. So the instant expertise on border arrangements that emerged in recent times always struck me as suspect. People who had never been near the Irish border began to say: “Ah, but what about the backstop.”
SEP1	School uniform is a fine British tradition bordering on sadism	Nothing says “back to school” more eloquently than a trip to Clarks for some playground-proof shoes. It’s the one part of school uniform purchase that has remained unchanged down the decades. Even the kindly women who negotiate a truce between the parent’s request for sensible footwear and their offspring’s yearning for street style seem to have teleported in from the Eighties. I misted up a little while buying black lace-ups for my 11-year-old, but part of that was the agony of parting with £40 on top of other clobber for his first day at our local academy. I knew I’d have to fork out for sports kit, but I’d forgotten about the calculator, pens and peer-approved Superfine rucksack. I naively thought my boy would wear his big brother’s cast-offs, but that was without factoring in different physiques and my younger son’s view of himself as a style maven. My husband and I felt faint at the extra expenditure this week, so heaven help those on lower incomes. Charities who help cash-strapped families with donated or second-hand uniforms say they have seen demand rocket in the past year. Part of the problem is the trend for schools to opt for branded uniform requiring specialised retailers, meaning parents can’t nip to Tesco for basics. Many state schools seek to channel the pride and identity they feel strict dress codes bestow upon children – which means blazers with badges, ties and polished shoes.
SEP1	When it comes to the rights of Hong Kongers, Britain must be clearer with China	It felt apt to spend the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Movement under a brolly in the humid thunder storms in Hong Kong observing thousands of residents here, protesting against Beijing as well as their local authorities and in defence of civil rights. I was a guest of Stand With Hong Kong, a civil society group comprised of volunteers that has run a powerful campaign to raise awareness of events in Hong Kong in the West. Hong Kong is in the frontline of a clash of political civilisations, which helps to explain some of the great global trends happening now.
SEP1	Brexit Britain has what it takes to be the world’s tastiest nation	A summer’s evening recently and I was sipping a glass of Sussex. Ahead of me were hundreds of precise lines of vines stretching out into the distance. I was standing on the terrace of the Rathfinny wine estate and would soon repair inside, to sit behind vast windows that framed the wonderful views of vineyard, hills of the South Downs beyond and a glimpse of the sea. Beneath the restaurant was the winery, a vast warehouse filled with enormous steel tanks which soon, once the harvest was underway, would be filled with the juice of chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier grapes for a variety of sparkling wines. Dinner would be a six-course menu of local delicacies: a tart of freshly picked peas, roasted tomato consommé with wild garlic, pork belly and a panna cotta of strawberries and cherry blossom. Each course matched with a blancs de blancs, a sparkling rosé and one of the estate’s still wines: their Cradle Valley white, a mix of pinot blanc and pinot gris. Outside the vines work their way down through the chalky soils to find moisture.
SEP1	Brexiteers must bring down John Bercow before he launches his most ruthless plot yet	We are finally here, the week that has been coming for the last three years. It could shape British politics, one way or another, for the next half a century depending which side comes out on top. The coming few days could split parties and topple a government. Sides are no longer defined by their political parties, only by whether they wish to Leave or Remain in the EU.  If the Brexiteers come out on top we are likely to be out of the EU very soon; if the Remainers win there’s a good chance of Brexit never happening. The central figure in the drama has now become one John Simon Bercow MP, Speaker of The House of Commons.  He is now where he has always wanted to be, at the centre of public life, in every newspaper and on every TV screen, high profile and with an influence a Common’s Speaker has probably never had before. Bercow will no doubt see his ability to insert himself into molding of the affairs of state, usually exclusively the purview of Governments, as a personal triumph. He has finally outwitted the people and party he ostensibly grew to despise, even hate, on his journey leftwards in politics. No one should underestimate the low cunning that his got him to the position of either Speaker or the huge influence he now wields. He has skillfully operated without principle over the last 10 years or so to reach his career summit – making friends, building alliances, and making highly inappropriate interventions as Speaker. He made sure he always had enough people willing to prop him up against the enemies he knew he had created. Those carefully made alliances even propped him up against compelling evidence that he had systematically bullied former staff – a sackable offence in most circumstances but not apparently if you have a Remain supporting Speaker on your team.
SEP1	To thrive after Brexit, we must turbo-charge forgotten corners of the country	All entrepreneurs and investors can quickly get a sense of how well a company is doing from the moment we walk through the door. Since Boris Johnson walked into Downing Street, there has been a palpable change in the energy and drive of the UK Government. Gone is the timidity and nervousness which marked Theresa May’s disastrous time as Prime Minister. And in its place is a positivity and optimism which is so very refreshing. The Government is obviously focused on leaving the European Union by 31st October. And I feel confident that if a general election takes place either before or after this date that voters will return Boris Johnson to No 10 with a renewed and enhanced mandate. Next Wednesday, Sajid Javid will announce his one-year spending review and we now also know that we have a Queen’s Speech on October 14th. Preparing for these two important announcements presents an excellent opportunity for the Government to step back and take stock of how the UK can best take advantage of the economic opportunity that Brexit presents.
SEP1	Antibiotics could kill us before climate change, so why is the world failing to act?	It would be nice if we only had to tackle one doomsday scenario at a time. There is currently much focus on the peril of climate change, with campaigners using a simple metaphor: act as if your house is on fire. Sadly, a roaring inferno isn’t the only thing we have to worry about. Our home is also under constant attack from trillions of tiny, deadly monsters – and unless we stop leaving the door open, they could wipe us out long before we burn to a crisp. That’s the message from England’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies. The problem of bacteria growing immune to our antibiotic arsenal, Davies has warned, “could kill us before climate change does”. Davies is right. Antimicrobial resistance is both a catastrophe on a global scale, and a problem we brought upon ourselves. It is also arguably more urgent (if not ultimately more serious) than global warming. When penicillins first emerged in the mid-20th century, they were miracle cures. By the turn of the millennium, having saved billions of lives, we had such a choice of drugs that pharma companies had simply stopped looking for more. Doctors wrote unnecessary prescriptions for illnesses probably caused by (antibiotic immune) viruses.
SEP1	Free schools are the shining inspiration in our Dickensian education system	The best of times, the worst of times: a tale of two educations.  We have had problems with our education system at least since the nineteenth century. Before that, the English were among the most literate nations (if less so than the Scots). A combination of sectarian jealousies and the Industrial Revolution (which could employ people without much schooling) pushed us back.   Radical reforms were not followed though. Winston Churchill wanted to democratise the public schools through plenty of tax-funded scholarships.  Rab Butler’s 1944 Education Act aimed to set up nation-wide technical schools. These things of course never happened. What did, a few years later, was the establishment of the comprehensive system, which I think can fairly be said not to have met the high hopes of its proponents. Our universities, on the other hand – once Oxford and Cambridge emerged from their comfortable torpor in the nineteenth century, and a range of proud civic universities were founded – rather surprisingly went from strength to strength.

SEP1	I voted to Remain… but I am glad the Brexit ball is rolling now	It’s increasingly hard to picture the time before the Brexit vote, which now feels like a faraway land of peace and simplicity. A time in which people chatted amicably at dinner parties and barbecues and could meet friends in the pub and not get into a heated argument about whether a coup had or had not taken place in the United Kingdom. A time when Jeremy Corbyn was just a fringe-y, loony Left MP that few had heard of. I voted Remain but, three years on, I have changed my tune on Brexit. Despite the plunge in the value of my flat, I now want to leave. I want to leave because a) it has to be done, and b) I just can’t take the stodge of parliamentary deadlock any more.
SEP1	Parliament must give Boris Johnson the space to secure a better Brexit deal	At times in the last three years it has seemed that Parliament will do anything but the one thing it promised. To honour the democratic vote to leave the EU. Instead of coalescing behind a deal to get us out, Parliament has quibbled, prevaricated, delayed and disappointed. The Commons has repeatedly said what it won’t accept but has never accepted that we are here to serve the people and respect their decision. The Labour Party, in particular, have been guilty of the most spectacular bad faith. They promised on page 24 of their 2017 election manifesto to honour the referendum result but then, with some honourable exceptions, have consistently voted not to.  The Prime Minister has made clear that we will, at last, honour the referendum decision. We will leave on October 31, deal or no deal. And, already, that resolution is helping us secure a solution. EU leaders are now ready to talk about a different way forward.  As of next week we will be in talks with the EU to try to find a new deal which can command the confidence of the Commons. The EU knows that a deal which has failed to pass the Commons three times cannot be brought back unamended.
SEP2	Forget prorogation, the only thing to do is call a general election	A year ago I warned in these pages that Britain was heading for a major political and constitutional crisis. Sadly that crisis is now arriving. Its root cause is not the actions of any one individual or party, but the historically unprecedented inability of a parliament to agree on, let alone implement, any course of action at all. To illustrate the severity of this, consider what would happen if any particular outcome prevails in the coming days or weeks. If Boris Johnson pulled off the unlikely but not impossible feat of a last minute deal with some major change to the Irish backstop, could we all be confident that deal would then pass the House of Commons? No. Some Brexiteers are so ardent that even that would not be enough, and the bulk of the Labour Party would once again place partisan advantage over the national interest. What if MPs and Lords this week successfully legislate against a no-deal Brexit and force an extension of EU membership after October 31? Could this parliament then agree on a deal it did want? Or on a new referendum? Or any next step at all? I don’t think so.
SEP2	Boris Johnson made a sudden statement on Brexit... and it wrongfooted everyone	At the end of his shock statement, Boris Johnson didn’t take questions. Which was a pity, because there was one in particular we were all dying to ask him. It was: “What?” I mean, seriously. All day long, we’d been waiting for the Prime Minister to demand a snap election. Mid afternoon, he’d called an emergency meeting of his Cabinet. Then, at half past five, Downing Street announced that, in just half an hour’s time, the Prime Minister would be making a statement outside No10. Top journalists were in no doubt: according to their highly placed sources, Mr Johnson would challenge his foes to a general election on October 14.
SEP2	Meghan and Harry would be much happier if they moved to California	On the day Meghan and Harry got married, how many of us made wagers? Whether it’d last and, if so, how long? Will she be pregnant within six months, and will there be one, two or three baby Sussexes? My wager, however, was on how long it would take the royal couple to move to California. After a decade spent dividing my time between London and Los Angeles, I was convinced it would be take less than two years for the actress-turned-duchess to grow sick of British venom and enforced provinciality. I’d been anticipating Sunday’s headline: “Homesick Meghan Goes House Hunting in LA.”
SEP2	The Tories have learned a valuable lesson from Labour's failure to remove disloyal MPs	Of course the PM should remove MPs who would replace his government with an extreme Marxist one Scottish Labour MPs couldn't have foreseen that their careers would be brutally ended by their support for the “No” campaign in the 2014 Independence Referendum. But speaking personally, my commitment to preserving the Union would not have been dimmed, even if I could have foreseen the electoral carnage that would be visited upon us eight months later. There are just some causes that are more important than individual careers. When faced with a choice between a political party and what you believe is best for your country, of course there is no choice at all: country comes first, every time. Which is why I have a great deal of sympathy and respect for David Gauke when he suggests that if his support for legislation preventing a no-deal Brexit means the end of his parliamentary career, then so be it. It is possible to disagree with someone’s priorities (and I certainly do) while respecting an individual’s commitment to them.
SEP2	A Brexit election looms... but Jeremy Corbyn sounds as hopelessly muddled as ever	Believe it or not, Jeremy Corbyn has now been Leader of the Opposition for four years. Even after all this time, though, he’s still a shambles. I’m not talking about his appearance: in this respect at least, he’s smartened up, and today looks less than ever like a compost heap shovelled into a suit. No – when I say he’s a shambles, I’m talking about his speeches. For example, the one he gave today, in Salford. What was it about? Frankly, you name it. Like so many of Mr Corbyn’s speeches, it seemed to be about more or less every topic under the sun. Almost dreamily directionless, the speech drifted hither and thither like a crisp packet across a car park. In patches it was about the horrors of a no-deal Brexit – while in other patches it was about railways in the north of England, or the glittering potential of offshore wind energy, or the closures of municipal swimming pools, or Labour’s aim to hit “every town” with a “record investment blitz”. (An intriguing choice of word, given that, traditionally speaking, a blitz tends to destroy the thing it’s aimed at.)
SEP2	The dog days of Brexit will leave a dreadful mess in Downing Street	In the dog days of Brexit, the nation’s First Puppy is being groomed to lead our last ditch negotiations in Strasbourg. The cat’s out of the bag. Or more probably hissing from the top of a Downing Street Georgian tallboy now that Dilyn, a wet-nosed, waggy-tailed interloper deselects him from his own constituency. But we’ll psychologically unpack Larry the Downing Street cat later. The main thing is that we finally know the real reason why Boris Johnson is proroguing parliament – and listen up, all you conspiracy theorists, it has nothing to do with cocking a leg over democracy.
SEP2	An early general election will confirm the total realignment of British politics	The next few weeks will see a critical stage in the realignment of British politics. A central part of this process is already nearing completion; namely, the transformation of the Conservative Party. But we should also expect significant movement in its other aspect, the metamorphosis of the centre and left.  Over the last four years British politics has undergone a steady transformation - the key aspect being a shift in the central issue that people use to identify their political position. Economic questions, like whether you favour a free market economy or one with a high degree of government intervention, have increasingly given way to a new divide over the issue of identity, or put another way, nationalism vs supranationalism.  The Brexit vote and its aftermath has hastened and crystallised these divisions. Polls confirm that Leave/Remain is the question that matters most to voters - and overrides traditional party allegiances. 
SEP2	'It didn't do much for my social life' - Telegraph readers on the humble school uniform	As children across the country return to the classroom this week, the Telegraph’s Rowan Pelling was left to ruminate on a conflicted relationship with the humble school uniform. From the modern day costs of kitting out her own offspring in school appropriate attire, to her experiences as a child wearing the "deep mud-brown with a vomit-yellow trim" garb of her alma mater, it's fair to say Rowan is not a fan.  But is Britain's predilection for school uniforms really a "torturous tradition bordering on sadism", or rather an important playground staple that aids discipline, affordability and a sense of equality in schools? Telegraph readers had plenty to say on the subject, from reminiscing about their own uniforms from school days past to offering up their own perspectives on the pros and cons of uniformity in scholastic fashion.  
SEP2	Momentum's late conversion to the anti No Deal cause is exactly what the Conservatives need	Boris's wholehearted embrace of Brexit has forced the hard-Left to take a damaging stand How impressive to see all those thousands of people marching in ‘Stop the Coup’ protests on Saturday. And how encouraging for Boris Johnson that the Remain campaign seems to have fallen into the hands of Momentum and the Occupy movement. Until a few days ago the rearguard Remain campaign could pose as the sensible middle way between the ‘Far Right’ (i.e. Boris) and the Far Left. The cause of leaving the European Union, of course, has long had a natural home in the Conservative party, but no less was it an article of faith on the left of the Labour party. Jeremy Corbyn himself was a long-established proponent of Brexit until his half-hearted campaign for Remain in 2016. He seemed not-very-secretly chuffed with the result – to the point that he called for Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to be enacted within days of the referendum result.
SEP2	Boris Johnson and his Cabinet must hold their nerve and deliver Brexit by Hallowe'en	If they can fend off the reactionary Remainers, a free and self-governing Britain will be the prize The death of the advertising executive and publicist Lord Bell last month brought to my mind the difficulties which he caused me as Chairman of the Conservative Party, tasked with guiding Margaret Thatcher's third consecutive general election victory in 1989.    Though not initially aware of the extent to which Bell's personality was affected by his addiction to cocaine, I did realise that our concepts of a general election were quite different. For Tim it was a wonderful bonanza of spending on advertising and great public events. For me, it was a matter of winning a clear majority for a Prime Minister whose image was beginning to fade from that of the victor of the Falklands to that of T.B.W (“that bloody woman”).
SEP3	The mood was as sour as old milk. In a raging Commons, the Tories tore themselves apart	That’s the risk, unfortunately, when you threaten to end the career of any MP who disobeys you. Before you can deselect them, the blighters have the cheek to deselect themselves.  Boris Johnson had just begun his first speech to the Commons in six weeks. “We are on the verge,” he trumpeted, “of taking back control of our trade policy, and…” The rest of this proclamation, however, was drowned out by a burst of cheering. But the cheers were nothing to do with control of trade policy. They were prompted by something that was happening a few feet to the Prime Minister’s right. 
SEP3	Boris Johnson has every right to strip these Tory rebels of the whip	At first the outrage was against the proroguing of the House of Commons, leaving people muttering how incensed they were to each other and to almost anyone who would listen. This has now moved on to fury that Boris could dare to withdraw the whip from anyone who votes with Jeremy Corbyn on tonight's motion to give MPs control of parliamentary business, which in turn would allow them to rush through a Bill this week to force the Government to delay Brexit, rather than pursue a no-deal exit. For those who don’t understand the concept of the whip, it is this: those who are elected parliamentarians for a political party are said to “have the whip”. Removing the whip is what happens when the party decides the behaviour of the individual on political, or sometimes personal grounds, means they can no longer be an active member of that particular party. The term references the hunting field, when the huntsman would keep the hounds together by “whipping in”.
SEP3	This is one of the most seismic political realignments in postwar history. The Tories had better be careful	Major realignments of politics are rare in this country. They happen when parties are deeply and irrevocably split, and trigger a wider realignment of voters – like the rise of the Social Democratic Party in the early 1980s, which paved the way for New Labour. Today, Britain is heading into one of the most significant realignments in its postwar history. Brexit and the gridlock in Parliament have already transformed our party politics. But with a fresh election on the cards the country could be about to see a far more profound change. Earlier this year, the pollsters Populus threw light on the extent to which Brexit is completely reshaping how we see the political world. The numbers are striking. While 66 per cent still said they identify with the main political parties, nearly 90 per cent now identify as a Remainer or Leaver. In a country where political loyalty used to be shaped only along the lines of social class this is nothing short of remarkable.
SEP3	Sorry, Nicola – the UK is strong enough to survive Brexit intact	Stepping down from a big political job is an odd feeling. Reading the screeds of reports, columns and comment pieces that are written is akin to sitting in the pews at your own funeral. But the strangest sensation of all is watching a theory emerge, develop and then harden into fact. Especially when said theory is woefully wide of the mark. So it was this week when my resignation – for a series of stated reasons incorporating both the political and the personal – prompted the latest bout of handwringing Jeremiahs predicting the end of the United Kingdom as we know it. Nicola Sturgeon was all but handed a hacksaw to set Scotland adrift at Berwick and a tombstone erected saying “Here lies Britain. 1707-2019. Aborted by Brexit.” It was, of course, tosh, and here’s why.   Firstly, everyone likes a bit of hyperbole about their own importance – but let’s not pretend it’s healthy to be seduced by it. I acknowledge that there was a job of work to do to fill the gaps immediately following the Scottish independence referendum when so many big beasts of the pro-union side – the likes of Alistair Darling, Gordon Brown, Charles Kennedy, Johann Lamont and Jim Murphy – either died, resigned or were voted out of office.
SEP3	Why Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are wise to weaponise the culture war - the next election will be fought on issues beyond Brexit	For too long, the British centre-Left has claimed the moral monopoly on all things Amid the babble last night over the prime minister’s statement to the nation, and the myriad theories over the path Brexit could yet take in its aftermath, one piece of information eked out, further confirming that Conservatives were not only gearing up for an election - but for one that would be fought on issues beyond Brexit. A number of journalists reported that No 10 had been busy polling “Culture War” issues, with the incendiary idea that this included “transgender rights” in several traditionally Labour seats that the Tories will target over the issue of leaving the European Union. 
SEP3	With a Brexit election brewing, why are Labour Remainers so coy about facing the people?	Boris Johnson sought to show last night that he did not want to incur the wrath of Brenda from Bristol and her friends, reassuring the nation: "I don't want an election, you don't want an election". The message was clear: he would only pursue one if forced to do so by MPs tying his hands over Brexit. The campaign he would fight in that scenario is obvious: Mr Brexit vs a Remainer Parliament. Brexiteers would be urged to give a clear mandate to the only main party leader dedicated to delivering on the referendum.
SEP3	With its core vote appeal, Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament could be an election-winning move	The Government’s decision to prorogue Parliament has sparked a major political row. The polls suggest the decision has divided voters too. But it seems unlikely to damage Boris Johnson’s electoral prospects. True, few accept the Government’s argument that it is simply proroguing Parliament in order to pave the way for a Queen’s Speech that will focus on the Government’s domestic agenda. According to Ipsos MORI, only one in eight voters believe that is the main reason for the Prime Minister’s move. As many as 70 per cent feel his true aim is to limit MPs’ opportunities to block a ‘no deal’ Brexit. Even most of those who voted Leave do not accept the Government’s stated reason for its decision. However this does not stop them approving of a step they think will help pave the way for the Brexit for which they voted three years ago.  Remainers, unsurprisingly, take a very different view. According to YouGov, no less than 82pc believe that it is "not acceptable" for Parliament to be suspended between mid-September and mid-October. Only 10pc believe the opposite. Ipsos MORI report that nearly three-quarters (74pc) of those who voted Remain say that the Government is wrong to stop Parliament from sitting, while just 11pc believe it is right to do so.  Similarly, Survation find that nearly two-thirds of Remain supporters (65pc) say that they "strongly" oppose suspension, suggesting deep antagonism from many who would prefer Brexit not to happen at all. Deltapoll found rather more voters sitting on the fence, but still nearly three-fifths (58pc) of Remain voters said that they opposed the decision to suspend Parliament, with just 17pc in favour. 
SEP3	Remainers fear that this country won't be able to cope on its own. But if Brexit fails, Britain fails	The Brexit debate has been one of the least civil and most seismic disagreements in history. Nevertheless, it is in the best interests of the wider world that Britain be strong; and Britain can’t reach its full strength without also being free to set its own course and chart its own future. Given Europe’s bloodstained history, there are obvious grounds for a close alliance between one-time foes. But this idea of 28 countries, large and small, relatively rich and poor, all with different languages, histories, ancient attachments and antagonisms, all needing to act in unison and heed the same faceless Brussels bureaucrats – well, if this nostrum were proposed in an Australian pub, the response would be to “tell ’em they’re dreaming”, and that would be the polite version. As a free trade zone, promoting mutual prosperity between neighbours, the European Economic Community made sense. Yet its evolution by stealth was always planned by those at its heart to create a new entity commanding more loyalty than its member states. The conservative instinct is not to change without good reason, but when change must happen – because the people want it – it’s not reform so much as restoration that’s needed: in this case, restoring the loose trading bloc that Britain thought it had joined back in 1973.
SEP3	Despite what historians may tell you, Boris Johnson is not Hitler	Historians will look back on 2019 as the Year of Bad Analogies. I’ve seen Boris Johnson compared to both Charles I and Oliver Cromwell (quite a feat) and, of course, Adolf Hitler, a uniquely evil man whose soubriquet has become shorthand for “anyone who disagrees with me”. The Right does it as much as the Left. I don’t think Boris is Hitler, but I do think Jeremy Corbyn is Stalin. Historians like me may roll our eyes but we’re partly to blame. We’re currently enjoying the same cult-like worship that comedians enjoyed in the Nineties, when entertainers were rebranded as philosophers whose jokes about airline food told us something profound about the human condition. Likewise, historians are on social media and panel shows, venting about Brexit – pro or con – and celebrated as soothsayers who by looking into the past can tell us our future. Remember that famous saying: “Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it?” If you take this rule literally, it’s easy to conclude that because Hitler said X and Boris Johnson has said Y, then World War Three is around the corner.
SEP3	Forget prorogation, the only thing to do is call a general election	A year ago I warned in these pages that Britain was heading for a major political and constitutional crisis. Sadly that crisis is now arriving. Its root cause is not the actions of any one individual or party, but the historically unprecedented inability of a parliament to agree on, let alone implement, any course of action at all. To illustrate the severity of this, consider what would happen if any particular outcome prevails in the coming days or weeks. If Boris Johnson pulled off the unlikely but not impossible feat of a last minute deal with some major change to the Irish backstop, could we all be confident that deal would then pass the House of Commons? No. Some Brexiteers are so ardent that even that would not be enough, and the bulk of the Labour Party would once again place partisan advantage over the national interest. What if MPs and Lords this week successfully legislate against a no-deal Brexit and force an extension of EU membership after October 31? Could this parliament then agree on a deal it did want? Or on a new referendum? Or any next step at all? I don’t think so.
SEP4	The Establishment plot to shut down Brexit has entered its ruthless final phase	 A spectre is haunting Brexit and its name is Tony Blair. Not merely the man himself – though, my, how stirringly his anti-Brexit diatribes this week have embodied the desolate passion and antisceptic piety of the arch-Remainer cause. But also the cunning and ruthless Europhile Establishment that the former Labour leader bequeathed to Britain and has declared total war on No 10. Sadly, following tonight's Government defeat in Parliament, Leave voters must now brace themselves for the most unscrupulous orchestrated attempt in modern British history to undermine a democratic vote. In a generation, Blairism – a globalist, post-modernist strain of authoritarianism, cleverly adapted to the pretences and exigencies of the modern Western world – has utterly colonised the minds of the British ruling class. The anti-intellectual dustbowl of an ideology – which stands for vaporous concepts like “compromise” and “the centre ground” – has bewitched the most bungalow-minded of today’s Tories, from those possessed by the dullard’s disdain for big ideas, like Philip Hammond, to vain mediocrities who would rather plunge the country into a Corbyn abyss than fade gracefully into oblivion, like John Bercow. But perhaps more astounding is how Blairite anti-Brexit forces have, in recent months, reclaimed Labour by stealth. The party’s centrist ruling caste, which comprises not only snob yobs like Emily Thornberry but also not-so-banished alumni like Alastair Campbell and Blair himself, have effectively neutralised the movement’s Eurosceptic Left. They have achieved this by preying partly on Mr Corbyn’s intellectual sluggishness but mainly on Marxism’s acute appetite for power at any cost.
SEP4	Ignore the Remainer triumphalism – Boris is still on course for victory	The Tory party is dead; long live the Tory party. The seismic realignment that was supposed to take place in 2016 is finally upon us, and a tougher, rougher, non-deferential conservatism is making its explosive debut. Ruthlessly focused on the public’s priorities, its ideology is complex. In some ways, it will be more pro-capitalist and pro-freedom: especially on tax, motoring and the nanny state. It will be more conservative on law and order, defence and immigration. In yet other areas, such as health and overall public spending, it will back a larger government, as we saw in a Spending Review that increased overall expenditure by 0.5 per cent of GDP over two years. But the biggest difference, of course, is that 31 years after Margaret Thatcher launched the modern Eurosceptic movement with her Bruges speech, her side has finally triumphed. Following the expulsion of the 21 most committed Remainers, Eurosceptics are in almost full control of the Tory party for the first time since the Fifties. If Boris Johnson’s massive, historic bet pays off – by no means certain – he will win the general election by scooping up a fresh demographic attracted by his domestic and European policies. He will then engineer a real Brexit, ensuring the period between 1973 and 2019 is remembered as a historical curiosity, an aberrant era during which the UK was conned into giving up its self-government.
SEP4	The liberal Left's pious outrage over Boris and Brexit is playing into the PM's hands	Today's PMQ's "backlash" over the PM's burqa joke was a testament to the chatterati's damning myopia It's probably fair to say that Boris Johnson's first PMQs didn't go exactly as he and his team had hoped.  Hours after losing his majority, the PM seemed tense and uneasy amid a barrage of heckling from opponents and former colleagues. John Bercow managed to exceed his usual (extraordinarily biased) standards with a nakedly partisan display. Fresh from a summer break spent plotting with Tory rebels from a Turkish sun lounger, the egomaniacal Speaker barely concealed his contempt for the PM, bellowing "Sit down!" like an exasperated supply teacher. 
SEP4	Slurs, snarls and even swearing: this was the day the Commons turned ugly	Parliament versus the people. That, reportedly, is how Boris Johnson plans to frame Brexit.  For now, however, what we’re watching is Parliament versus him. The anger in the Commons today was something else. It wasn’t just political. It was personal. Steamingly, screamingly personal. MPs flinging insults at each other is nothing new. But usually it feels like a performance. Pantomime. Playing to the gallery. 
SEP4	In praise of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the illustrious art of parliamentary lounging	He only did it to annoy because he knew it teases. It worked very well. Jacob Rees-Mogg, lounging in his double-breasted lounge suit across the green front-bench leather, was harangued from across the chamber on Tuesday night by Caroline Lucas, the Green MP. “His body language throughout this evening has been so contemptuous of this House and of the people,” she scolded, as though he had deliberately sat upon a rare orchid in a garden of remembrance for vulnerable children. She should know better, for Mr Rees-Mogg was behaving in a traditional manner for the Commons. Perhaps that is really what she did not like. I shouldn’t think she much likes Hon and Rt Hon members going “Hear-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar,” like Newfoundland dogs playfully growling as they mouth Pedigree Dentastix.
SEP4	It's time the Tories went nuclear on this flagrantly partisan Speaker, who has evaded democracy for too long	Bercow's theatrics and put downs have reached new levels of purple-faced absurdity Parliament’s supposed referee has attempted to cast himself as the Leader of the Opposition this week, with an outrageous display of naked partisanship in the Commons. The Speaker Bercow delighted in interrupting the Chancellor’s Spending Review statement today, repeatedly reprimanding him for being too "political" with delightful faux-naivety, as if this seasoned Parliamentarian had never encountered George Osborne, Gordon Brown or indeed any other Chancellor of recent years. Later, and in a clear breach of Parliamentary rules, he sat back as opposition benches whooped and clapped at questions from their own side. When challenged by Tory MPs on his inaction after multiple clapping outbursts, Bercow smugly informed the House that it may change its rules if it wishes. Parliament has been subjected to an unbelievable barrage of bias spewing from the increasingly dramatic Speaker all week - not so much playing to the gallery as craving recognition from an international audience. His theatrics and put downs have reached new levels of purple-faced absurdity.
SEP4	Why I joined the Tory MPs' no-deal Brexit revolt	It was worth sacrificing the party whip to put my country and my constituents first After nine years as the Conservative MP for Aberconwy, I found myself this morning being interviewed as simply the MP for Aberconwy. It’s quite something to find myself no longer a Conservative MP.  I suspect, however, that my disappointment pales into insignificance when compared to the impact of this rash and hypocritical decision on individuals such as Ken Clarke and Sir Nicholas Soames. When the Father of the House loses the Conservative whip after 50 years of loyal service and the grandson of Winston Churchill is now deemed to be insufficiently Conservative we should pause and reflect. What has happened to the Conservative Party?
SEP4	Jeremy Corbyn holds the power now, and the narrative for the next general election is already shaping up	The opportunity for Labour to spring a surprise victory should not be dismissed by the PM and his advisers On the day the Commons reconvened after its summer recess, a rally featuring a glittering array of hard left political activists was due to gather across the road in Parliament Square. The publicity for the event declared: “Stop Boris Johnson – We demand a general election now!” It must have come as quite a shock to the speakers – including two front bench Labour MPs and veteran revolutionary Tariq Ali – to learn that their demand for an immediate election would, by late that same evening, have been shelved on the advice of none other than Tony Blair.
SEP4	This wretched and inept Parliament has seized control. No wonder the public are in despair	They said there was going to be a Right-wing coup. Another broken promise. Never mind proroguing parliament, some people would now like to burn it down – and I've honestly never known such popular dissatisfaction with our so-called elites and their fantasyland politics. Parliament is actually the one holding a coup. MPs have voted to take control of the order paper in order to take control of the Brexit negotiating process: they want to rule out a no-deal Brexit, thus completely undermining the Government's strategy. It's highly irregular for the Commons to dictate foreign policy like this, let alone on such suicidal terms. It's like sending the army to liberate the Falklands armed only with a colander and a spoon. "Fine," says the Government, "if you don't like our policy, let's have an election." "Um, no," says Parliament. Why? Because the Government's policy is quite popular and its opponents might lose. Parliament says it is extending oversight and renewing democracy. It's not. It's blocking an election. 
SEP4	The sugar tax saves lives – Britain should remain on the right side of history	The UK is a relative newcomer to the group of dozens of countries around the world who have decided to put taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks. Ireland does it, France does it, South Africa does it, and so do Philippines, Hungary, Norway, Chile, and the US cities of Berkley, California and Philadelphia. Malaysia, the where obesity eats up to 19 per cent of the national health budget, introduced a sugar tax last month. All these countries are doing it for a reason – a sugar tax does something that has been elusive for far too long: a simple measure that works to improve our health, trim our nationally expanding waistlines and sugar intake to take the strain off our NHS. And the best news is, contrary to received wisdom, it is the poorest who benefit most.
SEP5	Boris's agenda isn't 'extreme' or 'hard-Right' – and voters know it	Deliver, Unite, Defeat, Energise: this was Boris Johnson’s original plan. It was his “DUDE” manifesto: get Brexit done, bring his party together, crush Jeremy Corbyn, then gee up the country. It hasn’t started terribly well. Rather than being delivered, Brexit now faces indefinite delay. Rather than being united, his party is being purged. As for defeat, he’s suffered three in Parliament already – destroying his majority and his authority. And energy? Just look at the opponents of Brexit. They have more of it than ever. The Prime Minister did start out hoping that, with oomph, he’d get Brexit past this Parliament. But it’s now pretty clear that we can expect no Brexit resolution from this particular group of MPs. They won’t endorse a deal, nor will they tolerate no deal. They can’t bring themselves to depose the Prime Minister, but won’t let him govern properly either. They can’t quite decide if they should let him have a general election, but this chaos means one will come soon.
SEP5	Boris Johnson gave the most bizarre speech ever on Thursday... and it was pure Alan Partridge	How to explain it? Stress? Exhaustion? After all, Boris Johnson has had a pretty tough week. He lost his majority. He lost his first three votes as Prime Minister. He failed to secure the general election he’d pretended not to want. More than 20 of his MPs rebelled against him, and were then kicked out of his party, prompting a backlash from those who remained. And then on Thursday morning, to cap it all, Jo Johnson – his own brother – resigned out of the blue as one of his ministers. So yes. Reasonably gruelling. But even so – I’m not sure it can entirely account for what happened on Thursday evening. Because, at a police training centre in West Yorkshire, Mr Johnson gave unequivocally the most bizarre performance of his career.
SEP5	It’s all too easy to blame the doctor when something goes wrong	Our nation is united by a quasi-religious faith in the NHS. When tested, it can breed a devastating sense of betrayal My father is – was – one of the unlucky ones. It took him two years to get a cancer diagnosis. He kept going to his GP, complaining of faulty plumbing and even blood in his urine, but the GP thought it was prostate trouble and sent him for all the wrong tests. By the time Dad finally got the correct diagnosis, it was too late: his bladder cancer – normally one of the easiest to treat – had spread, becoming impossible to contain. Unlucky, but not unusual. Almost half of cancer sufferers saw their GP at least twice before getting the tests that led to a correct diagnosis, according to the latest NHS figures. Almost one in ten had to go five or more times – a statistic that, even for the healthy observer, brings on palpitations of frustration and alarm.
SEP5	Failing to deliver Brexit will inflict on Britain a national humiliation worthy of the Suez crisis	In the tumultuous 20th century, one defining moment eradicated Britain’s self-confidence and prestige, and blew apart the notion that it was a still great power. After all the sacrifices of two world wars, it was the Suez crisis of 1956 that finally revealed Britain’s humbled status in world affairs. We are now on the verge of our 21st century Suez moment. If anything, it’s even more significant than that. Yes, in 1956, after being humiliated by our closest ally, the United States, Britain could no longer pretend to its former global importance. But even that will pale into insignificance alongside our failure to leave the EU on October 31, having begged for yet another extension to Article 50, or, worse, revoked it altogether.  Just imagine it. What would it say about Britain’s self-confidence, having lost our nerve on the cusp of an independent future? What would it say about our democracy, having given people the choice about the EU in the biggest vote this country has ever seen, then ignored their decision? What would it say about our economy, that we felt incapable of prospering on the global stage unless chained to other nations in a loveless union?
SEP5	In our turgid, disillusioned politics, voter apathy is the biggest risk	If too many voters abandon the ballot box it will pave the way for anti-democrats and Marxists Shampoo manufacturers must be bracing themselves for a spike in sales. For if, as is likely, Boris Johnson still intends to force a snap election, then the nation may well be preparing to stay in and wash its collective hair. It matters not that today the PM's spokesman valiantly claimed that the only course of action "is to go back to the people and give them the opportunity to decide what they want."As this unedifying charade plays out in Westminster, many of us probably think trudging out to the polling booth is a poor alternative to staying in and catching up on Coronation Street. At least they mean what they say at the Rovers Return.
SEP5	Jo Johnson's brotherly betrayal is a heavy blow for a PM already feeling the heat	“The family avoids the topic of Brexit especially at meals…” So once revealed Rachel Johnson, sister of both the Prime Minister and now former-minister, Jo Johnson. Following the latter’s dramatic departure from government, it’s easy to see why Europe might well be off the menu at Chez Johnson. The current battle over Brexit has been described as a second English civil war; like its 17th century predecessor the issue has the capacity to rent families asunder and turn brother against brother. And it seems the fratricide has reached the very top of our body politic. 
SEP5	Dominic Cummings isn't mad – like Donald Trump, he wants to rewrite the rules of politics	A complete realignment of politics along Brexit lines is the Tories' only hope of a parliamentary majority The last Conservative MP in the seat of Newcastle-under-Lyme was Charles Donaldson-Hudson. A JP and member of the landed gentry, he held it from 1880 to 1885. Yet, when the autumn election finally arrives, Newcastle will be one of the Tory party’s top target seats.  Joining it on the list will be Bishop Auckland (Labour since 1931), Ashfield (Labour-held for all but two of the last 54 years), and Barrow and Furness (won by Labour at every election since 1992).
SEP5	Labour's bizarre general election U-turn is the sign of a party in chaos	Labour are in a pickle. After years of nonchalantly calling for an immediate general election they find themselves horrified by the prospect of their stated demands actually being met. The party began the summer demanding an immediate general election as a result the Conservative Party changing leader. Labour politicians went into overdrive claiming it was an outrage that a party leader should be selected by an unrepresentative minority of the country. Well, they’ve known all about that since 2015.  Despite holding rallies, promoting websites, and making countless speeches and media appearances demanding an election as soon as humanly possible, Labour has used every trick in the book to avoid voting for one. Even in July, when the Lib Dems put forward a motion of no confidence as a means to force an election Labour simply ignored it.
SEP5	Voters can see through the pious pretences of this hypocritical Parliament	The politicians trying to stop Brexit held a rally outside Parliament last night. Calling themselves ‘the Remain Alliance’ and demanding a ‘People’s Vote’, they claimed to be standing up for ‘democracy’ against the ‘unelected Prime Minister’ whom they accused of carrying out a ‘coup’. They included Jo Swinson, Ian Blackford, Caroline Lucas, Emily Thornberry, Dominic Grieve, Jess Phillips, Phillip Lee, Liz Saville Roberts and Diane Abbott. Incredibly, nearly all of these MPs then trooped back into the House of Commons to vote against Boris’s call for a general election. Yes, you read that correctly. They passionately denounced Boris for being unelected and then, without pausing for breath, blocked his attempt to hold an election. They pleaded for a ballot in which the British public can once again say whether they want to leave or remain in the EU, and then stopped one from taking place.  Welcome to the looking-glass world of the Remainers in which the Conservative leader seeking the consent of the British people before taking us out of the EU is a ‘tinpot dictator’ and the Labour leader who’s been demanding an election on a daily basis for the last two years, but who’s changed his mind at the last minute because he knows the British people don’t support his position on Brexit, is a courageous man of principle who’s defending democracy.
SEP5	There's method to Labour's hypocritical manoeuvring over a general election	The PM facing the country after a catastrophic Brexit U-turn would be Labour's ideal scenario There could hardly be a better justification for an immediate election. When the incumbent government can no longer pass its own legislation, when ministers are forced to watch opponents take control of the legislative agenda, it’s time to hold up your hands and say “Enough!” And despite disagreements over last night’s motion, tabled by the prime minister, about the actual date of the poll, no one seriously expects this parliament to last longer than a few more weeks at most.
SEP6	Will Scots voters ever take to Boris?	With his expulsions of long serving Tory MPs and ex-ministers and his explosions of rage at the Despatch Box, is Boris Johnson really that epitome of liberal Conservatism that his admirers and even many neutral observers insist is the case? The question is relevant because there is no doubt in the mind of this observer that he must convince the electorate of that fact if he is to succeed in a general election. It can’t be won on the policies for Brexit alone. Nowhere is that more the case than in Scotland. Other than in tiny pockets of the country – such as the North East, where fishing communities are gagging to be out of the EU – Prime Minister Johnson has donned the mantle that Margaret Thatcher wore for decades … as the Tory PM that the Scots loved to hate.
SEP6	Boris may have to go on strike over Brexit to get past this rebellious Parliament	Is Jeremy Corbyn an idiot or a genius? I suspect that most readers of this column will already have made up their minds on this question. But perhaps we should not rush to judgment. Mr Corbyn has said daily, for what feels like years, that he wants a general election. The Conservatives therefore assumed that if they called one, he would have to agree (his agreement being required by the infamous Fixed-term Parliaments Act, or FTPA, invented by Sir Oliver Letwin and the Liberal Democrats in the 2010 coalition). The Tories liked this idea because they knew that he does not really want one, since he fears – with good reason – that he would lose. What Boris Johnson’s team did not foresee was that Mr Corbyn might find a way round this. He could not say that he did not want an election full stop, but he could say that he did not want one at the moment of Mr Johnson’s choosing. So now, thanks to the 21 Tory rebels, Mr Corbyn becomes a figure of power. “I can make sure the Benn Bill that stops no deal is implemented,” he can say, “and then I shall decide the right date for the election.” He acts as if he can govern though in opposition, whereas all Boris can do, though in Government, is oppose. The tables are turned. Mr Corbyn does not look such an idiot after all.
SEP6	Boris is not as relaxed about no-deal as he looks	In the Brexit circus, Boris Johnson is walking a very tricky tightrope. On one side is the threat of the Brexit Party, whose leader Nigel Farage now declares that only a no-deal Brexit will do. On the other is a great mass of swing voters, who don’t really fancy the idea of no deal. A recent YouGov poll found just 6 per cent and 8 per cent of voters respectively would be “delighted” or even “relieved” by the prospect. This passionate minority group is, however, enough to deny the Tories victory in dozens of marginal seats. This fine balance explains why the government reacts so furiously to any suggestion that threatens to knock Mr Johnson off the rope, like The Telegraph’s report this week quoting senior officials who believe Number 10 isn’t really trying to get a deal at all.  Despite the government’s protests and the Tory rebellion in Parliament, the story probably wasn’t unhelpful in electoral terms. Many of Mr Johnson’s MPs and ministers, however, including some of his fiercest critics, still don’t believe that no deal is really his top choice. There is an obvious reason why: a no-deal Brexit would represent the worst British political and diplomatic failure since the Second World War. The Prime Minister might appear gung ho about it, but he isn’t. He’s nervous.
SEP6	Robert Mugabe: a tragic tale of a hero becoming a tyrant	Robert Mugabe is a tragic case study of good becoming evil, of liberation hero becoming corrupt tyrant.  Elected president in 1980 by a landslide, and exhilarating anti-apartheid activists such as myself, he began preaching reconciliation and unity after the bitter years of being imprisoned and tortured by Ian Smith’s racist white minority regime.  But as the years went on he had tens of thousands of opposition Zimbabweans killed in the Bulawayo region, and became increasingly corrupt and ruthless as head of a military-security elite.
SEP6	The Remainers' scorched earth tactics and premature triumphalism will rebound spectacularly	The Remainers' scorched earth tactics will merely strengthen the Brexiteers' resolve The Labour frontbench and the Liberal Democrats have committed two great crimes in recent weeks. Not only have they collectively disregarded the 'irksome' Leave votes of millions of their own constituents, cast in good faith - and often for the first time - in the 2016 EU Referendum. Their adherence to the theological cult of Brussels and the European Union and its mythology has led them shamelessly to destroy the accepted mores and conventions of our unwritten constitution. Forget the disgraceful antics of the increasingly shrill and obnoxious Speaker, who will I predict be too cowardly to face his own Buckingham constituents again, permanent damage is being wreaked on the accepted norms that govern how things are done - the so-called "good chap" approach, enunciated by noted constitutionalist Lord Peter Hennessy.
SEP6	Violence was always in Robert Mugabe's political DNA	Robert Mugabe dominated so much of my own life, and the life of Zimbabwe, the country where I was born and raised, and still, in some deep, alchemical way, consider ‘home’.  Like most dictators he managed to be both ubiquitous and remote. For decades his brooding portrait stared balefully down from every office and shop in the country, hung there by law.   For years I witnessed, first-hand, how the gears of his repressive regime ground, first as a lawyer helping to defend rival leaders, then as a journalist cataloguing the appalling human cost of Gukurahundi massacres in southern Zimbabwe province of Matabeleland.
SEP6	My Sky News scrap with Kay Burley revealed the anti-Brexit media bias that is harming the public trust	Our broadcasters can skew the Brexit debate, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways I have come to suppose I will always have it a little harder than most interviewees on mainstream TV, not just because I am a Brexiteer, but a Brexit Party MEP. I say, bring it on. I’ve been fighting the bullying tactics of hardline Remainers for years. A fellow London commuter once publicly branded me a racist for the ‘crime’ of carrying a Vote Leave bag. Overhearing slurs in the workplace and other unreasonable insults from friends and colleagues led me to set up the grassroots group Leavers of Britain, to provide a friendly environment for Brexiteers to get together and chat. But it was only when I moved into the public eye that I began to understand how our broadcasters can skew the Brexit debate, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. 
SEP6	Why is the BBC so quick to listen to Chris Packham and his friends in the RSPB?	If you were to give the RSPB £1 million, what would you want – or expect – it to spend it on? I doubt it would be 20,000 lethal animal traps. But that is how many the RSPB has ordered, directly from New Zealand, in a deal which sidestepped the usual supplier of such traps here in the UK. It is a breathtaking order – so large that the suppliers are struggling to cope. Countless animals will be caught every hour in these powerful spring-loaded devices. They are designed to kill most animals within 45 seconds. Is this the same RSPB that proclaims on its website “With support from you, we protect wildlife”?  And what is the purpose of these deadly contraptions? 
SEP6	Debate: has the Tories' hardball Brexit strategy and ruthless party management gone too far?	A tumultuous week for the Conservatives has sparked turmoil in the Tory ranks. The decision to strip 21 rebel MPs of the whip - including former Cabinet ministers and the Father of the House, Ken Clarke - has led some to question whether the PM's chief strategist Dominic Cummings has overstepped the mark. Yet given the tough task ahead of the Conservatives, others believe 'going nuclear' is the only viable option for a party desperate to win eurosceptic support in a general election that cannot be far off. Ryan Shorthouse, Director of the think tank Bright Blue and Conservative activist Molly Giles give their response... A hardline approach on Brexit. A very powerful adviser in Number 10. Appealing to working-class voters in the North and Midlands. Enthusiasm for an election. Baby, I swear its déjà vu.  The Conservative Government tried this in 2017. It did not succeed.
SEP6	Labour's ridiculous position on Brexit is now beyond parody	Viewers of the BBC’s Question Time show last night will have got a foretaste of the general election campaign to come. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, was left with nothing to say after she was mocked by other panellists – and keenly interrogated by host Fiona Bruce – on her party’s Brexit strategy. Those who missed it had another chance to relish the argument put forward by Thornberry when she appeared just a few hours later on the Today programme. To her credit, the Islington MP did not use those few hours between broadcasts to consider what went wrong with her first appearance or to seek to hone or improve it. She is nothing if not consistent.  Presenter Mishal Husain suggested that listeners might be a touch confused by the logic of Labour’s position. The party seeks to form a government, then negotiate a new, improved deal with the EU, then put that deal to the voters in a referendum. But the ballot paper would also have the option of “Remain”. 
SEP7	The EU is setting a test that is impossible to meet	Attention has focused on Westminster this week, yet in Brussels we have seen serious and significant talks take place between the UK and the EU. On Thursday I spoke to Michel Barnier about the negotiations and in the past few weeks I’ve also visited counterparts in France, Finland, Sweden and Denmark. This weekend I’ve travelled to Italy to speak to leading international business people and senior EU politicians. And on Monday, the Prime Minister is meeting the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. Ahead of this the PM’s Sherpa, David Frost, and his team met officials from the European Commission twice this week for lengthy and productive discussions. Further talks will take place this week.
SEP7	The head teacher who banned skirts could do with a lesson in common sense	Maria Caulfield, the local MP, describes it as “political correctness gone mad” and it’s hard to disagree. The Priory School, a co-ed comprehensive in Lewes, turned children away at the school gate earlier this week because they weren’t wearing the new “gender neutral” uniform. Teenage girls turned up in skirts instead of the regulation grey trousers and the school’s headteacher had to enlist two community police officers to prevent them going to lessons. This may be the first time a school has called in the authorities to enforce non-attendance. The school justified its new policy by claiming the new uniform will “address inequality”. You might think it would be simpler to keep separate boys’ and girls’ uniforms and allow the children to wear whichever one they feel most comfortable in. That’s the approach taken by some schools. But apparently that wasn’t sufficiently egalitarian for the Priory.
SEP7	Nigel Farage can't deliver Brexit, but he could yet block it	Having spent two years demanding a general election on an almost daily basis, Jeremy Corbyn has voted to block one. The Opposition parties that accuse Boris Johnson of mounting a coup refuse to let him seek a mandate. MPs are now in the surreal position of propping up a government they have calculatedly undermined for the sole purpose of overturning a referendum whose result they had promised to respect. And they call themselves democrats. With a stunning lack of self-awareness, Labour and Green politicians held a rally at Downing Street today calling on people to “Stop the coup” and “defend democracy”. On Thursday, the same politicians had blocked a dissolution. No wonder MPs are held in contempt. The only parliamentary session to have sat for more days than this one without prorogation was the Long Parliament, elected in 1640. Those MPs also usurped the functions of the government – in their day, the Crown – combining legislative and executive power in their own hands. They, too, were reluctant to face their voters.
SEP7	In a society biased towards late parenthood, we can't keep rolling back IVF	On July 25, 1978, a few minutes before midnight in Oldham General Hospital, Louise Brown was lifted out of her mother’s womb. The operating theatre was packed, not only with medical staff but with researchers and government PR men, and the hospital had been under siege by reporters for days. Why? Because Brown was the first human being in history to have been conceived by IVF (doctors had watched her cells divide in a petri dish before their eyes). She would not be the last. But this January, 40 years later, health officials in Oldham announced that they would be cutting back NHS provision of IVF from three cycles to one. Despite strong public opposition, Oldham’s Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) – the committee of doctors and managers responsible for the bulk of local health spending in England – argued that financial constraints left them with no choice. “If we don’t cut this, then something else is going to be cut,” said the CCG’s chairman.
SEP7	Outside Westminster, people are backing Boris over the wrecker MPs	Has Boris blown it? There are two widely available and utterly opposed answers to this question around at the moment – and they are not emanating from the sources you might have expected. A number of highly influential Conservatives (some MPs, some not, but all dedicated supporters of the official Johnson position on Brexit) have told me that they have serious doubts about his leadership strategy and, most crucially, his ability to win an election. This latter point may surprise you. You may have perceived that even Labour now believes Mr Johnson would win an outright majority in a general election – which is why they refuse to allow him to hold one, preferring to keep him imprisoned but powerless in Downing Street until they can remove their own embarrassment of a leader and replace him with somebody electable. So why are the Tory forces so disheartened? From inside the enclosed, self-absorbed Westminster precinct, this is what they see: parliamentary plotting has succeeded in making the country ungovernable and the prime minister gives an impression of a man who has lost control of events, and his own temper. He seems, faced with utter stalemate, to be at his wits’ end – and this does not inspire public confidence.
SEP7	We all need back-to-school boundaries – so it’s a pity our politicians behave like they’re at nursery	The best thing about the summer holidays, as anyone who has ever been a child knows, is that you get to go completely feral. And the worst thing about the summer holidays, as anyone who has ever been a parent knows, is that you get to go completely feral. What a sweet relief it was, on Tuesday evening, to be able to throw my child in a bath of Dettol, run a brush through her matted hair and then chop great chunks of it off. How wonderful it was to signal an end to chaos and disorder by sitting my child down at the kitchen table with her homework, as my husband ironed name labels into her uniform and I prepared her first dinner for six weeks that wasn’t exclusively beige (no, you can’t have an ice cream for tea, we only do that when we’re in CenterParcs). A sense of calm genuinely descended on me in the queue at the shoe shop, even though the disparity between our ticket and the machine on the wall told us we would be there for at least another hour (if we were lucky). I will sit in Clarks all day trying to explain the concept of patience if I am rewarded with a return to school, to structure and discipline and a life that is neatly timetabled and regimented.
SEP7	Westminster has finally lost the plot... and there’s no hope of a cure	This is it now, isn’t it? It’s going to be like this forever. It will never let up. It will never calm down. The news is just going to go on growing madder and madder by the day. And, quite apart from anything else, it’s making my job a nightmare. People always say to me, “What a brilliant time to be a parliamentary sketch writer, you’ve got so much material!” But they’re wrong. It’s terrible. Because there’s simply too much happening to fit in. There’s barely enough space for me to provide a basic outline of what’s going on, let alone add some jokes about it.
SEP7	Sacred Mysteries: A bible that cost the same to make as building a small castle	King Solomon, in a red cloak sits cross-legged, as kings were wont to do, a long, thin sceptre in his hand, a crown trimmed with three fleurons on his head. Leaning towards him, her eyes meeting his, sits a queen, crowned like him. They are framed by the alcove for their thrones, its curtain drawn back. Around them and their architectural setting runs a double circular band of gold, for this is an initial O. It stands at the beginning of that remarkable poem on erotic love, the Song of Songs, in the middle of the Bible, a little after the Psalms and immediately before the Prophet Isaiah. Osculetur me osculo oris sui, it begins: “Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth: for thy breasts are better than wine.” Between the manuscript illumination and the text is a gloss: “The voice of the Church desiring the coming of Christ.” This is written in a hand from the 1160s, when it was not thought at all peculiar to meditate on sexual love and at the same time to see it as a strong allegory for the love of Christ and his Church.
SEP7	Boris can break the EU customs deadlock by flipping May's Irish weakness on its head	The PM should offer to carry out additional customs checks at the Irish Sea In last weekend’s Sunday Telegraph Michel Barnier claimed that the sole objective of the backstop was "simply to have an insurance policy in place that guarantees that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remains fully open, and that the status quo of cross-border exchanges on the island of Ireland is maintained". Yesterday the EU put out a claim that the UK had offered nothing new in the negotiations. The best way to break the deadlock would be to offer to carry out additional customs checks at the Irish Sea instead of at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Such checks could be carried out without threatening the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the UK.
SEP7	Freud may be sniffy about a spa’s ‘cheap pleasures’, but I’ve been rebooted	Until rather recently, passing a week at a spa hotel in the Austrian Alps would have sounded to me more like an activity for a lovesick invalid in a Russian novel than my idea of a holiday. But having a baby, I’ve discovered, changes things. That must be how I found myself lying facedown on a pink marble slab covered in some substance that felt an awful lot like uncooked meringue. “What is that?” I asked. “The cloud!” said the cheerful Austrian, squeezing the stuff out of what looked like a giant icing bag. As I twisted around, he exclaimed: “No! Do not look at the cloud.” I accepted this command. Being in the spa, I had learnt, meant accepting strange rules. There were plenty of them. Dressing gowns were positively encouraged at lunch, for example, but certainly not allowed at breakfast. Dining tables were rigidly pre-assigned. Like a home set up for a dementia patient, the whole hotel was full of meticulous little labels. Unfortunately, since nearly all the guests were locals, they were in German. This was a rigid but inaccessible social code – every English person’s nightmare.
SEP8	The streets of Westminster are turning into a circus. We need new laws to police protests	With the rhetoric inside the House of Commons ratcheted up to fever pitch, it is hardly surprising that protest outside Parliament has become equally chaotic. Unruly groups of flag-waving ideologues from all sides of the Brexit debate ran around Parliament Square looking for public figures to berate and civil servants and members of the public ran the gauntlet to their offices.  In a repeat of the infamous Anna Soubry moment earlier in the year, verbal insults were again levelled at various Members of Parliament.   This is turning into a circus, a safety issue and – given the resulting media coverage – a national embarrassment. Nor is it only a question of Brexit. Westminster has been subjected to too many seriously disruptive protests in recent times. For months, Black Cab drivers have been protesting by blocking Parliament Square and Whitehall on a Friday.
SEP8	Tories have to rally around Boris or face certain defeat by Corbyn in most important election for a generation	It might surprise you to know, with everything going on in Westminster, that Conservative MPs keep talking about a decision made 173 years ago. Is Boris Johnson, they ask, about to split the Tories just as badly as Sir Robert Peel did when he repealed the Corn Laws in 1846? The answer, emphatically, is no.  When Peel announced he was for free trade, he had no mandate to change policy. He was turning against his own MPs, the majority of whom still supported protection. And the great Tory split came not immediately, but after an election a year later. When the new party leadership promised to reinstate the Corn Laws and won, Peel’s supporters chose to put the Whigs in power instead. So it is not Boris who resembles Peel, but the Conservative rebels desperately trying to stop him delivering Brexit. The majority of Tory MPs back Boris, and so do Conservative members and voters. It is not Boris colluding and cooperating with the other side – in Brussels and in Parliament – but the rebels. Just like the 19th‑century Peelites, many are happy to ignore a national vote, eject a Conservative from No 10, and switch their support to other parties.
SEP8	Even for a hardened Marxist, antagonising the neighbours is a bold move	It is a bold householder who deliberately sets out to antagonise their neighbours, but that is what the Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, has done, complaining that in the west London street where he lives, “a third of the houses are right-to-buy, badly maintained, overcrowded; it’s horrendous.” This, to be clear, is the wrong, Thatcherite sort of right-to-buy, which a Labour government would remedy with its own version, offering tenants the chance to buy their privately rented homes at a discount. Mr McDonnell’s neighbours have not welcomed his criticism of their allegedly unkempt homes, insisting that theirs is a pleasant, well maintained street. But as we relish the piquant spectacle of a Labour shadow chancellor publicly embracing the Hyacinth Bucket-ish notion that owner-occupiers are more houseproud than tenants, it is worth considering the wider context of his remarks.
SEP8	Sacked for using plastic? Welcome to the latest madness from the 'woke corporation'	Historically, the private sector has been conservative with a small “c”, acting as a counter-weight to the dominance of progressive ideology in the public sector. But in the past 10 years most large corporations have embraced the full panoply of virtue-signalling mumbo jumbo, from “safe spaces” to “gender neutral” toilets. At Credit Suisse, they’ve even introduced a “reverse mentoring” programme whereby fresh-faced recruits take senior executives under their wing and teach them how to be better “allies” to their BIPOC and LGBTQ+ colleagues. In short, we are witnessing the rise of the “woke corporation” – and this week brought news of the most egregious example yet. At a company called Intelligent Hand Dryers in Sheffield, the 41-year-old founder has threatened his employees with the sack if they’re caught using plastic cups.
SEP8	I'd take a no-deal Brexit over Old Man Steptoe any day	I remember when my husband, a member of the Labour Party, voted for Jeremy Corbyn as leader. There was pouting, shouting, door-slamming – I hadn’t had such fun hating someone I loved since I was a teenager! But then the Brexit referendum was announced  – to be held on June 23, my husband’s birthday – and while I know Brexit’s been a source of conflict for others, for us it was better than twenty sessions of marriage counselling. Both of us raised as Socialists, we bonded over our mutinous cleaving to the Brexit Party; though Corbyn had always been against the EU, it didn’t occur to us to unite over him. Instinctively we knew he couldn’t be trusted with anything valuable. In a political milieu where so many people know the price of everything and the value of nothing, it’s really remarkable to appear equally blank about both. And observing the swaggering gaggle of superannuated Conservative politicians who seem so cavalier about letting this sad-sack get his paws on power rather than allow the Prime Minister to carry out the will of the people, I’m inclined to believe that all political careers end in petulance as much as failure.
SEP8	Oxbridge is discriminating against well-off pupils. Here's how to end the injustice	Last month Cambridge University announced it would offer places to 67 “disadvantaged” students whose A levels were better than expected. In terms of exploiting our country’s human capital, this is excellent: but it is not enough. The university has had no new undergraduate college since Robinson in 1979; in that era the admission of women to all men’s colleges – long overdue – meant demand for places at Oxbridge rose enormously. While both have expanded considerably their numbers of graduate students, Oxford’s last new undergraduate college was St Catherine’s, in 1963. While it is good to ensure that young people from poor backgrounds can have the life-changing experience offered by these two elite universities, it does nothing to help the numerous gifted students from more fortunate backgrounds whose A levels were also better than expected, or who were predicted stellar results and achieved them, but never had an Oxbridge offer in the first place.
SEP8	The Left's hatred of Singapore is based on anti-capitalist dogma, not evidence	In 1965, Singapore went through its own “no-deal Brexit”: an ill-tempered split with the Malaysian federation. The smart money, back then, was on Malaysia. Foreign policy experts and FT columnists assured one another that the city-state was too small to make a success of independence. In the event, 1965 was the beginning of Singapore’s take-off: the moment when, as its founding premier Lee Kuan Yew was later to put it, it “plugged into the international economic grid”. I spent last week in Singapore, marvelling at its cloud-capp’d towers and gorgeous palaces. Free-marketers have always loved the place: a swampy equatorial island, dependent on imports even for its food, water and electricity, that has raised itself to the highest degree of opulence through unrestricted commerce.
SEP8	The EU is setting a test that is impossible to meet	Attention has focused on Westminster this week, yet in Brussels we have seen serious and significant talks take place between the UK and the EU. On Thursday I spoke to Michel Barnier about the negotiations and in the past few weeks I’ve also visited counterparts in France, Finland, Sweden and Denmark. This weekend I’ve travelled to Italy to speak to leading international business people and senior EU politicians. And on Monday, the Prime Minister is meeting the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. Ahead of this the PM’s Sherpa, David Frost, and his team met officials from the European Commission twice this week for lengthy and productive discussions. Further talks will take place this week.

SEP9	It is time to quit the hysterics, if not we feed those who thrive on division and chaos	In recent times we have become accustomed to political debate being carried out in increasingly hyperbolic terms. Everything is a crisis, a cliff edge or an existential threat. Politicians seem to speak more in tabloid headlines than in sensible, rational tones. Much of this has been generated by the Brexit debate and, in particular, by the unwillingness of those who were on the losing side to accept the validity of the result. Much of the debate about the state of the Conservative Party has been verging on hysterical. We have been told that we have entryists and usurpers trying to turn the party from a centre-Right broad church into an extreme Right-wing faction. This is presumably a reflection on the level of support among party members for the Prime Minister’s position, which is to leave, without a deal if necessary, in order to fulfil the democratic mandate set by the referendum. Apparently “extreme Right-wing faction” equates to the willingness to accept no deal over no Brexit. Some comments, understandably, are an angry reaction from those who have had the whip withdrawn.
SEP9	The expulsion of the 21 rebels is the most egregious action by a Tory party leadership in my lifetime	Without a strong, united party of the centre Right, Britain could become the battleground of extremism Anyone who does not want to see an extreme, hard-Left individual who loathes much of the Western world come to power in Britain needs Boris Johnson to be a successful Prime Minister. For by the time we are singing Christmas carols, either he will have been returned to Downing Street or Jeremy Corbyn will be walking through its door. That means that those Conservatives who, like me, pointed out the severe problems with a “do or die” approach to Brexit on October 31, must often bite our tongues, remind ourselves that he has taken on an almost impossible job and hope he finds his way through it. We should all be doing our best to make sure the Conservative Party can win an election in the short term and provide good government for the long term.
SEP9	John Bercow may be going... but he’s trolling Tory Brexiteers to the end	Hundreds of MPs leapt to their feet and burst into applause. Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, former Tories… The only ones not to join in, it seemed, were Tory Brexiteers. Everyone else applauded with thunderous enthusiasm – and kept on doing so, for over 30 seconds.   Strictly, MPs aren’t allowed to applaud, and the Speaker is supposed to shout them down. On Monday, however, he generously decided to indulge them. After all, this was a special occasion. The person they were applauding was him. John Bercow had just announced to the Commons that he was to stand down. On the face of it, welcome news for Tory Brexiteers, many of whom seem convinced that Mr Bercow would love to help foil Brexit. But their foe had a mischievous little surprise in store. He’d chosen a very particular date for his departure. He would remain until the close of business on none other than October 31.
SEP9	This may well be the EU’s last chance to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But will they take it?	Boris Johnson's future as PM may hinge on whether he can avoid having to request a three-month extension, as required by legislation passed by a majority in Parliament. As this newspaper has reported, the Tory leader has drawn up plans to “sabotage” any Brexit extension by “send[ing] an accompanying letter alongside the request to extend Article 50 setting out that the Government does not want any delay after October 31”. The EU will require the UK to “indicate a way forward” as a condition to granting an extension. Therefore, the UK hopes Brussels will automatically reject London's “request”, if it deliberately fails to present a concrete reason for the extension. Legal challenges in the UK may hamper this strategy - a judge may, for example, rule that such conduct would violate the Benn legislation that forces Boris Johnson to request an extension. EU leaders might also still grant the extension, claiming that they believe a general election to be imminent, given the fact that Boris Johnson no longer has a majority. The latter would certainly be unprecedented, but these are unprecedented times.
SEP9	How dare the BBC teach children that there are ‘100 genders’?	“What are the different gender identities?” asks a little boy in one of the nine new BBC Teach films put out to support the personal, social and health education (PSHE) curriculum in schools – to which his head teacher replies: “That’s a really, really exciting question…” Actually, it’s not. And the answer is still less exciting. Which is perhaps why rather than give the boy a bald, biological and distinctly boring fact – “two” – the video cuts to a Relationships and Sex Education teacher, hopped-up on her own gaping-mindedness: “You know, there are so many gender identities,” she enthuses. “We know that we have got male and female, but there are over 100, if not more, gender identities now.”
SEP9	Good riddance John Bercow, a shockingly partisan, self-indulgent Speaker who demeaned his office	The Conservative Party finally announced it would stand a candidate against the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, in his Buckingham constituency. Twenty four hours later he announced he would leave office at a General Election or 31st October, whichever comes sooner.  Clearly the Party should have had the backbone to act long ago, perhaps when it first realised his inherent bias and allegations of bullying.  It is a small compensation that finally we have a Prime Minister made of sterner stuff and willing to act firmly in the interests of the nation. His announcement of his own demise, during his tear-filled Speaker's statement was typical Bercow, ham acting at its most exaggerated. It was self-indulgent, conceited, striving for attention and full of self-justification. After 10 years of service, one would like to be generous, but where Bercow is concerned it is very difficult as there is so little that is generous about him.
SEP9	The Westminster Bubble is missing the bigger picture in its frenetic focus on the Tory psychodrama	The polls just aren’t reflecting the 'dire' week Boris Johnson has had Boris Johnson is a disaster.  He’s the first Prime Minister to be defeated in his opening vote since Pitt the Younger in 1783. He has subsequently lost his majority, sacked Winston Churchill’s grandson, and watched his own brother quit his government, quickly followed by the well-respected work and pensions secretary who accused him of “political vandalism”.  His performances at the despatch box are starting to sound rambling and desperate, and the Irish Taoiseach has just humiliated him on live TV. 
SEP9	Is the PM inching closer to a backstop deal with Ireland?	Boris Johnson flew into a rainy Dublin morning for his first meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, exhibiting his trademark bumptious optimism that a Brexit deal could be achieved – but little in the way of specifics about what might it contain, or how he would get it through the House of Commons. It was the Prime Minister’s first meeting with Mr Varadkar, and the two seemed to hit it off alright – they spoke for a half an hour privately and joining their officials for a further half hour of discussions, before the PM had to hightail it back to Westminster. Despite a sharp public statement from the Taoiseach, the private exchanges between the two men were easier than those between Mr Johnson’s predecessor and Mr Varadkar – their strained encounters became the source of endless official hand-wringing, and occasional acerbic gossip.
SEP9	In praise of Therese Coffey, the single, Guinness-drinking, charmingly plain-spoken Work and Pensions Secretary	Amber Rudd's successor is a bona fide conservative Conservative As far as I’m concerned, Amber Rudd’s resignation is all to the good, simply because it has resulted in the overdue promotion of one of the fully-paid up human beings in public life, Therese Coffey, the new Work and Pensions Secretary. It would be wrong to call her a friend, because we only meet, glass in hands, at parties, but from the limited perspective you get from years of Irish embassy receptions, me with a glass of Jameson’s, she with (I think) Guinness, she is a sane, down to earth and likeable woman. She can take her drink.  I wish all the foregoing were a less rare attribute in a politician.
SEP9	Labour's strategy now is to paralyse Boris Johnson until the voters turn on him	One day, we may all look back on this as part of Dominic Cummings’ elaborate master plan. Or, perhaps, we will come to see it as the highlight of Seumas Milne’s greatest stratagem. But the more likely outcome, one fears, is that the current impasse in Westminster will be viewed as a nasty war of attrition. No 10 has clearly been caught off-guard by Labour’s refusal to back its call for a general election. It’s clear to see why the opposition wouldn’t want one right now: Labour can’t very well dance to their opponents’ tune.  The polls, despite skepticism, continue to show the Boris Bounce is yet to dissipate — if anything, it is increasing — with the Prime Minister commanding a lead in the mid 30s despite being “in office, but not in power.” Boris Johnson wants an election now because he believes he’ll win it, and by a decent margin — some pollsters’ rune-readings put the Tories on as many as a 50-seat majority. 
SEP10	Resigning as PM may be Boris's final hope - and his best option to deliver Brexit	Let’s be honest: the House of Commons has never been the most genteel of parliamentary debating chambers. Even its architecture is an invitation to a punch-up, with MPs separated by red lines marking the distance of two swords’ lengths. The benches face each other to replicate the first permanent Commons chamber on the site, St Stephen’s Chapel. After the fire of 1834, the new forum was deliberately designed by Charles Barry to be too small for the number of members and it remained so even after its post-war revamp by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, giving the impression of always being packed to the rafters on momentous days. So when tempers are frayed and the blood is up, the place can look and feel like a bear pit. On Monday, an unsuspecting visitor might have thought we were on the verge of insurrection as the Commons Speaker rallied parliamentarians against an executive which was itself using Crown prerogative powers to close the place until October 14. Black Rod, the Queen’s messenger, was howled down when she came to shut up shop. Labour MPs sang the Red Flag to give us a flavour of what is to come if Jeremy Corbyn gets into No 10. The SNP chipped in with Scots Wha Hae.
SEP10	Corbyn's hypocritical Remainer alliance is a threat to the national interest	Of all the pathetic excuses the so-called “Rebel Alliance” have used to justify their attempts to frustrate Brexit in parliament, the most odious must be the claim that they are somehow acting in the national interest. Time and time again, when Remainer MPs come up with some new stunt to frustrate the democratic will of the majority of Britons, they claim they are putting the interests of the nation above their own political ambitions. Setting aside the sheer arrogance of those who believe they know better than British voters, you only have to examine how these self-proclaimed saviours of democracy have conducted themselves in a different political context to see that their actions amount to nothing more than rank hypocrisy. The most obvious offender is Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has devoted his entire political career to associating with and supporting regimes and organisations that are declared enemies of the British state. Starting with the IRA during the Troubles in the 1970s, Mr Corbyn has been an avowed apologist for Islamist terror groups such as Hamas and Hizbollah, while at the same time defending the interests of rogue regimes in Iran, Syria, Russia and Venezuela.
SEP10	The day the House of Commons descended into a Mad Hatter’s Tea Party	I must have drifted off, because I woke in the small hours of Tuesday morning to find the House of Commons still on the TV. Something extraordinary was happening. An MP was talking sense. I could hardly believe my ears. Ivan Lewis, an Independent who deserted Labour last year over its appalling anti-Semitism, was patiently explaining to his colleagues what democracy involved. It’s a shame they needed reminding. “I am voting for a general election tonight,” said Mr Lewis. “I am willing to face the people in my constituency, unlike too many people on these benches.”
SEP10	There's something thoroughly un-British about spontaneously bursting into applause	‘If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands’ is a hideously repetitive nursery song many of us were brainwashed with as children – which perhaps explains the spontaneous applause when Speaker Bercow resigned in the House of Commons earlier this week.  Ultimately, it is a mass behaviour. Watching Bercow’s resignation at home, I almost found myself rising up to join in. Not because I felt he deserved any tribute but because whenever I hear anyone else clapping I can’t help but start clapping too. Like yawning, it’s irresistibly contagious. As a nation, though, I fear that we’ve officially lost the plot. We used to clap as a mark of respect at the start of toasts and the end of speeches. Take that brilliant banquet scene in Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop, when Lord Copper makes a 38-minute speech and notes with approval that “even the waiters… were diligently clapping”. Bercow has been boring on for a whole 10 years, so perhaps we might attribute some of the clapping to sheer relief?
SEP10	In a crowded field, what is John Bercow's most shockingly partisan moment?	The controversial Speaker has accrued an impressive range of scandals and black marks in the last decade When the curtain finally comes down on John Bercow’s Speakership (though no doubt, he’ll still be speaking as it does) he will have spent just over a decade in place — longer than Tony Blair served as prime minister. To have been around for so long, retaining so little good will, is almost impressive. Bercow will have succeeded in utterly transforming the role he inherited from one of studied neutrality to that of an active participant — and, as such, he leaves office with as many scandals and black marks to his name as the average PM might expect. 
SEP10	Sadly for Remainers, Jeremy Corbyn has missed this crucial point about no-deal Brexit	On Tuesday morning, out of the blue, I heard a song I hadn’t heard in ages. In fact, I’d forgotten all about it. Which was odd, because just a couple of years ago, the song seemed to be everywhere. Like all the biggest novelty hits, it was catchy, it had simple lyrics, and young people loved it. Thousands of them sang along with it at Glastonbury. It was the sound of the summer. But then, as is so often the case, it fell completely out of fashion. Those armies of young fans, it seemed, had simply melted away. They’d moved on. Perhaps they were embarrassed that they’d ever been fans at all.  The song went: “Ohhhhhh, Je-re-my Corrrrrrr-byyyyyyyn…”
SEP10	Think Boris Johnson doesn't respect the rule of law? MPs must know that Jeremy Corbyn is far, far worse	A chill wind is blowing fiercely through the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) right now. And its name is “reselection”. If you doubted just how much of an impact the threat of trigger ballots would have on Labour MPs, you only have to have watched Ian Austin’s speech during a debate in the House of Commons last night, a debate called in order to attack the prime minister. But Austin, who resigned the Labour whip earlier this year, was focused on an entirely different target. In an excoriating and passionate display, the Dudley North MP recited the significant occasions when his former party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, appeared to enjoy a less robust relationship with the rule of law than he currently espouses. From inviting suspected IRA terrorists into the Commons just days after that terrorist organisation had murdered five people in their beds at the Brighton Grand Hotel in 1984, to being arrested while taking part in a IRA demonstration against the trial of the man who actually planted the bomb, Corbyn’s record was laid out to the Commons in stark terms.
SEP10	Prorogation? The real Brexit coup is how badly Remainers have tied up Boris Johnson	The same MPs who accused Jacob Rees-Mogg of being undignified for sitting back on the frontbench were perfectly happy during last night's parliamentary prorogation to heckle the Black Rod, wave banners around and force security to intervene after crowding around John Bercow in the hope of restraining him in his chair. One might have hoped that these parliamentarians would have displayed the same good manners they recently demanded of the Leader of the House for this standard parliamentary process, which the Queen, guardian of the country's unwritten constitution, approved. However, they preferred to indulge in the Remainer fantasies that this was the climax of a coup: shouting "shame on you!", singing and kicking off about how they had been "silenced". It's hard to see how the House of Commons has been "silenced" over Brexit given that it has just managed to pass a bill into law that is so problematic for the Prime Minister that serious pundits are suggesting he should resign to avoid having to humiliate himself by fulfilling its obligation to extend Article 50. If Mr Johnson had tried to launch a coup, it was a pretty rubbish one, as the legislature was more than able to stick its oar in. 
SEP10	Question Time has become a bear pit – I nearly walked off the show	In 15 years of political TV punditry it had never occurred to me to walk out of a show, live on air. But it nearly happened on last Thursday’s Question Time. The thought flitted through my mind as, yet again, the other panellists talked over each other and I was barely allowed to get a sentence out without being interrupted. As Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, interrupted me for the third time after I had barely uttered a word, I threw up my hands and blustered: “What on earth is the point of debating if this is what you’re going to do?” Fiona Bruce, the show’s new host, intervened and I was eventually allowed to speak for about 45 seconds without interruption.
SEP10	Ireland and Britain remain dangerously locked in mutual incomprehension on Brexit and the border	Brexiteers and Backstoppers are trapped in a danse macabre, with Northern Ireland stuck in the middle The old adage about two countries being separated by a common language has never looked more apt. The only difference is that it’s now Ireland, rather than the United States, with whom Britain is locked in mutual incomprehension. Yesterday’s meeting in Dublin demonstrated that perfectly. It was as if Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar were each lost without a translator to interpret what the other was saying.
SEP11	Calm down, Handmaniacs… we’re not in Gilead yet	Why authors write sequels (money) and why they say they write sequels (anything but money) tend to be two very different things. But this week, when Margaret Atwood put the reason she’d finally decided to pen a follow-up to The Handmaid’s Tale squarely down to Donald Trump, this rang true. Artists have always been inspired by cultural schisms, and this human schism came with lurid neon hair and views to match: enough to draw many a fictional character out of retirement. Only when the 79-year-old “prophet writer” then went on to compare the dystopian Republic of Gilead in which her 1985 blockbuster was set – where hooded hordes of ritually raped and impregnated women are forbidden to vote, work, read or possess money – to the world we now live in, again this seemed to be accepted without demur.
SEP11	Forget Icarus, Nigel Farage is actually the Brexit Spartacus: leading the revolt against the EU oppressor	Twitter has been set alight by Brexiteer Hunter DuBose's piece on the Telegraph today, warning that Nigel Farage was the "Brexit Icarus" who needed to curb his ambition in his desire to keep Boris Johnson honest. If he overreached by trying to field Brexit Party candidates across the country against the Conservatives, especially in safe seats, then Mr Farage risked faced a political fate as grisly as the hubristic Greek who flew on hand-made wings too close to the Sun and crashed into the sea after they broke apart in the heat. The Brexit Party was urged to "heed" this mythological tale of vainglorious ambition ending in tears. Sadly, political tweeters showed their reluctance to read beyond the headline as they piled in with reminders that about what happened to Icarus, unwittingly proving Mr DuBose's point, which he set out in his first paragraph. Even those who have yet to subscribe (a highly recommended move, by the way) can freely read those opening few lines. 
SEP11	What a sorry state we're in when Fireman Sam is too male, pale and stale for the woke brigade	First they came for Fireman Sam. Then they put Postman Pat in a frock. Finally they fingered Rastamouse for benefit fraud. Not since Shrek have so many fairy‑tale characters felt so threatened. In fairness, Pat has not (yet) been made to dress like a Jess, but Rastamouse creator Michael De Souza has been sentenced to community service and they have most definitely come for Sam. By “they” I mean “them”, of course. And by “them” I mean, of course, those faceless diversity warriors who can’t help scouring the purlieus of CBeebies in search of gender, race and religious infractions. This time it is Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service who have provoked an incendiary response for featuring poor old Fireman Sam as their mascot. How dare they?
SEP11	The Supreme Court would be wise to accept that prorogation is too political for judges	Enoch Powell once admonished that the people should not leave to judges what they themselves can dispose of at the ballot box. The current litigation relating to the legality of the advice to the sovereign to prorogue Parliament is evidence of the wisdom of Powell’s dictum. In England, a powerful Divisional Court, including the Lord Chief Justice and Master of the Rolls, has found that the Prime Minister acted lawfully in advising the Sovereign to prorogue. In Scotland, the Inner House or appeal court has overruled the first instance decision of Lord Doherty and decided under Scots law that the advice was motivated by the improper purpose of stymying parliament and that it, and what has followed from it, is unlawful. The court ordered that the prorogation was unlawful and thus null and of no effect. The court’s reasoning has yet to be given. In the Outer House, Lord Doherty considered the Scottish Claim of Right of 1689  (well before the Act of Union 1707) which provided that the prerogative power could not be exercised contrary to the laws and liberties of the kingdom and any claim that executive power is unlimited or unfettered was untenable. However, he concluded that the Claim of Right did not specify limitations on prorogation either as to timing or length of time. Accountability for the advice to prorogue is to Parliament and ultimately the electorate.
SEP11	I thought Labour’s approach to Brexit couldn’t get any sillier. Then they proved me wrong	Hats off to Labour. I didn’t think they had it in them. But once again, they’ve proved the doubters wrong. Against all odds, they’ve managed to make their approach to Brexit even more screamingly chaotic than it was before. It’s less than a month since Diane Abbott was on the Today programme, explaining to a bemused Justin Webb what the next Labour government would do. In summary: Labour would march off to Brussels, thrash out a dazzling new Brexit deal, present it proudly to the nation… and then urge everyone to vote against it. Someone, however, must have decided that this approach wasn’t quite confusing enough, because on Wednesday, Labour ramped up the havoc to a thrilling new level. At the exact same hour, but in different cities, two of the most important figures in Jeremy Corbyn’s team gave speeches about Brexit – and outlined two utterly different strategies.
SEP11	Bercow has left his successor some major problems to clear up	Now we know. On or before Thursday October 31, John Bercow will stand down as Speaker of the House of Commons after ten years in the post, and MPs will elect a successor from among their number to preside over their proceedings, run the administration which supports the chamber and be, for many casual observers, the public face of Parliament. Already half a dozen names have put themselves forward. But what will be the priorities facing him or her, the most pressing issues which a new Speaker will have to deal with? The first decision the new Speaker will have to take is what style he or she will adopt as presiding officer of the Commons. Bercow has been a forthright and grandiloquent figure, his orotundity booming across the airwaves with rolling phrases such as “I say to him beyond peradventure that his attitude makes Dr Pangloss look a pessimist”. That's not to mention his endless quasi-catchphrase of admonishing members for "chuntering from a sedentary position”.
SEP11	Tom Watson has worked out that Labour's fence-sitting Brexit strategy doesn't work	The more absurd a political "line to take" is, the easier it is to spot. Take yesterday, for example, when Shadow International Trade Secretary, Barry Gardiner, was interviewed on the Today programme about his party’s latest version of its Brexit policy. He was asked whether Labour would campaign for a Remain or a Leave vote in any new referendum. To which he seemed to answer: “yes”. It was a reasonable question, but Gardiner wasn’t playing ball. “I think the important thing is to campaign to bring this country together again,” he declared, as if to a congregation of the Free Church of Scotland. “It’s time now for politicians to put their own personal preferences to one side and say the most important thing now is not Remain or Leave: the most important thing is that we have a country that is united and can move forward saying we’ve had our opportunity…” At which point he was interrupted by the presenter to ask how he personally would vote. “I’ve told you which way I would vote…” (He hadn’t). “I would vote to Remain.” Well, so much for putting aside your own preferences.
SEP11	Remainers are confirming Leave voters' worst fears by trying to litigate Brexit to death	Remainers have been waging legal warfare on every front possible. After being told by the High Court of England and Wales that Boris Johnson's prorogation was lawful, they have had a breakthrough in Scotland thanks to Edinburgh's Inner House ruling that the proroguing was "unlawful" due to its "improper purpose of stymying Parliament". This means the United Kingdom's Supreme Court is in for a momentous time next week deciding whether to side with the leading judges of England or Scotland on the legitimacy of Parliament being prorogued. That is not to mention the anti-no-deal case shortly to be decided upon in Belfast which could well land in the Supreme Court's in-tray. The Remain campaigners behind these legal bids, such as Gina Miller, who has been leading the fight through the English courts, herald their efforts as a "fight for democracy".
SEP11	Theresa May's absurd honours list shows the decay at the heart of our Establishment	In Ridley Scott’s film, Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Jerusalem is surrounded by Saladin’s army.  There were no knights in the city. They had all been killed at the Battle of Hattin. So Balian of Ibelin (brilliantly played by Orlando Bloom), the Commander of the Holy City, makes every able-bodied man, a knight. The Patriarch is outraged. He confronts Balian. “Does making a man a knight make him a better fighter?” he asks.  Balian pauses to answer. “Yes,” he replies. I believe that was true in 1197.  Would that it were also true now. To say that there has been quantitative easing in the honours supply in your and my lifetimes must be the understatement of the year.  The latest example is Mrs May’s resignation honours list. We must either laugh or cry. I recommend laughing.  There is already too much in our national life to cry about. Apart from the BEM for the Chequers Head Chef and for the Number 10 Housekeeper, which seems an inadequate reward for what they must have had to put up with (and the peerage for Heather Hallett, who should long ago have been appointed Lord Chief Justice), what is one to say about the rest? 
SEP11	The Scottish court prorogation ruling shows the anti-Brexit Establishment is hard at work	Many years ago, the then chief of a very major US business shared his thoughts with me in respect of the British Establishment. He said that a major problem with the UK is that it is still controlled by holders of assets, in particular land, at inflated prices and that the economy was run accordingly. As a consequence, the incentives to be enterprising and to work hard were diminished. He was particularly struck by how successful the British Establishment had been at keeping a grip on their privilege.  A week after I resigned as head of the British Chambers of Commerce, in order to fight for the Leave campaign back in March 2016, I wrote for the Evening Standard a piece comparing the referendum to medieval England's Peasants'  Revolt, I ended by saying : But if this is a latter-day 'peasants' revolt',  take a lesson from the original. As Wat Tyler, the leader of the peasants, found to his cost, you cannot rely on our leaders, corporate and political, being gentlefolk of the fair-play kind. The establishment are ruthless in defence of their own interests." 
SEP12	Crass Downing Street jibe at judges unites Scottish politicians	Whichever Downing Street apparatchik thought it a good idea to denigrate Scotland’s foremost judges as biased in their claim that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had misled the Queen over the prorogation must surely now know different. A serious row has erupted which may well have constitutional implications for the simple reason that seldom is any issue more likely to unite Scots whatever their political persuasion – unionist or nationalist, conservative or socialist – than an attack on the country’s fiercely independent judiciary. Needless to say this is especially so if the criticism emanates from England where, in the current political climate, Mr Johnson’s support for the Union is under constant scrutiny.
SEP12	Forgiving the Tory rebels is a dangerous move for Boris	When is a government not a government? When it’s run by Boris Johnson. This joke is doing the rounds amongst the rebels who seized control of parliament last week and it’s depressingly accurate. The Prime Minister is now a prisoner in 10 Downing Street, kept there by Jeremy Corbyn who is refusing to let him hold a general election – and instead joining forces with Tory rebels to pass laws and issue instructions. Their hope is that, after a few more weeks of this torture, his Brexit deadline will has passed and he’ll be humiliated in the eyes of voters. Dominic Grieve is enjoying this a bit too much. A former Attorney General and alumnus of Westminster School and Magdalen College he has, fairly late in life, tasted the vodka of rebellion and now seeks to finish the bottle. First he voted against Theresa May’s deal, then threatened to resign from his party. Now he’s using his lawyerly skills to draft legislation that Corbyn and his allies can deploy as they seek to destroy a Conservative Prime Minister. Philip Hammond is behaving in much the same way and although he has been kicked out of the Tory party, he’s hinted that he’ll sue his way back in. The case for readmitting either to the Conservative Party doesn’t seem to be terribly strong, but the Prime Minister is now in reconciliatory mode. His tactics failed. Threatening to kick rebels out of the party seemed to intensify, rather than diminish, the insurrection. If he’s about to win an election, he’ll need the backing of Tory voters who have a soft spot for Rory Stewart, Amber Rudd and a good few of the others currently cast out of Tory paradise. But how to do this, without looking pathetic?
SEP12	John Bercow gave this Brexit warning to Boris Johnson... and he couldn’t have sounded angrier	It’s another world, the House of Commons. On Monday, John Bercow announced to the chamber that he intended to stand down as Speaker. And in response, even though they’d spent the previous week protesting that they didn’t have enough time to debate Brexit, tremulous MPs devoted the next hour and 25 minutes to paying ever more gushing tribute to him. It doesn’t happen like that in normal jobs, does it? When, say, Tim from accounts decides to change jobs, he gets a leaving card, some drinks at the pub over the road, and a brief vote of thanks from his line manager. What he doesn’t get is every single employee in the entire organisation halting work for the afternoon so that they can take turns to stand up and proclaim, “Tim, when the history books come to be written, you will be remembered as one of the great office payroll administrators of our age. In these troubled and turbulent times, you have stood firm, and continued to enter monthly timesheets and deduct National Insurance Contributions with the most extraordinary grace, wisdom and courage. This accounts department, this company, and dare I say this nation, owe you a debt they can never repay.” Parliament is now suspended, so the tributes to the Speaker have, at least for the time being, been cut short. Mr Bercow himself, however, is not easily silenced, and this evening in London, at the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, he delivered a lecture about the ongoing constitutional bedlam of Brexit.
SEP12	When it comes to office banter, the joke’s on men	Lads, lads, lads. Has anyone else noticed that women in the workplace have no sense of humour? None. Take Stacey. She never laughs. Not even when you make the same joke every day.  Leaving that Hallowe’en witch’s hat on the desk was funny. So why sneak off to the HR department and land us all in it?
SEP12	Brexit has turned us all into Gareth from The Office	Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds tweeted a picture of himself this week, sitting alone on the green benches of the prorogued Commons. A bell tinkled in a distant corridor of my brain. There was something familiar about both the tweet itself – “Reporting for duty,” was his caption – and the eagerness of his body language: bottom perched on the front of the bench, hands clasped between the knees, the too-pointy tips of his office brogues pointing outwards in Second Position, his lips pressed together in a self-important smile. Oh my God – it’s Gareth from The Office! To be fair, Reynolds is not the only MP currently channelling the scrawny, self-aggrandising “team leader” of Wernham Hogg’s sales department. Both sides of the house seem to have been overrun by the spirit of Gareth Keenan: his neediness, his ludicrous vanity, his hyperbolic military metaphors. The ERG is especially stricken with Gareth-itis, from its chairman Steve Baker (“I will never taste surrender again”) to its vainglorious vox-popper, Mark Francois. “I wouldn’t vote for it if they put a shotgun in my mouth,” declared Francois, puce with pomposity, when presented with Theresa May’s mild-mannered Withdrawal Agreement.
SEP12	The absurdity of calling Boris Johnson a 'fascist' just shows the Left's dearth of ideas	Where would politics be without a touch of hyperbole? Exaggeration has always been part of the mix when it comes to democratic politics, whether it's Tony Blair's warning in 1997 that "We only have 24 hours to save the NHS" or The Sun newspaper asking, in the event of a victory by Neil Kinnock's Labour Party in 1992, "will the last person in Britain please turn out the lights?" The degree to which we should take this sort of thing seriously is unclear and regularly debated. And if such intemperate language were only deployed during general election campaigns, it would be bad enough. But in 2019 the fashion for “othering” your opponents – as opposed to merely making fun of them – has become ingrained as a daily occurrence. So used are we to the most absurd epithets being used to describe our politicians and political parties that we risk accepting them without a necessary degree of objectivity.
SEP12	Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage's cold war risks ending in mutually assured destruction	Dominic Cummings is not quite ready to bury the referendum hatchet, judging by the venomous briefing from "a senior Tory source" in response to the idea of the Tories striking a pact with the Brexit Party. "Neither Nigel Farage nor Arron Banks are fit and proper persons and should never be allowed anywhere near government," they said. In the past, Mr Farage would have countered such a jab with equal, if not greater, vitriol. The allusion to Mr Banks, who was a central member of Vote Leave's rival Brexit campaign Leave.EU but is not now part of the Brexit Party, clearly shows the aim of touching on the referendum-era rows they had with Mr Cummings and his colleagues. But the Brexit Party leader has not risen angrily to the bait, instead choosing to respond with disappointment. “I don’t want to be in government! I’m not asking to be in government!” he protested to Robert Peston last night. "All I want to do is unite the Brexit vote in this country, to give the 17.4 million people a political vehicle whereby we can get the result of the referendum delivered."
SEP12	The Tories' egotistical refusal to engage with the Brexit Party may spell their downfall	Nigel Farage has offered the Tory Party a “non-aggression pact” for the surely soon-forthcoming general election. We are told that “senior Tory sources” have dismissed the prospects of any such pact, declaring Nigel Farage not a “fit and proper person” for any role in government. Now of course “senior Tory sources” doesn’t have to mean anyone on Team Boris. After all, half the Tory MPs voted against him in the recent leadership campaign, and several members of his Cabinet literally stood against him themselves. We might not, for example, want to treat the comments of a “senior Tory source” as indicative of his own thinking. Nonetheless, there certainly has been a certain sort of Tory Leaver who in the past used to attempt to distance themselves from Farage. During the early 2010s there was even the “Farage paradox” that, the better Ukip did in the opinion polls, the lower support for leaving the EU became.
SEP12	Forget the Irish 'backstop' — let's bring on the night watchman instead	What would John Arlott have made of it all? Brexit, Boris, and backstops. It is easy to summon up his shade and hear again his inimitable port-over-gravel voice and the calm reassurance of his Hampshire policeman’s burr. “England have played themselves into a spot of bother. They’re finding it hard to get momentum having won the toss and opting to bat. And the light is definitely beginning to fade here at Lords as the umpires confer at the Nursery End. The openers are already licking their wounds back in the Pavilion after some very silly strokes.  There’s a bit of a pause as we wait for the new batsman to appear. Yes, I thought so. I thought it would be. The captain has called up the night watchman”.
SEP12	Despite the hysteria, Yellowhammer suggests there is little to fear about a no-deal Brexit	How ironic that whenever the BBC runs a story about a no-deal Brexit it uses a photograph of lorries backed up along the M20 taken during the Calais port strikes in 2015. On that occasion, strikers dumped tyres on the road leading to Calais docks and set them alight, closing the port altogether and leading to long tailbacks of lorries in Britain and France. Yet did the supermarkets run out of food? Did the British public riot because they were unable to get one type of lettuce? Industrial disputes affecting vital infrastructure are just one of the many crises for which governments have to plan. I presume – and hope – there are people in Whitehall already engaged in detailed contingency planning in the event of a general strike in Britain: something which many on the left keep demanding for various reasons and which a Corbyn government would help enable by repealing much trade union law. Remainers who demanded that the government release documents relating to Operation Yellowhammer, which make preparations for the event of a no deal Brexit, know full well the nature of this kind of planning. It is not a prediction but a worse case scenario, helping the government in its planning to mitigate the risks. Those like Sir Keir Starmer who are jumping up and down this morning trying to tell us that a no deal Brexit would be a national catastrophe have chosen to distort the purpose of Operation Yellowhammer – trying to present it instead as a forecast of what will happen in spite of government planning.  
SEP13	Convention underpins our democracy, and MPs toss it aside at their own risk	Why has John Bercow been, by a very long way, the most disastrous Speaker of modern times? He is, after all, intelligent, articulate, and unafraid of Ministers. He has helped backbenchers challenge frontbenchers. The answer is that he deliberately breaks convention. This might sound an amazingly feeble – even deplorable – objection. After all, we are supposed to admire people who defy convention to bring about change. Yet I hope to show that there are some positions, and some institutions, in which convention – as opposed to formal law - is the only way of working. Suppose, for example, that the Queen were to insist on her legal rights – making whomever she wanted a peer, eating every swan in the kingdom or refusing royal assent to any Bill she thought appalling etc. She would be breaking the convention by which a constitutional monarchy works. That would be the end of the House of Windsor. The Speakership is a position and the House of Commons is an institution much more dependent on convention than on law. There is no law which says the Speaker must be impartial, yet it is the convention by which he must operate. If one party or set of MPs believes that the Speaker is biased against it, the work of the House is soured and trust collapses. In the matter of leaving the European Union, a subject which especially requires a figure who is above the battle, Mr Bercow has been proudly anti-Brexit, and contemptuous of MPs, especially ministers, who favour it.
SEP13	Leavers must brace themselves for the most audacious second referendum plot yet	Remainers are organising. Their new plot, spearheaded by former Conservative Oliver Letwin, is predicated on keeping this rotten parliament alive for as long as possible, denying the people the ability to kick out their duplicitous representatives for months on end. All to try to cancel the largest vote ever taken in the United Kingdom. In 2017, just three parties with 48 MPs between them stood on manifestos committed to denying the result of the referendum. All other MPs stood for parties promising to respect the result. Since that democratic event there has been an immense, unedifying churn of shifting positions, defections, and new party formations. The Labour Party alone has drifted from originally promising to leave the EU’s single market and customs union, to keeping the customs union, to ‘regulatory alignment’ with EU rules, to keeping the option of a second referendum on the table in the event of no deal, to committing to one in any circumstance, to committing to rigged options of a bad deal or Remain. The only more Remainy step they could take now is outright revocation of Article 50 without going to the hassle of staging a rigged referendum. At least the Lib Dems are more honest with their new revoke position.
SEP13	Only a fatuous metro elite party like Labour could entertain the nonsense of a four-day week	In the past, the Labour Party – which literally has the word “labour” in their name – understood the value and dignity of a hard day’s work no matter whether it was down a mine shaft, on a factory floor, or in an office.  Today’s Labour Party is a far cry from the one founded by trade unions in the docklands and steelworks of the North of England and Scotland. Instead, dominated by the Notting Hill, self-actualising set, they seek to paint work as an unnecessary burden. This mentality hurts the worst off in our society. Corbyn-supporting pressure group Momentum had recently demanded Labour mandate a four day work week. But even a Labour Party-commissioned report out yesterday ridiculed the idea. The report’s author, Lord Skidelsky, said it is not “realistic or even desirable" to introduce a lower cap on working hours. Despite his thumping rejection, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has refused to rule out the idea and said to “watch this space”.
SEP13	Domestic abuse is not the preserve of an underclass – it's just as likely to be happening to a woman like you	We all know what domestic violence looks like, don’t we? It’s a red-faced man, quite likely drunk, standing over a crying woman in an untidy flat – Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire, in other words. The victim will be young, in her 20s or early 30s, and everything about the scene reinforces the widely-held assumption that domestic violence occurs most often in unskilled, low-income families. So do the statistics, which regularly find higher levels of violence against wives and girlfriends in families which are struggling to survive financially; the figures for inner-city areas are much worse than in leafy south-west London, for instance. The government’s survey of intimate partner abuse suggests that more than three times as many women experience abuse in households with an annual income of less than £10,000, compared to those in families earning £50,000 or more. It also suggests that women with degrees or diplomas are significantly less likely to become victims than those with GCSEs or no qualifications. All of this is obvious, expected – and highly misleading. Few crimes are as under-reported as domestic violence, so much so that the government acknowledges that the real extent is "hidden". Research suggests that women suffer an average of 35 assaults before they summon up the courage to go to the police, and many victims won’t report it at all. They are too afraid of the consequences, including not being believed – half of 999 calls about domestic violence don’t lead to an arrest, according to official figures.
SEP13	Team McCluskey is losing the internal battle against Labour Remainers	Avid conference watchers will be disappointed if they’re expecting fireworks at Labour’s seaside get together later this month. There have been reports that Len McCluskey, the boss of the party’s biggest donor, Unite the Union, has urged Jeremy Corbyn to adopt a more neutral tone when it comes to a second EU referendum. But it won’t make any difference. Len’s on a loser with this one. Let there be no doubt – the comrades will have a debate and there will be disagreements here and there. But eventually, as time-honoured tradition dictates, there will be a compromise, a fudge – call it what you like. And delegates will end the week more or less united, with a rousing rendition of the Red Flag, Palestinian flags waving proudly and fists clenched in the air. McCluskey doesn’t have to represent the majority opinion in the party to get his way – his sizeable contributions from the pay packets of his members is enough to get him a decent hearing. But the reality is that he is one of a vanishingly small number of Labour Party members to indulge any degree of scepticism about the European project. If it were up to Corbyn’s rank and file, the party would go into the general election pledging to “do a Swinson” and revoke Article 50 without a referendum.
SEP13	The Army's eco drive is a game changer for the green revolution	Finally, the Army thinks it has worked out how to persuade young people to join its ranks. It’s not by paying them more, or by branding them “snowflakes” and “selfie addicts”, as they did earlier this year. Apparently Generation Z will fight for its country if we give new recruits electric tanks to do it in.  The Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, has said the military needs to be “on the right side of the environmental argument” to attract young Britons, and that to do it, it must pour money into developing low-carbon military vehicles. Will it work? To be honest, I’m doubtful. But what such a move will do is seriously start to move things forward when it comes to green transport technology. Because one of the great lessons of the last 50 years in tech is that, for all the crowdfunding, angel investing and private sector R&D spending that goes on in Silicon Valley, nothing puts a rocket booster on development like a national defence budget.
SEP13	With Brexit on the rocks, does the PM dare to dismiss 'Rasputin' Cummings?	“Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?” Leaders have been grappling with the question of how to deal with over-bearing advisers since Henry II’s outburst led to Thomas à Becket’s bloody death on the steps of Canterbury Cathedral more than eight centuries ago. Now it is Boris Johnson’s turn to decide whether his Chief of Staff’s actions in excommunicating 21 MPs were egregious enough to deprive him of his political life.  Dominic Cummings may not be much of a holy man but he will certainly be poised for Brexit-martyrdom if the Prime Minister does cut him loose. Yet Mr Johnson is apparently being urged to do just that in order to keep the Conservatives together at this, perhaps the most dangerous moment for the party since its foundation.
SEP13	The baby boomers have wrecked marriage – no wonder millennials detest the idea	The older I've got (32 and counting), the more preposterous a concept I find marriage to be. And hand on heart, before you say it, this is not because I'm bitter about not having done it myself. Thank goodness I didn't marry the first serious boyfriend I had (or the second, or third). Much to my parents' quiet disappointment, I don't think I'll ever tie the knot. I'm far from alone in this. The proportion of women over 16 who are married is now just 49.5 per cent, according to official figures published yesterday – a record low. What puts women like myself off the idea? It may surprise some men to read that, far from planning the 'best day of our lives' since childhood, many of us unhitched ladies cringe at the thought of hosting a wedding. They are a monumental waste of money.  The outdated rituals associated with them are also downright creepy - the puritanical white dress, that kiss in front of an audience, the 'handing over' of bride by father.
SEP13	The party I love is now led by an enabler of anti-Semitism – which is why I can no longer be a Labour MP	I was brought up being told as a tiny kid that our family would vote Labour even if they put a donkey up, so long as it wore a red rosette. My great grandfather Henry helped to found the Labour party in Leeds in 1906. My great grandparents, my grandparents and my parents were all Labour party members and voters. But I am standing down as the Labour MP for Bassetlaw because I can no longer tolerate the rank hypocrisy of the Labour leader. Among working-class Labour voters, the perception of a Labour MP is someone who would automatically support the Royal British Legion and shake a bucket for Help for Heroes. And that’s Jeremy Corbyn’s fundamental problem with these voters because they don’t believe that he would. Having promised them at the last election that Labour would see through Brexit, he fails to understand just how great the level of anger is out there and how it’s building up by the day. The anger is much greater now than it was in the expenses scandal and it was visceral then. There’s one word they use, all the time, constantly, and repeatedly – it’s Corbyn. If he was to stand down, Labour would have a huge, huge boost in the polls. Anybody who goes out on the doorstep of those traditional Labour areas knows this is true – anybody. 
SEP13	The Tory grassroots is once again losing patience with its out-of-touch party	As a former Tory councillor, I have detected in recent days that the party’s grassroots base is getting more than a little bit fed up with the Conservative attitude towards the Brexit Party - not least following a blistering verbal assault by a ‘senior Tory source’ on Nigel Farage this week. The unnamed official  described the Brexit Party leader and Aaron Banks as “not fit and proper” and said “they should never be allowed anywhere near government”, following an offer by Farage to co-operate in any forthcoming election.  An attack on the Brexit Party is easy to interpret as an attack on Brexit. This broadside has led many to question why the Conservative Party should find it so difficult to reassure Farage that the Government intends to deliver proper British independence from the EU. This is not comfortable for the significant proportion of Leave voting Conservatives whose trust has been battered by the May administration.  To issue such strong denigration is an act of self-harm. Very significant numbers of former Tory voters and members inhabit the Brexit Party; it doesn't feel like a vote winning strategy to suggest to those voters you wish to encourage back that they are members of a degenerate organisation. This response seems rather out of touch and something much more appropriately directed towards UKIP now that it has been abandoned by all credible support. 
SEP14	If Jeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister, the Special Relationship is doomed	Since the end of World War II, the United States and the United Kingdom have cooperated closely, especially on defence and security matters. The few exceptions are well known – such as the US refusal to support the Anglo-French attack on Egypt in 1956 or the UK’s refusal to send ground troops to Vietnam – precisely because the norm is mutually supportive. This does not mean there has always been complete agreement. There have been periods of close cooperation – especially when the American and British leaders have a real relationship – and times where the partnership has been more formal. However, there is a risk that irreversible damage may be done if a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour Party comes to power in the UK, which could come to pass soon if Boris Johnson calls an early general election. Already, President Donald Trump’s disdain for multilateral bodies and genuine cooperation is one source of tension, made far worse when he effectively demanded the dismissal of the UK ambassador in July. For now, the UK-US links, though weaker, continue to work effectively at the policy level and in terms of sharing security information. But the election of a Corbyn government would place even this under intolerable strain.
SEP14	Our democracy is being overthrown by the EU’s Hideous Strength	It’s not about Brexit any more, at least not primarily. It’s about whether we remain a democracy in the fullest sense. Our system depends on unwritten conventions and precedents. We expect winners to show restraint and losers to show consent. We expect our officials – including judges, civil servants and, not least, the Commons Speaker – to be impartial. We expect the electorate to be the final umpire. All these norms are coming under pressure as the campaign to reverse Brexit intensifies. The EU, as well as being undemocratic in itself, tends to degrade the internal democracy of its member nations. Everyone knows that the Brussels institutions are oligarchic, combining executive and legislative power in the hands of commissars who are immune to public opinion. What is less widely appreciated is the extent to which the 28 member states are also required to alter their domestic constitutions so as to sustain the requirements of membership. Elections are rerun, coalitions broken, laws ignored, parties annihilated, referendums overturned, prime ministers toppled – all for the sake of deeper integration.  I think of it as the EU’s “Hideous Strength” – the title of CS Lewis’s adult novel about a diabolical plot to take over Britain through a seemingly bland bureaucracy. Until now, the most shocking examples were the civilian juntas imposed on Italy and Greece in 2011 to keep them in the euro. But ponder the past three years here. Look at the way our most basic understandings and conventions have been torn up. Look at the policies now being put forward by the main Opposition parties. Labour is proposing to get a better deal from Brussels and then campaign against its own deal in a referendum. The Lib Dems, less entertainingly but more shockingly, want to annul the outcome of the referendum that they were the first party to propose. 
SEP14	Explanations are not excuses for appalling childhood behaviour	"I blame the parents”. I wonder which self-satisfied and profoundly stupid soul first spoke these words? It’s a conclusion that some of our judges seemingly concur with – one of them has just blamed the parents of a man who cut off a teenage boy’s hand with a machete; “It is not society that is at fault. It is your parents and family – the way you have been brought up”, adding that “the sins of previous generations” had led him to behave like this. At least he was sent to jail; just around the corner from me another man robbed two teenage boys at knife point and walked free from court because his mother had died of cancer – those damn parents again! – and he had “got in with the wrong crowd”. It’s as if our judges listened to “Gee Officer Krupke!” from West Side Story and took it as a guidance manual rather than satire. We can only imagine what a nightmare man like this must have been at school. Though actually we don’t need to imagine any more as Ofsted has published its latest inspection report of a Birmingham school where staff went on strike earlier this year in protest at the behaviour of pupils, which had become so uncontrollable that panic buttons were installed in classroom. Sad though this is, some teachers are reaping what they sow; the Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman has told them to be harder on children who disrupt lessons rather than giving them a free pass because their “life circumstances” mean they can’t control themselves. I’d like to blame Les Mis, but this particular rot set in in the 1960s, like most disagreeable things. We live in a society which tells us that every bad act must stem from deprivation of some kind. Stealing a loaf of bread can be excused if one is hungry. But the rise of crimes like rape, domestic murder and child abuse cover all social classes; these are things people do because, horrible as it is, they want to, just as British jihadi brides and boys joined Isil not despite the torture, rape and murder but because of it. Upsetting though it may be to gentle-natured types to accept this, if you don’t you are conniving with the perpetuation of the suffering of the innocent and the getting off of the guilty.
SEP14	The Labour Party's war on private education goes against everything it is supposed to stand for	The Labour Party is gearing up its war on private education.  If elected, Labour will charge VAT on school fees, adding £3,000 to average day school fees, driving out parents who scrimp and save to get places for their children. It will apply full business rates to schools, again driving up fees or putting smaller, less expensive schools out of business. It is all part of a masterplan to get rid of private schools altogether. Labour Chairman Ian Lavery recently endorsed this aim. Labour Against Private Schools will endeavour to make it party policy at the upcoming party conference.
SEP14	Video games have become a form of gambling – so why can't we regulate them as such?	I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by stupid little treasure chests. Or at least that’s how it feels. Over the past decade, I’ve watched one of my favourite art forms, video games, be slowly colonised by the implacable force of gambling, which has turned their Arcadian theatre stage into a giant casino. Casinos, of course, can be fun in moderation. But most casinos don’t admit children. That is why a committee of MPs is now calling for “loot boxes”, a key component of the modern gaming economy, to be classified as gambling and therefore banned for under-18s. To be clear, gambling-like elements are nothing new in games. Game makers have long spiced up their work using variable rewards, the psychological trick which powers both slot machines and Instagram. In the past, however, games were sold and consumed in roughly the same way as novels – you buy one, you enjoy it, you move on – which put an upper limit on how much money you could make from an individual consumer.
SEP14	Boris is going to get a deal. But the Brexit process has done untold damage to British political life	I’m pretty sure I know what’s going to happen now. There is going to be a deal – or something that can plausibly be presented as one – by the end of October.  This would have been much easier to accomplish without the extraordinary seizure of government by the Remain faction in Parliament whose actual intention, of course, was not to prevent No Deal but to prevent Brexit itself. By undermining the prime minister’s bargaining position, the Speaker and his friends have done their very best to persuade the EU that there is no point in negotiating with him, and that they can just wait it out, since the possibility of No Deal has been outlawed. But mercifully, there are indications that Brussels and the DUP find this too risky a bet. So the threat of No Deal remains in play and everybody is having to come to terms with this despite the antics in Westminster and the various courts that have been drafted into the game – whose contradictory conclusions are only adding to distrust of the Remainers’ confident assurances to their friends in Brussels that they have paralysed the government and put an end to Brexit. In the midst of all the noise and bluster, and the desperate waves of face-saving disinformation, there is one simple truth: economic reality trumps ideology. (At least in democratic societies – totalitarian ones can starve as many people as they like in the name of a utopian goal.) And the economic reality is that, for all the hyperbole about the dangers of No Deal for the UK, the consequences for the other parties would come at a horrendously bad time. 
SEP14	The delights of shopping are nothing compared to the joys of 'reverse retail therapy'	I’ve always hated going shopping. It turns out most of my countrymen feel the same way. Given the chance to buy online instead, we have simply stopped going to the shops and the result, a study by PwC suggests, is that retail chain outlets are now closing at the fastest rate seen for at least a decade. I did, however, have one wholly positive high-street chain experience recently. Deciding I had made a mistake, I boxed up a pair of unworn shoes and took them back to Russell & Bromley. I often return items bought online, but it has been some time since I returned something to a physical shop. Until the card machine was placed before me, I didn’t think much of it. But then I saw the number: “-£225”. “Gosh – minus!” I thought. I entered my PIN and the miraculous feat was achieved: reverse shopping. I left. I felt lighter, less encumbered and richer.
SEP14	Labour's punitive tax raid on private schools will harm the state sector too	Parents and pupils everywhere have much to fear from Labour’s proposals to impose punitive taxes on independent education. Whilst it might at first seem tempting (they can afford it, right?) this is a dangerous policy based on myths and dodgy maths. It will effectively destroy independent education and drive up costs and class sizes in state schools. First, let’s bust those convenient myths. Most independent schools are not the couple of famous schools everyone thinks of, but small schools, with no spare income. Some are special needs schools or give places to children in care. Any spare cash goes straight back into education, including free or discounted places for lower income families and supporting local state schools; that’s why they are charities. A third of pupils get discounted fees and parents choose to spend their money that way rather than on tutoring their children or buying houses near good state schools. All this saves the taxpayer over £3.5 billion a year.
SEP14	The shooting industry is in rude health, despite Chris Packham's petty point-scoring campaigns	Last week I found myself just north of Hull enjoying a few ales with some local naturists. Needless to say I was there on behalf of another newspaper; it was strictly business.  As two pints blurred into three, the conversation, unexpectedly, turned to Wild Justice, or as one of my drinking compadres put it, "that lot who tried to ban pigeon shooting". This was followed by a cacophony of tutting before, in a rich tone of disdainful disbelief, a voice sounded that "there are bloody hundreds of the things". Aside from their penchant for taking their trousers off, the assembled were plucked straight out of middle England. There were two retirees who’d worked at an airport, a former social worker, and an old boy who seemed to spend most of his life on a ride-on lawnmower - in essence, quintessentially British folk. 
SEP14	Mediocrity and platitudes are the European way of life	Do you believe in Europe? If so, EU president-elect Ursula von der Leyen has a job for you. Like a svelte, corporate Tinkerbell in a pink jacket, “VDL” presented her new team of lost boys (and girls) this week, laying out a new structure for the incoming European Commission. The highest compliment she could pay to any of them was that they, like Peter Pan, believed. This one is “a dedicated and convinced European”. That one is “a true believer in Europe”. The other is “first and foremost a European”. This one, by the way, is also under investigation for mis-use of European funds, for which she had to resign as France’s defence minister. Another one is being investigated for expenses fraud when he was an MEP. Yet another narrowly escaped prosecution in her home country over the sale of a state-owned island in the Danube. Then, of course, there is VDL herself, soon to be questioned about her role in a corruption scandal while she was German defence minister. This is all entirely normal, according to an anonymous EU official cited by Politico, because it’s “impossible” to find career politicians to fill jobs who haven’t faced charges of some kind or another. Even if this revealing statement were true, it is precisely why healthy democracies clear out governments every five or 10 years and don’t just swap rejected politicians in and out of office. Power corrupts.
SEP15	The international community needs to get tougher on Iran	The drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities have been blamed by America on Iran, confirming the country’s rapid descent into the ranks of rogue states. The denials from Tehran are predictable but why should they be believed? There are increasing signs that hard-liners have now taken over all major decision-making.  On top of their persistent efforts to breach oil sanctions with Syria, the regime is also imprisoning foreign nationals, some with dual Iranian citizenship but several without. The British mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe remains in jail after more than three years and has recently been joined by two Australian travel bloggers and a British-Australian academic, Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert. She has been sentenced to 10 years, presumably for alleged spying though no-one knows for certain. Is Iran jailing Westerners to use them as bargaining counters in its diplomatic confrontation with America over the collapsed nuclear deal? Whatever the reason these incarcerations are unjustified and need to called out by the international community, including the UK, and not just Washington and Israel.
SEP15	I passionately believe that I can strike a Brexit deal within weeks	Let us be in no doubt as to what has really happened in Parliament in the last couple of weeks. Let there be no ambiguity about the underlying motive. A large number of MPs – though by no means all – are simply trying to crush Brexit. In spite of all that they promised – and voted for – they just want to stop this country from ever leaving the European Union. This isn’t about trying to block a so-called “no deal” Brexit. Any such claim is utterly disingenuous. It’s about trying to stop Brexit from happening at all – and the opposition parties have emerged in their true anti-democratic colours.
SEP15	David Cameron's protest against Brexit 'lies' is deceitful	The extracts and interview with David Cameron which precede his memoirs remind us that he is a sensible man. He can admit his mistakes, see the other person’s point of view, and usually avoid being consumed by bitterness (though he is certainly not fond of Michael Gove). History will judge him a decent prime minister, though not a great one. Yet even the moderate Mr Cameron takes up the cry that, in the referendum campaign, “Leave was lying”. “Lie” is – or ought to be – a big word. It does not mean being careless with facts. Nor does it mean saying untruthful things, such as “The food is delicious”, out of politeness. It does not even mean fibbing to excuse yourself e.g. “I’m sorry was late: I was held up in traffic.” A lie is a deliberate untruth told with bad intent, something which makes the person who utters it dishonourable. That is why the word is classified in the House of Commons as “unparliamentary language”.
SEP15	Boris Johnson should be terrified by the resurgence of the Lib Dems	Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t like Jo Swinson and the feeling is mutual. The Liberal Democrat leader has always known that she was politically opposed to Jeremy Corbyn – she regards him as a Brexiteer and as part of the same populist rise that categorises the SNP and Boris Johnson’s remodelled Conservative party, both of which she abhors. This antipathy has now been strengthened thanks to her interactions with the Labour leader directly in recent weeks, with the two parties engaging in weekly Brexit talks. In addition to his politics, his disorganisation and his dependency on his advisors has left Swinson convinced that he would not only be a bad Prime Minister – he would be bad at being a bad Prime Minister to boot. That fractured relationship and the bitterly acrimonious exchanges between activists on social media means that it is easy to forget that the electoral interests of the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats are still closely intertwined. That the two parties dislike one another doesn’t change the fact that the big Liberal Democrat target isn’t Labour – but the Conservatives.  
SEP15	From Gilead’s return to the new iPhone 11, it’s been a busy week for the perpetually offended	A friend and I were discussing a common acquaintance last week – someone we were close to at university but who eventually became so unreliable and self-absorbed that we gave up. My friend noted how odd it was she had taken that route when she had everything: great house, wealthy husband, two healthy kids and very little work to do. The kids had a nanny and the most stressful features of her life seemed to be hair appointments and visits to her personal trainer. Why, we wondered, did she claim to be so pressed with urgent matters, too busy to ask friends how they are, and perpetually offended? The reason, we decided, was that her life lacked enough real worries, such as summoning enough money to pay the mortgage each month. No serious, time-sensitive commitments, either, such as those one might have in a stressful job. The result was that her energy got channelled into herself, with unfortunate results.
SEP15	Eighty years after the Soviet invasion of Poland, the Western Left is still playing apologist for Russia	Eighty years ago today, Germany’s ambassador to Moscow formally requested that the USSR occupy the “sphere of interest” it had been allocated in Poland under the secret provisions of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. The German invasion, launched on September 1 1939, had gone well, the ambassador said. The Poles were in retreat. Now was the moment for the Soviets to “take a hand” and help their allies to “annihilate the remainder of the Polish Army”. Stalin needed no encouragement. On September 17, half a million Red Army troops, backed by 5,000 tanks and 2,000 combat aircraft, smashed their way into eastern Poland. Masters of dezinformatsiya, they initially spread the story that they were coming to help their brother Slavs. Some locals fell for it: the mayor of the little town of Złoczów welcomed a Soviet cavalry unit with the traditional gift of bread and salt. He was kicked to the ground and later executed. Other Poles – army officers, landowners, priests – were immediately marked for murder. In some villages, the Soviets lined men up and hauled away any whose hands they deemed too soft.  These events, recalled in a wonderful new history called First to Fight by Roger Moorhouse, are keenly remembered in Poland. They are remembered, too, in the other nations divvied up under the Nazi-Soviet Pact: Finland, the Baltic States and Romania. But they are largely forgotten in the West, and are more or less repressed in Russia, where polls show that most people think the Second World War began in June 1941 with Hitler’s invasion of the USSR.
SEP15	The right woodland can be glorious – but for that, we need to plant the right trees	Misleading headlines appeared in newspapers this week, claiming that global deforestation was increasing. In fact, the report on which these headlines were based reluctantly admits that net deforestation is actually decreasing, as more felling is offset by new forest being restored or planted.  In Britain this is especially true. A century ago, our island was less than 5 per cent woodland. Today woodland covers nearly three times as much land, at 13 per cent, and is probably almost as wooded as it was in mediaeval times. In this we are like other wealthy countries. Europe as a whole is steadily becoming more wooded. New England on the American east coast went from 30 per cent to 75 per cent woodland a little over a century, even as its population rapidly increased. Pressure groups like the Woodland Trust would like to see Britain still more heavily forested and complain that we are not planting enough trees every year. Maybe, but it is time to stop obsessing over the number of trees planted and start thinking about the quality, not the quantity, of our woodland.

SEP16	The West must unite to keep Iran under control	In a matter of minutes on Saturday, two major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia sustained crippling damage from drones, and perhaps cruise missiles as well. With the flow of five per cent of the world’s oil instantly halted, global oil prices have gyrated. As economists calculate the impact on the world economy, and arguments rage over who was responsible, it is worth making sure we understand what this reckless assault is telling us.  First, it is a reminder that the nature of warfare is changing. Saudi Arabia has powerful armed forces, a sophisticated air force and high-tech defences. It could easily fight off a large-scale attack by any state in the region. Yet drones are small enough to go undetected by those defences and can hit a target with sufficient accuracy to cause huge damage with a relatively limited payload.  This is only a foretaste of what will soon be possible. In the coming decades, the most valuable national assets of any country, from critical economic infrastructure to aircraft carriers, will be more vulnerable to a swarm of many, small but long-range precision devices, co-ordinating with each other by artificial intelligence, than to any conventional bombing campaign.
SEP16	Will the Liberal Democrats believe in democracy if Jo Swinson cancels Brexit?	Question: When is it perfectly all right to set aside a referendum result – as if it had never happened? Answer: When you’re a Liberal Democrat leader on the make and who’s getting carried away by a few defections, delusions of grandeur and dreams of Downing Street. That must be the explanation for Jo Swinson’s extraordinary decision to seek to invalidate the verdict of 17.5 million Britons in the EU referendum three-and-a-bit years ago … because there is no logic, whatsoever, in her folly.
SEP16	Brexit is inevitable. Remainers can delay it but they'll never stop it	Of the extracts from David Cameron’s memoirs that have been published in recent days, one phrase stands out above the rest: "Tory Psychodrama." It’s one of those curious little things you hear a lot now – an effort to paint the whole question of membership of the EU as some sort of irrational horror, played out entirely within the sphere of a small set of politicians. It is meant to discredit the referendum, those who pushed for it, and their reasons for doing so. To hear it come from the prime minister who actually gave the go-ahead for that referendum beggars belief. But not nearly as much as it does to hear the same prime minister suggest a second could be the answer, and that he might back Tory rebels seeking to overturn the first. That is not to say there has not been psychodrama in the party, though. The thing is, those to blame are not Eurosceptics, but Remainers like Cameron himself.
SEP16	Was Juncker trying to send a message by serving Boris snails and salmon?	Of all the news to have come out of Boris Johnson’s meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, by far the most interesting was their lunch menu. Between negotiations, we were told in advance, the pair were to dine on snails, salmon and cheese. Sounds like a Remainer’s dream feast. Perhaps that was why a more prosaic menu later emerged. But it raises some serious questions about diplomatic dining and the messages contained therein. Were the snails parsley-soused or garlic-buttered? The salmon cooked en-croute? And the chosen cheese an overripe Brie? Or (to acknowledge the PM’s rather French personal life) perhaps a cheeky chèvre? Either way, it’s not the first meal to have been couched in cleverly coded diplomacy. Indeed, these days, diplo-menus abound.
SEP16	Remainers' overwhelming allegiance to the EU cause has created our political crisis	It has long been apparent that the EU has eaten into the very soul of the British establishment – yet only now is it becoming clear just how bad things have got. For more than 40 years, this one-way process has gone on relentlessly as our political elite and professional bodies succumbed to political and financial inducements from Brussels, undermining our sense of nationhood and blurring the lines of accountability and loyalty. Up until now this has happened away from the public gaze, in the back rooms of power. For years the public could not see the extent of the conspiracy because, as the Tory MP and former chancellor Lord Thorneycroft put it of the European project: “The people must be led slowly and unconsciously into the abandonment of their traditional economic defences.”
SEP16	Was heckled Boris Johnson set up for a fall by EU chiefs in Luxembourg?	Did they do it on purpose? Was it a crafty plot, designed to embarrass Boris Johnson? It was hard to help wondering. Because when the Prime Minister visited Luxembourg on Monday, there was something very, very odd about the itinerary. First, Mr Johnson was invited for talks in a public place, a popular restaurant, with the inevitable result that protesters were waiting outside to heckle him. And then, bizarrely, he was expected to face a press conference not indoors, but outdoors, in a courtyard – mere feet from a large gate, where crowds of protesters could easily gather. And gather they duly did.  The protesters were anti-Brexit British expats. All knew about Mr Johnson’s upcoming press conference, and all were looking hungrily forward to letting him know precisely what they thought of him. While they waited, they warmed up by chanting “Stop the coup!”, hollering “Save us, Monsieur Barnier!”, and performing the EU anthem Ode to Joy on an impressive variety of musical instruments. 
SEP16	Could the Remainer luvvies who hijacked the Proms look any more out of touch?	On Saturday, many people around the country tuned into the Last Night of the Proms, hoping for a lovely evening of classical music and relaxation. But instead they discovered that the event had been hijacked by militant Remainers. As if these individuals hadn’t kicked up enough of a stink already, with the endless protests around London (where most of them live), they decided to ruin one of the UK’s most popular events. One that should remain free from Brexit and the worldview of the Southern elite.  A group called The EU Flags Proms Team was behind this disruption. Its members amassed 50,000 EU flags and handed them out to attendees. In between acts, Remainers paraded these - to the umbrage of much of the viewing public, many of whom do not have the convenience of proximity to BBC events to make their feelings known. Outside other Remainers walked around in t-shirts that read “Thank EU for the Music”. 
SEP16	The Brexit mess is not David Cameron's fault	When David Cameron led his party to an unexpected victory in 2015 – the first overall majority for the Conservatives in 23 years – he could not have foreseen the day, just four years down the line, when he would be the most hated man in Britain. Except that’s not quite accurate. He is certainly despised by all the right people – newspaper columnists and pro-Remain politicians. But you don’t have to dig very deeply to find the real reasons why the former prime minister is so hated: he lost. After all, no one criticises the late Harold Wilson for holding an In/Out referendum in 1975, predicated on precisely the same rationale as Cameron’s referendum: in order to hold his party together.  The difference is that in 1975, the “In” side won. In 2016, so confident were the Remain camp about their inevitable victory, their criticism of the actual decision to hold the referendum was muted. Not only muted – some of Cameron’s fiercest critics today were loudly banging the drum for an In/Out referendum even before Cameron unveiled his policy.
SEP16	I was wrong about Asian immigration, but don’t expect Philip Hammond to say he was also wrong about the consequences of a Brexit vote	It is not that often that I feel  I have to hold up my hand and confess to having been wrong, so enjoy this whilst you can.  Back in 1972 when Idi Amin expelled Uganda's Asians I argued that it would be best had they gone back to India where their roots lay, rather than coming here where their arrival might increase racial tensions and where they would simply not fit in to our society and be a burden on our economy. My colleague on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords, Lord Popat has recently published his memoirs of the expulsion of his family, their arrival here and his business and political career, entitled A British Subject.
SEP16	There is only one way Boris Johnson can avoid going down in history as a disastrous footnote to Theresa May	Boris Johnson yesterday gave a bizarre interview to the Mail on Sunday in which he compared himself to the Incredible Hulk - getting steadily stronger as he gets madder and madder in his attempts to leave the EU. That he feels obliged to offer reassurance by comparing himself to a green giant with communication and anger management issues speaks to the depths of his problem.  The Prime Minister today finds himself trapped in a potentially fatal political predicament of his own making – with no majority, and obliged to break his signature ‘do or die’ pledge. His only realistic route out is to push for a negotiated exit from the EU where the Government previously gave every impression of being prepared to crash out without a deal.  The Prime Minister’s situation is largely a result of the lack of seriousness with which his Government has so far gone about trying to negotiate a new deal, and its cavalier response to legitimate Parliamentary scrutiny. The Prime Minister has so far been unable to spell out what his alternative offer to the EU is, or to evidence any real progress in negotiations.
SEP17	Ultimate sovereign authority lies with the people, not Parliament	Which is sovereign, the people or Parliament? Is the Crown – ie the Government – entitled to interpret the wishes of the former and override the latter? Should the courts intervene in these arguments, something they have been reluctant to do since 1689? Such arcane questions, once the dusty preserve of academic jurists, are now central to our politics. The bedrock of the UK’s constitutional settlement, the separation of powers, has been shaken to its foundations by Brexit. There have been so many unprecedented political events since the referendum in 2016 that is easy to be blasé about the proceedings taking place in the Supreme Court. And yet this is arguably the most extraordinary moment of them all. Here are 11 judges sitting to decide whether the Queen was right to agree to the prorogation of Parliament or whether the advice she received from her Prime Minister was unlawful.
SEP17	The ultimate judge of Boris Johnson must be the court of public opinion	I met Clare at a Telegraph event and liked her immediately. She introduced herself as a solicitor who had voted Leave and was married to a judge. “Not many like me in my circle,” she laughed. Clare said she had kept quiet at many dinners where the judges present had expressed contempt for Brexit and for the “morons” who voted for it. It’s fair to say their Honours were aggrieved by the referendum result. “You see, they’ve always got what they wanted, their whole lives,” Clare explained, “and suddenly they didn’t get what they wanted.” She calls them The Three Quads. “They all went to public school. That’s Quad Number 1. Then they went to Oxbridge. Quad 2. Finally, the Inns of Court. Quad 3. Many of thems have never lived in the real world at all.”
SEP17	Trying to bring up a child as gender neutral is fighting the wrong battle entirely	Almost every parent I know frets, at some point, about the extent to which they are “gendering” their child. Little flutters of anxiety about dressing a male child in blue and a female in pink, or giving boys trains to play with and girls dolls. We roll our eyes at aisles in department stores that differentiate their aisle offerings between the two, and grit our teeth about the fact that you can now buy a globe for a girl where the sea is coloured pink.  That said, I know plenty of small boys who will spend hours happily playing with a toy kitchen, and little girls who refuse to wear pink and spend their lives in practical dungarees. Mostly, I think, the fact we worry about this stuff is a good thing: we’re wary of socialising our children in this way, and act to mitigate against it as much as we can. We’re all middle class parents; of course we do.  I have some sympathy, therefore, with the couple who are trying to bring up their 17-month old child in an entirely gender neutral manner, choosing to keep its sex a secret, referring to it by the pronoun “they” and dressing it in both girls’ and boys’ clothing. (And also some sympathy for the poor befuddled grandmother of said child, who has only just been let in on the secret in being allowed to change its’ nappy). 
SEP17	The smart meter fiasco shows what happens when ministers abandon common sense	Like one of the Soviets' five-year plans, grandiose promises have given way to failure How disappointing that the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has just announced that it is to delay until 2024 the rollout of electricity and gas “smart meters” in our homes. I was really looking forward to having a little meter in my living room that I can sit and watch when there’s nothing good on TV. I mean, other than by watching an electronic display as it adds up the pounds and pennies I have spent on electricity over the past 24 hours, how am I supposed to work out that I should go and switch off the light in the spare bedroom?
SEP17	Supreme Court prorogation hearing: Gina Miller's case gets traction as the Government has questions to answer	Last week the Scottish Court of Session in Edinburgh ruled that prorogation of the British Parliament was unlawful. However, courts in England and Northern Ireland have both decided that this is a political matter and not the place of the courts to intervene. It is now up to the Supreme Court to decide whether the five-week suspension of Parliament was lawful or whether it amounts to an abuse of prerogative power by the prime minister.   Day one of the hearing began with a submission from Lord Pannick QC, counsel for Gina Miller, in which he identified three arguments why the Supreme Court should not just hear this case, but why they should allow the appeal and uphold the judgment of the Scottish court.   First, Pannick targeted the motive for the prorogation and said that the prime minister opted for a five-week prorogation for the sole purpose of limiting Parliament’s opportunity to frustrate his government’s policies. Secondly, he argued that it is ‘elementary in public law’ that a prerogative power can only be used for a proper purpose and that evading parliamentary scrutiny was clearly an improper reason for prorogation. Thirdly, Pannick challenged the decision of the English High Court by arguing that the decision to prorogue was not subject to judicial review because he is not challenging the length of the prorogation, but rather the purpose for which it was being used.
SEP17	Jo Swinson told Lib Dem conference she can stop Brexit. Here’s the flaw in her plan	Party members clearly love the idea. Selling it to the wider public, though, might not be so easy. “Good morning, madam, I’m from the Lib Dems. May we count on your vote?” “Certainly not. You’ve said if you win you’ll cancel Brexit. That’s undemocratic.”
SEP17	By becoming extreme Remainiacs, the Lib Dems are only serving themselves	At my first ever Liberal Democrat conference in 2005 the biggest controversy was a policy pledge to replace antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) with acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs). Acronym substitution was precisely the kind of reasonable, technical, procedural proposal that Lib Dems did best. While Conservatives sipped champagne and Labour factions quarrelled, Charles Kennedy’s party indulged in hours of discussion about whether to take a separate vote on line 43 of a policy motion on the future of local government finance.  But Brexit has made radicals of us all. On the Right, the Conservatives have stopped listening to big business. On the Left, Jeremy Corbyn has abandoned a lifetime of straight talking about his policy beliefs. And in the centre, the Liberal Democrats have decided to stop giving a damn about the rules of our democracy, and start playing dirty like everyone else.  Gone is the alphabet soup of policy wonkery. Gone are the socks and the sandals. Now every second delegate is wearing a blue beret with yellow stars. T-shirts emblazoned with “Bollocks to Brexit" are everywhere. Even Steve, the anti-Brexit campaigner usually seen on College Green, was there in his finery.
SEP17	How I responded when an eight-year-old asked why I am ruining their future with Brexit	In his weekly diary, Bim Afolami reflects on life as a Conservative MP  Small children really do ask better questions than adults.  They are sharper. More direct. There is no obfuscation, no subtlety.  Recently I visited a small but perfectly formed primary school in Harpenden.  I was there to open a new entrance to the school – quite literally, a new door – giving more ammunition to some of my local critics who say that I will turn up to the opening of an envelope.  In any case, I thought my introduction was going perfectly well, until I looked out at the sea of little faces starting to fidget and yawn, and the adults at the back gazing up to the roof thinking about why they had given up a morning of work for this claptrap.  However, things livened up when I asked the pupils to ask me questions. First question – “Bim, why are you ruining my future by voting for Brexit?”.
SEP17	The EU's rigid attitude to Boris Johnson could yet lead to a no deal Brexit	Until yesterday, few people in Britain had heard of Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg’s Prime Minister, who gave Boris Johnson the ‘empty lectern’ treatment. In the view of some of Johnson’s Remainer critics, Mr Johnson got what he deserved as his host tore into Brexit. Others will be upset that a British Prime Minister could be treated in this way, regardless of how they see Johnson or the Brexit process. Even if other EU leaders have been tempted to do the same thing, they probably see it as bad diplomacy. As the Chairman of the German Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee put it, Bettel’s speech “did not serve the European cause. His public venting ignored that a deal is still in everyone’s interests”. In substance, Bettel did not say anything that contradicted the EU’s official position. Consistent with the recent remarks of other EU leaders, Luxembourg’s leader reminded everyone that Brexit was not the EU’s choice, and stated plainly that the EU27 would not accept the blame for a no deal Brexit.
SEP17	Jo Swinson's vow to revoke Article 50 is a tremendous own-goal	As an MP I would sometimes open a speech to Conservative Party supporters with a line invariably guaranteed to raise a titter: ”The Liberal Democrats are awfully difficult to hate. But it’s well worth the effort….” It’s pretty much the one bond which still links the Conservative grassroots with the Corbyn Labour Party – a visceral loathing of their local Lib Dem opponents, for many years acknowledged as the dirtiest street fighters in politics, belying their saintly and sanctimonious and always self-reverential image. That’s not to say they aren’t good at what they do. Yes, 2015 was a disastrous general election for them (as was 2017), and they have faced existential crises at various points in their history, in 1970, when they secured just six seats and during the messy amalgamation with the Owenite rump of the SDP in 1988. However, their tenacity and resilience and brilliance at hyper local campaigning via the Focus newsletter vehicle – pioneered in the 1960s in Liverpool - has always saved them from eclipse and extinction during periods of infighting and irrelevance, and specifically provided a foundation for success in Westminster elections. Quite simply, they outwork all other parties with a zealous commitment.
SEP18	We need a new Brexit constitution to replace the shattered old order	When the facts change, as Keynes put it, I change my mind. I’ve always been fiercely opposed to a written constitution: Britain has done brilliantly without one for hundreds of years, so why fix something that isn’t really broken? Why rip up the core of our political identity, unless one’s aim is to vandalise our institutions, risk undermining the monarchy and sever future generations’ connections to their past? The French and Americans have written constitutions, and that’s hardly worked out perfectly. But it is now clear that I was deluding myself: our once-great constitution is, to use a technical term, kaput. It is pathetic to pretend otherwise out of nostalgia. The debate is over: the old order no longer exists. It has been swept away by stronger forces that finally met their match in 2016. If we do leave the EU, Britain will have to reform and codify how we are governed, strictly protecting individual rights and liberties, while ensuring that democracy can no longer be routinely subverted by an arrogant, know-it-all elite. We may need a full-blown charter, or simply a series of fundamental laws, but the new constitutional settlement will require widespread public support. It will be a seminal moment in our nation’s history, and a key component of a rebooted, newly independent UK.
SEP18	Israel's political uncertainty is cause for concern in the unstable Middle East	At a time when tensions are running high in the Middle East over claims of Iranian involvement in the attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure, the inconclusive results from the latest Israeli general election must be a cause for serious concern for the Jewish state. The Iranian regime is regarded as an existential threat by the overwhelming majority of Israelis, and the fact that the election – the second in just six months – has ended in stalemate means that it is likely to be some time before a new government is formed. The result also raises questions about the future prospects of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who, having called the election after failing to secure sufficient seats in the previous poll in April, has not managed to break the deadlock.
SEP18	Euphoric Remainer snobbery has become a fanatical religion	If Brexit blew up the old world order, a new species of snob has been forged in its fuming embers. For evidence, look no further than the growing tribe of Lib Dem-defecting arch-Remainers. A few years ago, many were self-proclaimed sensible Blairite centrists, judiciously uninspired by politics and possessing no view whatsoever on the EU. But in the space of three years, their anti-Brexit beliefs have become radically spiritual. From their ecstasy in the exaltation that “people didn’t know what they voted for”, to their terrified delight in inhaling the smoky incense of an imminent no-deal “Armageddon”, hating Brexit – and Brexiteers – has become a religion.
SEP18	Captain Cook wasn't some 'barbarian' – he's a towering figure of history	Maori leaders who object to commemorating Cook's discovery of New Zealand are wrong to judge him by today's standards Captain James Cook is credited with having done more than any other explorer to fill the blanks on the world map. In the age of sail, this was a hard business, entailing years at sea, the ever-present danger of disease and the need to refit ships and restock provisions at little-known islands, often populated by hostile people. Such voyages were never going to be hands-across-the-ocean journeys of peace and love. Two hundred and fifty years later, the consequences are still controversial.  A trip around New Zealand by a replica of Cook’s ship HMS Endeavour, to mark the anniversary of his arrival, has been forced to alter its plans after Maori leaders objected to it docking in the village of Mangonui. Anahera Herbert-Graves, head of the Ngati Kahu tribe, called Cook a “barbarian” and said: “Wherever he went, like most people of the time of imperial expansion, there were murders, there were abductions, there were rapes and just a lot of bad outcomes for the indigenous people.”
SEP18	The Government's Supreme Court prorogation fightback was effective, but the missing witness statement rankled	Day 2 of the Prorogation Case in the Supreme Court commenced with an opportunity for the government to put its case. Sir James Eadie QC, representing the government and described on the Blackstones Chambers website as ‘the QC to whom the Government turn first for their major pieces of advice and litigation’ set out why the prorogation is lawful.   Eadie’s primary task was to represent the government at the Supreme Court. However, his arguments should also be seen in a broader political and public context which went beyond the courtroom. In seeking to rebut the arguments that the prorogation was unlawful, because it was motivated by an intention to prevent scrutiny of the executive for five weeks, Eadie was implicitly defending the character and integrity of the Prime Minister.  On the legal issue of justiciability, the crux is the constitutional question concerning the relationship between Parliament, the executive and the courts. Where should the line be drawn that determines whether a decision by government to prorogue Parliament is a matter of politics, not law, and therefore not subject to judicial review? Eadie explained that Parliament has passed some legislation on prorogation, but in areas where there is no legislation, the prerogative remains. 
SEP18	Lieberman's momentous decision spells the beginning of the end for the Netanyahu era	The Likud leader is heading for a criminal trial after his maverick former ally decided to take him down Benjamin Netanyahu used to be a winner. In July he became Israel’s longest serving Prime Minister, breaking David Ben Gurion’s record. But after ten years in office, his right-wing and ultra-orthodox coalition has fallen apart. When the results of April’s election were announced, it looked like Netanyahu would be able to recreate his previous coalition and sail past the magic 61 seats required to form a Government in Israel’s 120 member Knesset. But Avigdor Lieberman had other ideas. The maverick, right-wing, fiercely secular politician has been a cabinet minister in every Government for the last 18 years. His first job in politics was to look after an ambitious young politician called Benjamin Netanyahu, later serving as his Chief of Staff. The two men have a long, complex history together.
SEP18	Labour insiders are rightfully angry about the admission of Salma Yaqoob – but for all the wrong reasons	Tom Watson's choice of criticism betrays his party's painfully skewed priorities The loving, happy family that is the Labour Party is having another one of its tiffs this week. Fresh from the NEC's decision to wind up the Labour Students group on the basis that it is terminally moderate and not at all pro-Jeremy Corbyn, another spat has emerged - this time between deputy leader Tom Watson and Jon Lansman, founder of Momentum and a strong Corbyn supporter. 
SEP18	Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party wreaked havoc in Strasbourg – and left the EU fuming	They’re smart, the Brexit Party. To the untrained eye, their behaviour in the European Parliament on Wednesday might have looked boorish and mindless. Personally, though, I’m convinced it was all part of a cunning plan. Namely: to make the EU so heartily sick of us that they reject any request to delay Brexit, and just kick us out, instead. It might well work, too. Plenty in the EU seem to have already lost patience with Brexit – strikingly few MEPs turned up for Wednesday's four-hour debate on it in Strasbourg. And of those who did turn up, many sounded deeply long-suffering.
SEP18	Prorogation may have been ill-advised, but that does not make it unlawful	Should the Supreme Court declare the advice by the Prime Minister to the Queen to prorogue Parliament unlawful? In my view no. The prorogation power, although politically misused in this case, falls within the exclusive purview of Parliament. For courts to rule on its exercise would lead them into the exclusive jurisdiction of Westminster, interfering in the deep political relationship between Crown and Parliament that is the fundamental hallmark of our system of government.  At the heart of this case is a misconception regarding the nature of the British constitution. The issue is frequently presented as a battle between the Crown (as government) on the one hand and Parliament as law-maker on the other. In fact, the British constitution has no such separation of executive and legislative powers.
SEP19	David Cameron has unwittingly written the best ever case for Brexit	The former PM expected diplomacy from the EU but found a bureaucratic Death Star incapable of reform If you voted for Brexit, your optimism might be wavering right now. I can propose just the remedy: David Cameron’s memoir. It is, unintentionally, the most convincing case for Brexit that you will ever read. For The Record was written as political tragedy, a 700-page apology to the nation for the former prime minister’s role in what he regards as a calamity.
SEP19	Jacob Rees-Mogg knows the only way to deliver Brexit is with a clean break, not another fudged deal	I like Jacob Rees-Mogg and believe that many people underestimate his commitment to public life. But I was dismayed when I read in the Daily Telegraph his plea to wavering Conservative Party voters to return to the fold. His view is that a vote for the Brexit Party would be, in his words, “a vote, effectively, for Jeremy Corbyn.” This is nonsense. By peddling this line, Rees-Mogg is merely echoing what a lot of Tories are saying at the moment: that Britain is going to leave the EU ‪on October 31‬ and there is nothing to worry about. I find this optimism premature. The Conservatives have a long history of saying one thing and doing another when it comes to the EU. Think back to the 2001 general election when then-leader William Hague said: “If you believe in an independent Britain, then come with me, and I will give you back your country." Granted, Labour won that election, denying Hague the chance to put his vision into practice, but 15 years later Hague backed Remain in the referendum!
SEP19	David Cameron's lazy admission about the Queen and Scottish independence will do lasting damage to national unity	Her Majesty's role is worth more than an uptick in book sales to a former PM On her 21st birthday, the Queen spoke to the peoples of the Commonwealth as a young Princess with a long life ahead of her. Uttering a simple phrase that epitomised a reign that would see Britain and the Commonwealth prosper and become a more powerful influence for good in the world, she promised her rule would be governed by the motto "I serve". With this maxim, she dedicated her entire life to public service - though she said that she would not have the strength to carry out this resolution alone unless we joined her in it.  Could there be a more powerful reminder that our political masters have forgotten the words of the young princess than David Cameron’s admission that he sought the Queen's help ahead of the Scottish independence referendum? Not only was this a crass and short-termist attempt to flog his memoir, it carries worrying implications for the future. 
SEP19	Labour's war on private schools is an attack on aspiration	Labour has declared war on independent education. But the “Abolish Eton” group, which shadow chancellor John McDonnell has thrown his weight behind, is not only seeking to close every private school in the country (rather than solely Eton, as its name suggests). It also wants to abolish the freedom of parents to choose the school their child is educated in, contrary to the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Most of all, it seeks to punish parents for being aspirational, despite the clear evidence that lack of aspiration is what condemns so many schools, and children, to mediocrity. Evidence, however, rarely seems to matter to ideologues. Never mind that abolition would cost a cash-starved state sector £416 million or that independent schools save the country £3.5 billion a year. Abolishing independent schools would not improve under-performing state schools. Aspirational parents with money would buy houses in the catchment areas of good state schools.
SEP19	Sir John Major stole the Supreme Court show with his blistering broadside against Boris Johnson	After two days of intense argument over the government’s motives behind the prorogation, the final day of the hearing was set aside for interventions by other ‘interested’ parties and responses by Lords Pannick and Keen.  Star billing undoubtedly went to the intervention by Sir John Major in support of Gina Miller’s action. Major did not address the Supreme Court himself – as appeal courts do not hear from witnesses – but Lord Garnier, the former Solicitor General, made the submission on his behalf. Sir John Major’s intervention did not add anything new of substance to the legal arguments that the five week prorogation is unlawful and excessive. However, the intervention was perhaps more eagerly awaited as it would bring the Conservative Party’s thirty-year melodrama over the UK’s relationship with the EU before the UK’s highest court.
SEP19	How much damage could the Supreme Court do to Boris Johnson's Brexit plans?	At last, the Supreme Court has received an answer to a question that had been increasingly vexing its members: what would the Government do if it loses this week's prorogation challenge? The response has been distinctly chilly, with judges urged not to outlaw prorogation and order an early recall of Parliament due to the “very serious practical consequences” in organising a Queen’s Speech at short notice. Representing the government in court this afternoon, Lord Keen warned that Gina Miller, Joanna Cherry and her fellow litigants were "inviting the Courts into forbidden territory and an ill-defined minefield" by making such demands.  Last night, Jacob Rees-Mogg sought to unpick one of the key arguments put by those like Lord Pannick who have wanted the Supreme Court to weigh in on prorogation, namely the fear that failing to intervene would free the Government to prorogue Parliament again after the Queen's Speech. "I don’t think that would be a constitutional approach,” the leader of the House told Telegraph subscribers.
SEP19	Poor old David Cameron. Suddenly he seems like a relic of a forgotten age	It’s only three years since David Cameron resigned as prime minister, yet it feels like so much longer. Decades longer. Already he seems a relic of a distant age. Seeing him on TV again has been almost eerie. It’s as if the presenter has just said, “Coming up after the break, we’ll be chatting to Harold Macmillan”, or, “Call in now to put your question to the ghost of Anthony Eden.” Today Mr Cameron, accompanied by his wife Samantha, went on ITV’s This Morning, to tell Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby about his memoirs. Straight away you could sense that this wasn’t entirely the David Cameron we used to know. There was something missing. His voice sounded the same – polished, patrician, smooth as a limo – but the old bounce, the old pink-cheeked get-up-and-go, wasn’t quite there. Instead, he looked worn, deflated, and slightly faded, like a forgotten party balloon. Gamely he trudged his way through the questions about Brexit (“Well” – sigh – “it was a huge decision…”), while Samantha perched by his side, nodding earnestly. It wasn’t immediately clear why she was there, given that the memoirs under discussion weren’t hers. But presumably the producers had decided that This Morning’s viewers weren’t all that interested in boring old politics, because she was soon roped in to answer questions about how the children were getting on, and whether she felt protective of her husband (answer: yes), and what he was like around the house (“brilliant with the kids”). Perking up, Mr Cameron chimed in that he loves helping the children with their homework: apparently he finds the maths and science “a bit testing”, but he’s good at “putting in commas”.
SEP19	What it would take for me to rejoin the Tory Party	Last night, speaking to a live Telegraph audience, my brother Jacob said he would like me to return to the Conservative Party.  Would I do it? Well, that depends on Brexit.  Admittedly, there are reasons to be more optimistic about the state of the Tories right now. The removal of the whip from the 21 MPs who voted against the Prime Minister, and a no-deal Brexit, was absolutely the right call, and reassured Brexiteers like myself that things were changing. These were all people who had gone against their own manifesto, and deserved the consequences. 
SEP19	The 'grey man' has seen red over Brexit, but we shouldn't expect any less from hot-headed John Major	It was Edwina Currie who revealed the hitherto unappreciated levels of emotion which dwell within the soul of Sir John Major. Her 2002 revelations about the passionate affair they enjoyed nearly 20 years earlier captivated and titillated the nation precisely because they seemed to belie the image of the man we all felt we knew: sensible, steady; above all, grey. This was the Prime Minister of the Cones Hotline and humble soap box, warm beer and cycling old maids, the cricket-loving politician with an aptly-named wife called Norma, who ate his peas with relish and yanked his Y-fronts up to his midriff. Yet as we are discovering from the ardour with which Sir John has launched into battle at the Supreme Court, the man that Mrs Currie knew is perhaps the true reflection of the politician who ruled over us for seven years without, it seems, ever truly allowing us a sign of his true character.
SEP19	Why stop at Clause 4? If Corbyn is going to dump Blair's legacy, he might as well promise a full socialist utopia	It was always going to be an easy target once the hard Left took over. Clause IV, over which so many battles have been fought in the Labour Party’s history, is to be reviewed. Again. Older readers will just about recall Tony Blair’s successful attempt to persuade his party, shortly after he became leader in 1994, to ditch the previous version that had been part of the rulebook since 1918: “To secure for the workers, by hand or by brain, the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.” And breathe. Just rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it? Still, I’m sure the focus groups at the end of World War I liked it. 
SEP20	Menopause is a natural experience – women shouldn’t have to suffer in silence	Most women will go through the menopause at some point in their life. Yet, similarly to menstruation, there is a stigma around talking about this natural part of ageing. Why should women feel ashamed to talk about this? And why should they have to quietly suffer when struggling with the ongoing symptoms associated with it? While some women may experience mild symptoms, this varies between individuals. From physical symptoms such as hot flushes, headaches, and night sweats to unseen symptoms such as low moods, anxiety, and difficulties with memory and concentration. These can last on and off for months and even years – with 10 per cent of women experiencing symptoms for up to 12 years. The effects can be extremely distressing. About 25 per cent of women experience such severe symptoms that they can be diagnosed with mental health problems and the highest prevalence for suicide among women is between the ages of 50-54 (around the age most will experience menopause).
SEP20	With John Humphrys gone, who at the BBC will take the side of the listeners?	John Humphrys retired from the Today programme on Thursday after a 32-year reign which stretches back to the Thatcher years. On his last day, he was feted by colleagues and celebrities from Tony Blair to Dame Edna Everage. The praise was justified, but most of it picked the wrong point. Humphrys was lauded for his fearless grilling of the powerful. He is undoubtedly very good at this, but so are a great many others. Surely what makes him so unusual in the BBC is on whose behalf he seeks to act. The late Kingsley Amis used to say that the besetting sin of journalists, broadcasters and even creative writers was to shape and rate their own work by “how it went down at the club”. He meant that they cherished the esteem of their fellows more than the needs and views of the public.
SEP20	Boris knows he needs to win the Brexit blame game	It’s become a Tory article of faith: “Extension means extinction.” In other words, if Boris Johnson can’t get Britain out of the EU on Hallowe’en as promised, he and his party are finished. Is he, though? These days, every time we start banking on a political certainty, it soon after morphs or crumbles. And Mr Johnson is determined to stage his own extinction rebellion. There are several stages to that rebellion. The first is to see if he can slither, Houdini-like, out of the chains Parliament has wrapped him in. The mood on that is not hopeful. Even if the Supreme Court sides with the Government on prorogation, the law requiring him to ask the EU for an extension has been tightly drafted and any attempt to undermine its effect is likely to be illegal. Dominic Raab might talk about “testing the law” and Mr Johnson might talk about ditches and Hulks, but legally, it looks like MPs have the Prime Minister snared.
SEP20	Our children deserve better than Extinction Rebellion's dangerous fantasies. Sadly their teachers are encouraging them	Teachers should not be regurgitating XR’s doomsday narrative to fearful youngsters One of the strangest anomalies in our already bizarre politics has been the implosion of the established order. Unexpected coalitions are emerging from the Brexit realignment. Rock stars and “edgy” comedians now stand shoulder to shoulder with Goldman Sachs executives and Tony Blair. The Conservative Party – the spiritual home of agas, doilies, golf clubs and quiche – finds itself in opposition to Parliament and other ‘august’ British institutions. And today came the alarming sight of teachers and parents encouraging their charges to skive off school to join the latest round of Extinction Rebellion protests.  Many teachers, usually so quick to penalise parents for pupil absences, have wholeheartedly embraced this brand of uncompromising environmentalism – and the disruption to school ritual. Helpfully, the National Education Union furnished its members with a list of ideas to engage students, such as “Drop the curriculum for the day” or “Send a delegation” to the strikes. 
SEP20	The climate strikers' hard-Left agenda would only make things worse	“Hey hey! Ho ho! Climate change has got to go!” The teenagers I passed in Westminster yesterday were certainly having a good time – joining hundreds camped out in Parliament Square, and thousands more climate strikers bunking off from school. These protesters are decent, compassionate people. Their cause is righteous. But the movement they are supporting is built around some profoundly damaging ideas. On the Global Climate Strike website, the official demands include “stop burning fossil fuels and ensure a rapid energy revolution with equity, reparations, and climate justice at its heart”. Follow the link on “climate justice”, and you end up on another site listing “The People’s Demands” – the people, in this case, being an assortment of Left-wing groups. So what are their demands? 
SEP20	The success of Brexit Britain has left Project Fear on its deathbed	The only weapon in the Remain camp’s armoury was Project Fear. It was first launched to suggest that a simple vote to leave the EU would result in an instant deep recession with the loss of a million jobs and potentially a run on the banks. Well, that theory was virtually instantly debunked. The UK ended 2016 as the fastest growing economy in the G7. Since then the UK economy has gone from strength to strength. Far from a million jobs being lost, a million jobs have been created. Unemployment is at an all-time low and wage growth has finally begun to establish itself. 
SEP20	There's an easy way to slash your environmental impact: go vegan	Across the UK and beyond images of gratuitous animal cruelty are pushing more people to embrace the benefits of a plant-based diet. Orders of vegan meals grew by some 388 per cent between 2016 and 2018 and they are now the UK’s fastest-growing takeaway choice. A quarter of Britons are set to be vegan or vegetarian by 2025.  Despite real progress, we remain a million miles away from where we need to be. Our collective failure to radically reduce our intake of meat and dairy products is having a ruinous effect on both animal welfare and our natural environment. From the exacerbation of runaway climate change to the withering of our most vulnerable species, livestock farming is driving forward the unprecedented destruction of our natural world.  The world’s top three meat firms emit more greenhouse gases each year than all of France. Emissions from livestock increased globally by more than half from 1961 to 2010 because of increased demand for animal foods. And some 25 per cent of all global greenhouse emissions came from agriculture, with livestock production contributing about 80 per cent of that.
SEP20	Anyone who wants to delay Brexit cannot have the best interests of Europe at heart	Every day, I am bemused by the activities of the assorted groups of UK parliamentarians; especially those pursuing a 2nd referendum, a Brexit extension or trying to revoke Article 50. I hear their arguments and I read their opinion pieces, and I become ever-increasingly convinced that they do not understand democracy or how much they are hurting the UK. The howls of outrage at the time of prorogation from politicians and commentators were out of all proportion and have since largely disappeared. This is because Parliament has only lost the equivalent to 4 days of sitting time due to prorogation, when the time needed for the conference recess is factored in. It also cannot be forgotten that Parliament is not responsible for Brexit negotiations, merely approval and scrutiny, which it has failed to do effectively over the last three years.
SEP20	Diary of a reluctant MEP: Why is it so much easier to get a free cocktail than a chance to speak in the Chamber?	In his EU diary, direct from the heart of Brussels, Brexit Party MEP John Longworth reflects on the absurdities of life in the European Parliament This week I returned to sunny Strasbourg – after the long summer break the EU Parliament has resumed. I suppose the origins of the word “Parliament” suggest a talking shop. In the case of this particular one, however, even the talking is restricted. On two days your well-paid envoys turned up to vote for just twenty minutes as the vice presidents in charge rushed through the rubber stamping, interspersed with bouts of virtue signalling – most often speeches and motions by MEPs doffing their caps to their paymasters. 
SEP20	The biggest obstacle to a workable backstop alternative lies not in the EU, but the UK	The Prime Minister was set a 30 Day Challenge to produce an alternative to the backstop. If he is going to convince the heavyweights in Brussels that he has alternative arrangements ready to roll, then he is going to have to get serious with the technicalities. In managing any state border, there are three principles in play. One: we know what is crossing the border. Two: we know that it meets the criteria for doing so. Three: we can prevent entry/exit if needs be. In order to understand (and, perhaps, to resolve) the post-Brexit Irish border conundrum, it is helpful to conceive the challenge in these terms. The reason why the backstop is anathema for many is because it keeps the UK (specifically, Northern Ireland) and the EU closely aligned in certain ways. This is in order to use what might be seen as the ‘master key’ of border management, and the one that the process of European integration is built on. That is: it make it possible to assume that everything that crosses the border meets the criteria for doing so. This is the backstop: what is crossing from Northern Ireland into Ireland (and thus the Single Market) complies with the EU’s rules. Thus, there is simply no need for a hard border.  
SEP21	Global Britain is leading the world as a force for good	This week, I will join the Prime Minister in New York, where he is leading the UK delegation to the United Nations’ annual General Assembly. As we make progress in our Brexit negotiations, we are also taking our vision of a truly Global Britain to the UN – leading by example as a force for good in the world. The Government is making progress on Brexit negotiations, with the European Commission President, Jean‑Claude Juncker, stating plainly “I think we can have a deal”. Meanwhile, Liz Truss, the Trade Secretary, has been in Tokyo, paving the way for a free-trade deal with Japan and the wider Asia‑Pacific region. We want to be good European neighbours and buccaneering global free traders. But Global Britain is about more than Brexit or even free trade, important though they are. Under Boris Johnson, we intend to reinforce Britain’s role in the world as a good global citizen – and the UN is a great place to start.
SEP21	Extreme feminists are big girl's blouses if they think being called a wench is sexist	I’ve considered myself an extreme feminist since I was 12, so when I see someone being even more extreme than me, I feel a momentary flash of territorial resentment. I’ve noticed over the years that these occasions usually involve language and if there’s anything I am more than a Humourless Women’s Libber, it’s a writer. Do any damage to the English language – even in the name of feminism – and I may well snub you when next we meet. In the past, I’ve winced at “wimmin” and chided “chairperson”; now the motherlode has arrived, a petition with 30,000 signatures requesting that the Oxford University Press removes a wagonload of synonyms for “woman” from its dictionary, which the petition’s proud owner, PR consultant Maria Beatrice Giovanardi, considers sexist. I’m not going to make cheap jokes about the suitability of those in PR to be the guardians of our exquisite and ancient tongue. (Even if they are the only people in the world who ceaselessly “reach out” more than the Four Tops did.) But I must say that I find many of the “objectionable” names – wench, bird, filly – rather cheery; my grandmother used to call me “my wench” when I was a child, in the old West Country way, though I definitely grew up to be a “broad”. And why deny oneself the rare pleasure of being labelled a “besom” or a “demoiselle”? Because “these examples show women as sex objects, subordinate, and/or an irritation to men”, apparently.
SEP21	The unprecedented intimidation tactics of the ultra-Remainers are damaging our democracy	The prime minister is addressing the country from a podium outside his official residence. Around 30 yards away, a few dozen people scream and bellow continuously in order to drown out his words. The citizenry watching on television at home is scarcely able to hear what he is saying. They are intended to believe, from the level of noise, that the crowd outside the gates at Downing Street somehow represents the overwhelming judgment of the populace. (Television camera shots relayed later make it clear how small the noisy demonstration actually was.) Visiting an EU capital, the British prime minister cancels a planned outdoor press conference which has been made farcically impossible by around 70 people who scream, bellow, blow whistles and sing to drown out any words he may have chosen to speak. At Conservative Party conferences, small mobs of “protesters” gather to shout and spit at anyone entering the conference hall (with no allowances made for the fact they might be hired technicians, unaffiliated lobbyists or journalists). Stationing themselves permanently at the barrier to the conference entrance, they scream obscenities, bang drums and blow ear-splitting whistles in order to sabotage whatever gatherings or broadcast interviews may be taking place around the hall.
SEP21	The Remainer elite is laughing in the face of our history	Trying to beat the Brexit blues, I travelled north to Bishop Auckland, County Durham, to see Kynren. This spectacular open-air pageant, celebrating 2,000 years of history, has castles and ships arising magically from a lake, dozens of horses, flocks of sheep, innumerable geese and a cast of 1,400 local volunteer actors, including scores of children. And audiences of up to 8,000 a night. Kynren (an Anglo-Saxon word for kinship) is a loving musical celebration of “this blessed plot” (especially its north-east), its Christian heritage and its throne of kings. I have never seen anything like it. It starts with Joseph of Arimathea, takes in the Romans, the Vikings, William the Conqueror, Shakespeare and Queen Bess, the Civil War, the coming of the steam engine (a large train puffs along the huge grass stage) and Queen Victoria. German and British soldiers play football in No Man’s Land at Christmas 1914 – to applause from the audience. Churchill exhorts us on to victory in 1940 and the pageant finally praises the arrival of the Windrush generation.
SEP21	We must challenge the intellectuals attacking meritocracy	I never read the Hornblower books, but I did watch the television series made in the Nineties. Horatio Hornblower, for the uninitiated, is a character invented by C S Forester: a dashing British naval officer during the Napoleonic wars who works his way up the ranks through his great successes at sea, despite his humble background. It turns out that his story is even more improbable than its many adventurous plotlines suggest. Two economists recently published a study of patronage in the Royal Navy during the age of sail. They were interested in whether young officers who had some kind of nepotistic or social connection to senior navy types performed worse or better in battle than their unconnected peers. To their surprise, the well-connected officers performed markedly better, even when they controlled for type of ship or military encounter. They captured an average of two or three enemy ships a year, versus one or two for their low-born counterparts, and were significantly less likely to withdraw from battle before the bitter end. A purely meritocratic system, they concluded, would not have produced so many successes.
SEP21	Life lessons in schools shouldn’t stop at stand-up comedy	Sheffield High School for Girls is adding comedy to their curriculum What lesson prepares young people better for adult life: home economics or being hilarious? Sheffield High School for Girls is set on the latter, judging by the introduction of stand-up comedy to their curriculum. This won’t encourage pupils to clown around, the school says, but rather help them to hone key skills such as dealing with naysayers and boosting confidence; two things they will need on performing their routines to fellow students come the end of their eight-week course.
SEP21	Menopause is a natural experience – women shouldn’t have to suffer in silence	Most women will go through the menopause at some point in their life. Yet, similarly to menstruation, there is a stigma around talking about this natural part of ageing. Why should women feel ashamed to talk about this? And why should they have to quietly suffer when struggling with the ongoing symptoms associated with it? While some women may experience mild symptoms, this varies between individuals. From physical symptoms such as hot flushes, headaches, and night sweats to unseen symptoms such as low moods, anxiety, and difficulties with memory and concentration. These can last on and off for months and even years – with 10 per cent of women experiencing symptoms for up to 12 years. The effects can be extremely distressing. About 25 per cent of women experience such severe symptoms that they can be diagnosed with mental health problems and the highest prevalence for suicide among women is between the ages of 50-54 (around the age most will experience menopause).
SEP21	With John Humphrys gone, who at the BBC will take the side of the listeners?	John Humphrys retired from the Today programme on Thursday after a 32-year reign which stretches back to the Thatcher years. On his last day, he was feted by colleagues and celebrities from Tony Blair to Dame Edna Everage. The praise was justified, but most of it picked the wrong point. Humphrys was lauded for his fearless grilling of the powerful. He is undoubtedly very good at this, but so are a great many others. Surely what makes him so unusual in the BBC is on whose behalf he seeks to act. The late Kingsley Amis used to say that the besetting sin of journalists, broadcasters and even creative writers was to shape and rate their own work by “how it went down at the club”. He meant that they cherished the esteem of their fellows more than the needs and views of the public.
SEP21	Boris knows he needs to win the Brexit blame game	It’s become a Tory article of faith: “Extension means extinction.” In other words, if Boris Johnson can’t get Britain out of the EU on Hallowe’en as promised, he and his party are finished. Is he, though? These days, every time we start banking on a political certainty, it soon after morphs or crumbles. And Mr Johnson is determined to stage his own extinction rebellion. There are several stages to that rebellion. The first is to see if he can slither, Houdini-like, out of the chains Parliament has wrapped him in. The mood on that is not hopeful. Even if the Supreme Court sides with the Government on prorogation, the law requiring him to ask the EU for an extension has been tightly drafted and any attempt to undermine its effect is likely to be illegal. Dominic Raab might talk about “testing the law” and Mr Johnson might talk about ditches and Hulks, but legally, it looks like MPs have the Prime Minister snared.
SEP21	Our children deserve better than Extinction Rebellion's dangerous fantasies. Sadly their teachers are encouraging them	Teachers should not be regurgitating XR’s doomsday narrative to fearful youngsters One of the strangest anomalies in our already bizarre politics has been the implosion of the established order. Unexpected coalitions are emerging from the Brexit realignment. Rock stars and “edgy” comedians now stand shoulder to shoulder with Goldman Sachs executives and Tony Blair. The Conservative Party – the spiritual home of agas, doilies, golf clubs and quiche – finds itself in opposition to Parliament and other ‘august’ British institutions. And today came the alarming sight of teachers and parents encouraging their charges to skive off school to join the latest round of Extinction Rebellion protests.  Many teachers, usually so quick to penalise parents for pupil absences, have wholeheartedly embraced this brand of uncompromising environmentalism – and the disruption to school ritual. Helpfully, the National Education Union furnished its members with a list of ideas to engage students, such as “Drop the curriculum for the day” or “Send a delegation” to the strikes. 
SEP22	These days, forgiveness seems to be the hardest word	As social media makes our lives more public, the consequences of misdeeds become ever-more grievous and long-lasting In the days when Graham Norton was the Telegraph’s Agony Uncle, his column was the first thing I used to turn to on Saturdays. Kind, clever and bracing, he sounded like the godparent you longed for during the more troublesome passages of adolescence. Now he’s at it again, sharing his thoughts on mistakes, forgiveness and social media with the readers of Woman’s Weekly. Discussing the case of Kevin Hart, the US comedian who renounced his role as host of this year’s Oscars after accusations of past homophobia, Norton said: “Everyone should have the opportunity to say, ‘I regret that, and would I do it now? No.’ ”
SEP22	Sacred Mysteries: Cathedral of Crystal – one careful owner	This summer, the Crystal Cathedral in Orange County, California, built for a Protestant televangelist, has been reopened as a Catholic cathedral. The Rev Robert Schuller, who excelled as a preacher in his own version of the Dutch Reformed Church, built the church to the design of the Postmodernist architect Philip Johnson. Schuller had attracted auditors not only on television but also by inviting folk to drive-in services. “Come as you are in the family car,” his slogan went. Some sat in the car in the parking lot, others thronged the Crystal Cathedral. Schuller had insisted the walls and ceiling be glass. This, I feel, was an error in a place with 278 sunny days a year. Inside, despite a convection cooling system, temperatures often exceeded 100F.
SEP22	Jeremy Corbyn has never liked being questioned. But this time he sounded like a sulky teenager	Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t seem to like journalists asking him questions. He always sounds so angry. Not in a loud, macho, aggressive kind of way. Just crabby, cranky, resentful. As if he’s been shaken abruptly awake, and is now sitting up, blinking irritably, and wondering what on earth is going on. Why are all these people pointing TV cameras at him? Who is this silly man in a suit, pestering him to talk about Brexit and Tom Watson? Why can’t everyone leave him alone, and let him go back to bed? On Sunday, live from Labour party conference in Brighton, Mr Corbyn was interviewed by the BBC’s Andrew Marr. Even by the Labour leader’s formidable standards, it was a performance of outstanding huffiness. Half an hour solid of sighing, snapping and sourness.  He didn’t like being asked about the plot to oust Mr Watson as deputy leader (“I’m not all-seeing and all-knowing!”). He didn’t like being asked about the mysterious resignation of his key adviser Andrew Fisher (“I don’t know what you’re leading up to here!”). And he especially didn’t like being asked about the rumour he’s going to step down as leader (“It’s wishful thinking by some people! Probably yourself!”). 
SEP22	Macron's approach to migration is a masterclass in hypocrisy	The EU uses the weaker economies of member states to prop up the liberal ideals of wealthier members Tomorrow, the EU is expected to broker an agreement on the relocation of asylum seekers arriving in Italy and Malta. The deal is a clear attempt by the EU to reward Italy’s electorate following the departure of nationalist leader Matteo Salvini in favour of a more Europhile government. But will it go far enough? Italian voters have seen first-hand the way in which France, in particular, has paid lip service to the idea of open borders, while quietly hardening its own. Time and again Macron has shown deep levels of hypocrisy towards Italy - he has berated the electorate for embracing a populist leader with a firm stance on immigration and yet resisted migrant quotas of his own.
SEP22	Of course Labour wants to abolish Ofsted. How else could they cover up their disastrous education policies?	The real losers in this new regime will be parents News that the Labour Party wants to abolish Ofsted should not come as a surprise. It’s a world-class inspectorate that provides parents with a reliable, independent guide to their local schools and a detailed, annual report to Parliament on the quality of England’s education system. Labour knows that its wholesale reversal of the Conservative education reforms will have a catastrophic impact on school standards and is already taking steps to cover that up. Angela Rayner’s attempt to dress this up as a ‘win’ for teachers is laughable. The average English school has the Ofsted inspectors in for two days once every four years. If Rayner believes that places an unbearable burden on teachers, she should try taking a set four GCSE French class on a Friday afternoon.
SEP22	Have the Lib Dems made a strategic blunder in their extreme positioning on Brexit?	Lib Dem MEPs have written to Jean-Claude Juncker urging him not to do a deal with Boris Johnson Earlier this week, it emerged that Liberal Democrat MEPs have written to Jean-Claude Juncker urging him not to do a deal with Boris Johnson. We can all imagine why these MEPs might want to prevent the two sides reaching an agreement: for a start they would lose their jobs, chauffeur-driven cars in Brussels and generous MEP expense accounts almost overnight. Were the UK and EU to agree an amicable separation, the Lib Dems would lose much of their raison d’être. There won’t be much point in a party that defines itself as being in favour of Brussels after we’ve left.
SEP22	I’m sick of explaining the real Brexit story to ill-informed foreigners	Vanishingly few outside these islands have ever been exposed to the Leave point of view. “You Brits are crazy!” I’d only been in America for half an hour, but the conversation with my cab driver had already turned to Brexit. “Why do you say that?”, I asked, genuinely curious. He paused for a few seconds, obviously thinking hard. And then, finally, he gave me his answer: “Well, that’s what I read”. It’s a privilege to travel a lot for work, and it seems spoiled to complain. But wherever I go – from the Middle East, to the US, Asia and, of course, throughout the EU – people overwhelmingly parrot the narrative peddled by Remainers: that Brexit is a catastrophic own goal, that Boris Johnson is an "Anglo-Trump", that Britain is somehow “withdrawing from the world”.
SEP22	If Supreme Court judges stray into politics, they should expect to be scrutinised like politicians	In the first of Lord Sumption’s Reith Lectures last June, the former Supreme Court judge argued that “law penetrates every area of human life” as never before, not least because of government’s desire to regulate. Asserting that “judges are intellectually honest, by and large”, he added that “as politics has lost its prestige, judges have been ready to fill the gap”. He appeared to be making a case for judges – whom he described as “intelligent, reflective and articulate people” – to encroach upon the deliberative function of politicians who, perhaps by implication, have none of those admirable qualities. This overlooked the fact that politicians are elected, whereas judges are not: a fundamental consideration, one might think, if judges are to take increasingly political decisions. One area of human life the law may be shortly to penetrate is the relationship, in a constitutional monarchy, between the Queen and her prime minister. Lord Sumption must regret he retired from the Supreme Court before the present case against the Government – defined by its president, Lady Hale, “as being about the lawfulness of the Prime Minister’s decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament on the dates in question”. For, depending on what the judges decide, a crucial part of the British constitution – the separation of powers and what that entails for how judges are chosen – may have to be recalibrated.
SEP22	The Germans think Shakespeare was a German – and they are right	If but as well I other accents borrow that can my speech defuse…” says Kent in King Lear. Or perhaps, in one of those borrowed accents: “Wenn ich eben sowol einen andern Accent und eine langsamere Aussprache annehmen kan…” Sir Michael Redgrave, we learnt last week, was one of the many Shakespeareans who believed that the corpus, and in particular King Lear, sounds better in German. Germans have long had an unusually intense relationship with the poet. Herder, who did as much as anyone to create German national feeling, was obsessed with the plays. He regarded Shakespeare as a “Nordic genius”, a spiritual Teuton who had accidentally been born in England, but whose works reached perfection when infused with the Geist of the German language.
SEP22	Public goodwill towards Harry and Meghan has evaporated. They now have a chance to recapture it	It is hard to believe that it was only in May last year that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married. What has happened to all that goodwill? The atmosphere that day was electric: everyone was rooting for them, thrilled to see Harry so in love, enchanted by his beautiful film star bride. We all had a soft spot for Harry, always the naughtier of the two princes, the one who made everyone laugh, who was so down to earth, and so brilliant with vulnerable children. The one who went to war, who walked to the South Pole with the wounded, who created the Invictus Games and helped make physical and mental disability respectable. We longed for him to find someone who would make him happy. Meghan seemed to be just that person. She brought something special to the party. She was a career woman and a serious campaigner, she was American and of mixed race, she was just what the Royal family needed in the 21st century. And when she was out and about, visiting charities, meeting and encouraging people, lending her support, she gave her all and was rightly loved for it. And in May this year, without a hiccup, they produced a beautiful baby boy.
SEP23	Labour’s war on private education proves that Jeremy Corbyn is unelectable	This extremist proposal underlines the huge responsibility now facing Johnson and the Tories To me, 40 years after bidding farewell to Wath-on-Dearne, the striking thing about Britain is how meritocratic it is. Provided you get to the crucial interview at Oxford – a point to which I will return – or the equivalent seat of learning, and then work hard and build up your talents, the barriers soon fall away. Many young people today are being told there are roadblocks to their success, which in reality melt away if they simply walk up to them. We should be inspiring them with the knowledge of how they can succeed, not discouraging them with the psychology of failure. If you believe, falsely, that you are living in a society of class-ridden prejudice against you, then you are less likely to try for the top.
SEP23	As Labour descends into its own internal class war, Corbyn's grip on the party is loosening	Spend a day at Labour conference in Brighton and John McDonnell’s assertion that there’s no civil war soon comes into question. Alongside Palestine flags and soggy fish and chips, a battle for the soul of Labour is underway.  An event that was supposed to see the party put itself on an immediate general election footing has instead descended into acrimony with internal splits on Brexit, shadow cabinet squabbles and questions about Jeremy Corbyn’s future as Labour leader. Some can’t even face turning up to fight – the bulk of moderate Labour backbenchers have simply given the event a miss. The main battleground is Brexit – namely, whether the party should unanimously back Remain in any second referendum. Corbyn says no. A growing number of his shadow cabinet say yes. The divide is reflected in the party’s electorate – a clash between old working-class Labour and the new radical middle-class Left. 
SEP23	After this day of chaos, Labour are in a bigger mess over Brexit than ever	Imagine if there actually is a second referendum. Labour’s rallies will be a sight to behold. “What do we want? NO IDEA! When do we want it? NOT A CLUE!” On Monday, at their party conference in Brighton, Labour delegates spent more than four hours trying to decide what their approach to Brexit should be. One motion argued that Labour should commit straight away to backing Remain. A rival motion, supported by Jeremy Corbyn, argued that Labour should, at least for now, stay neutral. What followed was raucous, angry, steamingly tense – and hysterically chaotic.  Three separate delegates started their speeches by being furiously critical of the EU – before demanding their party campaign to stay in it. An interesting message to try on the doorstep. “The EU is an imperialist elitist neoliberal cabal! Vote Remain!”
SEP23	To save the monarchy, Harry and Meghan would be wise to follow the Queen's example	After many years of trundling along gloriously, the monarchy is back under review. The Duke of York is in the soup. The Queen has been dragged into the prorogation row. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are trying to reset their public image with a tour of southern Africa. And 62 per cent of Labour members say Britain should become a republic. If the rest of us want to keep the monarchy going, we’ve got to keep making the case for it – which is a problem, because that kind of public campaigning is contrary to the whole idea. The monarchy doesn’t justify itself. The Queen is the Queen by grace of God: the moment she defends her position, she implies that she rules by the will of the people, in which case she might as well run for office. If she did, it goes without saying that she would win.
SEP23	‘Wokeness’ has made us the laughing stock of the world	Which of the following headlines is a spoof? “Schools to teach children there are ‘100 genders or more’”, “Boys can have periods too, children to be taught”, “Schools to give happiness classes”, or “Children as young as six are to be given compulsory self-touching lessons”? The answer is, of course, none of them. It’s a lunatic-initiative-a-day here in barmy Britain – with that last one just the latest to be announced. Yes, as part of classes that will become compulsory in hundreds of primary schools across the country, children as young as six are being taught about “stimulating” their own genitals – alongside times tables, and how to identify an adjective. Those of us who chanced upon the article on Sunday, in which details of the Government’s freshly overhauled RSE curriculum for six- and seven-year-olds were laid out had a few choice adjectives of our own.
SEP23	Debate: At war over Brexit, should Labour officially back Remain?	Labour is on the brink of civil war over its EU policy, with Jeremy Corbyn set to be overruled on Brexit at party conference this evening, after a major union broke ranks and instructed its members to swing behind Remain. With the Opposition bitterly divided into Leave and Remain, two Labour politicians, Brendan Chilton (Labour Councillor and prominent Leave activist) and Peter Kyle (Labour MP for Hove) explain their respective camp's rival views...  Throughout the history of the Labour Party, we have been internationalists, looking outward, not inward. Brexit is in direct opposition to our core principles. It wants us to fear the outside world, to pull up the drawbridges and to retreat from the world stage. The ideologues – a mixture of ultra-Thatcherites who want to use Brexit as a way to slash and burn what’s left of our social safety net, and outright xenophobes and racists – are now those who insist we crash out with No Deal. The Labour Party should define itself by its opposition to these malicious forces trying to poison our society from the inside out.
SEP23	Labour is plotting a middle class culture war that could propel it into No 10	Their radical agenda is an attempt to capitalise on public discontent and desire for change The Labour Party’s Brighton conference may be going through the motions of a dysfunctional family gathering — sniping at each other, wrestling for control of the TV remote and growing increasingly raucous — but there is still a semblance of a strategy in what they are doing. To many onlookers, the policy announcements that have emanated from the floor veer from preposterous to wantonly destructive. From introducing flexi-work for women going through the menopause and reducing the working week to four days, the destruction of private education or abolishing Ofsted, this is a smorgasbord of announcements to get the pulse racing. And that’s before we even get to the prospect of the party potentially campaigning against its own Brexit deal.
SEP23	Just how much would abolishing private schools cost the taxpayer?	Absent a magic money tree, Labour's plans would mean finding over £7.5 billion each year in the education budget Labour’s declaration of war on private schools, promising to withdraw their charitable status and redistribute “democratically and fairly” their “endowments, investments and properties”, will cost the taxpayer almost £7.5 billion a year. Let me break that down. According to the Department for Education, 580,480 English children up to the age of 19 are currently at independent schools. Of those, 58,445 are under five, 194,592 are aged five to 10, 237,333 are aged 11 to 15 and 90,110 are 16-19.
SEP23	As Remainers take control, even 'dead cats' won't help an outfoxed Jeremy Corbyn	It couldn’t have been more of a dead cat had it sported whiskers and a pungent aroma – and they thought it might just do the trick. As Jeremy Corbyn prepared to face the most difficult Conference of his four years in office, with activists, MPs and his own shadow cabinet allies in open mutiny over his Brexit stance, news broke of an audacious bid to oust his troublesome deputy, Tom Watson. The move by Jon Lansman, head of Momentum, Mr Corbyn’s Praetorian Guard, took not only Mr Watson by surprise – he was 250 miles from the conference in Brighton, visiting his teenage son in Manchester – but even, it was claimed, the Leader himself.
SEP23	Labour's private schools crusade is a dogmatic assault on freedom	The party's hardline approach threatens aspiration, self-improvement and other tenets of a free society The Labour Party’s newly-adopted policy on abolishing private schools may have come as a shock to those who haven’t been paying attention to its drift to the Marxist Left. Others will regard it with bemusement. Where will the likes of Shami Chakrabarti, Diane Abbott and many other committed abolitionists send their children to school now? With high performing free schools, academies, grammars and private schools all for the chop, along with Ofsted reporting and standards, it can only mean one thing - their children are now grown up and need no longer worry about seeking out good schools. Unfortunately, many of the rest of us do and we should have a choice.
SEP24	Tenacious MP and three Scottish judges proved right by Supreme Court ruling	The activities of a tenacious Scottish politician, and the considered opinion of three Scottish judges, have been vindicated – sensationally so - by the unanimous verdict of 11 justices of United Kingdom’s highest court. It’s not often – in fact it’s never happened before - that the SNP MP for Edinburgh South, Joanne Cherry, is the subject of  praise in this column. But there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that she deserves the highest acclaim for sticking to her task in seeking to frustrate Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s prorogation of parliament. She will undoubtedly attract brickbats from opponents for seeking to deny Brexit, but this frequently noisy and excitable MP has been transformed in this case. She has used her legal expertise calmly and soberly – she is a Queen’s Counsel – to lead the campaign of over 70 politicians of all parties to have the government’s decision to suspend parliament set aside. And ultimately she had the highest court in the land on her side.
SEP24	This judgment will greatly assist Remainers in seizing control of government again	There can be no question but that we are now in a genuine constitutional crisis. This has been coming ever since the referendum and Parliament's refusal to act on the majority decision of the British people.  Of course the opposition are already leaping up and down claiming that the Prime Minister should resign – but this is a hollow jibe. After all, they could have done that all along simply by calling a vote of confidence in the government.  I was astonished that, when the Supreme Court made their judgment that they were acting to uphold Parliament’s rights against an over-mighty executive, they didn’t see fit to mention that Parliament could have stopped prorogation all along either by agreeing to an early election or by passing a vote of no-confidence in the Government.
SEP24	Jeremy Corbyn can't topple Boris – he's too afraid of a general election	Were Jeremy Corbyn a drinker he might be expected to raise a glass to Lady Hale, President of the Supreme Court, following her jaw dropper of a ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was illegal. If he did, it would be a toast motivated not by glee that a Halloween Brexit now appears more distant – it is one of the peculiarities of the European conundrum that Mr Corbyn is a Eurosceptic of far greater fervour and longevity than Boris Johnson – but because the decision has dug him out of a horrible hole in Brighton. Labour was nearing the end of one of its more torrid conferences when Lady Hale lobbed her hand grenade, exploding the Prime Minister’s plans for a quiet week at the United Nations and killing off the embarrassing spectacle of Corbynista activists staging a walk-out from Deputy Leader Tom Watson’s speech.
SEP24	The hypocrites on Labour’s front bench will betray ordinary schoolchildren	On Sky’s Kay Burley Show, broadcast live from the Labour Party conference, an inner-city teacher called Polly explained that Eton would still exist after a Labour government had abolished private schools. Eton wouldn’t actually be razed to the ground, Polly conceded magnanimously – the school’s buildings would just be “redistributed”. Burley did well not to honk at this staggering statement. If that were really the case, she pointed out, what was to stop Labour confiscating Kay’s house, the one she had paid for out of her own taxed income? Polly flashed her best Thornberry smile (maximum snarling superciliousness, zero mirth). Such details would be filled out in due course, she said evasively, by John McDonnell, who was “very clever”. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Soviet Socialist Republic of Corbyn, where there will be no such thing as independent education, let alone independent thought.
SEP24	We’ve seen some mad days in British politics. But this was off the scale	A few weeks ago, it was rumoured that Dominic Cummings – the Machiavelli of Downing Street – was cooking up a brilliant secret ploy to overshadow Labour’s party conference. Feverishly journalists strove to imagine what this mysterious masterplan might be.  Despite our best efforts, however, none of us even dreamt that it would entail prompting the highest court in the land to rule that the Prime Minister had broken the law. Classic Dom. Always thinking outside the box.
SEP24	Boris Johnson's enemies want prorogation revenge. But do they have a plan besides cold fury?	After the Supreme Court unanimously struck down Boris Johnson's prorogation, how was he able to summon up the sangfroid to insist nonetheless that "we will get on" with the Government's plan for Brexit by October 31? Remainers will chalk it up as a sign of delusion, reminiscent of Theresa May in the last days of her administration. Yet they risk forgetting, amid the excitement caused by the shock verdict, that it does necessarily stop the Prime Minister from pursuing his desired Queen's Speech next month - as he would just prorogue for a smaller time. But first, Mr Johnson has to brave a return to a House of Commons rife with vengeful MPs baying for political blood. Jeremy Corbyn is just one of the many opposition party leaders making clear they think the Prime Minister should resign, which he is unsurprisingly not obliging their request. Where does that leave them?
SEP24	Today’s disastrous ruling will usher in US-style court politics to our legal system	Elected judges, confirmation hearings and politicised appointments are beckoning British politicos love to wallow in American politics. A combination of a common language and a very different culture allow us to enjoy the ongoing succession of dramas and crises of that riven republic vicariously, and from a safe distance.  Yet there but for the grace of God we might yet go ourselves. After today’s Supreme Court judgment quashing Boris Johnson’s prorogation of Parliament, it is no longer remotely difficult to imagine how America’s court politics could come to Britain – whether anybody actually wants it to or not. 
SEP24	We need a general election to seize Brexit back from the lobbyists and lawyers	There is only one way to settle this now. Not with an agonising, contentious reexamination of our constitutional arrangements – which would be conducted under whose auspices? Certainly not, God help us with the introduction of a written constitution which, created under these exceptionally divisive circumstances would be hopelessly skewed and almost immediately unfit for purpose. Not with endless further recrimination between elected politicians and unelected justices, or yet more intractable arguments about what constitutes, at any given moment, the “will of the people”. There is only one definitive way to arrive at a truly democratic outcome. We must have a general election as soon as is humanly possible. That is the traditional, historically unimpeachable, constitutionally agreed way to determine what the people wish to happen.
SEP24	The Supreme Court was fair, independent and judicial. It also happened to be wrong	There is something reassuringly genteel about UK legal proceedings. Baroness Hale’s summary of the Supreme Court’s decision was delivered this morning in typically polite and thoughtful terms, and received in respectful silence. But make no mistake – behind the veneer of calmness, the outcome of the Miller/Cherry case will have a fundamental impact both on this government, and others in future.  The Supreme Court’s word is, literally, law, and now that it has given its judgment, it must be respected – not least because the decision was reached independently and honestly, by an impartial judiciary.
SEP24	Ousting Dominic Cummings over prorogation would be a terrible mistake	Following the Supreme Court judgement, it took approximately 30 seconds for the first politician to call for the Prime Minister's resignation and then only a few minutes more for the knives to appear for his most senior Downing Street adviser, Dominic Cummings. The pressure on both will be intense, and sadly but rather predictably, a small number of Tory MPs are briefing behind the scenes that Cummings must go. Usually in politics calling for advisers to be sacked is a displacement activity for not being able to force out the real target. We all know the real target for these few disgruntled Tory MPs is the Prime Minister. They realise, along with most MPs on both sides of the House of Commons, that Boris Johnson will probably win a general election against Jeremy Corbyn. Nothing from the Supreme Court changes that dynamic, indeed for Boris it merely adds to the list of establishment bodies trying to overturn the Referendum result and stop Brexit.
SEP25	For all their bluster, Remainer MPs are frightened to face the voters	"This Parliament is a disgrace," thundered Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, as he answered questions about the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down the prorogation that he had advised would be constitutional. If opposition MPs returning cock-a-hoop to Westminster imagined that they would find cowed and contrite Government ministers squirming with embarrassment in their places on the front bench, they were quickly disabused. The Prime Minister, on his return from the UN meeting in New York, was not only unapologetic, he was positively combative. In a rousing statement to the House, he savaged Labour’s Brexit delay tactics, decrying the selfishness of Remainer MPs for their failure to respect the referendum vote. Accompanied to cheers from the Conservative benches, he then challenged the opposition parties to put their antics to the judgment of the voters.  
SEP25	Remainers have turned Parliament into an anti-democratic monstrosity	There was a time when Eurosceptics thought that they were the new Roundheads, fighting to return power to Parliament, pitted in combat against the Remainers, a new generation of Euro-Cavaliers committed to the divine right of the EU to rule over us. It was a compelling tale, so it’s no wonder that the more extreme Remainers are seeking to appropriate a warped version of it for themselves. Their real aim is to cancel Brexit, and they’ve found a brilliant new way of dressing up their power grab in pseudo-democratic garb. Remainer MPs, we are told, are the true friends of Parliament; Brexiteers are on the side of the bullying executive; and the courts have stepped in to complete the 1611 Case of Proclamations that limited the Royal prerogative. So what’s wrong with the Eurosceptics? Didn’t they spend years demanding greater parliamentary sovereignty? Why, then, are they so angry at John Bercow for enhancing MPs’ role? Why don’t they support the Supreme Court’s revolutionary reinterpretation of the Bill of Rights? It’s a trap. The Remainers are proposing a new doctrine: a perversion of the old idea of parliamentary sovereignty and its replacement by a toxic concept which posits that MPs should have almost unlimited power. Instead of a representative democracy, Remainers want an elected oligarchy, a parliamentocracy, with MPs free to do whatever they wish once elected, with zero accountability. It would be like creating a hybrid between Lords and Commons, with MPs as heroic rebels, defying the bigoted voters, organising themselves into ever-shifting alliances, with manifestos merely a sick joke.
SEP25	Geoffrey Cox is right – this Parliament is a disgrace	As dead men tell no tales, so a dead parliament can pass no deals. This was the message of the Attorney General, Sir Geoffrey Cox QC, as he stood at the dispatch box on the resumption of the House in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s ruling on the government’s attempt at prorogation. Beset by baying, and calls for his resignation, he was forthright in his criticism of the action of members opposite, both for the motives of their actions, and for the sheer number of questions he was in no position to answer.  It was clear that many parliamentarians intended to make this a show trial for Sir Geoffrey. If Boris Johnson was not to make an appearance, the Attorney General, who provided the Government with advice that prorogation was legal would do. There was plenty of preening and grandstanding from the arrayed faces making up the Remainer Alliance, but none more so than from the ruddy features of Barry Sheerman, who, no doubt anticipating his five minutes of Twitter viraldom, let sputum rip about ‘barrister’s bluster’ — which seemed rather ungrateful, given the profession of those who recalled parliament in the first place.
SEP25	The High Court's transgender ruling spells a rare victory for sanity	These discussions now must be opened up for critical and rigorous debate involving the public at large Shocking news from the High Court. Judges have ruled that if you become pregnant and give birth to a baby then you will be described on your child’s birth certificate as the mother. You might dress like a father, act like a father and ask your child to call you “dad”; you might even pump your body full of testosterone or undergo surgery: but this counts for nothing. If you have a uterus and ovaries and you use these parts of your anatomy in the creation and delivery of a child, you are a mother.  Freddy McConnell, born a woman but now a trans-man, was fortunate enough to be in possession of ovaries and a uterus when he decided to press pause on the process of transition in order to conceive and give birth last year. McConnell, however, wanted to be legally recognised as “father” on the child’s birth certificate and leave blank the box labelled “mother”. So keen was McConnell to erase from record his role in carrying and giving birth to his child that he took legal action against the General Register Office. Clearly, people have children for many reasons, no doubt some of them selfish. But the narcissism required to get pregnant and give birth and then seek legal redress to ignore biology and rewrite history is beyond most people’s comprehension. 
SEP25	Labour launched into Boris Johnson with newfound fury... and I’ve never seen anything like it	The study of Brexit will keep academics busy for decades. But the busiest won’t be historians or political scientists. They’ll be psychologists. Just look what the EU referendum has done to us. On all sides it’s turned the moderate militant, the rational rabid, and the calm crazed. More than ever before, political thinking seems informed not by evidence or reason but by pride, pigheadedness, delusion – and above all else anger. What we’re witnessing isn’t the conventional cut and thrust of debate. It’s a collective nervous breakdown. Wednesday's behaviour in the Commons would be worth a PhD on its own. MPs were back with a vengeance, and the first minister they hauled to the dispatch box was Geoffrey Cox – who, in his capacity as Attorney General, had assured the Prime Minister that suspending Parliament would be lawful. Mr Cox’s first few answers sounded calm enough – but within half an hour he seemed to be in absolute meltdown. Ranting and roaring, a spluttering combustion of beetroot-cheeked derangement, lashing out left, lashing out right, and trumpeting umbrage like an incensed bull elephant. 
SEP25	Why I couldn't care less about the gender of Gina Miller or Lady Hale	The democratic stakes are too high for enforced admiration  In our era of identity politics, it was no surprise that coverage of this week’s Supreme Court decision focused on one person in particular: Lady Hale, the so-called “Beyonce of the legal profession”. Another newspaper gushingly branded her “the real Northern Powerhouse”. Commentators praised her clear and eloquent delivery and speculated about her eclectic choice of brooches. There is a dose of low-expectations sexism to all of this – and one that risks obscuring key issues. Shortly after the decision, ITV’s Robert Peston tweeted that “a trio of extraordinary women have today changed the course of British politics”, naming Lady Hale, Gina Miller and Joanna Cherry. “Wherever you stand on Brexit or Johnson,” he added, “you’ve got to be impressed.”
SEP25	The idea that Boris Johnson should resign over the Supreme Court ruling is ridiculous	The Commons has sought to impose a negotiating strategy which the Prime Minister does not accept The Supreme Court’s ruling that the Prime Minister’s advice to the Queen for Parliament be prorogued for five weeks was unlawful was the first occasion on which such advice has faced judicial review. It was, however, by no means the first time that the courts have reviewed the exercise of executive discretion. Nor will it be the last. In the past, both Conservative and Labour governments have been judged to have exceeded their powers. This has never led to a prime ministerial resignation. Nor should it today. The Prime Minister has not been caught with his hands in the till. He has not committed a criminal offence, but was found by the Supreme Court to have exercised his powers for an improper purpose.
SEP25	The experts' snooty disdain for public opinion isn't the rule of law but the 'rule of lawyers'	We are all entitled to our views on Monday's Supreme Court ruling The Supreme Court’s revolutionary decision on prorogation yesterday morning has provoked fierce debate. Perhaps the most disturbing commentary has come from those who suggest that the Supreme Court (and judges in general) are not just impartial and expert, but beyond criticism. This is levelled not just at ordinary people who are not legally qualified, but also at the Government's response (though it disagrees with the court's decision, it will nevertheless respect it). One highly respected lawyer went so far as to compare this to criminals who maintain their innocence after having been convicted.
SEP25	Parliament's return will expose just how useless a leader Jeremy Corbyn really is	As this Pointless Parliament, the longest and most useless since the English Civil War, carries on its record-breaking efforts at doing little if anything of note, it is worth taking stock of where we've reached – particularly given that Jeremy Corbyn, a man with the lowest approval rating of any leader of the opposition since 1977, now holds all the cards. A significant proportion of the public believe Parliament is stuffed full of cheats and liars. When the election eventually comes they won’t forget how a huge number of MPs who promised to uphold the referendum result have since wilfully obstructed and trashed the democratic process. No amount of excuses can hide MPs them from their failure to deliver what the majority of the public demanded legitimately and legally in 2016. Remainers returning to Parliament with little plan for what to do next, despite having demanded the right to sit again in increasingly agitated tones over the last couple of weeks, are only going to antagonise people further. To say people are angry with their politicians rather understates the situation.
SEP25	Installing Harriet Harman as PM would be an anti-democratic outrage. It could also sweep Boris to victory	They were the worst of times, they were the worst of times. And what times! No government in living memory – or perhaps even in recorded history – has been in quite the pickle Boris Johnson’s administration finds itself in. Eventually, all of this will fall to the great British public to sort out. And if they fail to sort it out – if, for example, they again refuse to bestow a working majority on any party – then the madness of the last few years will have some way to travel before eventually (we must hope) it burns itself out.  Yesterday’s ruling by the Supreme Court will, on the face of it, have little immediate impact on the Government’s plans to remove us from the European Union on October 31, other than put new resolve in our EU counterparts to refuse any kind of meaningful compromise on what they previously agreed with Theresa May. The Benn legislation legally obliging the prime minister, in the absence of any deal agreed by parliament, to seek an extension to our EU membership, remains on the statute book and would have applied with or without their lordships’ eagerness to assume the job of creating new statutes.
SEP26	The one skill we can't afford to ignore if we're to build a bright future in Britain	When I was at school computing technology was more rudimentary than it is today.  At the time, our predictions for the 2020s would have read like the script for Back to the Future II: a world of hoverboards, flying cars and pocket-sized super-computers. But fast forward and here we are, facing a new decade presented with exciting opportunities brought on by the digital age.  We need computer scientists not just in technology or finance but in every type of industry, now and for the future. So all school-leavers need to be familiar with rigorous computing principles if the economy is to be competitive over the long-term. 
SEP26	It's the SNP contingent at Westminster that's behind the party's rise in the polls	In the highly charged, at times vicious, atmosphere of the Commons’ resumption on Wednesday night perhaps the most striking irony was that it was a man and a party whose dearest wish is to break-up Britain who appear to have become the most accomplished champions for those Britons who’re not Boris Johnson’s greatest fans. On an evening when Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Her Majesty’s  official opposition, noticeably failed to turn up in any meaningful sense it was Ian Blackford, the SNP Commons leader, who sought to publicly embarrass the Prime Minister over his 11-0 defeat at the hands of the Supreme Court justices. That he failed had more to do with an almost brazen determination on Mr Johnson’s part not to appear apologetic than to any shortcomings on Mr Blackford’s part.
SEP26	Parliament has lost its sense of purpose	Blackguard, pipsqueak, guttersnipe and hypocrite are among two dozen words deemed to be unparliamentary. Had any of them been used during Wednesday evening’s broohaha in the House of Commons, John Bercow, the Speaker, would have called the proceedings to order and demanded they be withdrawn. Yet he was happy to preside over a raucous, ranting rabble, some of whom accused the Prime Minister of being a bigot and a racist, accusations that today are somewhat more toxic and inflammatory than hooligan or squirt. When the Speaker is so obviously, almost wilfully, parti pris on the great issue dividing the nation it is hardly surprising that the chamber erupts in anger, both real and confected. Mr Bercow’s job is to keep order, but he failed to do so.
SEP26	Boris is right – the only way to heal the rancour is to get Brexit done	Shortly before Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, I met him in his parliamentary office and asked how on earth he hoped to heal the wounds caused by the referendum. He had a ready answer. The wounds are deepening, he said, precisely because of the delay. He thought this inevitable: when there’s uncertainty about the direction of travel, people are more prone to fight with each other, hoping to influence it. Brexit bloodletting will only stop, he said, when “we make a clear decision, which we’ve shirked for the last three years”. So the best way to end the division over Brexit is to “get it done”. When...
SEP26	No transgender parent should be able to airbrush their child's history	Calling all Archers fans! Have you heard about the latest au courant plot twist in this everyday tale of farming folk? New parents Adam and Ian are only going to court to have their surrogate Lexie’s name taken off the birth certificate so that Ian can be legally registered as the mother. Well, he is taking a year off work, you know. What do you mean you don’t believe it? Might that be because even for a long-running radio soap that pioneered all things organic (Pat and Tony on the farm) and orgasmic (Sid and Jolene in the shower), this is just too stupid? And you’d be right. Sometimes, life is far too ludicrous for art to even think of imitating.
SEP26	It is misery to be a night owl on a schedule set by larks	I can’t expect the early-rising majority to change their ways As a lifelong insomniac, I have sympathy for teenagers. They’re not lazy: they’re conspired against. Just when their brains and bodies are beginning the most tiring work imaginable – metamorphosing into adulthood – and their circadian rhythms are changing pace (the sleep hormone melatonin doesn’t kick in until 11pm in teenagers, meaning they naturally sleep later), they go to secondary school, and are suddenly expected to keep Army hours. “Rise and shine you ‘orrible little lot!” bellows the cruel, unfeeling world, snapping open the curtains to reveal a navy sky still waiting for dawn. The duvet gets forcibly whipped away, the stiff-collared uniform is slotted on, the backpack shouldered and off you stagger to catch the bus, your whole body dizzy with the injustice of it.
SEP26	Jeremy Corbyn is a busted flush, and his humiliated party is all too aware of it	Why else won't the Labour Party call a vote of no confidence in the Government? In all the fuss over Boris Johnson’s language in the Commons on Wednesday night, it’s easy to overlook what else happened. Dragged back to Parliament from New York, the prime minister faced what seemed certain humiliation at the Despatch Box. The Labour benches were baying. Tory MPs would rather have been anywhere else. And yet Jeremy Corbyn’s response to the Prime Minister’s statement was so awful, so devoid of serious argument and so full of contradictions that it was the Conservative benches that ended up cheering for more, with Mr Corbyn humiliated.
SEP26	After those shocking scenes on Wednesday, the mood in the Commons has turned utterly rancid	It’s spreading across politics like a mould. A mould that lurks at the back of the fridge. Something has curdled, festered, soured – and now it’s turning dark, and thick, and rancid. It’s been happening slowly. But all the time, its spores have been dispersing, silent and unseen, to contaminate all they touch. It’s breeding. Devouring. The rot is setting in.
SEP26	Far from being unprecedented, British politics has always been a raucous bear pit	The pearl-clutching response to the events of the past 48 hours shows little historical perspective “Calm down, dear!” David Cameron got into hot water for saying those words to Labour MP Angela Eagle in Parliament in 2011. Boris Johnson got into even hotter water on Wednesday for accusing Labour MP Paula Sherriff of “humbug” when she attacked him for using words like “surrender” and “betrayal” in relation to Brexit. After 36 years in the Commons, Sir Nicholas Soames said he had never seen such a “poisonous atmosphere” in the House. He should calm down, too. The pearl-clutching response to the events of the past 48 hours shows little historical perspective. British politics has always been a combative bear-pit.
SEP26	Blocking or even delaying Brexit threatens to destroy conservatism as we know it	Traditional Burkean conservatism may be a victim of the coming realignment Public debate is resounding with calls for politicians to moderate their language and refrain from using inflammatory terms such as "surrender" and "traitor" in Brexit debates. The explicit thinking behind this is that MPs using such language incite division and hostility among the public – they are the cause or source of strong feelings and intemperate attacks on MPs. But this analysis has things exactly back to front. The language used by the PM and other MPs may be calculated but it reflects and derives from feelings that are already present in British society. If that were not the case they would not be using it.
SEP27	A nation in crisis needs vision and leadership. That's exactly what Mrs Thatcher provided	If you debate current affairs a great deal, studying history helps. This is because of the similarity and the difference. The similarity is that almost no problem is new. The difference is that history requires a cooler manner of thinking. In the heat of the present, you wish to argue. In the perspective of the past, you wish to understand. Each mode helps the other. As a journalist for 40 years next month, I have done plenty of arguing, never more so than now, when the subject of Brexit has driven roughly half our MPs so crazy that they are staging a sort of sit-in, collecting their wages for doing nothing but block a referendum result, a government, and a general election. For the second half of my time, however, I have had the privilege of writing history as well. In 1997, Margaret Thatcher asked me if I would be her authorised biographer. I began work on this in 1999. Last month, I finished it. The third (and final) volume, Herself Alone, is serialised in this newspaper from today.
SEP27	The BBC can no longer claim to be impartial	Complaints against two BBC presenters underline the media vogue for opinions rather than facts Is impartiality desirable? Is it even possible? Among journalists and broadcasters of a certain age the answer would still be “yes”. True, it was difficult. Certainly the aspiration often went unachieved. But it was something to aim for, at least. Then 2016 happened. That year, the publics in Britain and America both cast a vote that was not accepted by the majority of the media in either country. While journalists blamed the Leave campaign and Donald Trump for creating “fake news”, and the Right in both countries vented long pent-up concerns about the bias of the “liberal media”, that media did the worst thing it could have done. It decided that on matters of the greatest importance, impartiality was not just undesirable but was actually part of the problem.
SEP27	Entangled in politics, the court has wrongly seized supreme power	Our judges are there to be fair-minded interpreters, and not authors, of the law Rebels come in many forms. This one wore a black frock and an elegant, diamond brooch in the shape of a spider. It took Lady Hale just a quarter of an hour to read out the judgment, arrived at over a long weekend, which has smashed our constitution to bits. Among the chattering classes, the Supreme Court judgment was hailed by all as a humiliation for the Prime Minister and a shocking indictment of his government. Now, though, as the storm of performative outrage and hypocrisy abates, the focus is rightly returning to the content of the judgment itself, raising a profoundly uncomfortable question. What if the real destroyer of democratic norms, the real, dangerous insurgent, isn’t the Prime Minister, but the court itself?
SEP27	Boris Johnson faces a near-impossible task trying to bypass the Benn Act	In three weeks’ time the Prime Minister will be returning from the European Council with either a new deal to put to Parliament, or refusing to accept the backstop and intent on leaving on no-deal terms. Yet with MPs having passed the Benn Act three weeks ago, on Saturday October 19 the PM must by law send a letter to the EU requesting an extension to January 31 2020 if Parliament has not voted on and approved either a deal or a no-deal Brexit. The PM has said he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than seek an extension, but the Benn Act will force him to request an extension he doesn’t want. Downing Street has promised to test the Benn Act to its limits, and over the last two days several theories have been proposed. John Major feared that an Order in Council could be used to suspend the Benn-Burt Act until after October 31. However the Bill of Rights explicitly rules out using Ministerial powers in this way, stating that suspending laws without the consent of Parliament is unlawful.
SEP27	Harry and Meghan's Africa tour is a storming success, but have they turned a corner with the public yet?	Beaming and tactile, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have summoned the spirit of Diana with their effortless ability to win hearts and warm souls during their first official trip abroad as a young family, in Africa. During their first pit stop in South Africa, alongside the hugs (Meghan) dad dancing (Harry) and high fives (both), the couple were fearless in their message about women's rights as they visited Justice Desk, an organisation helping youngsters and women who are often the victims of violence.  A subsequent appearance – finally – by Archie, the baby we've all  been desperate to coo over, and victory was indisputably theirs.
SEP27	Tony Blair’s diabolical plan has succeeded: more than half of young people are now at left-wing madrassas	Expanding the higher education sector was never about boosting social mobility The news that over half of England’s young people are going to university will be music to Tony Blair’s ears. According to the latest government figures, 50.2 per cent of 17-30 year-olds in England had participated in higher education in 2017-18. Back in 1999, when the figure was only 39 per cent, Blair set himself the 50 per cent target and less than 20 years later it has been achieved. The percentage of young people in England going to college or university is now even higher than in the United States, where the figure for 18-24 year-olds is about 40 per cent.
SEP27	Public discourse is all the weaker for Jo Swinson's 'moralising mummy' act	Using parenthood as a rhetorical strategy marks a new low In the 2016 Conservative leadership contest, I was surprised when Andrea Leadsom, then energy minister, found herself disqualified after a remark implying that parents were better cut out for leadership than the childless. In suggesting that by not having children (Leadsom had three and therefore "a real stake" in the country), Theresa May was somehow less fit to lead, she had made a fool of herself and had to pay the price. It seemed such a leap forward that the Conservatives had not stood for this and its corollary: that parenthood is somehow a badge of moral honour and professional proficiency combined.  Sadly, things seem to have regressed since then, and the manipulative mummy act is back and stronger than ever. In her dressing down of the prime minister for proroguing parliament, declared unlawful by the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson bellowed at the Prime Minister: “Even my five-year-old knows that if you do something wrong you have to say sorry." I sense she won't be afraid to use that sort of line again - and again. 
SEP27	The rise in private tutors is a sign of aspiration. It should be welcomed, not scorned	The news this week that over a quarter of secondary school pupils have private tuition is, we were told by critics, another profound sign of the inequality in our society. The children of the rich have their path paved with gold while those who cannot afford to spend £25 an hour on extra maths lessons are destined for life’s scrapheap. The Sutton Trust, the social mobility charity that produced this figure, is calling for changes to level the playing field so more students can access the benefits of tuition.  But while these raw statistics may tell us how many children are receiving tuition, they don’t actually tell us all that much about the parents who are paying for it. There is no doubt that middle class families are using private tutors to support their children. However, the huge rise, particularly in London, has come from poorer migrant communities. According to the Government’s race disparity audit, the group that has improved most when it comes to A-level results has been “black African”. One of the key reasons has been the use of private tuition, even though black African families are among some of the poorest in the country.
SEP27	America’s heavyhanded vaping clampdown was always going to happen	Lawmakers are exploiting a contrived panic to bring in the excessive regulation they have always wanted It is now several weeks since people started being hospitalised with ‘vaping-related’ lung injuries in the United States. The epidemic has slowed considerably in recent days, but it is said to have claimed the lives of at least 11 people and made hundreds severely ill.  Partly in response to the outbreak, Walmart has stopped selling e-cigarettes. The billionaire nanny statist Michael Bloomberg has put up $160 million to fight vaping. The states of Michigan, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island have banned all flavoured e- cigarettes except ‘tobacco’ and menthol. Illinois and California are among the states considering a similar ban, and a nationwide ban may be looming after Donald Trump complained that ‘people are dying’ (although he later appeared to backtrack on this). 
SEP27	Remainers' plot to foist Jeremy Corbyn on the nation shows how unprincipled and shameless they are becoming	There is no greater sign of the mounting desperation among Remainers to delay - and ideally derail - Brexit than their reluctant embrace of Jeremy Corbyn. At first, the Labour leader was kept at arm's length by his opposition party counterparts. His offer to table a motion of no confidence in the government was given the cold shoulder because he insisted as a condition for doing so that they agree to support him as an alternative prime minister. They were happy to work with him to see Hilary Benn's Brexit-delaying legislation into law, prompting Boris Johnson to fulminate to this day about the "Corbyn surrender bill".  Despite the Prime Minister's fury, he is not admitting defeat. Mr Johnson continues to insist that Brexit will be delivered nonetheless by October 31, without breaking the law, which has clearly sent jitters down Remainer spines as they now fear his team have a dastardly ruse to avoid being humiliated by the legislation.
SEP28	Rich or poor, everyone will benefit from Boris Johnson’s tax cuts	Lower taxes are a good thing. They boost the economy, attract investment, create jobs and make the country as a whole better off. Obviously, some tax cuts achieve these goals more effectively than others. Overall, though, there is a strong correlation between lower taxes and higher growth. Now for a couple of points that should be obvious, but that evidently need spelling out. Tax cuts will necessarily bring more immediate gains to people who pay taxes than to people who don’t pay taxes. By the same token, they will bring more immediate gains to people who pay a lot in tax than to people who pay very little. That might strike you as a trite, almost banal, observation.
SEP28	From paying reparations to backing our enemies, Labour's anti-British credo is shameful	The single most shocking proposal to come out of the Labour conference was largely overlooked. Attention naturally focused on the blizzard of Bolshevist policies: expropriating private houses and schools; decreeing a four-day week; giving the vote to foreigners; opening our borders without restriction. Worse than any of these ideas, though – and, in a sense, the key to understanding them all – was the promise that, as John McDonnell put it, Britain would “begin making some reparations for our colonial past”. Here we see the animating spirit of Corbynism, huge and hateful, all disguise cast off. The essence of Labour’s credo, the starting point from which everything else flows, is anti-Britishness.
SEP28	Greta Thunberg is the first saint of our cruel new environmental religion	Religious thinking pervades our supposedly secular age, from the purity-obsessed “clean eating” fetish, to the unforgiving online lynch mob, with its public shamings and demands for penance. The Greta Thunberg phenomenon will fascinate future sociologists – and for similar reasons. Thunberg, with her apocalyptic warnings and Pippi Longstocking plaits, has become a global icon in a matter of months. More striking than the ubiquitous crowds accompanying her, however, is their quasi-religious reverence. She is portrayed as a child-prophet, a modern-day Joan of Arc in her ability to inspire a movement. Senior broadcasters call her “Greta” as though they enjoyed a direct connection with the teenager. A seemingly hyperbolic comparison, but there are religious echoes to Thunberg’s doomsday activism, and parallels with the child saints credited with supernatural qualities and praised for their innocence and moral clarity. Thunberg describes her autism as a “superpower”. She depicts a fallen world, whose only hope of salvation lies in Utopian retreat to a pre-industrial past. Her followers’ calls for “climate justice” and reparations to poorer countries ring with self-flagellation.
SEP28	Our arrogant political class holds the British people in open contempt	A few weeks ago – even before the latest instalment of this saga at the Supreme Court – a member of our family in the North of England rang up to say, with heartbreaking resignation, “They don’t care about people like us.” There was no question about who she meant by “they”. The membership of the group she had in mind is presumably now a bit larger, bringing even the objective authority of the law into contention. I wonder if that smug Remain coalition in Westminster has any idea of the terrible thing it has brought into being and is now – with every triumphal move – determined to consolidate. With the help of the credulous (or colluding) broadcast media, confected rage about over-heated parliamentary language took over the news agenda last week. Can anybody seriously believe that this is the big story? Or, more importantly, the most damaging constitutional outrage that is being committed? In a week in which a foaming, shrieking opposition was denouncing the Government as unfit for office – but refusing to permit a general election that might replace it? And the legal commitment to accept the result of a referendum was being undermined with desperate, shameless dishonesty? (Message to Parliament: nobody in the real world believes that all those lawyers scrambling around were simply trying to prevent no deal, and not attempting to block Brexit altogether.)
SEP28	My new-look M&S shows how desperate the high street has become	A brand new branch of Marks & Spencer has opened down the road from us, and let me tell you: this is not just any M&S store… it’s an extra flashy M&S store, an all-singing all-dancing M&S store, an M&S store with bells and whistles on. This M&S puts the sparks into Marks. There’s a DJ, playing “feelgood” tunes so you can imagine you’re starring in the latest ad campaign as you browse for milk and a load of bread. There are four different types of trolley, and three different types of basket, including a beautiful wicker number that would not look out of place on the arm of an Instagram influencer who wants to let their followers know that yes, they are normal and go to the supermarket, too.  There’s a great big disco ball that is actually a pizza oven. “It’s the country’s first revolving disco pizza oven,” explained a member of staff proudly. The herbs are grown in store, in a great big gleaming glass house that you can gasp at and coo over, as if you were too stupid to know how food was grown, which of course you are, because you have been weaned on supermarket culture. (And when I say you, I obviously mean me). 
SEP28	Call me old-fashioned, but I’m not sure breaking the law is a good idea	Crime: a good thing, or a bad thing? Until recently, I would have imagined this to be a question on which there was something close to a national consensus. But perhaps I was simply out of touch. Here, verbatim, is a question asked by a man in the studio audience, during Thursday night’s edition of Question Time. It was prompted by speculation that the Prime Minister might be prepared to break the law, in order to take Britain out of the EU without a deal. “We all break laws on a day-to-day basis,” began the man in the audience. “Do you think it’s acceptable to do so if it’s in the national interest?”
SEP28	Sacred Mysteries: In Santiago I saw something that wasn’t there	I saw something that wasn’t there in the cathedral at Santiago de Compostela this week. I don’t mean a ghost. A familiar feature was missing. A celebrated performance at this popular pilgrim destination is the swinging botafumeiro, the silver censer as tall as a man that flies high into the transepts, almost hitting the vaulting, and back across into the other side, trailing smoke and flame as in Turner’s Rain, Steam and Speed. It’s not being swung just at the moment as the cathedral is full of scaffolding for renovation work, but the thing that is missing is the eye of God looking down from the high point where the nave and transepts cross, from which the botafumeiro rope hangs.
SEP28	Road verges are Britain’s secret gardens where the wild flowers bloom	A pocket of joyous biodiversity survives on our roadsides One of the greatest environmental tragedies to have befallen Britain is the loss of wildflower meadows – down to 3 per cent of their number at the end of the Second World War. This isn’t the stuff of protest by Extinction Rebellion. But the toll is dismal, and more directly relevant to most of us than the Amazonian rainforest, which is somewhat further away. (Though before anybody pursues me on social media, that’s important too.) Fortunately, a pocket of biodiversity survives. Well, less a pocket than a very long, stretched-out stocking – over 300,000 miles of it. Britain’s network of road verges.
SEP28	Today's Parliamentary tricks are nothing new	Earlier this year, I read William Hague’s biography of William Wilberforce, the anti-slave trade campaigner and backbench MP. The book recounts how Wilberforce battled for years, through setback after setback, to push legislation banning the trade through Parliament. One of the tricks used by all sides back then was suddenly to move for a vote on something that hadn’t been expected, making sure that your fellows knew the game and that the other side didn’t. Before your opponents understood what was happening, you could push through or kill controversial motions and painstakingly designed bills in the dead of night. Of course, as soon as one side got wind of what was afoot, its leaders would scramble to rouse sympathetic MPs from their members’ clubs and card games and drag them, worse for wear, into the House.
SEP28	A nation in crisis needs vision and leadership. That's exactly what Mrs Thatcher provided	If you debate current affairs a great deal, studying history helps. This is because of the similarity and the difference. The similarity is that almost no problem is new. The difference is that history requires a cooler manner of thinking. In the heat of the present, you wish to argue. In the perspective of the past, you wish to understand. Each mode helps the other. As a journalist for 40 years next month, I have done plenty of arguing, never more so than now, when the subject of Brexit has driven roughly half our MPs so crazy that they are staging a sort of sit-in, collecting their wages for doing nothing but block a referendum result, a government, and a general election. For the second half of my time, however, I have had the privilege of writing history as well. In 1997, Margaret Thatcher asked me if I would be her authorised biographer. I began work on this in 1999. Last month, I finished it. The third (and final) volume, Herself Alone, is serialised in this newspaper from today.
SEP29	Our politics is following the path of America's vicious culture wars	Boris Johnson is boxed in. The Commons refuses to support his Brexit policy. In seven votes out of seven it has defeated his Government. And twice it has vetoed a general election. Before metaphors were banned from political debate, Tony Blair summed up the PM’s predicament. Jeremy Corbyn “has the most sensitive parts of Johnson’s political anatomy in his hands,” Blair said. Boris “cannot move without his consent.” Admiring their own achievement, and intoxicated by their own intelligence, opposition politicians are feeling very pleased with themselves. They expect to stop Britain from leaving the EU on October 31, and force Boris into breaking his promise to get us out by that date, “do or die.”
SEP29	Our MPs are behaving like bolshie students	As I walked through St James’s Park last week, a normal-looking, middle-aged white man wheeling a bicycle called something out to me. I could not quite hear what he said, so I put a hand to my ear to indicate this. “You’re a venal piece of filth,” he said, louder. I looked puzzled, and waited for him to explain. “You’re an MP, aren’t you?” he asked. “No.” “I’ve seen you on television. You’re a reporter, aren’t you?” “No.” “Well, you’re Establishment. You’re a venal piece of filth. This is a filthy country.” Then he passed on. As I walked away, I realised that I had no idea which side of the Brexit fence my accuser was on. Since he had half-recognised me and felt instinctively revolted, and since I have been a Brexiteer in public throughout, he could easily have been a Remainer. On the other hand, it is more often Leavers who complain about the Establishment, so he could easily have been one of them who had mistaken my allegiance.
SEP29	Boris Johnson has a simple message for his Brexit critics... surrender	Surrender. Surrender. Surrender. All the way through his extraordinary interview on The Andrew Marr Show, Boris Johnson said it again, and again, and again. It was like listening to some new Radio 4 parlour game, in which the contestant is challenged to use a given word as many times as possible inside a minute.  “Our chances of a deal have not been helped by the Surrender Act,” said the Prime Minister. And: “There has been an attempt to conceal the effect of the Surrender Act.” And: “On the Surrender Act, I think it’s important for viewers to understand why the Surrender Act is so pernicious.” And: “I must get back to my key point, which is that if you look at the Surrender Act…” The Act in question will require Mr Johnson to ask the EU for extra time, if he fails to bring back a Brexit deal. It isn’t actually called the Surrender Act; it’s called the Benn Act – or, more formally, the European Union (Withdrawal) (Number 2) Act 2019. But Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson’s strategist, believes that calling it “the Surrender Act” will rattle Mr Johnson’s opponents, whip up public anger against them, and boost support for Mr Johnson. So ministers are under orders to repeat it every chance they get.
SEP29	Giving 16 and 17-year-olds the vote would be egregiously cynical gerrymandering	Here we go again: there is speculation that the opposition parties could use their ability to seize control of the House of Commons to force through a law extending the franchise to 16 and 17 year-olds. Labour has already said that children should be able to vote in a second Brexit referendum, and given that this is one of those issues that unites Tory wets, socialists, big state liberals, and Remainers in the self-righteous belief that they are doing God’s work, it is not impossible that it will happen. None of the arguments for lowering the voting age hold water. Children are more dependent on adults than they used to be, are less likely to be in work from 16 (even the Saturday job is in decline), and are required by law to be in full-time education or training. While it is true that it is something of an injustice that 16 year-olds can’t vote but are liable to pay tax, why this is an argument for extending the franchise rather than exempting teenagers from direct taxation is lost on me. But I doubt the adult proponents of lowering the voting age care about any of this. Their intention is to gerrymander: they believe that all those new voters will fall reliably into line behind the Left/Remain parties. They praise the “idealism” of younger people, by which they mean the mindless adoption of lunatic ideas.

SEP29	Smart tech has taken over our lives – next, it will destroy our brains	Last winter, there was a particularly cold day, following a week of sleet and ice. I felt depressed, listless and frozen to the core. My boiler was broken and some friends were coming round for dinner. I snagged the last heater from my local shop and lugged it home. The flat was a mess, I could see my breath indoors and, despite my cold hands, I kept compulsively toggling through my email and social media accounts, as if that would somehow help.  Of course it didn’t. But once I’d torn myself away from my laptop and phone, sat down on my living room floor and began to assemble the heater, screwing its legs on with tiny screws from a plastic bag, I felt my mood rising. By simply exchanging the tug of the virtual for some DIY, I had sharply boosted my brain chemistry. It ended up being a brilliant evening.  Turns out, there are clear neurochemical rewards for getting our hands dirty in the physical world. Which is why people who knit are happier than those who don’t: a 2013 survey of 3,500 frequent knitters, published in the British Journal of Occupational Therapy showed that the more people picked up their needles, the better they felt.
SEP29	Saudi Arabia must get its act together if it is to survive its confrontation with Iran	It is not just the glaring gaps in Saudi Arabia’s air defences, exposed by the attacks on the country’s oil facilities, that should concern the kingdom’s ruling royal family. Even more troubling will be the decidedly lukewarm gestures of support the Saudis have received from staunch allies like Britain and the US. To put the crisis in its proper context, the well-coordinated drone and cruise missile attacks on Saudi’s Khurais oil field and the Abqaiq oil processing facility – in all likelihood instigated by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps – represent the most devastating assault on Saudi territory since the Gulf War in 1991, when the kingdom came under attack from Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s Scud missiles. Back then the Saudis could take comfort from the fact that the US-led coalition had assembled a force of around 500,000 troops to defend their interests, as well as those of other Gulf states. Saddam’s missiles, though, only caused minor damage, while the recent attack on Saudi’s oil infrastructure succeeded in inflicting the greatest damage the country’s oil industry has suffered since Saudi Arabia became one of the world’s major oil producers. The Saudis contend that the attack was as much directed at the global economy as it was the kingdom, with Adel Al Jubeir, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, pointing out last week that oil prices could have easily hit $150 a barrel had the damage been more severe.
SEP29	The public's opposition to Labour's Marxism shows this isn't the country Corbyn thinks it to be	But for the Supreme Court’s judgment the political story of the last week would have been the chaos, division and collapse of the Labour Party. Jeremy Corbyn’s personal rating is near-subterranean; his party registers barely 20 per cent in national opinion polls. It is near-obliterated in its former stronghold of Scotland; in its English and Welsh industrial heartlands its traditional voters feel alienated and repudiated by the metropolitan elite who run the party. Its truncated conference espoused policies that achieve ideological purity for the batty clique behind Corbynism, but are entirely anathematical to the floating voters Labour needs if it is to win an election – and to many of its own supporters. Dredging up a discredited policy from the 1980s, it wants to ban private education. Not only does this rob individuals of freedom of choice in how to bring up their children; it would end one of the most important charitable exercises in this country. An estimated 41,000 of the 500,000 children enjoying a private education have some or all of their fees paid by their schools.
SEP30	Mind your language: politicians who talk in clickbait are asking for trouble	Nigel Farage has been investigated by police after vowing to “take the knife to the pen-pushers in Whitehall” once the UK leaves the EU, it emerged on Sunday. However, despite an official complaint – filed by the Northern Ireland MEP Naomi Long, who felt that Farage's remarks made at a rally in Newport, South Wales last week were an “incitement to violence against staff in the Civil Service” – the police have decided not to pursue the matter, “since this was a clear-cut case of over-excitement: the kind that would have had our parents sighing and mouthing ‘OE’ to one another back in the day”, read a statement issued by the force. “And, let’s face it, in these excitable times bouts of verbal excess could happen to anyone. Indeed, they seem to be happening to everyone.”
SEP30	Mark Francois is the breakout star of Brexit. And in Manchester he showed why	The breakout star of Brexit? No contest. It’s got to be Mark Francois. The man’s everywhere. One moment he’s in the Commons, working himself into a fit of blustering self-combustion over the perfidies of Remain; the next he’s on TV, bellowing irate analogies about the Second World War, and getting into staring contests with europhile novelists.  To his critics, Mr Francois may well resemble a cross between Penfold from Danger Mouse and an angry pork pie. He may well look as if he dines exclusively at motorway service stations. He may well sound so volcanically enraged that at any moment he might physically explode, erupting over the Commons benches in a Vesuvius of molten Peperami.
SEP30	Free-spending Saj gave us a glimpse into the Tory future	I had assumed this year’s Conservative Party Conference would be a bit of a hollow affair. With MPs recalled to Parliament, I reasoned, the atmosphere would most likely resemble a village fete circa 1915, with all the young men away fighting at the front. How wrong I was. It was slightly emptier than usual, perhaps, with Ministers, MPs and aides shuttling to and fro between London and Manchester, but the upbeat mood inside was a world away from the sense of funereal hopelessness inspired by Theresa May. There were many more young people than at previous conferences, too.  Delegates in the main chamber gave a show of support for the Chancellor that felt more sincere than the receptions afforded some of Philip Hammond’s more anaemic offerings. Sajid Javid certainly isn’t one of nature’s orators, but his audience chuckled at his gags (“Given how much damage [Labour] will do every single day they’re in office, I’m glad they say they would only be working four days a week!”) and cheered dutifully as he unveiled his plans for the motorways. 
SEP30	Forcing parents to vaccinate their children isn't the way to solve this growing health crisis	Should we be taking radical steps to make the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine mandatory? This has been advocated by senior members of the medical community and now the Health Secretary has said he's considering it. “I think there’s a very strong argument for movement to compulsory vaccination,” Matt Hancock has said, “and I think the public would back us.”  It’s certainly tempting. Measles can be deadly for children – as well as causing pneumonia, deafness, epilepsy and brain damage. What’s more, it is preventable. The MMR vaccine was so successful that, based on data from 2014-2018, the UK was declared measles-free. No longer. A spike in measles cases caused the World Health Organisation to rescind the UK’s measles-free status over the summer. In England, the first dose of the MMR vaccine is now being given only 90.3 per cent of the time.  When it comes to freedom to make one’s own health choices, MMR is not straightforward. If a parent does not have their child vaccinated, it affects “herd immunity”. Data suggests that for such immunity to work, 95 per cent of the community has to be vaccinated. If enough parents refuse, it raises the risk for everybody. Supporters of compulsory vaccination also question the fairness as children who don’t have the jab benefit from a herd immunity created by the vaccinations of others. 
SEP30	The Remainer plot to impeach Boris is utterly ridiculous	As the seemingly never-ending Brexit circus continues to perform at venues across the UK, last week the details emerged of the latest trick to be staged by opposition MPs. According to Plaid Cymru leader Liz Saville Roberts, she and other MPs are considering impeaching the Prime Minister. Shadow minister Liam Byrne has even tweeted that the impeachment process should begin “immediately”.  Politicians must, of course, be held to account, but any such move would amount to an ill-judged power grab. Impeachment in the UK is an entirely “obsolete” process – not my words, but the finding of a Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege some twenty years ago. The impeachment procedure was no longer suitable back when it was last used in the early nineteenth century, and it’s yet more absurd to suggest that it has any relevance now.  Yes, it’s true, that, embarrassingly for Boris, he was one of the MPs who argued for the impeachment of Tony Blair after the Iraq War, but he was wrong then, and it would be wrong to give any truck to an impeachment motion now. We want Parliament to legislate, not to carry out acts of political revenge. 
SEP30	The rule of law is integral to conservatism. The Tories should not be in a fight with it	There is much to welcome in this year’s Conservative conference. The opening announcements on hospital construction are a powerful reminder of what can be done if the national finances are put in order. The infrastructure projects confirmed by the Chancellor are necessary for a strong economy in the future. And as the emphasis on better education and fighting crime also comes through, the outlines of an effective election campaign are clear. Even the loosening of purse strings required to fund many of these plans is in line with sensible government, provided it doesn’t get out of hand. For Tories, austerity has been the essential means of repairing the damage of Labour profligacy, not an end in itself, and investing taxpayers’ money to increase opportunity for all is in line with our One Nation traditions. Neither the demeanour of the grassroots Conservatives nor the pronouncements of the leadership give any support to the idea that this is a narrow or nationalistic party. The recently published plan to let overseas students stay and work in Britain is a welcome indication of a desire for this country to be open to the talents of the world. Boris Johnson shows no sign of abandoning the socially liberal instincts that eight years as Mayor of London reinforced in his personal philosophy.
SEP30	Much of the public simply is not bothered by Boris Johnson's 'woman problem'	It was perhaps inevitable that Boris Johnson’s premiership would, for all the efforts to promote the image of a nice, wholesome relationship with current girlfriend Carrie Symonds, be dogged by tales of sexual misadventures and impropriety. Only a few weeks ago, we could not go a day without his de facto spouse appearing in the press in some capacity or other, be it bringing home a rescued dog or championing environmentalism, but even that carefully managed storyline has been shattered by historic rumours of affairs and claims of wandering hands. One can already spot the cogs of No 10 grinding into motion to head the story off — not for nothing did Johnson, in an interview today, describe his behaviour in the Commons as ‘model’ — use of the word in that context may be intended to knock stories about former model Jennifer Arcuri off the top of Google search results. But will this have a lasting, damaging effect on the prime minister? I wouldn’t count on it. 
SEP30	Panicking Remainers are terrified that Boris Johnson has outwitted them all	There are fewer more ugly political phrases than “Bring it on”, with its pugilistic roots in American TV drama. Yet it has been adopted wholesale by politicians this side of the Atlantic as shorthand for “I’m really not scared of the forthcoming battle, honestly.” Most of the time they are, though. Not every time, admittedly. In 2006 and 2007, as Tony Blair made his plans to leave office and Gordon Brown ensured that he would replace him without any suggestion of anything so old fashioned as an internal party election, friendly Tory MPs would hiss their delight at the prospect. “Gordon is no Tony,” they would smirk over a G&T in Strangers’. And they were right. Briefly, of course, Gordon’s arrival at Number 10 gave most Labour MPs confidence that an early election would be a cakewalk for this dour son of the manse. “He’s not flash, he’s Gordon” boasted the posters outside Labour conference in Bournemouth as the party’s strategists sought to make a virtue of the new prime minister’s biggest perceived weakness.
SEP30	Is Boris Johnson laying the groundwork for a Brexit surrender?	Boris Johnson recently explained to Tory MPs why he was so incensed by Hilary Benn's Brexit delay mandating legislation, which he has taken to calling the "surrender bill". The Prime Minister had been getting along well with European leaders in his renegotiation mission, to the extent that – as one MP recounted being told – Angela Merkel turned to Donald Tusk to insist a deal needed to be hammered out "that Johnson can sign". Tory colleagues were told how the face of the European Council's chief fell on hearing this. But then the pressure had been eased on his European counterparts, Mr Johnson complained, because he had his "legs chopped off" by the legislation pushed through Parliament.
SEP30	These are dark days for Britain's institutions	As British soldiers sent to Ulster to save lives from the terrorists of IRA/Sinn Fein and extremist Unionists alike remain under threat of prosecution for events of nearly half century ago, the renegade priest Patrick Ryan broke cover to boast of his role in assisting the terrorist attacks in Hyde Park and at the Grand Hotel Brighton. Asked if he had any regrets he said, "Only that such attacks had not been more successful."  By that we have to assume that he meant that more innocent people might have been killed. What a contrast with the  seriously ill 74-year-old former British soldier who has been charged with the attempted murder of a man who refused a order to stop for questioning in County Tyrone 45 years ago and who was rightly given an unofficial guard of honour as he arrived in court. Of course, having lost many friends murdered by IRA terrorists and living with my terribly injured and wheel chair-bound wife, I have a strong interest in  bringing Ryan to justice, but we all have a lasting interest in seeing terrorists securely locked up. 
OCT1	If Brussels wants to end the Brexit saga, it must take Boris Johnson's proposal seriously	At last, we have a plan. With less than 30 days to go to Brexit, Boris Johnson’s government has presented the UK’s offer to the EU to resolve the impasse that has paralysed politics in Britain and soured relations between the UK and the rest of Europe. The two big questions are: first, will the EU accept it as a basis for negotiations or reject it out of hand; and, second, will it get through the Commons? The two are connected. If Brussels thinks it will be voted down by MPs then they have no incentive to agree. On the other hand if they do engage positively and make it clear that there will be no further extensions, the dynamics at Westminster will change and we could see an end to this protracted stalemate.
OCT1	Reason sleeps, anger stalks the land – but Brussels can end this purgatory	The weather here in Manchester these past few days has been as miserable as the national mood and there is just one question on everyone’s lips. Whether it be a Government minister, an MP who has fled the shenanigans at Westminster, a Conservative constituency representative enjoying an annual conference outing, a lobbyist promoting a pet cause or a journalist looking for a scoop, the question is this: what is going to happen? It is asked at parties, during chance encounters, over a cup of coffee or afternoon tea, by old friends and casual acquaintances. And the only honest answer is: I haven’t the faintest idea. I know what the plan is and it might work if there is a real willingness on all sides to, in the words of the Conservative conference slogan, “get Brexit done”. The Government is to present its proposals to the EU, framing them as an “offer”, which is the right approach since it makes us look less like the supplicants we appeared to be when Theresa May was running the show.
OCT1	A minimum wage hike is a risk worth taking for the Tories	When Labour brought in the minimum wage in the late Nineties, it was in the teeth of strong opposition from the Conservatives. In 1992, Michael Howard argued that its introduction would double unemployment, costing up to a million jobs. In 1998, Tory MPs stayed up all night attacking the policy in Parliament in a failed attempt to erode its support. Yet here we are, 20 years later, listening to a Tory Prime Minister make the case for pushing up the national minimum wage to one of the highest levels in the OECD. “We’re putting more money in people’s pockets,” said Boris Johnson. By “we”, presumably, he meant businesses that will actually shoulder the cost – and what that cost is, the Government signally failed to say. The grumbling from most businesses has been muted, however, and it’s worth asking why. The truth is that most of them recognise that it is time for employees to take home a bigger slice of the pie. British wage growth over the last decade has been dismal, despite a steady rise in the number of hours worked.
OCT1	There's nothing wrong with ministers finally listening to the public on crime	Murderers and rapists will no longer be automatically set free half-way through their prison sentences, the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland announced at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester. It’s a move that has been cheered by those who want the Tories to reassert themselves as the party of law and order, a policy theme which waned during the Coalition years and until now hasn’t emerged again. Conference attendees – and it seems to me there are more party members here than last year – were also relieved to hear that short prison sentences won’t be scrapped. The Government has binned David Gauke’s decision to do so earlier this year, when he was Justice Secretary (and still in the Tory party). That is good news. Admittedly, it is hard to rehabilitate offenders who are only in jail for short stretches but it does at least keep them off the streets and away from their unfortunate neighbours. Tories are wise to remember that it is the poorest in society, those without high hedges and sophisticated burglar alarms, who are disproportionately the victims of crime.
OCT1	Britain's frivolous obsession with Boris Johnson's personal life is politically unhealthy	It's getting ever closer to crunch time for our prime minister, and nobody knows what the final outcome will be. Meanwhile, the tide of salacious accusations regarding his personal life continues to rise with inevitable predictability.  I, for one, find it pathetic. I don't care how many flings Boris Johnson has had, when, or with whom. Honestly, I remain unfazed by the precision-timed allegation that he squeezed the thigh of a journalist 20 years ago. My only concern is how (if at all) he's going to deliver Brexit this month.   Over the weekend, I - of the liberal-leaning right - and my mother, the hard left - were discussing politics over toast. “I can’t believe,” she said, “that we live in a world where Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are both in power.” 
OCT1	Soft power, not sanctions, is the way to mould Chinese thought to Western ways	Eleven years ago at the Beijing Olympics the world watched as China celebrated its immense achievements. Lifting a billion people out of poverty and re-invigorating one of humanity’s great cultures is no mean feat. It was a beautiful spectacle. A deeply positive display of pride in modernity and tradition.  Today, The People’s Republic of China marks its 70th anniversary with a massive military parade. Tens of thousands of lock-stepped soldiers side by side with tanks, military drones and hypersonic nuclear ballistic missiles. It creates a very different impression for an international audience concerned about China’s values as a nation.  It’s hard to criticise the Chinese for holding a military parade. President Trump had his own spectacle of tanks and jets in Washington to celebrate Independence Day this year. Yet most people around the world know that the US has had, on the whole, a hugely positive impact on world peace and economic development. They are not yet sure that the same will be true of China. 
OCT1	Boris Johnson thinks he has the perfect formula to persuade Left-wing Leavers to abandon Labour	Since before Boris Johnson became prime minister in July, the Labour Party and sympathetic journalists have been warning about the extremism about to be unleashed by this new Government. This is standard fare in UK politics. The other side must always be presented as the most extreme iteration of their party thus far (that Corbyn’s Labour is exactly that is merely confirmation of the occasional accuracy of a broken clock). Where such a charge of extremism doesn’t stick – as was the case with John Major in 1992 and 1997 – the attack changes to one on a prime minister’s ineffectiveness and inability to take decisions. But the reason the extremist allegation is preferred is because it seeks to narrow the options of the opposition to steer its tanks onto your own ground. It is an indispensable feature of the UK political system that each of the two main parties seeks, in the run-up to polling day, to attract the support of those who voted for the enemy last time round. Not only is this a daring strategy, without this phenomenon of Labour-Tory switchers, there would be no change of government at elections. If you’re ever desirous of seeing a young person’s face contort in bemused confusion, try explaining this to a Momentum activist.
OCT1	Boris Johnson is a BBC interviewer’s nightmare... for this very simple reason	Boris Johnson is unstoppable. Literally. His interviewers can’t get a word in edgeways. Because the man simply will not stop talking.  Quite plainly, it’s a deliberate and well-honed technique. Call it the juggernaut, because that’s what it’s like: the helpless interviewer is utterly drowned out by a vast onrushing juggernaut of bluster, 10 solid tons of thundering waffle. BLAM! At maximum speed the juggernaut roars straight through all obstacles, traffic cones scattered, crash barriers crushed, its driver hell-bent on just blasting on through, zooming away from whatever question he’s been asked by babbling out buzzwords and unrelated policy announcements for whole minutes on end, louder and faster, louder and faster, the interviewer now no more than a frantic dot in his rear-view mirror. Today at Conservative party conference the Prime Minister gave three live interviews on TV and radio. First in the juggernaut’s path was Dan Walker of BBC Breakfast. The poor man didn’t stand a chance.
OCT1	The architects of Project Fear can't resist repeating their errors with a no-deal Brexit	How bizarre to hear Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, claiming on the Today programme on Monday morning that her organisation was “pretty well right” in the economic projections it made in 2016 in the event of Brexit – a triumph for what she described as the CBI’s “50 year track record of evidence-based, fact-based economic analysis”.     You cannot, strictly, accuse the CBI of being wrong in its March 2016 document: "Leaving the EU: implications for the UK economy". Forecasts made for 2020 assumed that if we voted to leave we would have left by then. Clearly, we haven’t got to 2020 yet, let alone left the EU. But for the same reason the CBI cannot claim to have been right, either. Moreover, the CBI expressed its forecasts in relative terms – what would happen if we left compared with if we stayed.  Unless someone can train a telescope on the parallel universe where Britain voted to remain, we will never know. Even so, the CBI’s 2016 report is hardly a great advert for the skills of its economic forecasters. If we left the EU with a  trade deal, it claimed, by 2020 GDP per capita would be 3 per cent lower than if we stayed. If we left without a deal it would be 5.4 per cent lower. Employment would be down by 550,000 (if a trade deal) and 950,000 (if no deal) – again relative to a remain vote. The 2016 document also included the CBI’s underlying assumption for what would happen if we voted to remain. Annual GDP growth, it suggested, would average 2.3 per cent per annum between 2015 and 2020. Employment in 2020, it predicted, would be 32.2 million.
OCT1	Boris Johnson needs to shift from his failing Brexit plan to avoid catastrophe	At Conservative Conference in Manchester, the mood feels upbeat and optimistic. Boris Johnson is clearly popular with the party. When he speaks tomorrow, he will likely be warmly received - whatever he says. He is, however, a man on the precipice of a strategic dilemma which threatens his premiership and our prosperity as a country. On the one hand, he could stick with the divisive, confrontational approach being pushed by the Vote Leave Team. On the other, he could capitalise on the hard Left's regressive and highly damaging agenda and take a more traditional, centrist campaign. If he is sensible, he will use his speech tomorrow to choose the latter course.  This would require him to build bridges with those he has alienated to date. Ultimately, such a move would likely require him to part company with Cummings. However, although such a move is clearly not in the interests of some of the Prime Minister’s advisers, it might be Johnson’s best hope of winning a majority come the next election. 
OCT2	Boris's Brexit plan is the real deal: it would be a fatal mistake for the EU to underestimate him now	There is a new ideology in town, and it’s called Johnsonism. It is patriotic, optimistic, consumerist and designed to go with the grain of human nature: it doesn’t fit neatly into any of the old, abstract, Tory boxes. Just as most voters straddle “Right” and “Left”, depending on the issue, Boris Johnson believes in a pick-and-mix philosophy, albeit one grounded in the different strands of Tory thinking. Combined with his joyful, unconventional delivery, Johnsonism will prove extraordinarily potent when an election finally comes. Brexit is an essential component of this new doctrine, but the domestic agenda is just as important: the Prime Minister’s speech at party conference yesterday was his clearest attempt yet to forge a popular Conservatism for the 2020s. A real Brexit is therefore best understood as a necessary but not sufficient part of Johnson’s plan to reboot Britain. In some ways, the PM is moving the party to the Right. He is far tougher on crime. Theresa May and David Cameron occasionally paid lip service to capitalism; Johnson is a true believer in entrepreneurship, and desperate to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s paleo-communism. The PM doesn’t like red tape, is pro-home ownership, pro-trade and generally anti-nannying. He is supportive of immigration but wishes to control it.
OCT2	Leo Varadkar has painted himself into a corner by cynically using the Irish border to stymie Brexit	The 320-mile Irish land border runs through towns, along rivers and even divides individual farms. Most of the 270 or so crossing points are marked, if at all, by a simple sign or a white line on the road. Since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, this largely invisible border has replaced the sentry posts and security checks of the Troubles. Nobody wants them back. Yet the Irish frontier has been cynically used in an attempt to stymie the biggest act of democracy in British history. Boris Johnson’s “alternative arrangements” for the Irish border didn’t exactly go down well in Dublin yesterday. While the European Union has said that it is open to talks, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described the plan as “not promising” and said that it “does not appear to form the basis for an agreement”. On cue, the outrage machine was cranked up. Britain’s Brexit impasse owes much to home-grown shortcomings – Theresa May’s weak leadership, venal party politics and an overwhelmingly pro-Remain political and media class. But Dublin has also played a big role.
OCT2	Eton's Tory alumni are part and parcel of what makes my old school so great	Of course Eton should be proud that it produced Boris and Rees-Mogg  We sometimes have to run for cover, us Old Etonians. The flak can come from all directions. Social media, naturally, flings out abuse. Famous actors, some my contemporaries, eagerly disparage the school, fearful perhaps that they may lose out on roles when it’s revealed that they too came from this place of extreme privilege. Politicians, usually Marxist ones, revel in using the word Etonian as a pejorative term. And they never use the adjunct “old”. Even if you went there 30 years ago, you’re still an Etonian – a stuck up, nose in the air toff, strutting about with your stiff collar, tail coat and money pouring out of your pockets.
OCT2	Boris Johnson could build a powerful new constituency in the young liberals who are rejecting the EU	It says a lot about the state of Britain that a suggestion from Jon Snow last week that there should be a second Brexit vote because “so many Brexit voters have died” barely got any attention outside the Westminster bubble.  The sad truth is we’ve all got so used to hardline Remainers shouting about how they’ll triumph once all the crusty oldies are dead, we can hardly be bothered to be outraged anymore. But it’s still worth pointing out just how misguided the argument is.  Young leavers were a formidable - if forgotten - force three years ago (nearly a third of 18-24s voted for Brexit), and their ranks have swelled since. In 2016, most young people who’d grown up with the EU as a backdrop to their lives couldn’t see the point of rocking the boat (myself included). But after three years of Brexit in the headlines, we’ve been forced to look into what the EU actually does, and many of us don’t like it one bit. 
OCT2	Diane Abbott did better than expected at PMQs – but that isn't saying much	There was much chatter beforehand about the prospect of Diane Abbott taking her leader’s place at Prime Minister’s Questions this week. Unkind individuals relished the prospect of the shadow home secretary producing an underwhelming performance at the despatch box while the Prime Minister was addressing his conference and Jeremy Corbyn was tending to his marrows. But such hopes were always going to be dashed. Not that Abbott’s performance was impressive – it was not. She certainly won’t gain the plaudits that her Shadow Cabinet colleague, Rebecca Long-Bailey, enjoyed after her first outing substituting for the leader. But she survived. Just about. Which, given expectations and fears on the Labour side, can be counted as an extraordinary achievement. The reason hopes of a complete meltdown were misplaced is because asking questions at PMQs isn’t anywhere near as difficult as answering them. In fact, although he did a workmanlike job standing in for Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab should have been the subject of at least as much pre-match analysis as was aimed at Ms Abbott. 
OCT2	Boris Johnson brought the house down with a speech that was pure Tommy Cooper	People always say that Boris Johnson’s greatest inspiration is Churchill. I’m not sure that’s true. I think it’s Tommy Cooper. Take that speech he gave on Wednesday, at the Tory party conference in Manchester. It was typical Boris Johnson, but also, in many ways, typical Tommy Cooper. Obviously the physical scruffiness (jacket sleeves too short, hair plastered not quite successfully into place) – but also the perpetual air of rumpled discombobulation.
OCT2	Boris Johnson's bold plan to bin the backstop will be doomed without a domestic mandate	The Government’s plan for replacing the backstop is a bold attempt to seize the initiative in the negotiations with the EU. The full text of the plan has yet to be presented to Brussels, but the outline reported by the Telegraph builds on the ideas that Boris Johnson has been talking about for some time. Until now all sides have agreed in theory that the UK could leave the Customs Union but have not confronted what this means in practice. Looked at from first principles, the Government’s proposals involve some important compromises. The plan seeks to share the burden of checks between the land border and the sea border: ‘two borders for four years.’ In declaring that Northern Ireland should leave the EU’s Customs Union along with the rest of the UK, Johnson is honouring a commitment to the Unionists of Northern Ireland and making an important statement about the integrity of the UK. As the Prime Minister put it on Tuesday, ‘in the end a sovereign, united country must have a single customs territory.’ The hope that Johnson would readily return to the EU’s original Northern Ireland-only backstop seems to have been scotched for now. In other respects, the package represents a significant move towards the EU’s position. In proposing regulatory alignment not only on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) rules but also for industrial goods, the Government has accepted the need for checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The assumption is that the DUP would accept this, despite the party’s famous opposition to an Irish Sea border.
OCT2	Good-humoured Boris just gave us the best speech of his career	That was pitch perfect. Easily the best speech he has ever given and the best party leader’s conference speech for a very long time. It was to be expected that he would go big on hope, confidence and optimism but there had to be a question as to how convincing that pitch would be as well as a risk that he might go too far and look flippant. The toxicity of the national mood could easily have made enthusiasm about the future appear arrogant or irresponsible. Maybe, after all, it was uncharacteristic gravity that was called for in these terribly divisive times. But in the end there was no need for him to be anything but what he was obviously inclined to be. It was the best version of his good humoured, resoundingly forceful self that we got. And it rang true.
OCT2	What the Conservative Party Conference lacked in MPs it made up for in defiant unity	Those who attended will be glad to leave behind the hot air of Westminster It might seem strange to hold a party conference while parliamentary business goes on, hundreds of miles away, but in some ways nothing could be more appropriate for our current political climate. Gathered in Manchester, the Conservatives delight in being away from the SW1 bubble, relishing the opportunity to differentiate their government and its agenda from the muddled din of Parliament. Despite the continuing saga of lost commons votes, lost court cases, and lost MPs, the Tory members have a renewed confidence. People here care far more about the latest YouGov poll than they do about current parliamentary hijinks. An election is coming, and the party seems refreshed and confident of victory.
OCT2	The Tories will regret not making Britain's military a higher priority	It is perfectly understandable for the Conservatives to promote the NHS, schools and police as their main priorities at their Manchester conference. This could well be the last gathering of the Tory faithful before the next general election. And assuming Boris Johnson can deliver on the party’s primary “Get Brexit Done” objective, moving their campaign into policy zones traditionally occupied by Labour should help to broaden their electoral appeal. However, the Tories risk missing a trick by not also highlighting their commitment to another issue vital to our national well-being, namely the defence of the realm. For generations the Conservatives have burnished their reputation by positioning themselves as the party that can be relied upon to ensure our Armed Forces are properly resourced and funded. This claim no longer holds true after the damage they have inflicted on the Armed Forces since David Cameron entered Downing Street in 2010, which may well explain the Tories’ reticence about discussing defence at Manchester.
OCT3	'Johnsonism' amounts to shrewd politics – terrible economics	The Tories could be setting themselves a dangerous ideological trap In his speech to the Conservative Party Conference yesterday, Boris Johnson made what many commentators hailed as an unapologetic defence of capitalism. He spoke of “championing the wealth creating sector of our country – and I don't think we've done it enough over the past few years – extolling the merits of free-market capitalism."  "Yes, I'm going to use that word,'' he added, "I'm absolutely determined to make it the core of my campaign."
OCT3	The government should hold its ground on state pension equality	Today's High Court decision corrects a historic discrimination against men Earlier today, campaigners against the government’s handling of changes to the state pension for women lost their case in the High Court. This seems the right decision, both in law, economics, and morally. The bare facts are relatively straightforward. Up until 2010, women received their state pension at 60, while men had to wait until 65. That age has now been equalised at 65 and is due to rise to 66 for both men and women by 2020 (with further increases to come over the coming decades). As a result, many women born in the 1950s who were otherwise close to receiving their state pension have had to wait several years longer for the money.
OCT3	You’re tired: Sorry, Lord Sugar, but it’s all over for The Apprentice	It is common knowledge – in my household, at any rate – that I bow to no one in my shameless devotion to the pleasure of reality shows Love Island and The Apprentice. Now that cardigan and cover-ups season is upon us, Lord Sugar’s show is once again on our screens, and I confess I snuggled down on the sofa this week full of spiteful anticipation. My 17-year-old has avidly watched it with me for the past five years or so, for anthropological reasons – in case she ever has to fend off a hostile takeover bid in some crazed battle of the interns. Not this year.
OCT3	The purity of Greta Thunberg and her young anti-BP comrades is delusional	There are few sensations more discomfiting to a woolly centrist than agreeing with Vladimir Putin. “I don’t share the common excitement about the speech by Greta Thunberg,” sniffed the Russian president this week. “No one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and diverse. People in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden. Go and explain to developing countries why they should continue living in poverty.” What a state of affairs this is, when a constitutional despot is the only person brave enough to speak truth to a frowning teenager. Not one of the adults in the room managed so much as a politely demurring cough when Thunberg made her now-famous speech to the UN, accusing the older generation of “betraying” the young. How they whooped and clapped, like ingratiating courtiers at the feet of an intemperate queen, as she dished out her final warning: “If you choose to fail us, we will never forgive you.” But, but, but, I found myself shouting at YouTube. What about the millions lifted out of poverty on the watch of the older generation? What about soaring life expectancy; the halving of child mortality rates; the dramatic improvements in global health and literacy? Is all this part of the Great Betrayal? Or could it be that the old folks actually did their best? Perhaps it’s harder than it looks, kids – this business of making people richer and healthier without harming the planet.
OCT3	Boris Johnson presented his Brexit plan... and John Bercow was (almost) speechless	For Tory Brexiteers, things were at last looking up. Three years of frustration, anger and humiliation, it seemed, were at an end. Their prayers had finally been answered. John Bercow had lost his voice. It wasn’t clear what the cause was – a cold, an allergy, or simple overuse – but at any rate there was no mistaking it: today in the Commons, the Speaker could barely speak. Sometimes, he gasped and rasped, like a 3,000-year-old mummy working its way through a carton of Woodbines. At other times, he grumbled and growled, like a bear with a two-day hangover. At other times still, he hacked and hissed, like a cat trying to cough up a Brillo pad.
OCT3	Will conflicted Labour rebels actually back Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?	The most important factor in Brexit as far as Westminster is concerned isn’t to be found in Boris Johnson’s new proposals. While he has succeeded where Theresa May failed in uniting his party and his coalition partners, the DUP, behind his position, they are only a starting position and he will need at least a few Labour votes to pass any deal that he comes back with – if, that is, he comes back with a deal at all. Of course, throughout the Brexit process, Labour MPs have had a similar relationship to voting for a Brexit deal as fans of Tottenham Hotspur have to winning trophies: talk to some of them and one or two will tell you that this is the hour and this is the time. Then the moment of truth comes around and it turns out that perhaps next week, or next year, will be the hour of destiny. These Labour MPs are caught between three instincts: their sense that backing Brexit is the only way to keep their seats, their fear that bailing out the Conservatives will imperil their hopes of being reselected by their members, and a belief, however deep it is buried, that they would prefer to remain in the European Union all things being equal.
OCT3	Boris Johnson's Brexit plan is an attempt to put lipstick on a pig. Far better to walk away now	The Prime Minister’s long anticipated offer to the EU is a commendable effort to improve on a deeply flawed document, namely Theresa May’s disastrous "deal". It contains some positive aspirations which, if agreed by Brussels, should take our country nearer to the intended goal of Brexit. To my mind, however, it still resembles nothing so much as an attempt to put lipstick on a pig. The masterstroke of the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, was to get Mrs May to agree to the Irish backstop. Convincing an avowed Unionist like her that it was acceptable to trap part of the UK inside the EU rulebook with no voice, no vote and no veto required a certain type of political nous. I think our nation owes a debt to the 28 “Spartans”, the Conservative MPs who quite rightly rejected her surrender document. Without them, Northern Ireland was to have been sold down the river.  With that said, the new proposed arrangements for Northern Ireland have their problems too. Indeed, they may have deep implications for the future integrity of the United Kingdom.
OCT3	The collapse of democracy in Hong Kong is the story of a very British betrayal	The 70th anniversary of Chinese Communism passed with all the militarised bravado anticipated. How tragically appropriate that the event will be remembered not for China’s muscle flexing, but for the shooting in the chest of a Hong Kong protester at point blank range. This is just the latest betrayal of millions of Chinese who 30 years ago saw a false dawn of freedom ended in the massacre of Tiannemen Square. But it’s not only Beijing who is guilty of betrayal. "Two systems, one country" is perishing. A close look at its decomposition reveals the anatomy of a very British betrayal. And like most betrayals the effects of our sins are felt far beyond our own consciences.  I write from Taipei where Britain’s abandonment of Hong Kong feels very real indeed. Hong Kong was not a latter day acquisition for the Empire. The territory became a Crown Colony in 1842 while the Qing dynasty was still reigning. For context, this was the the same year that Queen Victoria first used a train. That's 177 years of relationship with only a short hiatus during the Japanese occupation. Who would have believed that 17 decades after the Treaty of Nanjing, the Union Jack would be hoisted in defiance of Beijing by protesters proclaiming “I am not Chinese” in full-throated unison?
OCT3	Ireland is playing the long game and will not buy into Boris Johnson's Brexit deal	Boris Johnson’s big and bold, first and final offer to the EU – “constructive and far-reaching . . . good and creative” was the advance billing – was hailed by Conservatives in Manchester as the way to break the Brexit deadlock. But in Dublin it is viewed as nothing like that. Leo Varadkar seems to have struck up a better personal relationship with Boris Johnson than he endured with Mr Johnson’s predecessor. That can help things, but it won’t butter any parsnips on its own. The fact is that the Irish and EU position is miles away from the British one, and Johnson’s proposals won’t close it. Mr Varadkar gave his initial response to the British proposals at Government Buildings yesterday afternoon, and while a full formal response won’t come until the formal proposals are fully digested, it is pretty clear that the new plan isn’t going to fly with Dublin or with Brussels.
OCT4	Will any of the police and politicians involved face justice for the Carl Beech scandal?	Nick (Carl Beech) was pronounced a “credible and true” witness by a Metropolitan Police Officer in December 2014, when he claimed he had suffered, as a boy, from appalling acts of sexual and violent abuse at the hands of powerful men. Now Beech is serving 18 years for perverting the course of justice, fraud and possession of indecent images.  We can all make mistakes, of course; but now that the Met have lost their battle to prevent Sir Richard Henriques’s devastating report being published virtually in full, we can at last fully understand that the words “credible and true” were not the sloppy usage of one middle-ranking officer. They were part of a policy.   Sir Richard shows that the senior officer in charge, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, had, with colleagues, agreed that this line would be given to the media once Nick’s astonishing accusations had been made public. When DAC Rodhouse settled on this policy, he had not even met the witness. Nor had he read Beech’s police interviews and his blogs. He therefore could not compare their obvious inconsistencies. 
OCT4	Is the robotic suit the first step on the slippery slope to us all becoming cyborgs?	I don’t know about you, but I am extremely grateful for my wearable augmentation tech. Some may frown at the idea of this kind of enhancement, which takes my bodily frailties and puts me on a par with the best. But the truth is I wouldn’t even be able to type this article without it. I’m talking about my glasses. Which are, in principle, little different to the astonishing exoskeleton revealed this week by French researchers, who restored movement to a paralysed man – just as my glasses restore unfuzzy sight to me. But where glasses seem humble, unthreatening, there is something unsettling and slippery-slopey about the sight of a man encased in a robotic suit, even if manipulating that suit is currently a tortuous process which in no way replicates the dexterity and deftness of the human frame.
OCT4	Even as a half-German Remainer, I rather liked Michael Gove's speech – despite the bum note	Oh dear. Are we incapable of agreeing about anything nowadays? What was supposed to be a celebratory evening at the German Embassy has instead ended in a bitter row over a speech given by Michael Gove. The occasion was the Day of German Unity, which marks the anniversary of German reunification eleven months after the fall of the Berlin Wall. To celebrate this peaceful revolution, the German Embassy in London throws a big party every year including lots of hearty Germanic grub washed down with lots of delicious German beer. I always go and invariably have a splendid time, although not every year is as eventful or as controversial as this one.
OCT4	Does Eton wield an unhealthy influence over British politics?	The Battle of Waterloo may, as the Duke of Wellington declared, have been won on the playing fields of Eton, but is the hallowed public school responsible for the modern-day battle over Europe that is Brexit? That at least is the logical conclusion of the complaint by Tony Little, a former Head Master of Eton, who this week bemoaned the number of Old Boys at the heart of government.  “I think it is unfortunate at the moment and we’d all be better served as a nation if this particular clutch of people hadn’t been educated at the same school,” he told the Henley Literary Festival.
OCT4	Metro elite Rory Stewart has found his 'safe space' in London	Until a few days ago Rory Stewart was still on a mission to save his Leave-voting constituents from themselves. “Really important reminder for Cumbria,” he tweeted last Saturday, “I voted against no deal to protect Cumbrian farmers”.  Alas, it seems, the ungrateful bumpkins don’t want to be helped.  Today, Rory has announced that his days soliciting for votes around the farmyards and milking parlours are over. He will not stand again in his Penrith and the Borders constituency – which in 2016 voted 55 percent to leave. Instead, like Dick Wittington, he is hoofing it up to London to revive his political fortunes – and stand for Mayor.   He will at least find the path well-trodden. Already there seems to be a trickle of Remain MPs who are seeking London seats. New Liberal Democrat recruit Luciana Berger is planning to stand at the next election in Finchley and Golders Green rather than Liverpool, where she currently sat for Labour. Chuka Umunna is retreating from Tooting to the Cities of London and Westminster.
OCT4	Extinction Rebellion has turned the green movement into a bloody culture war	Yesterday Extinction Rebellion (ER) paid a trip to the Treasury and attempted to hose it down with 1,800 litres of fake blood. The plan backfired. Literally. Perhaps having survived too long on vegan sausages, the protesters weren’t strong enough to keep control over their instrument and liquid sprayed all over the streets. Even atheists who were watching might be tempted to conclude it was a sign from God, warning demonstrators that they should cease these mad attacks. Unfortunately this sort of vandalism, masquerading as environmentalism, shows no signs of going away. Londoners are being warned that for the next two weeks 20,000 eco-warriors will close down different areas, such as the City Airport and Westminster, with 4,000 activists willing to be arrested for the cause. This is part of an international rebellion, taking part in 60 different cities. ER boasts that it uses “non-violent civil disobedience” to fight climate change, but what’s so “civil” about damaging London’s historical buildings? It’s criminal and hardly in the interests of environmentalism given the energy it will take to clear up the mess.
OCT4	No deal may be the only way of honouring the Brexit vote – and it doesn't need to be a disaster	Despite the parliamentary shenanigans of the last few weeks, no deal is still the default Brexit outcome unless a withdrawal deal is agreed or Brexit reversed. It is vital that the UK is prepared. Another extension will not alter the options: it merely delays the inevitable reckoning Parliament has put off for over three years. For all the shadow boxing between London and Brussels, at this stage, the EU has little incentive to seriously engage with the UK’s latest Brexit proposals for replacing the Northern Ireland backstop. There are genuine EU objections to the new UK proposals which would need to be worked through via negotiation but, ultimately, with this Parliament firmly opposed to no deal, Brussels can play for time in the hope something better will turn up. It therefore seems increasingly likely that, sooner or later, the public will need to choose in a general election between a Government determined to leave the EU, without a deal if necessary, and an administration which would either put the issue to another referendum or stop Brexit altogether.
OCT4	The EU wants to bind Facebook to its will again – but this time it may have gone too far	I write a lot about how Facebook is like a government. It has a private speech council which draws up rules covering 2.4bn people. It has a police force of 15,000 moderators who enforce those rules across the globe. It has a powerful executive leader in the shape of god-emperor Mark Zuckerberg, and soon it will even have its own "supreme court" to hear appeals.  But every so often, an actual old-school government – one of those "weary giants of flesh and steel", as the internet pioneer John Perry Barlow called them – decides to throw its weight around, and reminds us that multinational internet corporations have not replaced the politicians quite yet. On Thursday the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that European courts could force Facebook to take down posts, videos and photos across the world, not only within the EU or within their own borders. Even if the content in question is not illegal elsewhere, courts can require it to be blocked or removed anyway, whether it's libel or hate speech.
OCT4	It's not just what Boris Johnson says, it's the way he says it that alienates Scotland	With his proposed new Brexit deal can Boris Johnson become the key to Scots backing the Tories north of the border? Or does he remain the problem? That is the conundrum that Scottish politicians have to work out as they await the reaction to the Prime Minister’s move to end the international stalemate over the UK leaving the EU and "Get Brexit Done". And whilst the nitty gritty of his latest offer to Brussels is still being debated, one salient fact remains: the details might be important but it is the style of this Prime Minister that still remains the make or break factor with the Scottish electorate.
OCT4	If the EU rejects Boris’s offer, it’s full steam ahead for a no-deal Brexit	Something very strange is happening in the House of Commons. The hardline Brexiteers who refused to back Theresa May’s deal seem to be in agreement with the 21 rebels expelled from the Tory party. Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan, they say, is something they can vote through. Similar noises are coming from the more level-headed Labour MPs; ditto Arlene Foster’s DUP. Suddenly, we have something entirely new: a majority in parliament for a specific Brexit plan. Those fighting hardest in their respective trenches can see a chance for peace. “It’s a massive sea-change,” says Nigel Dodds, who like all other DUP MPs refused to back Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement. “If the EU 27 support it, then so will I,” says Labour’s Ruth Smeeth. Steve Baker, the hardball-playing head of the European Research Group of Tories, says the Boris plan could turn into “a deal that I can proudly vote for.” Stephen Kinnock, who put together a group of 25 “Labour MPs for a deal”, says even his group is ready to defy Jeremy Corbyn if there’s a breakthrough. “If Dublin and Brussels are happy,” he says, “then we’re happy.” But Dublin and Brussels aren’t happy with the Boris offer. “Not fit for purpose,” grunts Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister. “Our first reaction was not positive”, says Guy Verhofstadt. “Unconvinced,” says Donald Tusk. “To be frank, lots of work still needs to be done,” laments Michel Barnier. We can see the familiar performance of a le grand non from Brussels – complete with plenty of sighing and heaving. The chances of a deal this month, we hear from Dublin, are virtually nil.
OCT5	This Government won't back down on Brexit	We are approaching the moment of truth. The UK and the EU need to negotiate a new approach to the Irish border issue. Or we must leave without a deal. It is doable – but only if the EU works with us. Brussels must now decide whether it wants to break the deadlock and see us leave on good terms with a deal, or no deal.  On Wednesday, the Prime Minister set out our proposals for a new Protocol on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to replace the anti-democratic backstop. A backstop which was, let’s remember, rejected by the UK Parliament three times. The proposals represent a very reasonable compromise which honours the referendum result and delivers Brexit. As the backstop would have applied indefinitely, it meant we could have been compelled to follow European law and the rulings of the European Court of Justice forever.  Our new proposals bring the whole of the UK out of the EU Customs Union, meaning Northern Ireland will be part of the UK’s customs territory – where it belongs. We will not set it adrift. 
OCT5	Leave voters can see what's going on. They won't blame Boris if Brexit is delayed	Here’s how it will go. The EU, after some sneering and posturing, will reject Boris Johnson’s deal. It will do so because it is convinced that the Benn Act – we’re not supposed to call it the Surrender Act, so let’s go with Abject National Grovelling Act – will force us to seek another extension. It expects that extension to lead to a general election, which it hopes our pro-Brussels parties will win. Brexit could then be reversed: total victory for the federalists, total ruin for the souverainistes. And should Boris win, well, Brussels can always come back to his proposals then. Can I be certain of this sequence of events? Of course not: no one can be certain of anything in British politics at the moment. But I am pretty sure about the first part. Whether through design or through gargantuan stupidity, the MPs who voted to make “no deal” impossible last month instead made a deal impossible. As long as Eurocrats believe they can keep us in by saying “no”, they will carry on saying “no”. This tactic has required some hurried goalpost-shifting. Until now, the EU line – loyally broadcast by most British media – was that the priority was to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Boris’s proposals plainly obviate the need for any new frontier infrastructure, so Brussels and Dublin have suddenly taken to arguing that, in fact, any divergence in customs duties is unacceptable.
OCT5	With the right plan, Boris can turn his free-market dream into reality	How heartening it is for supporters of free markets to see a Conservative Prime Minister stand up and make the case for capitalism. Certainly that was how I felt when I saw Boris Johnson, during his speech to the Conservative Conference on Wednesday, putting a dynamic free market at the heart of his message to the party and the country. Gone was the miserable managerialism of Theresa May, replaced with a Prime Minister actually willing to praise the virtues of the market over the state. British politics has been missing somebody willing to make this argument for quite some time. The signs are there that the broader public agree. Dilly dallying on Brexit and implementing nannying policies that infantilise ordinary people dragged Britain’s most successful political party to just nine per cent in the polls at the European elections in May. But, while Boris may have correctly diagnosed the reasons behind his party’s malaise, how can he turn free-market rhetoric into real-world results? Fortunately, we at the Adam Smith Institute have a few ideas for him. At the conference in Manchester last week we launched our Neoliberal Manifesto – a plan for a freer and more prosperous Britain. The concept of “neoliberalism” may loom large as a bogeyman in the imagination of the Left, but it is increasingly being embraced as a badge of honour by idealists on both sides of the Atlantic who refuse to commit to socialist revolution.
OCT5	Sacred Mysteries: The saint who was like John Henry Newman	John Henry Newman is to be canonised in St Peter’s Square on Sunday, October 13. The Prince of Wales will be there. (The Queen no longer travels abroad, so he is the most senior member of the Royal family who could go.) Newman, who lived from 1801 to 1890, is the most modern English person to be declared a saint. He was very English indeed, hardly speaking a foreign language, despite his deep learning in Latin and Greek. I find him a most sympathetic character, and there are acres of his writings to get to know – 31 volumes of his letters and diaries alone. What was he like? To say he was like St Gregory of Nazianzus (329-390) seems little help, since most of us have no inkling of what that saint was like. But Newman systematically studied the Church Fathers from 1828 onwards, and knew Gregory very well, liked him and saw their similarity.
OCT5	Labour’s pro-deal faction could yet be key to deciding Britain's future	The Labour party could be about to determine the future of the country. Now there’s a sentence you did not expect to read here. Bear with me, this is not a joke. The bizarre concatenation of absurdities which are dominating our politics have thrown up a paradoxical state of affairs that might produce what would have seemed, around a week ago, the most wildly unlikely outcome imaginable. Of course, I am not referring to the official Corbyn-led Labour party which has become utterly irrelevant to the most important argument of the day, nor to the Starmer-Thornberry Remain platoon whose forces seem determined to break faith with the party’s historic roots and traditional moral mission. No, the Labour faction which could exercise this power is that band of real rebels: the backbench posse of MPs who are refusing to join in the blanket refusal to back a Johnson deal and thereby strengthen the belief that a majority in Parliament is unequivocally committed to remaining in the EU. 
OCT5	#MeToo two years on: 'Why 12 women are gagging our social media accounts for 12 hours today'	It was on October 5 2017 that the first allegations against Harvey Weinstein emerged and #Metoo dominated social media, as the words of broken women were truly heard for the first time Women who had suffered sexual assault, sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace finally had a voice. Two years have passed and yet I continue to drown in the anonymous stories of women facing pregnancy and maternity discrimination. They can’t speak out about their experience as they have often been silenced by non-disclosure agreements; a legal weapon used by some powerful employers to cover up abhorrent behavior towards women who dared to use their uterus. These new mums are career women, with years of experience, but they are bullied, harassed and forced out of their jobs - then legally gagged. The silence is deafening. 
OCT5	Why I don't believe in 'Sober October'	I keep getting emails from public relations people telling me it’s “Sober October”. These PRs wonder in their emails if I have thought about writing a piece on the trend for going alcohol-free, because, if so, here are some case studies I could use in my article, and these case studies – quite coincidentally, of course – found that the alcohol-free wine that the PR person is being paid to promote made the whole decision effortless. Effortless! I mean! Imagine if the process of going teetotal felt effortless! And as for alcohol-free wine? Ha ha ha! Ha! As anyone who has even glanced at this page will know, I do Sober October every year. I also do Dry January, February, March, April and so on and so on, until I am standing at a Christmas party listening to someone repeat themselves for the 87th time, wondering when I can go home and weep for the booze-soaked life I once lived that at least made myself and other drunk people bearable.
OCT5	The Special One – or a spent force? Dominic Cummings has become the Jose Mourinho of politics	We’re always being told that Dominic Cummings’s role models are military strategists and theoretical physicists. Personally, though, I think that’s nonsense. I think his role model is Jose Mourinho. Admittedly, the former manager of Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid is not mentioned anywhere in the countless lengthy blog posts that the Prime Minister’s chief adviser has published on the subject of his inspirations. Yet the similarities between the two men’s methods are uncanny. 
OCT5	Michael Gove, the Berlin Wall, and how the clever people in Britain become so mad	It doesn’t matter how many times the Prime Minister says it. We aren’t leaving the EU on October 31. Why? Because the law says we can’t. The Government knows this. It said as much in its submission to a Scottish court yesterday. But the Prime Minister cannot accept his promise must be broken. He has to go down fighting, defeated by an over mighty Parliament. The fight is making fools of everyone. Our politicians are now locked in a constitutional ratchet, in which each move ups the ante and inexorably triggers the next escalation. With the stakes rising, the argument keeps slipping from content to tone, from substance to character. Paradoxically, the people most caught out by this shift are the intellectuals who claim to be immune from it.
OCT5	Child marriage is child abuse – we must stamp it out by raising the legal age	When people hear of child marriage in developing nations they are rightly appalled, but many have no idea that it is legally happening in the UK. Take Sophie, who was just 16 when her family found out about her boyfriend. She was taken to her uncle’s home and held there. Her family told her she had brought shame upon them and the only solution was to get married, or they would force her to have surgery to “make her a virgin again”. She escaped and went to the police, but found the burden was on her to provide testimony to prove that the proposed marriage was “forced”. Under intense pressure from her family, she withdrew her complaint. As it stands, civil law permits child marriage under the age of 18 across the UK, through the legal exception of parental consent. But this law was set in 1929 when living together or getting pregnant out of wedlock was socially unacceptable. It is now patently out of date, not least because it allows coercion from family or community to go unchecked, forcing children into marriages against their will.
OCT6	Brussels' behaviour shows it can't really want a deal – otherwise why would it negotiate in such bad faith?	Boris Johnson’s proposition to Brussels last week might have been rejected, but it succeeded in one important respect. It demonstrated that the European Union is not negotiating in good faith. The EU, it constantly tells us, “is committed to respecting the territorial integrity and constitutional order of the UK.” Yet its response to Britain’s proposal – which would effectively keep Northern Ireland aligned with single market rules but allow it to leave, with the rest of the United Kingdom, the EU’s customs union – shows Brussels is doing little more than keeping up diplomatic appearances. “If we are going to be in two different customs unions,” said Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach, “I think that creates a real difficulty that’s going to be very hard to reconcile.” Making himself more specific, he added: “We don’t want to see any customs posts between north and south. Nor do we want to see any tariffs or restrictions on trade north and south.” In other words, according to Ireland and the EU, Northern Ireland cannot be allowed to leave the single market or the customs union. In effect, Northern Ireland – alone, or with the rest of the UK – cannot leave the European Union at all.
OCT6	Rory Stewart is a classic Privileged Crusader: compassionate, restless and wants to run the world	People are trying to work out why Rory Stewart shouldn’t run for Mayor of London. Is he too white? Too posh? Too odd? No: the problem isn’t that he’s running in London but that he isn’t running in Penrith, his current constituency. Mr Stewart fell out with the Tories over Brexit, which can’t be helped, but why not run as an independent at the next general election? He’d join a great tradition of MPs – Tony Benn, Michael Portillo – who stood and lost and re-entered the Commons at a later date to fight their cause. Instead, he joins another tradition of MPs – David Miliband, Tristram Hunt – who realised they’d hit a ceiling in Parliament and so flounced off to do something else. I call them the Privileged Crusaders. They are compassionate. They are restless. They deeply believe the world needs them to be in charge. I was at university with a lot of these types and one has to admire their self-confidence and ability to get things done, but there’s also something slightly absurd about the scope of their ambition and its lack of locus. Mr Stewart has walked across Central Asia, run an Iraqi province, lectured at Harvard and been an MP on the borders. You could call him an international polymath. You could call him a gadfly.
OCT6	Ginger Baker was a wild force of nature – and the most gifted drummer of his generation	It is hard to imagine Ginger Baker resting in peace. The pioneering rock drummer has died, aged 80. Amongst his more dubious achievements, Baker is credited as the father of the rock drum solo. The 1966 debut album from Cream concludes with the instrumental Toad, in which Baker displays his superhuman skills and timekeeping, building up dazzling pattern upon pattern with speedy hi-hat, cymbal, tom-tom and double bass drum work of stunning invention and control. One of the most extraordinary things about Toad is its economy and coherence. It only lasts five minutes and never descends into freneticism or melodramatic showboating, which is something you can’t really say of all the drum solos that followed. The next time you are at a heavy rock concert when the drummer embarks on fifteen minutes of ridiculous, self-indulgent percussive flatulence in the solo spotlight, use it as an excuse to slip out to the bar and raise a toast to Mr Baker. Baker’s reputation was double-edged, as one of the greatest musicians and wildest men of rock. To see him behind his drum-kit was to witness a man utterly abandoned to music, flaming red hair corkscrewing out at every angle, eyes bulging, mouth agape, hands a blur. Off-stage, that same violently explosive energy was channelled in less productive ways, with well-publicised drug and alcohol problems and an approach to personal relationships that might be most politely described as volatile.
OCT6	Woke protesters aren't progressive – they want to take us back to the stone age	Woke-taunters (amongst whom I proudly include myself) have largely swallowed the line which the special snowflakes themselves like to propagate; that they are rebels with many causes, each one more daring and progressive than the last. Having been of a rebellious bent all my life, this never sat well with me. The more you examine what The Woken want, the more they emerge as reactionaries rather than rebels. The yearning for a less enlightened world infests the woke rainbow. It takes in transgender activists who claim that lesbianism is transphobic and that sportswomen should accept second place to competitors who were born male, fauxminists who believe that a permanent underclass of prostituted women is acceptable and that wearing a hijab is subversive, American antifas and Corbynite clowns who repeat ancient anti-Semitic tropes. But it can be seen most shamelessly in those of the Green stripe. When Extinction Rebellion sprayed, or at least attempted to spray, thousands of litres of fake blood over the Treasury building this week – after the Treasury quite rightly stated that Britain is well to the forefront of action against climate change – this rag-bag of flora and fauna fetishists demonstrated admirably the childish sense of entitled rage that fuels their tantrums. (Unlike the privately-owned fire-engine they sprayed it from, which is fuelled by diesel.) 
OCT6	Banksy isn't a genius – he's a hack, and his fans are the butt of the joke	Parliament, you may have heard, isn’t currently held in high repute. It might, therefore, seem apt that the art sale in the headlines this week – during Frieze London, too – wasn’t an abstract expressionist work, or a sculpture in stainless steel, but a 14ft figurative painting of the House of Commons in which the MPs are all chimpanzees.  But Devolved Parliament is the work of Banksy, and the sale, it seems to me, is a joke in a number of ways. Much of the joke, for a start, is on whichever member of the beau monde spent £9.9 million on the painting at Sotheby’s. The work isn’t new – it’s a decade old – though the artist has tweaked it a little of late. The lights in the chamber, for instance, are dimmer; a banana is now upside-down. “It’s just so topical,” the dealer Acoris Andipa sighed to The New York Times. Some of the joke may be on Banksy himself. The sale beat his record auction price (£1.5 million) and the painting’s guide price (£1.5-2 million), but he didn’t own Devolved Parliament and won’t have earned royalties. 
OCT6	Why do we assume all young people will vote Labour? They won't - trust me	I gave a talk at a London university recently. I had been asked to critique political orthodoxies, such as the sanctimonious #MeToo movement, or evident in the voguish command to "check your privilege". Before the talk, my teeth chattered, as they always do when I’m about to address young people. Wouldn’t I be verbally hanged, drawn and quartered as soon as my anti-woke message became clear? Don’t all young people hate those who deviate from the lefty line, and seek to either 'cancel' them or make their lives hell? Turns out, no. A noisy contingent of them certainly are like that. But the publicity they generate with their chilling crusades obscures an increasingly apparent reality: many young people find the authoritarianism of those who toe the leftist PC line tiresome, stifling and intimidating. They’re unimpressed by the relentless lecturing and hectoring by SJWs (social justice warriors) and the vindictiveness of the ‘Kill A Tory’ brigade who wear ‘never kissed a Tory’ stickers at fresher’s week - and rightly so. The result is that the Conservatives seem to be enjoying a boost among a younger crowd. The Tory Party Conference was heaving with people of college age, organised via a Young Conservatives Twitter page for those under 25. And this new contingency are now wielding real power in the party: the week before last they took their first delegation of Young Conservative Councillors to Downing Street to discuss policies affecting young people with senior advisors.
OCT6	Smacking kids is nasty, brutish and ineffective – but we shouldn't ban it	To smack or not to smack? If English law goes the way of the Scottish it won’t even be a question any more. This week Scotland made it a criminal offence for parents and carers to use physical punishment against a child. The move has naturally been welcomed by children’s rights campaigners, who have long questioned why adults enjoy legal protection from being smacked by another adult, but children don’t.  There are many, many reasons why a parent might smack a child, but they are rarely justified. I try my hardest not to smack my children, but when I do it’s usually out of sheer frustration with their behaviour: their stubborn refusal to get dressed, stop screaming, or cease hitting each other in the back of the car while I’m driving. I try and justify it to myself because I give them a warning first, but I can’t deny that the short, sharp, instantly satisfying slap is usually more for my own benefit than theirs. It’s not a particularly adult way to behave.  Does it work? That depends on what your intentions are. Yes, it sometimes shocks – or, let’s be honest, frightens – them into stopping what they’re doing. The immediate gut-wrenching remorse most parents feel after administering physical chastisement is also enough to diffuse the situation sufficiently to change the tempo. But deep down, we all know that it’s self-defeating. 
OCT6	It's high time the Government let us drive at 80mph	Huzzah for Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, who has become a sudden beacon of hope in the political storm clouds. He has rightly surmised that the thorny issue of raising the motorway speed limit from 70mph to 80mph should once again be championed, and has found a new ally in the noble fight: the electric car. Let’s hope he’s made of stern stuff, because what he’s considering is something of a political hot potato – perennially mooted, and then predictably discarded. For 80mph to become the new speed limit on motorways, he will have to fend off the usual ill-advised bleating about the dangers from various pressure groups, including road safety organisations and, unfortunately, female voters (when the increase was last floated in an AA survey in 2013, 73 per cent of men favoured the change, but 41 per cent of women thought it should stay at 70mph, based on a hunch that 80mph was more dangerous. Ugh). Mr Shapps drives an electric car and the penny has dropped that, as more people buy them, the threatened increase in emissions caused by vehicles moving more quickly along motorways will disappear. He’s half right: over the next 10 years the vast majority of us will move from the internal combustion engine to electric propulsion – we’ll have to, as all manufacturers electrify their model ranges to meet crippling, ill-conceived European emissions targets.
OCT6	Social engineering in universities can only harm one of our great national assets	Britain’s strengths are in twenty-first century industries: international legal services, biotech, artificial intelligence, the audio-visual sector, finance. Underpinning all these is perhaps our single greatest asset: our exceptional system of tertiary education. Depending on which of the two main league tables you use, we have either four or five of the world’s best 20 universities. Times Higher Education ranks Oxford and Cambridge first and second. No other EU state has a single top 20 place. There are currently two main threats to our primacy, one that comes broadly from the Right, the other broadly from the Left. The first has to do with a resentment of the number of overseas students; the second with a desire to lower standards in the name of equality.
OCT6	This Government won't back down on Brexit	We are approaching the moment of truth. The UK and the EU need to negotiate a new approach to the Irish border issue. Or we must leave without a deal. It is doable – but only if the EU works with us. Brussels must now decide whether it wants to break the deadlock and see us leave on good terms with a deal, or no deal.  On Wednesday, the Prime Minister set out our proposals for a new Protocol on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to replace the anti-democratic backstop. A backstop which was, let’s remember, rejected by the UK Parliament three times. The proposals represent a very reasonable compromise which honours the referendum result and delivers Brexit. As the backstop would have applied indefinitely, it meant we could have been compelled to follow European law and the rulings of the European Court of Justice forever.  Our new proposals bring the whole of the UK out of the EU Customs Union, meaning Northern Ireland will be part of the UK’s customs territory – where it belongs. We will not set it adrift. 
OCT7	Boris, Ireland and the DUP all desperately need a Brexit deal – and there is just one way to achieve it	With a European summit looming, the Brexit negotiators of all sides are agreed on only one thing – there are just a few days left to do a deal. And in these few days there are three key decision makers who will effectively determine the outcome. One, of course, is Boris Johnson himself. The second is Arlene Foster, leader of the DUP, whose support is needed to pass a deal through the current Parliament. The third is the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. However much attention is paid to the pronouncements of other governments around Europe, they are not going to force Ireland into a compromise it doesn’t want, nor resist a deal with which it is happy. So on the EU side, the fate of a deal will be decided in Dublin. These three leaders are not currently on course to make a deal, although they all need one more desperately than they would like to admit. For Boris, not reaching agreement this week means fighting an election advocating a no-deal Brexit or perhaps, by some slim chance or crafty manoeuvre in the final days of October, having accomplished it. Neither is attractive for anyone wanting to be confident of winning a Conservative majority.
OCT7	Inside the Extinction Rebellion protest: All life was here, but was anyone really listening to them?	A black hearse was parked across the carriageway on Trafalgar Square. Inside there were flowers and a dark wooden coffin crudely painted with the legend “Our Future”. Lying prone on the ground beside the vehicle was Joe, a softly-spoken 35-year-old folk musician. The white pillow under his head made it look as though he was the victim of a ghoulish hit and run rather than engaging in an act of civil disobedience. The fact the police milling around were studiously ignoring him didn’t help either.
OCT7	We’ll never stop online trolls – so let’s go after real criminals instead	There is a corner of my local park I take extreme lengths to avoid. Even when it’s pouring, I’ll take the long way around; the east, west or south entrance – anything to bypass the huddle of hostile strangers crouching among the pigeon splatter, idly spewing bile at passers-by. They are also why I am not on Twitter. Or Facebook. Because I have no desire to be cursed or threatened (albeit emptily) by people I don’t know, and because I don’t want to wake up to one of those strangers telling me he or she is going to murder my husband and rape me, along with every female member of my extended family, and, by the way, do I know that I look like an [insert farmyard animal of choice]?
OCT7	The betrayal of the Kurds is as immoral as it is sadly predictable	Erdogan’s plan to relocate two million Syrian refugees to their territory is a recipe for a new civil war Donald Trump’s decision to give Turkey the green light to intervene against Kurdish forces in Syria is not merely another of the president’s routine breaches with the norms of US statecraft. For once, Mr Trump is acting entirely in line with US policy in the Middle East. Since the First World War, western support for the Kurdish cause has time and again dissolved like a mirage – just when they needed it most. Depressingly, nobody, least of all the Kurds, should be surprised by this latest betrayal. In 1919, a Kurdish delegation arrived in Paris to lobby that famous peacemaker President Woodrow Wilson in the hope that he might support the emergence of an independent Kurdish state. Their sheikh had bound the twelfth of the US President’s Fourteen Points into his Koran because it backed self-determination for the peoples of the Ottoman Empire. Would he act on his grand principles? Not a bit of it. Other great power priorities were judged more important, and Wilson became the first occupant of the White House to dash Kurdish hopes for independence.
OCT7	Whatever happened to the right to get on with our lives in peace?	As millions of people brace themselves to be inconvenienced by Extinction Rebellion over the next fortnight, it is worth asking why we have to put up with this stuff. It is partly because of a newish concept called “the right to protest”. In any free country, of course, protest should play its part. Our law has usually dealt with this by the very important British principle that everything which is not forbidden is allowed. (Continental law tends to operate on the opposite principle.) This means that most protests can happen, but the public authorities can ban them because of public-order issues or disruption to normal life. This common-sense attitude is not enough for the purveyors of international “human rights”. They put the right to protest on the level of the right to free speech or the right to vote. The police then zealously uphold it. It causes major problems, for instance, in rural areas, where masked animal-rights extremists disrupt legal hunts, shoots and sometimes even forms of farming, and get away with threatening behaviour and worse.
OCT7	Boris has won victory in the Scottish court, but the case should never have been brought in the first place	There are now so many court hearings about Brexit that they’re almost as numerous as branches of Rory Stewart’s favourite sandwich shop, Pret a Manger. Earlier today, the Scottish Court of Session gave its ruling in response to the latest legal skirmish: a petition brought by, amongst others, Boris Johnson’s two QC arch-nemeses, Jolyon Maugham and the SNP MP Joanna Cherry. The PM emerged victorious in this latest encounter (although the order is being appealed): it was not quite revenge for his defeat in the Supreme Court, but it was something. In this petition, Maugham and Cherry were seeking a wide range of orders against the Prime Minister. First up, they wanted the Court to require Boris to send a letter to the EU under the Benn Act, requesting an extension to the Article 50 period. But this was just the beginning. They also wanted the Court to order Boris not to “encourage” any other member state to veto the extension, and to require him not to take “any action that would undermine” the will of Parliament. If they’d had their way, he would have had to do all this under the threat of potential imprisonment if he failed to comply. There’s no doubting that Boris helped to see off the first part of the challenge because he confirmed, through his legal team, that the letter would be sent, and that he wouldn’t try to “frustrate” this obligation. 
OCT7	Extinction Rebellion exposes Left-wing activism as a global elite sham	These self-indulgent protests are a world away from Hong Kong It would be wrong to say that the age we live in will come to be defined as an age of protest. Protests are not a new thing by any stretch; for as long as there has been a way of doing things, there has always been someone vociferously opposed to it. That said, we do currently find ourselves beset by protests, in what might well become known instead as the age of outrage. But within this, there is a divergence in terms of what, exactly, is triggering the outrage, and the way in which different cultures, and segments within them, respond to said outrages. No two examples better demonstrate this difference than the protests in Hong Kong, and those of Extinction Rebellion in the West.
OCT7	What would dystopian Britain look like under Prime Minister John Bercow?	Amid suggestions that the Speaker could lead a Government of National Unity to steer the nation through Brexit, Rosa Prince imagines life under the controversial politician He started his political life on the Right of the Conservative Party, so it is perhaps something of a surprise that as premier, the leader that John Bercow most resembles is Cuba’s Fidel Castro, or even a Chairman Mao. But then Chairman Bercow never was shy about his leadership abilities – and now the personality cult of one has been expanded to cover the entire nation. 
OCT7	Cowardly Remainer MPs can't hide from the people's judgment forever	In a country as divided as ours, we must embrace the few opinions that unite us. One such is that parliament is currently going through a bit of a rough patch in terms of the low esteem in which it is generally held. This is nothing new from a historical point of view. I write as one who was a member of the Commons during the parliamentary expenses scandal of 2009. In years since then, though, MPs had at least begun to improve their general reputation from "criminal" to merely "untrustworthy". That was until Brexit came along. I have always considered myself a defender of MPs, a task that has appeared somewhat less self-serving since I was kicked out of the Commons in 2015. The vast majority of MPs (the usual argument runs) are good, honest people who just want to improve the lives of their constituents; they just disagree on how to do that. This is still essentially true, right across the parties represented on the green benches. So what has changed?
OCT7	Jennifer Arcuri just gave a live TV interview about Boris Johnson... and it was utterly spectacular	I’ve never seen anything like it. On ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid spent an entire hour interviewing Jennifer Arcuri, but at times they could barely get a word in. They might as well have tried to interview an exploding fire hydrant. She was a constant unstoppable gush of babbling energy, cascading out in every direction.  “Jennifer!” wailed Mr Morgan helplessly. “Jennifer! Jennifer! Jennifer! Jennifer!” But to little avail. She just surged relentlessly on. Still, it was spectacular TV. The interviewers were attempting to establish whether the young American businesswoman had once had an affair with Boris Johnson, and, if so, whether that had anything to do with the decision to award her large sums of tax-payers’ money in grants. 
OCT8	The EU will not browbeat us into breaking up the United Kingdom	The UK is due to leave the European Union in just 22 days’ time and yet the prospect of doing so with a deal looks as far away as ever after an extraordinary war of words that has exposed an almost unbridgeable gulf.  At issue, as it has been all along, is the status of Northern Ireland. Whereas the British government considers the province to be an integral part of the UK, the EU regard it as part of greater Ireland.  Their view is that any agreement about its future status must be acceptable to Dublin. They cite the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement to back up their case along with the fact that a majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain. If anyone was still unclear about this it was spelled out by Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, in a conversation with Boris Johnson. Essentially, she said if the UK wanted a deal it must agree that Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, remains inside the EU as part of its single market and customs union. This means one of two things. Either we can only leave the EU by breaking up our country; or we can never leave save on terms dictated by Brussels. Neither of these are acceptable to any government. Yet in the Commons, Labour fulminated against the Prime Minister, accusing him of setting impossible terms in the expectation of collapsing the talks. But this is not the case.
OCT8	With no Brexit deal, Boris Johnson will remain Parliament’s prisoner	Shortly after 11am next Monday, the Queen will leave Buckingham Palace in the State Coach for the short journey along the Mall and down Whitehall for the umpteenth time in her long and illustrious reign to open a new session of Parliament. This is assuming that the climate change “crusties”, as Boris Johnson called them, have been cleared away from the route. Perhaps the approaching rumble of the Household Cavalry’s Sovereign’s Escort will encourage them to move aside if the police have not already broken up their camp by then. It also assumes that the Government is even in office next Monday. With everything else that is going on – Brexit unresolved, a critical EU summit looming, the Prime Minister under siege and without a majority in Parliament – her Majesty would be entitled to ask herself along the way “what is the point of this?” and turn back. She won’t, of course, because it is her duty to open Parliament at the request of the Prime Minister.
OCT8	Giving the Stirling Prize to a Norwich council estate is a triumph for radical ordinariness	The news that the Stirling Prize for architecture has been awarded to a council estate has been a long time coming.  The prize has been awarded annually for the past twenty four years but the 2019 winner, the Goldsmith Street development on the edge of Norwich city centre, is only the second housing scheme to scoop the award and the first to have been publicly commissioned. That oversight reflects the Stirling’s long-standing prejudice in favour of the spectacular and expensive, reflected all too clearly in the choice of the billion-pound headquarters building of Bloomberg as last year’s winner. However, it is also indicative of the fact that housing of architectural quality has been notably thin on the ground and homes built by local authorities all but non-existent. Goldsmith Street represents the first new housing that Norwich City Council has commissioned since the 1980 housing act prevented local authorities from reinvesting funds from the sale of council houses into the construction of new homes. Last year, that legislation was finally overturned and given the present scale of our housing crisis – housing charity Shelter reckons that the UK needs to build 3 million social homes over the next twenty years – it was a welcome if long-overdue change. 
OCT8	The EU has negotiated in bad faith all along	We are entering the end game of the Brexit talks, the final realisation that the EU has been negotiating in bad faith right from the very start. It is clearer than ever that Brussels’s objective all along has been to keep the UK bootstrapped to the EU. They will only have themselves to blame if the result now is that we leave without a deal. Who can forget Theresa May’s deplorable withdrawal agreement, among whose many sins the worst was the Irish backstop? It was a trap made possible by Dublin’s demand that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland: the EU have long believed that this was the anvil upon which they could smash Brexit. And it was entrapment by design. Enda Kenny, the predecessor of the current Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, started work to mitigate the need for a hard border. After taking office, however, Varadkar scrapped that work and insisted on the backstop – even though it had been clear for many months that alternative arrangements could be effective.  We know this because Varadkar and the EU have previously said that in the event of no deal there need not be a hard border on the EU’s side. I happened to meet Michel Barnier shortly after. I asked him to explain how he would achieve that open border. At first, he refused to answer but after some pressing, his assistant said that they would have any checks away from the border. I responded that he was simply describing what had been proposed by the UK side. He replied that what the EU did on their side was none of our business and what we did wasn’t any of theirs. 
OCT8	When it comes to police failures, ‘sorry’ just doesn’t cut it any more	You know when you’ve reached a point where things are so mental that you think nothing can shock you any more? Then along comes a report from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on Scotland Yard’s investigation into an imaginary Westminster paedophile ring. The report not only clears five detectives of misconduct, it concludes brightly that the utter shambles, the monstrous trashing of reputations, the shameful lack of basic policing, the millions wasted, the preference for lies over truth, the trusting the word of a fantasist over that of one of our most distinguished soldiers, can be seen as “an opportunity for organisational learning”. Lunatics taking over the asylum we can just about live with, but self-satisfied, management-speak morons in the highest echelons of the police monitored by a toothless watchdog? That is truly frightening for each and every one of us.
OCT8	Why Pizza Express's problems could be a tragedy for live music	Everyone from Amy Winehouse to Diana Krall played at the Pizza Express Jazz Club – but is a slice of music history in danger? Jazz and pizza – it's an unlikely combination, when you stop to think about it. The kind of food that goes naturally with jazz is surely a classic New Orleans dish like gumbo or a hearty New York steak. Yet such has been the success of the Pizza Express Jazz Club, now celebrating its half-century, that the idea of listening to great jazz while eating pizza seems the most natural thing in the world. Now it seems the very existence of one of the country’s great jazz venues is under threat. The company that owns it, the famous Pizza Express chain that now has around 600 restaurants worldwide, is suffering from the downturn in the mid-price dining-out market, and is in crunch talks with its creditors to refinance its debt pile of around £1.1 billion. Closure of some branches, which is a possible outcome, could mean closure of the club. Its founder Peter Boizot, who died last December, was one of those born entrepreneurs who can’t help turning their personal enthusiasms into a practical scheme. One of them was jazz. Having created a restaurant on Frith Street, he set about creating a jazz club in the basement, where it still operates today. In 1969 founding a jazz club in the heart of Soho must have seemed decidedly risky. After all, barely 100 yards away was Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club, founded 10 years previously, which was going strong. The fact that both clubs flourished shows what a big mainstream audience jazz could pull at that time. There wasn’t that strict divide between jazz and pop that appeared in the Seventies – Ginger Baker, whose death rock fans everywhere are mourning, actually started out as a jazz drummer.
OCT8	Brexit talks are collapsing before our eyes. So why does Michael Gove sound so calm?	It’s all very strange. One moment, a mysterious “Downing Street source” is ranting about the imminent collapse of Brexit negotiations, and muttering dark threats to EU states. The next moment, Michael Gove is standing up in the Commons, acting as if all is well, and there isn’t a cloud in the sky. “It’s the strong desire of this Government to leave the European Union with a deal,” Mr Gove told MPs pleasantly this afternoon. “If the EU moves, there is still every chance we can leave with a deal… We remain committed to working with German and other EU governments to find a deal, and I’m sure we can find a way through…” Given the extraordinary ructions earlier in the day, involving Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel and Donald Tusk, Mr Gove’s manner was almost head-spinningly serene. But then, we should probably be used to it by now. He’s always like this. No matter how grave the crisis, how deafening the discord, Mr Gove remains smoothly, even eerily imperturbable. In this, and many other ways, he’s less like a politician, more like an Edwardian butler.
OCT8	We have no right to expect other nations to waive their diplomatic immunity	The case of Harry Dunn may be painful, but the privileges enjoyed by diplomats have been put in place for a reason Anna Sacoolas, the US diplomat’s wife alleged to have killed teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn while driving on the wrong side of the road, has left the UK without fully and formally accounting for her actions. What if anything does this tragic case tell us about diplomatic immunity and its limits? I worked some twenty years overseas as a UK diplomat enjoying all the usual privileges and immunities. Thousands of diplomats around the world do the same and respect the rules. Their work is part of the quiet oil that makes the world’s trade, climate change negotiations, sport, tourism and all the communication links that support them work smoothly, with hugely beneficial effects for all of us.
OCT8	The intransigent EU will quickly regret killing this final chance for a Brexit deal	The EU’s mask slipped today after a phone call with Angela Merkel revealed that the EU will not agree to any deal that doesn’t keep the United Kingdom locked in their regulatory orbit or effectively annex Northern Ireland. It has become increasingly clear that that Brussels will never accept a relationship with the UK that is based on anything other than subservience. The Government is right to not back down. Merkel has effectively made it clear that she believes the EU has a veto on whether the UK can leave the customs union. This is not good faith negotiation. It would be madness for any UK government to let a foreign power set tax rates and control trade policy in the way that the EU demands. Clearly this is an organisation so buoyed by dissent within the House of Commons and Britain’s media class that they believe they can act as judge, jury, and executioner of this entire process rather than one side of the negotiation. They believe powerful Remain-backing forces within the UK will always have their back, and that Brexit can be defeated. But they are sorely mistaken.
OCT8	The naval-gazing Nobel prize is failing to face up to our existential challenges	Nobel prize week is science’s version of the Oscars. It’s a chance for researchers everywhere to gather round, hope their favourite discovery will get the nod, then gripe endlessly that their area has been overlooked "again". And yet, as the first prize was dolled out to three recipients earlier today – including Briton Sir Peter Ratcliffe – I doubt most people even noticed. You’d think news of a British Nobel prize winner would be trumpeted across the land. Afraid not. Nobel prizes rarely get that kind of attention; usually if any mention is made, it’s because the committee has finally awarded the prize to a woman rather than the usual parade of crusty white blokes. Last year, Donna Strickland became only the third woman to win the prize for physics, while Frances Arnold became the fifth for chemistry. Both are astonishing talents, yet do you have any idea what they worked on? (It was lasers and bioengineering enzymes, respectively).
OCT9	In a choice between Revoke and No Deal, a clean Brexit will triumph	A no-deal Brexit will cause “the collapse” of the United Kingdom, Jean-Claude Juncker claimed this week. Heaping blame on Britain for the lack of a Withdrawal Agreement, the European Commission President dubbed our June 2016 referendum result “the original sin”. The UK’s Brexit negotiations are in turmoil. Boris Johnson endured a telephone drubbing from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and there’s no breakthrough on the vexed Irish border question – ahead of next Thursday’s crunch Brussels summit. Hemmed in by the Benn Act, and with no agreement in the offing, the Prime Minister could be forced to ask the EU for an extension beyond October 31, despite his “do or die” promise. Having dubbed the biggest act of democracy in British history a “sin”, Juncker and Co could yet go further – granting an extension of just a few weeks, denying Johnson the time for a general election he now looks odds-on to win.
OCT9	The only way to get Brexit done now is for Boris to back no deal	The war of words with Brussels shows no sign of abating. Aggressive Downing Street briefings following Boris Johnson’s phone call with Angela Merkel on Tuesday morning have led to rebukes from Donald Tusk and to Jean-Claude Juncker accusing the UK of committing the ‘original sin’. To what extent Merkel really did demand the annexation of Northern Ireland is unclear. What this week’s events have proved is that keeping Britain in the customs union was always the EU’s main priority. The proposals put forward by Boris Johnson that have led Britain to this point were an improvement on the previous surrender treaty, but they were never going to be accepted in full by the EU. For one thing, the next few years would have relied entirely on the good faith of Brussels – something that has been in short supply since 2016.   I understand why Johnson set off on this rocky road. Keeping his split party together and possibly gaining a majority in parliament are undeniably important. But, frankly, I am pleased that this latest proposed deal is now all but dead. In fact, I’m feeling more optimistic about Brexit than I have for a long time. The choice is looking clearer. Either we leave the bloc, or we remain in it.
OCT9	The 'Brexit Day' 50p joins a noble tradition of quirks and oddities in our coinage	Throughout history, errors in our currency have attracted interest from collectors The 31 October deadline is rapidly approaching, and to many, it seems unlikely that Britain will leave the European Union as planned. Yet the Treasury recently announced a huge issue of commemorative 50p pieces (ten million of them, to be precise) to mark the date.  If the Brexit sceptics are to be believed, these coins could be destined to join a long list of numismatic oddities and curious collector’s items. 
OCT9	We have laboured to find a Brexit middle ground, but the EU was never serious about compromise	Over the last few months, the Prosperity UK Alternative Arrangements Commission has taken the words of the EU President, Donald Tusk, in April very seriously. “Please do not waste this time,” he said when the EU granted the extension to October 31. We have devised and developed Alternative Arrangements for the Irish border, as envisaged in both the original Withdrawal Agreement, the Strasbourg Declaration and the Brady Amendment, which passed the House of Commons in January with a majority of 16. Our work has helped inform the British Government’s thinking and its new offer to the EU – and, in that regard, we hope it will ultimately help unblock the Brexit jam. We have engaged a technical panel of 23 global experts on trade and customs and with real life experience of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement negotiations. Our Technical Panel has produced a 275-page report and two protocols in order to secure a deal. 
OCT9	These nine MPs are after John Bercow’s job... and one of them may be an even bigger windbag	October 31, 2019 will stand as a momentous day in the history of this country. Generations of schoolchildren will study it. October 31, they will learn, was a day that marked the end of an era, and our first tentative steps, as a nation, into a brave but uncertain future. The day, in short, that John Bercow stood down as Speaker of the Commons. Of course, after the period of public mourning is at an end, the tribute programmes have all been shown and the mountains of drooping bouquets have been cleared from Parliament Square, some poor soul will be tasked with succeeding Mr Bercow. The challenge will be daunting. His successor will, at least metaphorically, have big shoes to fill. But today, at a hustings in Parliament, no fewer than nine candidates courageously stepped forward.
OCT9	Universities do have a sex assault problem – but consent classes won't fix it	A decade ago last month, I became a fresher for the first time, expecting, as I assume my fellow first-years did, to be met with all the requisite hallmarks of university life: lurid coloured booze at £1 a pop, mornings that stretched lazily into afternoons, mealtimes ditched for toast and takeaways. At 18, freedom is the name of the game for newly untethered teens. That same freedom can be their undoing; a new report from Universities UK has found that two thirds of universities have now introduced consent courses for students – some of which were mandatory during freshers’ week. The classes seek to educate on matters of recognising sexual affirmation, and have in recent years become as de rigueur in those inaugural days as the halls social or the societies fair. Last year, an acquaintance, aged 40, relayed her shock, on joining a London university, at being schooled on acceptable terminology (“cisgender” had not by then made it to her native South Africa) and the appearance of wardens in hi-viz jackets at union nights, apparently introduced for students’ sexual safety.
OCT9	The EU’s antagonism proves the backstop was a trap all along	Recent behaviour proves they were never going to negotiate in good faith  It was all about the peace process, apparently. When Dublin and the European Union Brexit negotiators insisted on there being a separate Northern Ireland protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement, it was to serve as an insurance policy, they said. This "‘backstop", they proposed, would ensure there was no return of a physical border between north and south – and thereby, they hinted darkly, no risk that we might see a return of the "men of violence", who’d surely kick off without such guarantees.
OCT9	No, Brexit hasn't made the economy £60 billion smaller than if we'd voted to Remain	The IFS's calculations are spurious at best Another day, another economist trying to rewrite history to convince us that yes, all those forecasts of immediate doom if Britain voted to leave the EU were on the money after all. On the Today programme yesterday, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), made the ear-catching claim that the UK economy is now £60 billion smaller than it would have been had we voted to remain in the EU – a claim which went unchallenged. The IFS tends to avoid making specific forecasts but this figure could be said to coincide with what Johnson wrote a fortnight before the 2016 referendum: “the immediate impact could be seismic… In the short run a vote for Brexit would create uncertainty. In the immediate aftermath the pound, and probably the stock market, would dive, making us all poorer. Investment and consumption would fall, and the economy would suffer”.
OCT9	MPs had no way of kicking out the partisan John Bercow. The next Speaker should fix that	As the country gears up for another election, some politicians at Westminster have already started appearing at hustings, explaining to their audiences why they’re the best man or woman for the job. No, Boris Johnson has not yet found a way round the roadblock created by the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act that would allow him to seek a new mandate and break the Brexit deadlock. Instead eight wannabee Speakers of the Commons have started pressing the flesh and kissing babies in the corridors of power as they seek to replace John Bercow at the beginning of next month. As an aside, there’s a potential bump in the road between now and the moment when the new Speaker is dragged by their supporters (ostensibly reluctantly) to the chair for the first time. If the prime minister is dragged (unambiguously reluctantly) to ask the EU for an extension to our nation’s membership of the European Union, the opposition parties may well agree on an early general election immediately afterwards, thereby moving the date of the Speaker’s election to the first sitting day after polling day. In those circumstances, the new Speaker would become the first holder of that office to have been elected by a new parliament since Betty Boothroyd in 1992. And the various candidates for that office will be unable to canvass for votes until parliament has resumed.
OCT9	What must Hongkongers think of Britain's privileged eco whingers?	From civil rights to Vietnam, protest used to really mean something. For today's youth, it's little more than an excuse to flaunt their virtue on social media I always wanted to be a protestor when I grew up. As a well-behaved child I was in awe of the American civil rights movement and then as a rebellious tweenager I wanted nothing more than to run wild with the anti-Vietnam war protestors whose appeal was more feral but whose cause seemed nearly as noble. Then I read about Cable Street and in my small way tried to emulate them by showing up and yelling at the National Front at Lewisham in 1977, becoming intimately acquainted with the wrong end of a police horse for my troubles. In my twenties I admired the miners with their beautiful banners and the dignity that only comes with physical labour.
OCT10	Britain cannot ignore the spiralling crisis in the Middle East	As though the quagmire in the Middle East were not deep enough, the Turkish invasion of northern Syria has made an already hazardous set of circumstances far worse. The military action against the Kurds has reignited the threat from the Islamic State jihadists who had been defeated and effectively immobilised. The Kurds, who led the fight against Isil, have retreated, leaving thousands of jihadis and an even greater number of women and children unguarded. They are now either at the mercy of the Turks, who killed more than 100 militants yesterday, or will flee causing a serious refugee crisis which President Erdogan will doubtless ensure falls on Europe to deal with. The West’s culpability for this impending calamity cannot be shirked. Donald Trump’s peremptory decision to withdraw US troops from the Turkish-Syria border gave Ankara the green light to launch its onslaught even if the administration in Washington now say that was not the intention. It is all of a piece with the failure of the American and European governments to prepare for the consequences of the defeat of Islamic State. Inevitably, they were going to involve what to do about the foreign fighters and how to respond to renewed Kurdish demands for a homeland as a reward for their help.
OCT10	Europe is dangerously unprepared for a world without a US policeman	If the Turks crush Syrian Kurdish forces this weekend, how should we react? You can say that these Kurds are our allies, who risked and gave their lives confronting Islamic State jihadists not so long ago. That decent countries defend their friends, and we should act. Or you might argue that there’s been too much Western “acting” of late, costing billions and achieving nothing. So best leave the Kurds to fight their own battles. I’m in the former camp. When Sir John Major’s government decided to defend the Iraqi Kurds with a no-fly zone in 1991 – in effect, protecting them from Saddam’s butchery – it led to stability and even prosperity. We ended up with good relations, trade, even Land Rover dealerships in Irbil. And we exchanged people. The page you’re reading was designed by Kuchar Swara, a Kurd who also redesigned The Spectator. Business minister Nadim Zahawi is another Kurdish export. The Kurds have long been Britain’s friends. And America’s, too. But Donald Trump is redefining alliances now. The Kurds didn’t fight in Normandy, he bizarrely said this week, so why should America shield them from the Turks? Or shield anyone in the region from anyone? “The worst mistake the United States has ever made, in my opinion, is going into the Middle East,” he said. He puts the cost of deployments in Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq at anything from $4 trillion to $8 trillion, depending on his mood and his audience. His upshot: he’s fed up with America being the world’s policeman. He’s walking away from the role, and his allies will have to get used to it.
OCT10	Corbyn's perplexing enthusiasm for an early general election proves he is a hostage to Labour’s factions	Until his latest speech, there was a real prospect of the election being delayed indefinitely Like so many moments in recent Labour Party history, Jeremy Corbyn’s speech to supporters in Northampton yesterday could prove pivotal, for the country and for the prospect of a Labour government. Although he is not quite “champing at the bit”, and refused to say precisely when it would happen, he declared his enthusiasm for an early general election once an extension to Britain’s EU membership had been secured. Ordinarily this would not be a news story: which Leader of the Opposition has ever publicly rejected the prospect of an early election? But rather than applauding the chutzpah of a man who relishes the prospect of a campaign while trailing the Conservatives by more than 10 points in some polls, his allies are worried. Some of them even feel betrayed.
OCT10	I want misery and grief at my funeral – not DJs and Prosecco	Oliver Peyton is 58 and in good health, but he has already planned his funeral. After a service in a wood, during which Peyton will be buried in a biodegradable coffin, his friends will be summoned to an extravagant wake. White truffle risotto will be served with champagne. There will be DJs and dancing, and at 3am, when the guests are flagging, “out comes some really expensive Château d’Yquem pudding wine – and people will say, ‘Well, we can’t go now.’” This, Peyton hopes, is the future of mourning. The former restaurateur has launched a new business offering “life-affirming funerals”. Exit Here promises to “disrupt” the undertaking industry by “bringing a bit of joy to it”. The website for Exit Here looks like the booking page for a hip hotel. The waiting room is painted a modish blue; there’s a velvet sofa, and a mid-century armchair upholstered in a bright floral fabric. Elsewhere, there are photos of pale pink roses,crystal glasses clinking in celebration, and a wild lake surrounded by cornflowers and swaying grasses. If this were a brochure for a spa weekend, I’d be sold.
OCT10	Northern Ireland is a burden on the rest of the UK. We can't let it get in the way of Brexit	The EU talks are still in danger of collapsing because of Northern Ireland at a time when the majority of people who live there think they will be part of a united Ireland within ten years, according to Lord Ashcroft’s September poll. Northern Ireland has long been a millstone round the neck of the rest of the UK and to fail to take back our independence because of it would be an historic tragedy. It is not widely known that it costs the UK more to support Northern Ireland than it does to be in the EU. In 2016-17, according to HM Treasury figures, total expenditure by the Government on Northern Ireland was £20.6 billion. HMRC reports that tax receipts from Northern Ireland in the same year came to £11.7 billion, a net payment of £8.8 billion.
OCT10	Extinction Rebellion's clueless doom-mongering is finally getting the scrutiny it deserves	Extinction Rebellion is a doomsday cult, devoid of any association with reality In normal circumstances, when someone tells you that billions of people are about to die you laugh in their face.  Not only have Extinction Rebellion been allowed to shut down our streets and waste police resources, they've received an overwhelmingly sympathetic hearing from the luvvie media establishment.
OCT10	Far from fearing an election, curiously confident Jeremy Corbyn can almost taste power	Some years ago, as an MP, I led a Parliamentary delegation to Central America and one of our party was Jeremy Corbyn. He impressed me as he knew as much as our hosts about local politics and government.  At the time, he was seen as rather a joke figure: an eccentric and largely harmless Leftist zealot who could always be relied upon to irritate the Labour whips and Blairite Ministers from his perch on the Labour backbenches. In his trademark Sinn Fein geography teacher jacket, he would opine on various fashionable liberation campaigns, British imperialism, trades union rights, the evils of US foreign policy and the like. He was incurious of most domestic issues and appeared unconcerned at reconciling himself with the necessary compromises by all governments to stay in power. Why not? He was never likely to get anywhere near power. 
OCT10	A second referendum is an affront to democracy. Remainers can only stop Brexit by winning an election	The EU will, apparently, accept a Brexit extension only if Britain agrees to call either a general election or a second referendum. Clearly an appeal to the people cannot be long delayed. What form should it take? Tony Blair argues for a referendum on two grounds. The first is that an election can never yield a mandate for a specific policy. Were, for example, the Conservatives to win, this might be, not because of their Brexit policy, but because voters preferred Tory economic policies to Corbynite ones. There is no way of deducing the meaning of the outcome by scrutinising the number of Xs on the ballot paper. The Brexit Party and the SNP are single issue parties. The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are not. Secondly, Blair argues that under our electoral system, a party can win an overall majority on just 35 per cent of the vote, as indeed he himself did in 2005. It would then claim a mandate for Brexit even though nearly two-thirds of the voters might be against it.
OCT10	These three words show why Labour are doomed under Jeremy Corbyn	Three words. Just three little words. That’s all they were. And yet somehow, they summed up the state of the Labour party to a tee. Jeremy Corbyn had just finished giving a speech in Northampton to a room of his most ardent local fans. They’d cheered and whooped with a passion that verged on the rapturous. Then came time for questions. A journalist from the Guardian raised his hand. If Mr Corbyn lost the next general election, asked the man from the Guardian, would he resign?
OCT10	Sally Davies is wrong if she thinks she can stop us snacking on the Tube	Listening to Dame Sally Davies on the Today programme this morning, I found myself shouting at the radio in fury. The outgoing Chief Medical Officer was doling out her final piece of advice to the Government on how to whip public health – specifically of the nation’s children – into shape, namely to ban snacking on public transport.  In addition to a calorie cap on restaurant and takeaway meals, and compulsory nutritional labelling on supermarket food, Dame Sally wants eating and drinking prohibited on trains and buses. At which suggestion I found myself shaking my fist and thinking back to all those times where a banana to eat on the Tube was the only thing between me, my children and total collective meltdown.  The trouble is, she’s right about the severity of the obesity problem and the role played in it by snacking. One in three children leave primary school overweight or obese; obesity rates have doubled among children in the last 30 years. At the same time, we have become a nation of snackers: according to Defra, in 1977, the average adult in Britain consumed 29g of crisps, nuts, seeds, popcorn or savoury snacks a week; in 2015 that figure had nearly tripled, rising to 89g. 
OCT11	Why I probably won't be getting Brexit for my birthday	The October 31 deadline has become totemic thanks to Remainer obstruction Please forgive the apparent self-indulgence of what follows. I hope its point may have wider application. On Monday night, the think-tank Policy Exchange kindly hosted the launch of the final volume of my biography of Margaret Thatcher in the Banqueting House, Whitehall. Also very kindly – especially given the extraordinary days he is living through – Boris Johnson attended and spoke.
OCT11	Brexit Britain can fill the gap left by a retreating Trump	The UK needs a foreign policy revolution to shake off the declinist idea that we can have no global role The single, unequivocal message that resonates from Donald Trump’s abandonment of the Syrian Kurds is that the West can no longer rely on Washington to safeguard its interests, and those of its allies. This conclusion, moreover, has profound implications for post-Brexit Britain as it seeks to define its global presence, both in terms of its diplomatic reach and its military prowess. During three years of incessant Brexit debate, reference has often been made to the concept of Global Britain, one where, supposedly, the country reasserts its position as a leading presence on the world stage, providing clear, values-based leadership on the key issues of the day.
OCT11	The NHS is failing cancer patients by failing to trust them	Our health service must become more patient-centric People may call me “brave” for facing cancer twice before the age of 35, but nothing terrifies me more than the latest research from Breast Cancer Now. When breast cancer spreads, one in four patients must visit a GP three or more times for a diagnosis, the charity has found. This unacceptable wait means cancer is likely more advanced, and, crucially, less treatable by the time it is diagnosed. With 10,000 people dying every year due to diagnosis barriers, the health system needs to go back to basics: listen and trust patients. For a long time, I assumed that I was uniquely unlucky – that I alone was failed by the NHS. After all, national pride dictates that it’s our country’s greatest achievement. I presumed it was just me who visited my GP nine times before being referred to hospital. Just me that A&E sent home in excruciating pain without tests. And only me who had five hospital scans before a clinician would look into my eyes and truly listen to me – to say the horrifying words no one wants to hear: “you have cancer”, in my case cancer of the bowel.
OCT11	If his deal fails, Boris Johnson should resign rather than accept the political suicide of a Brexit delay	The PM must prove that doing the right thing is more important than clinging to office Recent polls will have made alarming reading at Tory HQ. The polling, seen by the Telegraph, indicates that if the Prime Minister proves unable to complete his new Brexit deal and take Britain out of the EU on or before October 31, then the party will not secure a majority. True, the Government's plan may still lead to a deal. Negotiations are underway, with apparent goodwill on both sides. But let’s assume that Boris Johnson’s deal (whatever it is) does not succeed — either because the negotiations break down or the European Parliament or House of Commons refuse to pass it.
OCT11	As we reach the Brexit endgame, Boris must avoid becoming the next Theresa May	We are in the Brexit endgame now. With only a few days to go until the European Summit, we still don't know what the final proposals for the pathway to an agreement finally are. But the fact that there remains hope of a deal being done is in itself remarkable following the chaos left behind by Theresa May's premiership. Everyone said there wouldn't, couldn't, be a deal and that Boris Johnson only wanted a no deal outcome. The Prime Minister will have enjoyed proving the likes of Corbyn, Starmer and Swinson wrong. But, like many Conservatives, he will have been deeply troubled by the behaviour of Amber Rudd, Philip Hammond and David Gauke, who have attempted to restrict his room for movement in the negotiations with the EU at every turn. It will be hard for the party's membership to forgive such disloyal behaviour. 
OCT11	The Remainers are furious: Boris Johnson might actually get a Brexit deal	It’s far too early to quantify poultry, given the roller coaster that has been Brexit for the past three years. But we are at least in a position that few of us expected to be in at the start of the week, with vaguely positive-sounding remarks and body language coming from key EU players in response to Boris Johnson’s latest proposals for a withdrawal agreement. And it’s Friday, so let’s throw caution to the wind and enjoy, briefly, that rarest of commodities in 2019 Britain: optimism. Maybe it will all come to nought, but there’s no law against dreaming (at least at the time of writing: who knows what new law our dysfunctional parliament might dream up to prevent such frivolities in future?). I woke this morning with a feeling of nervous dread, fearing that the optimism sparked by yesterday’s meeting between Johnson and the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, would have dissipated overnight, bludgeoned to death either by Donald Tusk’s angry Twitter activism or by recalcitrant Ulster unionists. But no, there was still hope of an actual deal, a deal that would allow us to honour the result of the 2016 referendum and protect jobs, investment and exports. What’s not to like?
OCT11	Trapping Northern Ireland in the EU's Customs Union would catastrophically undermine the Good Friday Agreement	It would fundamentally alter Northern Ireland’s constitutional status There were encouraging noises from the talks with the Taoiseach on Thursday that a practical and mutually-beneficial deal with the EU can be reached. Boris Johnson’s offer to the EU to ensure that the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is kept seamless using existing techniques and processes is a pragmatic one, and should form the basis of productive discussions.  There is still, however, a danger that lurking beneath the warm words is a plan from the EU and the Republic of Ireland to keep Northern Ireland permanently in the Customs Union. There is a risk that Martin Selmayr’s view that Northern Ireland should be the price the UK pays for Brexit continues to prevail. 
OCT11	Why I don't regret being arrested protesting with Extinction Rebellion	On Monday I was arrested at the Extinction Rebellion protest in Trafalgar Square on two offences - obstructing a highway and public nuisance (I have not been charged, but an investigation is pending). The last thing I saw before I was bundled into a police van was a crowd of people cheering me on in front of Nelson’s Column. I’m not trying to glamourise it, that’s just what happened. Four others were arrested with me – three men and a woman – all of whom I would guess were in their Sixties. None smelled remotely of hemp or looked at all crusty. One wore a suit in the correct size. There wasn’t a bivouac in sight. I’d never met these people before and although we chatted briefly and exchanged nervous smiles, we were mainly quiet and contemplative. I was reflecting on my reasons for being at the protest – to compel the Government to tell the truth about climate change and take bolder measures to prevent it getting worse – and also weighing up the possible implications of getting arrested. I think the others were doing the same.
OCT11	Girls should be walking to school, not down the aisle	“Many of my friends have no education. They’ve left school. They get married and have children.” 16-year-old Alexandra is growing up in the Dominican Republic, where one in three girls is married or in an informal union by the age of 18. At her age, Alexandra’s mother Betty already had her first child, but she has encouraged her daughter to choose a different life. “Every day my mother tells me to finish school. And that now is not the right time to marry.” Next year marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Conference and Platform for Action. In Beijing, global leaders recognised the devastating impact of gender inequality and committed to removing barriers to women’s empowerment.
OCT11	Northern Ireland would prove a costly prize for Leo Varadkar	Acceptance of Britain’s departure from Europe will pave the way to the least damage for both sides The “Irish problem” is how British historians used to refer to the machinations of Irish nationalism and independence. With good reason, given the abominable, subservient way in which Ireland has been treated at key points in our shared and often troubled history, the Irish tend to think of it as the “British problem”. But whichever way you want to argue the age-old enmity, what is certainly true is that co-membership of the EU has allowed the wounds to heal, enabling a degree of harmonious coexistence that might once have been thought impossible. Ireland has therefore found it very difficult to accept that the UK is actually leaving the EU, more so than any other country in Europe. Notwithstanding yesterday’s talks between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar, which have once again raised hopes of some sort of a deal, it is obvious that Varadkar is still struggling with the idea; he hopes for eventual revocation, or at least something that keeps the UK locked into Europe’s single market and customs union.
OCT12	So far so promising, as the crunch point approaches for Brexit talks	From the moment Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, conventional wisdom among Remainers dictated that his tenure would end in disaster. The EU would never re-open Theresa May’s appalling deal, they predicted, so there was no point in even asking for a renegotiation. Mr Johnson would be laughed out of the chanceries of Europe, they said, because there was no other way of resolving the Irish border issue than by trapping the UK in the EU’s customs bloc and in just about every other part of its legal and technocratic order. And if Brexiteers didn’t like that, they had better face facts: leaving the EU in a sensible manner was all but technically and logically impossible. It was either leaving in name only, or Remain. How wrong the Remainers look now. Not only did the EU accept that the Withdrawal Agreement could be reopened, it has been locked in talks this weekend with UK negotiators over a revised deal that looks immeasurably better than anything proposed until now. Of course, these talks could yet collapse, but if speculation about their content is correct, the agreement Mr Johnson is aiming for could be substantially better even than the original Donald Tusk offer, let alone Mrs May’s catastrophic deal.
OCT12	My plea to Brexiteers – you must trust Boris	Tomorrow is the day of the Queen’s Speech. This fine ceremonial display is not only about pageantry – it also puts the constitution on show. The Queen-in-Parliament is the system of government that this nation enjoys. It is visible at its opening and closing proceedings. It is a link to the origins of Parliament and the medieval aspects are all there – the Queen is at the centre of events, and closest to Her Majesty are the lords spiritual and temporal with the commons at the bar. All are brought together in front of the sovereign, who is an instrumental part of the institution, before they depart to deliberate separately, returning again to be closed by prorogation or dissolution. When they go their separate ways the ceremony will be abandoned and the raw meat of the Parliamentary shambles will once again be on display. In the House of Commons this means a debate between the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson and the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. This is the choice the nation has made: one to lead and one to oppose, so it is worth reflecting on their various merits. Mr Corbyn is, in truth, one of life’s perpetual backbenchers, a pursuer of lost causes and a campaigner for antediluvian ideas. His shameful party is being investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) because of its alleged anti-Semitism. The self righteousness of the Left means the socialists cannot understand how they could be accused of such things because they believe, in their warped way, that the rights of individuals and of minority groups must be subordinated to their view of the collective good. It is worth remembering that the only other party to have been investigated by the EHRC is the BNP, that viper’s nest of racism.
OCT12	The Brexit row is turning us all into devils – and our MPs are mainly to blame	“Don’t you have any regrets about Brexit, Hannan?” I am asked the question several times a day, usually by enraged Remainers who don’t expect an answer. But, for the record, yes I do. I regret the overheated, stagey anger that now infuses almost every political conversation. I regret the screaming demonstrators outside Parliament, the broken friendships, the foul language. I regret the way people search for traitors rather than for compromise. I regret that our age has descended into what Julien Benda in La Trahison des Clercs called “the political organisation of hatreds.” Above all, I regret the collateral damage to our institutions. Like most Leavers, I liked the idea of living in a full democracy, hiring and firing the people who passed our laws. When I argued that we should put our MPs back in charge, I had no idea how little they wanted the job.
OCT12	Extinction Rebellion is a primeval, anti-capitalist cult	With bourgeois baby-boomers bopping goofily to techno music in Trafalgar Square, hemp-trousered “crusties” obstructing bridges as they sit cross-legged on yoga mats, and even the likes of the Prime Minister’s father on board, Extinction Rebellion (XR) has sometimes resembled a wellness festival for ageing hippies meets a sit-in by the National Trust. But dig a little deeper and it is clear where Extinction Rebellion’s roots lie – in the anti-capitalist, anti-globalisation movement which a few years ago was lobbing bricks through the windows of McDonald’s. At the heart of Extinction Rebellion is its central demand that carbon emissions be slashed to net zero by 2025. No serious person thinks that this could be achieved in just six years’ time without a devastating blow to living standards – the government’s own Committee on Climate Change has advised that 2050 is the earliest date it might be possible without crashing the economy. But that is the point: Extinction Rebellion wants to crash the economy. It wants to initiate the complete breakdown of the industrial capitalism and replace it with what they view as a fresh-aired, utopian form of primitive socialism.
OCT12	Misguided Remainers do not understand European history	Britain is a European country. Leaving the EU is cutting itself off from its historic nature. Brexit is isolating us, turning us in upon ourselves in pursuit of some crazy nostalgic fantasy. The EU is the world’s largest market, which we are mad to leave. So often does one hear these arguments that they must clearly convince many people. Rather than dismissing them, I would like to try, in a constructive spirit, to look at them seriously. Every notion of historical or geographical determinism that claims to tell us what we are or must be, is fundamentally undemocratic. It reminds me of the German historian Treitschke, who told the people of Alsace-Lorraine, seized by Germany from France in 1871, that even though they considered themselves French, history dictated they were really German, like it or not. Romantic Europhiles like to hark back to ancient Greece and adopt a quasi-nationalist view that Europa has some deep and continuing cultural identity of which the modern European Union is somehow an embodiment and Europe’s destiny. A glib answer would be that if such identity were real, the EU would not be experiencing so many conflicts. The truth is that Europe is very diverse. Its only historical claim to unity is as Christendom, but even that unity did not last beyond the 11th century. In its languages, cultures and mores it is hardly more a unity than Africa or Asia, and far less so than South America.
OCT12	Don’t worry, Prime Minister. If your Brexit deal falls through, there’s still this foolproof Plan B	At last: some hope on Brexit. But let’s not speak too soon. Should this final push for a breakthrough fail, Boris Johnson will be in grave trouble. Unable to take us out with a deal – and, thanks to Parliament, unable to take us out without a deal, either. He’ll be cornered. Trapped. Snookered. But maybe not. Because thankfully, there’s still one last-ditch way he could save his skin. It’s ingenious. Yet remarkably simple. Keep us in the EU – but tell everyone we’ve left.
OCT12	These Extinction rebels are putting politics before planet	The group's silliness must not hide the fact that markets are now driving a greener approach Gosh, it’s so easy to mock the Extinction Rebellion lot that it almost takes the fun out of it. Almost. On Thursday I walked around their camp in Trafalgar Square. Between two exits of the roundabout, a group was holding a “people’s assembly”. A woman called Rachel was whipping up the crowd. “So,” she said, “if we’re positive about it, then… yay!” Her audience, including one dressed as a Red Indian, another in a pith helmet and several lying in bathtubs, looked up belatedly from their phones and clapped.
OCT12	How a Twitter joke led to Left-wing demands to save the people’s pizza	Pizza Express’s near-death experience this week prompted a spasm of extremist, Left-wing overreach, of the sort that now happens whenever there is bad news. Instead of going under, claimed some bright sparks online, the struggling restaurant chain could simply be nationalised! What began as a joke on Twitter morphed instantly into painfully virtuous ruminations by a student, Anisha Faruk, about how “we legitimately do need a national food service”, followed by the obligatory “moral lesson from history”, in which a journalist called Jon Stone pointed out that, during World War Two, the government ran state canteens to feed people. It then reached the peak of quackery: an endorsement by the Left-wing columnist Owen Jones. “Publicly owned restaurants,” he mused, could offer cheap food especially for “nurses and care workers”.
OCT12	Why I probably won't be getting Brexit for my birthday	The October 31 deadline has become totemic thanks to Remainer obstruction Please forgive the apparent self-indulgence of what follows. I hope its point may have wider application. On Monday night, the think-tank Policy Exchange kindly hosted the launch of the final volume of my biography of Margaret Thatcher in the Banqueting House, Whitehall. Also very kindly – especially given the extraordinary days he is living through – Boris Johnson attended and spoke.
OCT12	Brexit Britain can fill the gap left by a retreating Trump	The UK needs a foreign policy revolution to shake off the declinist idea that we can have no global role The single, unequivocal message that resonates from Donald Trump’s abandonment of the Syrian Kurds is that the West can no longer rely on Washington to safeguard its interests, and those of its allies. This conclusion, moreover, has profound implications for post-Brexit Britain as it seeks to define its global presence, both in terms of its diplomatic reach and its military prowess. During three years of incessant Brexit debate, reference has often been made to the concept of Global Britain, one where, supposedly, the country reasserts its position as a leading presence on the world stage, providing clear, values-based leadership on the key issues of the day.
OCT13	We must show compassion and repatriate British children in Isil camps	What to do about the Islamic State fighters captured in northern Syria is a major headache for the Western countries whose nationals comprise many of the detainees. Britain has stripped identifiable UK citizens of their passports and effectively handed the problem to someone else. Until recently the responsibility for their incarceration lay with the Kurdish fighters who captured them. But the Turkish army border offensive has upended these arrangements with the Kurds no longer prepared to act as jailers as they fall back before the advance. What will now happen to hundreds if not thousands of jihadists left to their own devices is unclear. If they escape from custody they could make their way back to the West. The Americans were sufficiently concerned at this propect that they have spirited away at least two British fighters, part of the so-called Beatles group, to stand trial for murder. But the UK government seems to be doing nothing. Not only are the defeated jihadists affected but so are their families who lived in the so-called caliphate. There are an estimated 8,000 children, half of them aged under five. The BBC reported that three orphaned children born to British parents who left London five years ago are in one of the camps and want to go home.
OCT13	Brexit 'crunch week' will reveal the true colours of our politicians	Cries of anger, howls of anguish, and claims of betrayal will fill the air this week. But as the details of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal become clearer, it will not necessarily be the purists and hardliners among Leave supporters protesting. It will be the Remainers and Remoaners whose hopes of stopping Brexit altogether now risk coming to nothing. Since the referendum, few MPs have argued, honestly and openly, that they want to overturn Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. Labour’s manifesto promised to “accept the referendum result”. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has spent the past three years insisting that “while Labour did not support leaving the European Union … we have accepted that that choice was made and that it will now be delivered”. In practice, however, opposition politicians – and opponents of Brexit on the Tory benches – have argued that the terms upon which we leave must be different to whatever terms are negotiated by whichever prime minister happens to be in No 10.
OCT13	Never again must the Speaker be able to make up new rules whenever he likes	Constitutions ought to be straightforward things. Bits of political plumbing to make sure democracies work properly, so power can transfer smoothly from a dying Government to a new one without a punch-up. But that’s not what ours is doing at the moment. The plumbing is completely blocked. We’ve got a Government which can’t govern because there’s no majority, but an Opposition which can’t replace them because it hasn’t got one either. A Parliament where MPs have failed to deliver a referendum result after more than 3 years of bickering, with half-finished bits of vital Brexit preparation legislation stuck like fatbergs halfway round various Parliament u-bends. And a nation that’s thoroughly fed up with whole thing, screaming for someone to turn up with a plunger and sort the horrible, smelly mess out.
OCT13	Boris Johnson is already defanging Britain's monstrous quangocracies	For all their mighty talk of parliamentary sovereignty, MPs have been happily denuding themselves of power for decades. Transferred to the EU, yes, but also to that sprawling governing class that now makes many of the really big decisions. Quangos, public bodies, agencies, call them what you like: the dogma of the past 30 years has been to take responsibility out of the hands of politicians and give it to a new class of technocratic “experts”.  It is a convenient arrangement for ministers, particularly those on the liberal-Left. They can take the heat out of controversial decisions by devolving them to semi-detached officials. This extra-political superstructure also both permits and encourages the growth of the regulatory state. Failed Labour politicians, meanwhile, get sinecures from which they can continue their interventionist proselytising. The most disastrous consequence of the growth of the quangocracy is that, even under Conservative governments, liberal-Left policies never retreat. In fact, it becomes harder for Tories to be Tory. They now have to fight a new special interest group and, by virtue of having abandoned large swathes of policy to the “experts”, have not bothered to craft an agenda for those issues consistent with their own principles.
OCT13	A vinyl revival can free today's bland music fans from their streaming ‘safe space’	As a teenage runaway I slowed myself down considerably by taking my entire record collection with me. It must have looked comical; this slip of a girl with only the clothes she stood up in - and 50 slabs of twelve inch vinyl - teetering through the streets of London looking just a tiny bit conspicuous. When I eventually returned home, my parents were concerned as to whether or not I was still in receipt of my virginity, but all I could fret about was that some rotter at the YWCA had made off with my banana-sleeved Velvet Underground LP. Two years later I got a job at the New Musical Express because I fell in love with a record sleeve just as much if not more than I did with the disc within - Patti Smith’s Horses - and was inspired to write quite a lesbionic teenybopper flight of fancy about it.
OCT13	Mandatory consent classes will only turn young men off from being good feminists	When I was at university, I encountered all sorts of men. Most were nice, some were dreadful bores, others vile snobs, a handful were lovely and handsome, and a sprinkling were downright nasty. I gave those ones a wide berth (usually) and, despite several bruising relationships, basically left university intact in all the important ways. Nobody came close to laying an unwanted hand on me; nobody was coercive or threatening. Sadly, many women are not nearly so lucky. Reports of sexual violence at British universities have risen by 82 per cent in the past year. Universities clearly enable some of the very worst strains of laddish masculinity, with women paying a stark price. What to do? Anything, surely – but the embarrassingly thick-headed solution currently being rolled out: mandatory consent classes and gender-awareness training. That’s right. To make them realise it’s bad to treat women like worthless objects, to assault, harass and intimidate them, up to two-thirds of UK universities now insist on enrolment in consent classes, according to Universities UK.
OCT13	It would be a lethal mistake if the West shuts its eyes to the Isil 'bloodlands'	When I first visited Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial centre in Jerusalem, I was struck by a bleak statistic. Survival rates for Jews in Poland, Lithuania and the occupied parts of the USSR were lower even than in Germany. The Yale historian Timothy Snyder was later to explain why in a grim book called Black Earth. The most dangerous spaces in the world – not just for vulnerable minorities, but for everyone – are those where there is no functioning state. The Third Reich’s amoral regime still had police, courts and bureaucratic procedures, however illegitimate. In the occupied bloodlands, by contrast, there was only arbitrary force entirely devoid of residual restraints: Einsatzgruppen, local militias, execution pits. In the Third Reich, there were police, courts, bureaucratic procedures. Parts of Iraq and, even more, Syria, are now bloodlands, lacking anything that approximates the rule of law. But in contrast with those lawless areas of Eastern Europe that imprisoned innocent Jewish victims 80 years ago, today’s bloodlands host many of the dangerous Western-born extremists who joined the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil).
OCT13	So far so promising, as the crunch point approaches for Brexit talks	From the moment Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, conventional wisdom among Remainers dictated that his tenure would end in disaster. The EU would never re-open Theresa May’s appalling deal, they predicted, so there was no point in even asking for a renegotiation.

When I argued that we should put our MPs back in charge, I had no idea how little they wanted the job.
OCT14	Trapped by Parliament, Boris has little choice but to make concessions in search of a deal	Last week I described why each of the three key decision-makers in the latest Brexit negotiations – Boris Johnson, the Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish Prime Minister, Leo Varadkar – has a strong incentive to do a deal. Since then they have all duly demonstrated that they want to do one, despite optimism waxing and waning every few hours after each bulletin from Brussels. Yet some people in this country will be puzzled as to why the great majority of concessions seem to come from the British side, and why the “do or die” Prime Minister continues to make them. The UK has conceded that the island of Ireland will be one area for the purposes of regulations covering agricultural and manufactured goods and has, as far as one can tell, also accepted that any departure from that regime would require the consent of both nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland. On the third and most complex issue of customs rules, it is again the British Government that is giving ground from its initial position, although any solution will involve the EU and Ireland accepting some new way of managing customs, previously unknown in the world.
OCT14	My traditionally Labour constituency just wants Brexit done, so we can focus on the voters' other priorities	The Queen’s Speech showed us the great potential of post-Brexit Britain and the importance of getting Brexit done; not least because when we finally stop arguing about leaving, there are a million and one domestic priorities that need and deserve our attention. The speech focused on the key issue to cross my desk as Mansfield’s Member of Parliament, which is law and order. I’ve always felt that if a Conservative Government can’t achieve law and order, it is a failure. That is why it’s so brilliant to see Boris and our new Home Secretary working to revive the reputation of the Conservatives as the party of the police, and the party that is tough on crime. More officers on our streets, more powers to detain perpetrators of the worst crimes and to deport foreign criminals, more protections for the police and more support for victims. We’ll reduce violence in prisons, improve safety and invest in rehabilitation. That is an agenda to be proud of, and one that will hit home with members of the public.
OCT14	The EU is right to fear an ultra-competitive independent Britain	Remainers like to think of the UK as a non-entity, but it is Europe that is the over-regulated backwater In recent years, Brexit’s most implacable opponents have revelled in rubbishing Britain’s hopes of succeeding on the world stage. Britain is a diminished country, they insist, incapable of functioning on its own. Consider Emma Thompson’s description of the UK as “a cake-filled misery-laden grey old island”, or Michael Heseltine’s glorious Freudian slip when challenged about our economy outperforming EU rivals: the UK “is doing significantly better than you might hope”. Yet at the weekend came a dose of (unintended) optimism, from an equally unexpected quarter: Angela Merkel. The German Chancellor warned of the threat an independent UK posed to the EU. “With the departure of Great Britain, a potential competitor will of course emerge for us. In addition to China and the United States of America, there will be Great Britain as well.”
OCT14	The Queen’s Speech was a magical spectacle. Shame it was completely pointless	Normally, the State Opening of Parliament is a thing of wonder. The jewels, the clothes, the pageantry, the history – and above all, at least for me, the titles of those involved. Rouge Croix Pursuivant. Maltravers Herald Extraordinary. Gold Stick in Waiting. Master of the Horse.  As it happens, a few years ago I was lucky enough to meet the Rouge Croix Pursuivant. In exchange for discharging his duties, I learned, he was paid the handsome salary of £13.95. (Happily, through the College of Arms he was also able to charge fees for genealogical research and creating coats of arms.) At State Openings of Parliament he was provided with a tabard worth £45,000, but was expected to supply his own tights. He would buy them from the ladies’ hosiery department of John Lewis. He also told me that his driving licence didn’t bear his actual name (John Allen-Petrie); it simply said “Rouge Croix Pursuivant of Arms”. A great honour, of course, although he found it sometimes prompted puzzled looks when trying to hire a car abroad.  
OCT14	There's nothing 'populist' about cracking down hard on crime	“Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.” Tony Blair’s mantra was aimed at placating anger over rising criminality while reassuring the liberal intelligentsia whose good opinion he wanted to retain. It was a balancing act David Cameron attempted to imitate as he invited us to “hug a hoodie”. Under Theresa May, the Tories drifted even further away from their once-hawkish reputation on law and order. But fewer police on the streets, overcrowded and drug-infested prisons, a failing parole system and record levels of knife crime have all combined to create a feeling of insecurity. It is this insecurity that Boris Johnson’s government is seeking to address and Priti Patel as Home Secretary has left us in no doubt about the direction of travel. “We are coming after you” is her message to criminals, and yesterday’s Queen’s Speech filled in the detail of previously sketched out plans. Violent and sex offenders will face longer sentences. The horrific consequences of releasing prisoners only half way through their sentences were revealed by this newspaper last week: almost a fifth of all murders are committed by prisoners on parole who have been let out of jail early. Under the Government’s proposed reform, anyone jailed for four years or more will have to serve at least two-thirds of their sentence before they can be released.
OCT14	Donald Trump has empowered all of the most heinous anti-Western forces in the Middle East	With the decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, President Donald Trump promised to put an end to “endless” wars in the Middle East. But instead of making Americans safer, the move has already emboldened global extremist forces and threatened western allies in the region. The shameful betrayal of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces evokes dark memories of the genocide in Rwanda and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans when vulnerable populations under international protection were abandoned and left to be slaughtered. The same Kurdish forces who liberated thousands of enslaved Yazidis and offered refuge to other displaced minorities are now being indiscriminately wiped out with Western-supplied weapons by Turkey, a Nato member. How can we allow for this?
OCT14	Scrapping useless rail franchises makes sense – it's already making fares cheaper and passengers happier	The government’s announcement outlined in today’s Queen’s speech that it is to scrap franchising is, on the face of it welcome news. It is universally accepted that the current system is not fit for purpose. I and others from across the political spectrum with knowledge of the industry have been arguing this for years.  Franchising is universally unpopular; it’s inflexible, provides no incentive for operators to innovate and acts like a Mafia protection racket shielding operators from competition. In short, it is a far cry from what rail privatisation was supposed to deliver – innovation, better value fares, lower running cost and real competition.  The greatest failure of the current model is that is adopts a "one size fits all" solution regardless of whether you’re a commuter on the heavily congested 0757 from Surbiton to Waterloo or venturing back from Matlock to the surrounding Derbyshire dales after a late night at the pub. Rail routes and the markets they serve are as diverse as Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck in Bray is from the local Slough McDonalds. 
OCT14	Boris Johnson can only make this Queen's Speech a reality by breaking the Brexit impasse	As I headed off for a post-party conference break two weeks ago, the big problem facing Boris Johnson was how to deal with the legislation he likes to dismiss as the "surrender act". That is even more the case today.  The pomp and ceremony in today's State Opening of Parliament might lead some to think the Government was ready to deliver on its agenda after a smaller (and therefore legally non-contentious) prorogation with verve. That zeal is undeniable, as the Queen made clear from her very first line: "My Government’s priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on the 31st October." Her Majesty announced five bills as part of the Government's Brexit drive, which seek to set up fundamental parts of British life outside of the European Union like its regimes for immigration and customs. These were all items of legislation Theresa May promised to introduce back in 2017, but parliamentary opposition meant they did not make it into law by the time Mr Johnson's prorogation took effect, thereby requiring them to begin their journey again. But this time, they have to deal with what the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has rightly branded a "dead Parliament".
OCT14	Why should Boris kowtow to biased BBC presenters who say that he's a 'dictator'?	If I were a prominent BBC journalist  (I know, I know... but suspend your disbelief for a moment) I think I would be cautious about throwing around charges that it is only other people who are in the propaganda business. People in glasshouses, etc. But clearly no such misgivings are weighing on Nick Robinson's mind.  The Today presenter, speaking at a literary festival at the weekend, took aim at the Prime Minister's use of Facebook to answer questions from the public. According to Robinson, Boris Johnson's "people's PMQs" sessions on Facebook, in which he is able to “broadcast directly” to the public, are nothing less than “a form of propaganda used by dictators down the ages”. Which is quite a serious charge when you come to think of it, and one worth unpicking. Boris acting like a dictator? A curious accusation when we currently have a Prime Minister who cannot command a majority in the House of Commons, whose hands have been tied by his political opponents  and who has arrayed against him the massed ranks of the Establishment. Only an over-heated imagination could possibly espy a sinister dictator in that beleaguered figure.
OCT14	The curious case of Mumsnet, Flora margarine, and the spread of fascism in the trans-gender debate	Mums are boycotting Flora margarine. Not because, let’s be honest, whatever the health benefits, marg is never going to taste as indulgently delicious as butter. But because Upfield, owner of Flora and a number of other plant-based spreads, has pulled the brand’s links to Mumsnet, the online parenting resource and all-round mothers’ mouthpiece. Mumsnet’s offence was to allow discussion of issues relating to the transgender debate on its message boards – where some of its more than 10 million members raised such controversies as whether female professional athletes were losing out to competitors who were once male.  A forum in which mothers discussed their concerns about the growing number of children questioning their gender and the best ways to help them was deemed a particular red flag.
OCT15	Why Nicola still hopes Brussels says No to Boris	There was no end of standing ovations for Nicola Sturgeon at her conference in Aberdeen yesterday, especially as she claims we’re going to have another independence referendum next year. Her activists looked to be heading happily for home on the back of such a promise. But then that was what this assembly was all about – independence, independence and independence - and firing up those activists with the process of legislation and constitutional change. The polls may be reporting that support for independence is growing, and far be it for me to challenge the voters’ wisdom, but what is it that they’re supporting?
OCT15	Have Labour stumbled on a cunning new excuse for blocking an election?	Until a few years ago, most people were probably pretty much agreed about Britain’s place in the world. It seemed fairly straightforward. Up a bit from France, just round the corner from Holland, you can’t miss it.  Since the 2016 referendum, however, the question has taken on a new, much deeper meaning, and caused seemingly endless squabbling. Politically, we’ve turned into a family from the 1980s who have got lost on a road trip: the parents bickering furiously over the map, while the children in the back drone, “Are we nearly there yet? Are we nearly there yet?” Then again, at least parents on 1980s road trips knew where they wanted to end up. MPs can’t even agree on that. On Tuesday in the Commons they actually held a debate entitled “Britain’s Place in the World”. Naturally they spent most of it arguing about Brexit.
OCT15	Hard-pressed farmers are the real victims of an ideological war on meat	As I write this, I have in front of me a programme for the National Farmers’ Union annual dinner dance from 2005. It contains a list of past chairmen going back to 1920, and on the front this quote from Cicero: “There is nothing better than farming, nothing more fruitful, nothing more delightful, nothing more worthy of a free man.” The sense of what it means to be a farmer, and that it is truly something to be proud of, is palpable.  Things today, sadly, could hardly be more different. Depression and high suicide rates in the farming community are well recognised and prevalent all over the world. But to some of the old reasons for this – isolation, financial pressure and a reluctance to seek help – we can now add a new one: the victimisation of farmers by the increasingly extreme environmental movement. Far from being respected and appreciated, farmers are modern society’s whipping boys and girls. It was heartening to see Minette Batters, the NFU president, taking the fight to Tesco this week by expressing the concern of many farmers at one of the supermarket’s recent adverts. This featured a meat-loving dad giving in to his daughter when she says: “Daddy, I don’t want to eat animals any more.” No doubt some viewers found it cute. But for farmers whose livelihoods are at risk due to the demonisation of meat, the mawkishness and subtle-as-a-brick sermonising came as yet another kick. 
OCT15	The EU's spineless leaders, always vocal about Brexit, have gone strangely silent on Catalonia	This week, pro-democracy activists were handed down lengthy prison sentences. Their leader, forced to live in exile, condemned the authorities’ “repression”. No, I’m not describing any kind of clampdown in Hong Kong. Those sent to prison were not living in Africa or Venezuela. They were in Spain – a supposedly civilised European state. Nine leaders of the Catalan nationalist movement have been imprisoned for organising an independence “referendum” in 2017. The poll they ran was, by any objective measure, neither free nor fair. The Spanish government would have been entirely justified to have simply ignored it. But they did much more than that, incarcerating those that ran it, inflaming opinion, and stoking up precisely the separatist sentiments that they fear. To appreciate quite how draconian the behaviour of the Spanish state has been, conduct this little thought experiment. Imagine for a moment that it was Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP who had been forced to flee Scotland after running an impromptu poll. Try to contemplate a scenario under which Ian Blackford MP had been sentenced to time in Wormwood Scrubs.
OCT15	We are closing in on a deal that would enable the UK to reap the full benefits of Brexit	Clear patterns are emerging in this process Only a very small circle of people know exactly what is being proposed by the UK in the Brexit negotiations – or, for that matter, what the EU has deemed acceptable – but some clear patterns are emerging. The discipline of both sides has been much better than in the past, with a minimum of briefing and counter-briefing. This is a good sign. More briefing means less of a chance of a deal.
OCT15	Brexiteers want Boris to take a delay and fight on for a better deal, not palm them off now with a fudge	Even members of the Brexit Party now admit the PM could survive breaking his 'do or die' pledge to leave by October 31 if he stays true to his Eurosceptic principles Of the many alternative branches of history Dominic Cummings has envisaged, he undoubtedly had a better scenario in mind for the Government than the one we're currently living in. If Boris Johnson had succeeded in his first attempt to hold an election, today would be polling day. By now, he could be happily waiting for the exit poll and looking forward to being returned with a healthy majority, ready to proceed full steam ahead with getting Brexit done.
OCT15	Just how ready is the EU for a No Deal Brexit?	Across continental Europe, fears of disruption give a powerful incentive to negotiate Boris Johnson and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar's apparently successful meeting has sparked renewed hopes for a deal between Britain and the EU that would ensure an orderly exit. The EU seems to have accepted that Northern Ireland could remain in the UK’s customs union legally, enabling the Northern Irish to reap the benefits of UK trade deals, but with customs checks taking place inside the UK, to avoid them at the border with the Irish Republic. Both sides, however, are still searching for agreement on how to secure democratic “consent” for Northern Ireland. EU officials been extremely wary of anything that looks too much like a veto for the DUP, and they remain concerned that the Prime Minister could still find a legal way to leave the EU unilaterally, despite the Benn act ordering him to request an extension, absent agreement by 19 October. Though a deal remains far from certain, Boris Johnson has reiterated his pledge to leave by the end of the month.
OCT15	Of course Corbyn wanted to pull out of Nato. What does Emily Thornberry have to gain from pretending otherwise?	That Members of Parliament are behaving in an extraordinary fashion is hardly front page news any more. We’ve succumbed to a sort of political torpor, where reports of MPs screaming and shouting invective in the chamber of the House of Commons, of singing, applauding, holding up political banners and taking selfies are greeted with a nonchalant shrug and a desire to change channels. So very few people will have noticed the unseemly spat between the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and his opposite number, Emily Thornberry, at the despatch box this morning. It began with a casual reference by Raab to the fact that Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has spent his entire political career campaigning against Nato and Britain’s membership of it. Raab’s succinct summary was: “The leader of the Labour Party has called for us to come out of Nato.” This was not a controversial thing to say. It’s like suggesting Gary Lineker is a supporter of the England football team, or that Hillary Clinton didn’t vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Corbyn’s political record over decades speaks for itself: he made a name for himself with every far-Left outfit in the land by banging on about how awful Nato was, how we should disarm our nukes and how it would be perfectly fine if we did so while Russia kept theirs.
OCT15	If only Parliament were willing to make Boris's 'fantasy' Queen's Speech a reality	It is hard not to agree with the Liberal Democrat MP Sir Edward Davey who observed that this was "a fantasy Queen's Speech". There is not very much in it that stands any chance of getting through this Parliament and indeed little prospect of a general election anytime soon – possibly not for a couple of years. Although the speech asserted that the Government's priority is to achieve Brexit by October 31, this looks a formidably difficult task, especially in the light of the Surrender Act. It is certainly an urgent task (as the speech put it) to seize the opportunity to work to implement new regimes for fisheries. If things go on as they are for much longer, the damage caused by the vandalising of fish stocks will take decades to repair. 
OCT15	This photo of Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar shows how deep the UK-Ireland friendship is	The meeting between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar at Thornton Manor last week illustrated the remarkable power of photographs. Amongst the several pictures betokening a relaxed friendship between the two leaders, the one which stands out is of the two men deep in conversation strolling along a grassy tree-lined path. It could be taken as a metaphor for the pathway towards possible Brexit agreement which, against all expectations, they managed to identify. As the formal Brexit negotiations which have resumed in Brussels now seek to thrash out an agreement, it is worth reflecting on the impact of a simple photograph. Whatever happens, for four reasons the picture will be of lasting significance in British/Irish relations. First, the photo captures the real and deep friendship between our two countries which has been somewhat obscured in recent times. While only a small minority, in both our countries, appear to want to go back to a darker past, it is obvious that the Brexit experience has had a wider impact on public opinion. The unavoidable fact that Brexit has set the UK and Ireland on different trajectories has been compounded by a serious misunderstanding by some of Ireland’s motivations. 
OCT16	With a deal in sight, the Prime Minister has been vindicated	Whatever happens next, the past few days of frenetic talks to try to reach a new Brexit deal have been a vindication of Boris Johnson’s policy. He came to office in July determined to secure a different arrangement from that negotiated by his predecessor but was told it was impossible. The EU, said his critics, will simply not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and especially not for the man they blame for Brexit. But they did, as he said they would; and his endeavours are bearing fruit. The Prime Minister’s determination has paid political dividends with a surge in support for the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Just a few months ago the party was on its knees, registering just 8 per cent in the European elections and facing an existential meltdown. Now the Tories are well ahead of Labour, even in London, according to one survey. Were Mr Johnson to get Brexit over the line, the Opposition would be plunged into disarray, which is why they will try to block anything he agrees with Brussels. Were he to fail, he can at least campaign in the general election that must follow as having tried his hardest only to be thwarted by those who want to reverse the referendum result.
OCT16	This may be Leavers' last, realistic chance to achieve a proper Brexit	They gambled and won by rejecting May’s awful deal. Now they should help the PM achieve the real thing We are about to find out whether the Brexiteers’ great gamble is going to pay off. They were told that Theresa May’s abysmal half-in, half-out deal was their last chance, the final hope of clinching some sort of Brexit, albeit fatally adulterated. It was either that, or watch powerlessly as a hostile, all-powerful Remain establishment slowly extinguished their dream. A hard-core of Brexiteers – the Spartans – didn’t accept this counsel of despair. They chose instead to roll the dice one last time: the fact that Mrs May, a rudderless, ideologically bereft PM, had decided to rat on them was not a good enough reason to hoist the white flag. The public had saved the day once; it would do so again, or so the Brexiteers convinced themselves.
OCT16	The PM's 'great Brexit gamble' on sticky fudge over noble delay could be about to backfire	There is something over-eager about the idea of a “do or die deadline” – an already dangerous word smeared with a gratuitous dollop of Johnsonian rhetorical urgency. Ironically, a “deadline” was once a concept to be avoided, referring to a line prisoners could not cross, lest they be shot. And indeed, as the clock ticks, Brexiteers are starting to realise that the October 31 deadline could be lethal. For, if the PM has felt pressured into accepting a bad deal for fear of breaking his promise, any hope of a clean Brexit could be killed off. The belief in Westminster that any deal is better than delay has some logic. Brexit has become adrenaline-free anticipation in the exhausted search of an ending. And, from the hyenish hysteria of Remainers to the soiled aroma of capitulating politicians, “nightmare” does not do justice to the desolate, multi-sensory torture of the last three-and-a-half years. It is also undeniable that, if there is a delay, many voters will defect to Nigel Farage, exasperated that another Tory PM has broken a sacred Brexit vow. But it would be a mistake to sign up to a worrying deal, for the sake of “October 31”. Many Leavers can smell the sickly seep of fudge in the near distance and would prefer to go hungry for now. This is not an intransigent or extreme position. Stabbing at a plate of Swedish meatballs, one Tory MP told me this week that the Brexiteers are “suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, terrified to leave Brexit purgatory”. But the idea that Leavers are reluctant to forsake the dystopian neatness of their spartan prison cells for the messy realism of a deal is wrong.
OCT16	Labour MPs are not going to give Boris Johnson his Brexit triumph	One of the mistakes that people like me made was to write off Boris Johnson’s chances of becoming Prime Minister. Why did we do it? Because we didn’t listen carefully enough to Conservative MPs. The average Tory MP, when asked about Johnson, would say that they were unconvinced that he had the makings of a great PM, and that the Conservative Party’s future lay with Jeremy Hunt or Sajid Javid. But then their eyes would light up like hubcaps and they would tell you about how, when Johnson visited their association, passers-by, not even members, would stop him and ask for selfies. In the end, faced with a tough election, they opted for the party’s one genuine out-and-out star. Now the PM may be on the verge of securing a deal with the EU, but his chances of getting Parliament to pass it are far from certain.
OCT16	The rise of 'hate crimes' has made victims of us all	The Home Office's announcement that hate crimes have surged this year has triggered a predictable outcry. Some pressure groups find it expedient to argue that hate crime is rising, preferably fast enough to call it an 'epidemic'. Yet though police-recorded hate crime rose by 10 per cent in 2018-19, the same Home Office report admitted that the increase was mainly the result of improved recording. Moreover, the Crime Survey for England and Wales, an annual survey of 50,000 households, found that in the decade to 2017-18, hate crime fell by 40 per cent. In America, after decades of inexcusable discrimination, from the mid-1980s laws were passed to punish more severely offenders judged to have been prejudiced. The UK followed and the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act created the possibility that assault, harassment, criminal damage and public order offences could be racially aggravated and punished more harshly. Later laws applied to religion, sexual orientation, disability and transgender.
OCT16	If victory comes, Brexiteers must resist the temptation to play furious Remainers at their own game	It remains to be seen whether Boris Johnson can persuade a majority of MPs to back his new deal on Saturday, but the mere possibility that he might succeed – and take us out with a deal on October 31 – is driving Remainers round the twist. If you thought Brexit Derangement Syndrome was bad, you ain't seen nothing yet. A clue as to how the provisional wing of the Europhile Army is likely to react was provided by the historian Simon Schama in a tweet: “Should this non-government succeed in forcing our exit from the EU on Halloween let all of us who bitterly mourn ring funeral bells and light bonfires of rage and grief and resolution at 12pm – up and down the nation.”  Actually, if we do leave on October 31 it will be at 11pm, not midnight, but let’s gloss over that fact. The image of Remainers wandering the streets, ringing bells and carrying burning torches, is reminiscent of a scene from one of Hammer’s Dracula films. Will Simon and his mob of bug-eyed zealots be looking for heretics to burn on these “bonfires of rage”?  Brexiteers planning to celebrate with street parties of their own may want to be on their mettle.
OCT16	Say what you like about Stephen Barclay, but he’s got one thing that no other MP can match	Competition is stiff, but in my view there’s only one winner. The most boring voice in politics belongs to Stephen Barclay. It’s like listening to a fridge. A low, constant, unvarying background hum, so quiet that your ears soon stop picking it up altogether, and you completely forget it’s there. This morning I spent two hours watching the Brexit Secretary take questions from the Brexit select committee. It would have been fine if his answers had been worth staying conscious for, but most of them were doggedly, even defiantly vague. No matter how straightforward the question, the reply was usually a kind of verbal smudge. You could squint at it through your magnifying glass as hard as you liked, but you could never be entirely certain what it was. Partly this was because, like so many politicians, Mr Barclay adheres to a strict rule: never use one word when 38 will do. Labour’s Hilary Benn, chairman of the committee, asked how Boris Johnson would respond if, for any reason, a Brexit deal fell through. Could Mr Barclay confirm that the Prime Minister would send the EU a letter, asking for more time?
OCT16	Yet again, Remainer MPs are sneaking off to Brussels to undermine the will of the people	Remainers should not be left to negotiate Brexit. That was surely the biggest lesson to draw from Theresa May’s short-lived premiership. For all the hollow soundbites of ‘Brexit means Brexit’, her instincts were to preserve as many of the conditions of EU membership as possible. As we all now know the result was a deal detested by Leavers and Remainers alike. Depending on where you look, Boris Johnson’s talks are either on the cusp of a breakthrough or are on the verge of disintegrating. But although the country’s leadership and the people officially leading the negotiations are a bit more Brexity, Remainers are still attempting to negotiate with the EU -- albeit unofficially. A cross-party selection of fervently pro-Remain MPs was spotted this morning about to take the Eurostar to Brussels. Among their number was Dominic Grieve, Caroline Lucas, David Lammy and Vince Cable. The MPs are reportedly planning to ask Brussels for an extension to the Article 50 process in advance of this week’s EU summit. Officially, under the terms of the Benn act, Johnson’s government is supposed to ask for an extension if talks break down, which would leave open the possibility of No Deal.
OCT16	Delaying Brexit would be the real nightmare scenario for our economy	If we don’t leave in the next couple of weeks, we face months, possibly years, of chaotic indecision Raising the minimum wage to £30 an hour. Shifting to a three day week with no reduction in pay. Doubling the number of bank holidays, making duvet days compulsory, and handing out free Toblerones in the staff canteen. There are lots of potential policies it would be surprising to see a group of business leaders backing. But an immediate no-deal Brexit is probably right at the top of the list. We have heard so many warnings for so long about its potentially catastrophic impact that we just assume every chief executive is against it.  But hold on. In the Daily Telegraph yesterday an impressive group of entrepreneurs, including the founders of Hiscox and First Property Group, argued that in fact any form of postponement would be the worst possible outcome. “This rank uncertainty is crippling British business and it cannot continue”, they argued. That is surely right. In truth, there is nothing more damaging to an economy than uncertainty, and the only way left to end it is to make sure we are out by the end of this month. 
OCT16	What Boris meant by 'do or die' has become clear for MPs: do his deal or Brexit dies away	Anyone hoping, encouraged by Dominic Cummings' public bravado, that ministers had found an ingenious way to get around the Benn Act in order to fulfill Boris Johnson's "do or die" desire for Brexit by the end of this month is set for disappointment. The Government has indicated that the only viable loophole it has found to avoid a legal obligation is the one laid out under the terms of the Brexit-delay-mandating legislation, namely securing Parliament's approval for a deal. Stephen Barclay confirmed to the mastermind of the so-called "Surrender Act", Hillary Benn, and his fellow Brexit committee members that the Government would "comply" with the law. The Brexit Secretary made clear that the government would respect the undertakings it gave to the courts earlier this month, which were so explicit in promising that the prime minister "will send a letter" as stipulated that the judges did not feel it necessary to issue any order to ensure compliance.
