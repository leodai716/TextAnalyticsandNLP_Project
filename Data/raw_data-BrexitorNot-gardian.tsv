SEP2	Term is starting – and English schools must tackle their arts emergency	A new school year is about to begin. This means that I might soon arrive at a school and do a poetry workshop with some younger teenagers. It could well go like this. They make it clear that they don’t like poetry. I tell them poetry comes in hundreds of different shapes, sizes, rhythms and moods; one way we can make poems is in a group and without writing anything down. For example, the people who are in charge of us in life have ways of showing they are fed up with us, angry with us, or through which they try to control us; punish us, even. What do such people say? I suggest they go into pairs and say these kinds of things to each other – in role, as parents, teachers, carers. We select the best lines. Then I say, can we create this into a scene? They suggest that all the lines should be said to just one of them sitting in a chair; the rest stand in a semicircle around him, and as they each say their line they point at the boy in the chair and then step back, while the semicircle repeats a chosen chorus. We have made a snapshot of one aspect of their lives. It has rhythm, structure, solo and chorus, movement and mimesis. Later they can perform it for others, write a transcript of it and “publish” it on a school blog. We can talk about what we have made: what worked? Was it like any other poems or plays?	0
APR3	Rees-Mogg and the AfD’s Alice Weidel have a lot in common – all of it nasty	My first reaction on hearing that Jacob Rees-Mogg had retweeted a video by the populist German Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) was: “Well, that figures.” And not just because the AfD is the nasty party in German politics and because Rees-Mogg represents the faction that wants the Conservatives to remain the nasty party in Britain. One of the driving forces behind the AfD is a very German inferiority complex regarding the second world war. Rees-Mogg, with his foppish retro look and accent, embodies the Britain that German nationalists think they lost the war to. A Britain they despise, envy and admire in almost equal measure. What binds Alice Weidel to a party of older white males is her almost pathological hatred of foreigners	0
FEB15	Who’s the biggest failure in the Brexit cabinet: Chris Grayling – or Liam Fox?	How badly do you have to mess up, these days, before you’re not allowed in Theresa May’s cabinet? Just how far does tolerance stretch? You might imagine Chris Grayling to be the ultimate prototype in this real-world experiment, with his granting then cancelling of a £13.8m ferry contract to a ferry company with no ferries, but let us also observe the progress of Liam Fox. Fox is one of the most vocal and optimistic Brexiteers in politics. In 2016, he declared that a trade deal with the EU would be “one of the easiest in human history”. In 2017, he promised to “replicate the 40 EU free trade agreements that exist before we leave the European Union so we’ve got no disruption of trade”, and they would be ready “one second after midnight in March 2019”.	1
FEB28	For Kashmir, there is only one strategy left to try: peace	In the summer of 1999, I was standing outside our ancestral home in Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, when I saw fighter jets roar past in the skies above me. The Indian air force was carrying out sorties towards the mountainous district of Kargil to dislodge Pakistani militants and, as we found out later, Pakistani soldiers. The troops had quietly occupied the snow-capped peaks as part of a stealth operation masterminded by the then Pakistani general and future president Pervez Musharraf. The sight and sound of sophisticated military hardware provided a brief thrill, but it soon turned into panic. What if these bombers dropped their lethal cache on our home? At night, as I lay in bed, I imagined our neighbourhood as rubble from which acrid smoke rose. I imagined dear ones lying dead in homes and on streets, like in war films. I saw friends and myself as bodies in pools of blood. It was terrifying.	0
FEB22	The EU must resist impatience with Britain – for its own sake	“I will celebrate,” said an emphatic German voice behind me, while some dignitary on stage mouthed the conventional polite platitudes of regret about Britain’s departure from the EU. “I will celebrate when it’s over at last.” A week spent talking to politicians, officials and opinion-makers on the continent tells me that this captures the prevailing mood among Britain’s frustrated and increasingly contemptuous European partners: just get the negotiated withdrawal agreement across the line and Britain out of the door – then we can go back to fighting the real battles for Europe, starting with the European elections. While I understand all the feelings and calculations behind this view, it is profoundly shortsighted. It abandons those of us still fighting for Europe in Britain and underestimates the EU’s role in deciding Britain’s future. A divided country in the midst of a collective nervous breakdown is painfully dependent on the reaction of its now much stronger EU negotiating partner. This explains why every tweet from Donald Tusk, every hint from Jean-Claude Juncker, every nuance from Michel Barnier, is pored over in the British media with almost Sovietological attention. The EU is a major actor in the British debate, not merely a reactor to it. The conclusion is clear: it’s not just Britain that faces a big choice over Brexit, it’s also Europe.	1
AUG24	Poor Prince Andrew is ‘appalled’ by Epstein. Let that be an end to it	It’s basically your classic men-of-the-world vignette. Lying in business dress in the New York mansion of his friend Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew is receiving a foot massage from a young, well-dressed Russian woman. Other men are in the room while this is happening, and they include Epstein (also being foot-massaged by a Russian woman) and the literary agent John Brockman, who runs a foundation connecting scientists and intellectuals with billionaires. As the young Russians work on their feet, Andy is complaining about his lot. “In Monaco,” he says, according to Brockman’s account, “[Prince] Albert works 12 hours a day but at 9pm, when he goes out, he does whatever he wants, and nobody cares. But, if I do it, I’m in big trouble.” Waa waa waa. What could be a more effective heartstring-tugger than “other European princes have it better than me”? It’s right up there with Chandler’s line from Friends: “My wallet’s too small for my 50s, and my diamond shoes are too tight!”	0
SEP19	Suddenly, it’s OK to be German and to talk about race	When I was growing up there was no racism in Germany. In the 1980s every child learned at school that race was a construct that fascists had used to justify segregating and killing people. So if race didn’t exist, it naturally followed that racism didn’t exist either. If you wanted to talk about it people looked at you as if you were the Nazi. All this is changing. It is dizzying to watch my motherland grapple with the concept of race. And, to be honest, to grapple with it myself because when you stop speaking about something you stop thinking about it eventually too. So we’re all walking on eggshells; the discussion about racism is on the agenda but we’re whispering “race” as if it were a dirty word. Except for members of Alternative für Deutschland, the far-right party, who keep pushing the boundaries of what you can and can’t say, and at every opportunity tout their worries about “other races” outbreeding white Germans. Germans of colour, meanwhile, worry about the AfD’s success in winning a quarter of the votes in recent state elections in Saxony and Brandenburg.	0
FEB22	I served in the Met. The lack of progress on diversity is disgusting	The question that needs to be asked is not “are the Metropolitan police institutionally racist?”, or “why does black and minority ethnic recruitment for the police still lag so far behind the diversity of London as a whole?” It should simply be: “Why do young black and minority ethnic people reject the Metropolitan police as a career choice?” This week, marking 20 years since the landmark Macpherson report on institutional racism in the police, the Met said it would take 100 years for the force to mirror the wider diversity of London and will remain disproportionately white. Why?	0
MAR6	I will survive: how Failing Grayling made himself unsackable	What does it take to get sacked by Theresa May these days? That’s a question being asked on the other side of the Atlantic after the bumbling transport secretary, Chris Grayling, went global and became the subject of an editorial in the New York Times. Under the headline “How does he survive? The curious case of ‘Failing Grayling’ ?, the paper describes him as “a byword for haplessness in a golden age of political blundering in Britain ?. While the NYT has developed a reputation of late for gloomy coverage of UK politics, Grayling’s political survival is also the subject of increasing astonishment in the UK. The Labour party claims that, as a government minister, Grayling has cost the taxpayer a total of £2.7bn by way of political gaffes. Meanwhile, there are plenty of Conservative MPs who have grown impatient with their colleague over continuing train problems that have got their constituents seeing red. Most recently, Grayling made the news for a ferry fiasco, when he awarded a no-deal ferry contract to a company with no ferries and then had to pay out £33m to Eurotunnel over the decision.	1
JUN18	I thought I would die in Brook House. Now my abusers will have to face justice	I thought this moment would never come, but I always clung on to hope. I spent nearly two years in Brook House immigration detention centre and I was abused by the officers, like so many other people there. It often felt as if no one would ever find out what was happening. But on Friday a judge ordered an inquiry that will make sure the voices of people like me are heard, and make sure our abusers will finally face justice. If you saw BBC’s Panorama documentary in 2017 on abuse in immigration detention services, you would have seen me. But what was shown on TV wasn’t even half of what went on. We were bullied every day. We were mocked all the time. There would be a casual racist taunt as you came down to breakfast – a casual punch as you went to your cell to try to sleep. And much more. Those who couldn’t speak English got it the worst. Someone I knew well tried to hang himself; the officers took their time in responding. They didn’t care whether we lived or died.	0
AUG21	The real consequence of a no-deal Brexit is not short-term shock – it’s a long recession	A couple of days before the UK voted to leave the EU, the official remain campaign, Stronger In, released a bulletin of what it imagined the news headlines to be the next day in the event of a leave vote. Job losses would ensue, it said; prices would rise, the pound would plummet, and the UK would be stuck in a protracted negotiation process for the next decade. (Tellingly, the issue of the Irish border wasn’t mentioned.) Since the vote, sure, life is worse in the UK than it was in 2016 – but it’s hard to pin that on Brexit, as a sense of national decline is at least partly why a majority voted to leave in the first place. Indeed, aside from the parliamentary absurdities of the past three years and the slide in sterling’s value, it’s fair to say that the predicted catastrophe hasn’t really happened. The principal group of people whose lives have been immediately disrupted by Brexit are EU citizens and the victims of increased racist hate crimes. Shamefully, that doesn’t seem to be reason enough to give us pause as a nation – and so we’ve pressed on.	1
OCT3	The climate protest movement must not alienate Britain’s working classes	Next week thousands of Extinction Rebellion protesters will descend on Westminster, the latest example of direct action in a year when committed women, men and children across the world have pushed climate change to the top of the global agenda, where it belongs. Although London will again be the focal point, the movement mustn’t overlook the committed activists in places such as Bolton, Wigan, and Sunderland who are also spreading the message across the country. For the climate movement to succeed we have to build a broad coalition that covers our nation’s towns as well as our cities, and reaches out across class divides. Calls for individual action can’t just be modelled on the lifestyles of middle-class city dwellers. Telling people to get out of their cars can’t be the solution in those parts of the country where decades of chronic underinvestment have left us without public transport. In towns such as Wigan, jobs have disappeared as investment flowed into cities, creating lengthy commutes on public transport for most working-age people. Trains are overcrowded, deeply unreliable and ceased to function entirely for a large part of last year, while the buses are few and far between, and often more expensive than getting a taxi. Demanding people abandon their cars isn’t realistic if the alternative is a round trip of 42 miles a day on foot or by bike, just to get to work. Campaigns to tackle climate change need to link up with campaigns for better transport and fairer funding for it, particularly for buses.	0
SEP19	The NHS saved Mum - but I saw a system on life support	A week ago the NHS saved my mum’s life. She had been prescribed some new blood pressure medication which caused her sodium levels to plummet dangerously. Clinicians in A&E ran blood tests, identified the problem and treated it, restoring the balance of minerals so that her sodium was once again coexisting in harmony with her potassium and the various other things floating around in the blood that we take for granted until something goes wrong with them. The staff were, without exception, kind, competent and respectful. So what’s the problem? My mum is the perfect case study for just how good the NHS is at saving lives and looking after older people. But the bits in between, the cement that glues the bricks, is crumbling into dust. And like the climate crisis this erosion is speeding up with disastrous consequences.	0
SEP2	We know life is a game of chance, so why not draw lots to see who gets the job?	The sweaty palms, the swotting, the tricky question that prompts your heart to plummet: job interviews are no one’s idea of a good time. The other side of the equation is hardly fun either: days out of a busy schedule spent interviewing candidates, some of whom you know within a couple of minutes you would never offer a job. Interviews are time-consuming for all involved. But we persist in doing them because recruitment decisions are some of the most important we take in the workplace and it follows we should invest time and energy into a robust recruitment process, right?	0
JUN27	An Islamophobic security agenda shouldn't mix with arts funding	The last few days have seen a furore over the Bradford literature festival’s decision to accept funding from the Home Office. Some 12 speakers have pulled out of the event so far, in protest at the source of the money, the government’s “Building a Stronger Britain Together” fund, a scheme that supports projects that supposedly counter extremism. As a result of the row, reputational damage has been done to this award-winning festival. Let’s be clear why this has happened: the government refuses to engage with Muslim communities in a meaningful way – unless it is under the auspices of counter- extremism or counter-terrorism. Why does funding offered to Muslim communities so often appear under this guise? We’ve also seen this in the form of the goverment’s terrible Prevent counter terror strategy, which is a toxic presence and is already under review.	0
SEP17	There’s nothing normal about this beast of a government	How grimly symbolic of the times in which we live that it is necessary to correct the prime minister on his reference to comic book characters. Only a couple of years ago, Boris Johnson was urging the Tory party conference, in pseudo-Churchillian phrases, to “let the [British] lion roar”. Now, in an interview with the Mail on Sunday, he is invoking more primitive and aggressive imagery. If he fails to get a new Brexit deal with the EU, he will simply ignore the legislation requiring him to seek an article 50 extension: “The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.”	1
SEP28	Tory moderates may have to fight to get their party back	If Boris Johnson is capable of shame, then he should surely now be feeling it. He has brought this country to the point where an election is genuinely to be feared, no matter who wins, because of the violence that may follow; where MPs facing death threats will need all the courage they can muster just to go out campaigning, and decent voters will switch off from the spite and hysteria surrounding them. It should go without saying that Johnson’s dismissive response to the Labour MP Paula Sherriff, when she challenged his deliberately provocative talk of surrender and betrayal over Brexit, was awful. Having listened in the past to Sherriff matter-of-factly describe the threats she has faced from the far right, and the depressingly elaborate precautions so many of her colleagues must take just to go about their everyday life, I too feel rage bubbling up at the idea that this was somehow faux concern. But what if rage is what they want, those determined to turn this next election into some kind of political hunger games? For only when we are goaded beyond reason, red mist descending at the slightest provocation, can they get the reaction their divide-and-conquer strategy needs.	1
JUN30	Lucy Bronze, the England player who won me over to the World Cup	I was so excited about England’s first match of the Women’s World Cup that I trotted off to my local. Last summer, it had been a regular haunt, thanks to the men’s World Cup, which filled the beer garden for almost every match, whether England were playing or not. On that first Sunday afternoon, two televisions were on, cricket on one and rugby on the other. I asked the landlady if they were showing the World Cup. She hadn’t known it was on, she said, but she gave one of the screens to us and we sat there, an audience of two, cheering bashfully. That already feels like a long time ago. What a delight this tournament has been. Support has grown as the games have progressed and England made their way to a semi-final once again. I’m a relative newcomer to enjoying sport, and certainly football, but the women’s game feels welcoming to someone like me. I never would have dreamed that I’d be talking about starting lineups and reading match reports, but I’ve begun to have tentative conversations about them, the words new and cautious as they form. I have never known the names of an entire football team... until now. The cheering has become less bashful already.	0
APR2	A customs union would not solve the Brexit conundrum	Parliament has a little over one week to prove that it can do what Theresa May should have allowed it to do after her failure in the 2017 election, and come up with a plan that saves us from the Brexit cliff edge. The question is whether it can, without the constraints of Mrs May’s self-imposed red lines, agree a deal based on the creation of a permanent customs union, and perhaps also continuing membership of the single market. Only a minority of the Conservative party, which now looks increasingly like the leave campaign, would buy into this, as most now want to leave the EU with as “clean” a break as possible, however painful. But we may find in the coming days that there is a cross-party majority of MPs – including possibly the DUP – who are willing to back a softer form of Brexit. Negotiations to see whether a compromise is possible are the only alternative to what the former Brexit minister, Lord Bridges, has described as the British public being asked to walk a gangplank into thin air.	1
MAY30	Missouri may lose its last abortion clinic this week. That's dark news for us all	By the end of the week, women in Missouri may live in a state without a single abortion clinic. While restrictive laws in states like Alabama have made headlines, Missouri shows the other side of the anti-abortion strategy: steadily shave away at abortion rights. You don’t need to outlaw the procedure outright if you can make getting a safe, legal one nearly impossible. The reason there’s only one remaining clinic in Missouri in the first place is because the state has tried to regulate abortion out of existence. A series of unnecessary rules and regulations makes it harder both for women to access abortions and for medical professionals to provide them. Missouri’s misogynistic laws already don’t trust women to make their own decisions – they mandate that any woman seeking an abortion in the state has to come to a clinic, request the procedure, and then go home and think about it for three days before it can be legally proffered. They also require that young people under the age of 18 notify both parents and get the notarized consent of at least one parent before they can terminate a pregnancy – a serious hardship for girls who live with abuse, or who don’t have a good relationship with their parents, or who don’t want to be mothers but want to keep their medical decisions private.	0
JUN28	An Australian points-based immigration system? It’s just more Boris Johnson bluster	A “tough new Australian-style points-based system for immigration”: Boris Johnson’s radical new proposal, splashed across Thursday’s front pages? No, that was Liam Byrne, then the Labour immigration minister. In 2007. I was a civil servant then, and I complained to a special adviser colleague, more in sorrow than in anger, that what we were proposing had little or no resemblance to the Australian system – and wasn’t even really a points-based system. “Of course, I know that perfectly well,” he said. “But the focus groups love it.” It is in that light that we should read Johnson’s essentially vacuous pronouncements, spun in the Telegraph as the restoration of “control over our borders” and in the Financial Times, by contrast, as “bringing down barriers to skilled overseas workers”.	0
JUL5	The Tories are there to be demolished. But Labour is too inept to do it	If anyone missed the depth of this national crisis, just look at the latest dire economic figures: we’re plunging towards a recession of our own making, with Britain’s first quarterly contraction in seven years. Meanwhile the two would-be prime ministers daily demonstrate their unfitness for office with ever wilder promises and preposterous claims. More fox hunting, more sugar? Both are now fatally boxed into a no-deal future with no escape hatch, hostages to Nigel Farage and the European Research Group of hardline Tory MPs. Each bids to persuade the Conservative membership that only they can bar Jeremy Corbyn’s way to Downing Street. Jeremy Hunt claimed on Wednesday to be “the best person” to stop “this clear and present danger”, with Boris Johnson counter-boasting, as his lead narrows. But does the idea of Corbyn as a bogeyman to petrify all right-thinking citizens fly? Weakness, not red peril, is Labour’s electoral problem. Nothing in Labour’s last or next manifesto could be a fraction as radical as the earthquake the Brexiters have caused to Britain’s economy, its union, its internal harmony or its standing in the world. The nearest to revolutionary terror is Labour’s plan to raise the top level of tax for the richest 5% back to where it was in 2010. Popular plans to take back rail and the utilities to public ownership is hardly Venezuelan, since they leak as much money to shareholders as the water companies’ three billion litres leaked daily from broken pipes.	1
MAY31	Mueller stopped short of calling Trump a criminal, but did we need him to?	Did Donald Trump repeatedly break the law by trying to block multiple investigations into his mysteriously intimate relationship with Russia? The answer is rather similar to questions about the pope’s Catholicism and the propensity of bears to poop in the woods.	0
JUL26	Will Dominic Cummings turn No 10 into a Nasa-style control centre?	Might one of Boris Johnson’s first acts as prime minister be to renovate the offices in No 10? According to his new senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, one simple way to improve the UK government is changing the spaces where decisions are made. If Cummings gets his way, out would go the polished wood tables, fireplace and ticking antique clocks. In would come banks of screens, predictive computer models and untested cognitive tools. Downing Street could look like more like a Nasa control centre than a stately home. And that’s not all he would change. Cummings has gone so far as to suggest one of his primary motivations for involving himself in Brexit was the once-in-a-half-century opportunity it would allow to fundamentally reform the British state. Over the years, he has repeatedly criticised Whitehall as achingly slow, blindly driven by the news cycle, staffed by ineffective conformists, oblivious to evidence, and out of touch with advances in technology. He thinks the civil service is staffed by “hollow men” who are incapable of thinking wisely about big problems and acting on them.	0
MAR6	We’re divorcing the EU. So why do hard Brexiteers still feel jilted?	There is a jilted quality to the way some Tories talk about Brexit, which is odd, given that Britain is dumping the European Union. The resentment would make more sense if it were the other way round: if 27 member states had expelled Britain from their club. But after decades of treating everything European as a punishment inflicted on a nation against its will, the habit is hard to break. Even the act of leaving is configured by the Eurosceptic imagination as something done by them to us. There is an illustration in the resignation letter sent by George Eustice, an agriculture minister, to Theresa May last week. Eustice was appalled by the prospect of an article 50 extension, which would, he fretted, be “the final humiliation of our country”. He said the European commission had “not behaved honourably” and had “deliberately made progress slow and difficult”. Yes, George, it would all have been quick and easy without those meddling Brussels bureaucrats. It doesn’t require a romantic attachment to the EU to find such Brexiter tantrums tedious. All it takes is an ability to imagine what the process looks like from the other side of the negotiating table.	1
JUL8	Want to know what a Boris Johnson government would look like? I have just the book	Seven years ago, a group of Conservative MPs who had taken their parliamentary seats in 2010 brought out a slim manifesto for the future of Britain titled Britannia Unchained. Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Liz Truss appeared to speak with one voice: that of unabashed Thatcherites, convinced that hacking back tax and regulation and fixating on the demands of “business” was as appropriate for the 21st-century UK as it supposedly had been for the crisis-plagued Britain of the 1970s. Some of the text was so provocative that it read like trolling. “The British are among the worst idlers in the world,” read one passage. “We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.” To even start to compete with the rising economies of India, China and Brazil, said the authors, we need to avenge the “dependency culture” and “stop indulging in irrelevant debates about sharing the pie between manufacturing and services, the north and the south, women and men”. They advised fellow Conservatives to double down on austerity, and maintain their faith in old-fashioned laissez-faire economics.	0
MAY5	Countryside versus town? Please don’t turn this into a culture war	Selina Scott is rewilding her 200-acre farm on the edge of the North York Moors. She says she reluctantly decided to control crows to protect endangered ground-nesting birds, including lapwing and curlew, that nest on her new wetlands. But the Yorkshire-born broadcaster- turned-farmer complains she cannot save her threatened birds because her brother, Robin (a former editor of Sporting Gun magazine), is now banned from shooting the crows that prey on helpless chicks. Town and country need each other. From one flows ideas and people. The other provides peace and quiet, space and food	0
JUN11	Gerraway with accentism – I’m proud to speak Yorkshire	Hopefully you haven’t subjected yourself to Still Open All Hours, the mystifyingly popular sequel to the classic Ronnie Barker comedy series of the 1970s-80s. If you have endured a whole episode then you’ll know that the Yorkshire dialect is a key element of the show’s humour. I watch David Jason’s Doncaster-based japes with a stony face. Perhaps the charm of the series is lost on me because I’m bored out of my chuffing mind by seeing Yorkshire’s working-class communities parodied for comic effect. We’re used to these trite “wi’ nowt teken owt” portrayals of regional dialect. Still Open All Hours, like Last of the Summer Wine, stands in a long tradition of hackneyed portrayals of bolshy but benign Yorkshire-sounding characters offering gentle, down-to-earth “by ‘eck, lad’ humour” with their hilarious flat vowels.	1
JAN5	All aboard Chris Grayling’s Brexit pizza ferry – what could possibly go wrong?	We’re about to “give back control” to a government that can’t tell the difference between P&O and Papa John’s pizza. I know you think that sounds good, but one day you’ll want insulin or a functioning health service rather than a pepperoni stuffed crust. In case you’ve missed everything, here’s a quick recap … In 2016 government members insisted that Brexit was easy and no deal was better than a bad deal. After realising that was shite, they discovered they had to do quite a lot of planning for no deal. This left them in the awkward position of going back to a public they’d just told that Brexit would improve their lives and assuring them there’d be food.	0
MAY14	From Years and Years to Bird Box: why we turn to dystopian dramas in a crisis	In Years and Years, the six-part BBC drama series from the writer Russell T Davies that starts this week, Daniel (Russell Tovey) cradles his newborn nephew and says: “I don’t think I could have a kid in a world like this … Because if it’s this bad now, what’s it going to be like [for him] in 30 years’ time, 10 years, five years?” It would be tempting to write Daniel off as a catastrophist except that, as the series shifts forward in time, he and his family are forced to navigate an increasingly divided country in which technology is wreaking havoc, the economy is collapsing and war in Europe is bringing record numbers of refugees to British shores. If you think we’ve got problems now, Davies seems to warn us, you ain’t seen nothing yet.	0
JUN23	Richard Ratcliffe’s wife was wrongly jailed and no one will help. What else can he do?	What a frightful pest Richard Ratcliffe is being – so thoughtless, cluttering up the lovely posh pavement outside the Iranian embassy in Knightsbridge, with his protest against his wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s wrongful imprisonment in Iran, where she is serving a five-year sentence for espionage. Another view might be: what else is Ratcliffe supposed to do, when the right to protest is all he has left? Ratcliffe has joined his wife on a hunger strike, demanding, among other things, her immediate release. He’s just spent the week stationed outside the embassy and plans to stay until at least this weekend, perhaps longer. Ratcliffe has been visited by family members and supporters, including SNP MPs and Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson. One important person Ratcliffe didn’t manage to see, even on Father’s Day, was his young daughter, Gabrielle, who lives in Tehran with her grandparents in order to be able to visit her mum in prison. Lovely.	0
MAY29	Are ‘weed tampons’ the answer to period pain?	I have spent the past 15 minutes sprawled in an undignified position on the floor experimenting with cannabis suppositories. This isn’t a typical Monday night for me, I’ll have you know; I am doing it in the name of science. Specifically, I am doing it to see whether “weed tampons” can get rid of period pain. There is a distinct possibility that I just lost 90% of my male readers. The squeamishness surrounding menstruation is part of the reason that little effort has been made to find effective treatments for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and period pain. Want to hear some rage-inducing stats? There have been five times as many studies into erectile dysfunction as there have been into PMS. That is despite the fact that 90% of women have experienced PMS, while only 19% of men have been affected by ED. Period pain can be debilitating, but women are still expected to suffer through it with just ibuprofen or a hot water bottle.	0
SEP30	I used to think Boris Johnson could get a Brexit deal. Not after last week	I cannot recall a more critical week in British politics. It will decide whether parliament, the law and public opinion can hold the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to account, or whether a new poison has entered public life. We need constantly to remember that Britain faces no menace to its security or prosperity. It could by now be outside the EU with agreed terms of trade. This crisis is entirely the outcome of one man’s device to seize control of his party. From the moment Johnson began his final climb to power, his appeal has been crudely populist. He has discarded the core Tory tradition of fiscal probity with a welter of spending pledges and tax cuts, plus plans for immigration control and toughness on crime. On Brexit, he has distorted a near trivial “freedom to trade with the rest of the world” with claptrap about vassalage, sovereignty and patriotism. The idea that Brexit will bring a new dawn of national wealth is absurd. It is simply how Johnson became prime minister.	1
JAN7	To stop Brexit, Labour supporters will have to revolt against their leader	Since nearly all of his career has been spent in rebellion against his own party, I guess we should not be too surprised that Jeremy Corbyn seems so determined to defy it over Brexit. Labour members hate Brexit and they want it reversed. With parliament deadlocked and growing public support for taking the question back to the people, a large majority of Labour voters, and an even larger majority of Labour members, wants the party to throw its weight behind another referendum. Compare and contrast with a Labour leader who doesn’t hate Brexit, doesn’t want it to be reversed and will not help facilitate another referendum if he can possibly avoid it. That divide between leader and members has been pretty obvious for a long time to anyone who contemplated Mr Corbyn with clear eyes rather than wearing soft-focus lenses. The split has become more evident as the Labour frontbench has run through various tactical ruses to try to mask the tension between its members and its leader. He is what he is and that is a lifetime opponent of the EU. He has not once expressed a flicker of remorse about the result of the 2016 referendum and treats the momentum behind a second referendum not as an opportunity to be seized, but as a threat to be smothered.	1
MAR30	Beware the great betrayal myth. This debacle is the work of hard Brexiters	There is no deader horse in the kingdom than the deal brokered by Theresa May. Flogged and flogged again, it expired for a third time at 2.42pm today on the floor of the House of Commons. Something else lay dead alongside it: the illusion that the objection of MPs was not to the precise terms of Britain’s proposed exit from the European Union – contained in the withdrawal agreement – but rather to the sketched vision of our future relationship with the EU, the so-called political declaration. That fond thought was also bludgeoned to death, for MPs had the chance to vote on the withdrawal agreement alone – and they rejected it by 344 votes to 286. Now we face a new cliff-edge, with 11pm on 12 April the new day of destiny. At that hour, Britain will crash out of the EU with no deal, in a scenario those charged with stewarding our economy, our industry and our safety warn will be catastrophic. The only way to avoid that fate is for MPs to agree on something else, fast, and, once they have, to impose their will on a reluctant prime minister. That is harder than it sounds.	1
JUN4	I was on Love Island in 2018. This is what ITV needs to get right this year	As a doctor working in a busy hospital A&E in south-east London, I thought spending the summer of 2018 in the sun as a contestant on the ITV reality show Love Island wouldn’t be all that difficult. Sun, sea, attractive people and, best of all, no mobile phones – how hard could it be? It turns out I couldn’t have been more wrong. If the contestants in the new series are expecting a relaxed summer of sun by the pool, they are in for a shock. From the moment my phone was taken off me as part of the pre-show preparations, I realised it was not going to be a walk in the park. There would be no speaking to friends or family or knowing what was happening in the outside world. Then came the dreaded entrance to the Love Island villa, in which the men walk in, one by one, to a line of female contestants who are waiting, ready to step forward for you, or stay in line and reject you. My turn came and I stood there shaking as my worst fears were realised: no one stepped forward. I felt sick and ashamed knowing that very soon, millions of people would see my humiliation – including all my family, friends and colleagues.	0
JUL27	An election looms – and Labour must act now to puncture Johnson’s hubris	A general election is coming, and Boris Johnson’s ruthlessness in preparing for it has provoked private pangs of jealous admiration among prominent leftwingers. There’s no messing around here: opponents and critics have been purged and an unapologetic hard-right, ultra-Brexit administration has been formed. Where Jeremy Corbyn would be denounced for Stalinist authoritarianism, Johnson is applauded for strong decisive leadership. Life is easier, I suppose, when you have most of the press and your own MPs enthusiastically on side. Today’s Sun newspaper splashes with Johnson’s face superimposed on an image of the sun, with the headline “JOHNSUN”: Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea’s ruling party, would have been too embarrassed to print something so fawning. The funeral rites for Corbynism are being read by those who seem to have forgotten that, just over two years ago, the election campaign began with Theresa May enjoying higher approval ratings than Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher at their peak, and with Labour 24 points behind the Tories. In some current polls, Labour is still ahead. 	0
JAN10	Want to stop prisoners reoffending? Start by allowing phones and photos	These are dark days in a country torn by Brexit and years of austerity, which have widened the gap between rich and poor. And few places are as gloomy as the prison system, where shocking levels of violence and drug abuse mean there is little in the way of positivity for those tasked with inspecting the penal estate.	1
MAY8	The only Brexit is a hard-right one. Labour must back another vote	As the Labour party resumes negotiations with what can only be described as Theresa May’s faction of government, Labour members and voters across the country are increasingly concerned as to what any deal might look like – especially as the local election results are used to justify each and every option. But there is something that all of us in the Labour movement need to keep at the forefront of our minds – something substantive we have learned since the Brexit referendum. While Brexit voters come from all classes and all political stripes and voted Brexit for many different reasons, the people driving Brexit in the Tory party have a very specific economic agenda – one that is now at the heart of these negotiations. Labour is the party of social solidarity and the Tories want Brexit because they want to destroy social solidarity in Britain. To all intents and purposes, they want to eliminate the Labour movement.	1
FEB12	Britain deports people who grew up here. This racialised system must end	Last week mass deportations resumed in Britain. It’s less than a year since the Windrush scandal broke – and the review into the events leading up to it hasn’t even reported back yet. This was a stark reminder that the government’s “compliant environment” policies have changed in name only: otherwise they remain as hostile as ever and continue to destroy the lives of black and ethnic minority people (BME) people – many of whom have lived in the UK since they were children. Before the deportation flight the home secretary, Sajid Javid, declared that many of the “foreign national offenders” on the flight had committed “very serious crimes” – but soon after this the Home Office admitted that most of the deportees had committed minor crimes such as single drug or driving offences. More worryingly, 13 people on the Jamaican charter flight had come to the UK as children – nine of them were under the age of 10, 11 had indefinite leave to remain (ILR), and one person even had a British passport. Not only were most of the people on this flight “more British than foreign”, they were also being punished twice (three times if you include immigration detention) for crimes they had already served sentences for.	0
JUL29	The Vote Leave gang now running Britain do not want to govern. They want to win	Life moves pretty fast, as the philosopher Ferris Bueller observed. A week ago, the question was: how come 160,000 Tory members were about to choose the next prime minister? Today, the question is: how come we are suddenly being governed by a rightwing populist single-issue campaign group? In the past few days it has become quite clear that, at heart, Boris Johnson’s new government is essentially a reunion party for the Vote Leave gang that triumphed in the 2016 EU referendum.	0
JUN29	Kamala Harris just changed the direction of the presidential race	As the second round of Democratic presidential debates approached, one of the major questions on the minds of voters and political commentators was whether the candidates would focus on trying to differentiate themselves from each other, as was done the previous night, or whether they would focus on critiquing Donald Trump. Senator Kamala Harris chose to do both, and she did so effectively, in what turned out to be the breakout performance of the evening.	0
FEB16	The arts were supposed to champion diversity. What went wrong?	In February 1999, the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence made 70 recommendations for eradicating institutional racism within the police. Although the arts, culture and media sectors were not a target of the report, we can similarly trace the uptake of what would later become known as cultural diversity within these institutions – particularly at a time when the political context was invested, at least rhetorically, in eradicating racial prejudice. This week, 20 years on from the report, Arts Council England published its annual report on diversity within the arts sector, showing that in some areas arts organisations are “treading water”.	0
MAR4	Corporate-branded ‘communities’ prove you can’t buy taste	I find reading about rich people very depressing. Not because I am jealous they have so much money, but because I am frustrated they have so little imagination. Take a look at the recent New York Times piece that says a growing number of wealthy home-buyers are “choosing to live in corporate-branded communities”. Not just any branded communities, mind you, but luxury ones from the likes of Porsche, Armani and Bulgari. These expensive branded buildings have proliferated in the past few years, a trend that seems to be driven by the 1% having more money than they know what to do with. Slapping a fancy brand name on a residential development can add a price premium of 14% to 44%, according to the upmarket estate agency Savills. A report on the sector by another agency, Knight Frank, notes that there is a “direct correlation between wealth creation and demand for branded residences”.	0
JUL22	The diary of Carrie Symonds, aged 31¾	Downing Street minus seven Usual mad dash to get in before lunch, but enough time to see my Sun debate strategy was a game-changer! Long to tell B but he said he’s got lifesaving surgery first thing, so I’m not on any account to worry he’s met someone younger and stayed out all night.	0
JUL17	This genetic breakthrough on anorexia should transform how the disease is seen	Once upon a time, disease was thought to have been sent by God as a punishment for sin. If not, then it must surely be the work of demons, witches or groups regarded as social outcasts. Thankfully medicine has moved on from the days when Jews were blamed for outbreaks of the plague across medieval Europe, yet with psychiatric illnesses something of the old accusatory myths seem to linger. Until relatively recently, autism was still wrongly blamed on so-called “refrigerator mothers”, who supposedly damaged their children by being cold and unloving. The discovery that autism has a genetic component turned our understanding of the role it plays in families upside down, and now something similar may be happening with anorexia.	0
FEB13	The EU looks like the Soviet Union in 1991 – on the verge of collapse	Europe is sleepwalking into oblivion and its people need to wake up before it is too late. If they don’t, the European Union will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991. Neither our leaders nor ordinary citizens seem to understand that we are experiencing a revolutionary moment, that the range of possibilities is very broad, and that the eventual outcome is thus highly uncertain. Most of us assume the future will more or less resemble the present, but this is not necessarily so. In a long and eventful life, I have witnessed many periods of what I call radical disequilibrium. We are living in such a period today.	0
JAN10	Brexit proved our economy is broken, but our leaders still have no clue how to fix it	Just after midnight on 25 May 2016, a senior staffer in the remain campaign sent colleagues an urgent message. “Voters are very sceptical about our warnings on the economy,” began his email. “They don’t trust the numbers. They don’t trust the Treasury.” As head of strategy for Britain Stronger in Europe, Ryan Coetzee had bombarded Britons with evidence of the economic damage they would do to themselves if they didn’t stay in the EU. He and his team enlisted the Bank of England, the IMF, the OECD and pretty much every acronym that mattered. They’d wagged fingers, flung numbers around and pointed out the danger signs. From David Cameron down, leading remainers considered the economy their trump card. In the biggest single choice Britain had had to make for four decades, they were sure economics would be the deciding factor. But with less than a month to go before the vote, seasoned operative Coetzee could see the strategy was failing. Why, just a few days earlier, George Osborne had produced Treasury analysis that Brexit would send house prices plunging by as much as 18% – and BBC journalists reported being deluged with calls from would-be buyers asking where they could sign up.	1
SEP16	Against very familiar rivals, Jo Swinson will be the wild card of the election	David Steel once told a Liberal conference to “go away and prepare for government”. They went away and remained in opposition. Vince Cable once said that he could imagine himself becoming prime minister. Which is where that idea stayed: in his imagination. Nick Clegg did take them into government during the coalition years, an experience that ended with the Lib Dems losing all but eight of the 57 MPs they started with five years earlier. So they have had fair warning about the perils of dreaming of breakthroughs. They usually don’t come true. On the rare occasions when they do, the consequences for the party can be terrible. But dream they always will and never more so than now.	0
SEP12	Chaos is being normalised. It is all part of Boris Johnson’s pernicious plan	On Saturday, for the first time in living memory, neo-fascists were chanting the name of the serving prime minister. Supporters of the English Defence League and the Democratic Football Lads Alliance wandered around Whitehall some drunk, harassing random remain protesters and shouting into the faces of journalists until, inevitably, they attacked the police. It’s part of an unnerving trend that’s emerged in the past two weeks: the normalisation of chaos.	0
FEB3	Bullshit, not lies, is the corrosive influence blighting our public life	‘Bullshit,” the philosopher Harry Frankfurt observed in a seminal essay on the subject, “is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about.” He wrote that in 2005, but he might have been watching recent episodes of This Week, BBC’s late-night politics show, presided over by Andrew Neil. Over the past two weeks, it’s thrown up two car-crash interviews that serve as textbook illustrations of Frankfurt’s thesis. First, we had the rightwing writer James Delingpole waxing lyrical about a no-deal Brexit. If ever there were a case of someone talking without knowing what he was talking about, this was it. The simplest of questions reduced Delingpole, who clearly is as familiar with economics as Theresa May is with dancing, to incoherently mumbling: “I don’t know the answer.” Michel Barnier could probably have made a better fist of arguing for Brexit.	1
AUG25	How luxury hotels such as Biarritz’s Hôtel du Palais have helped shape history	Few hotels in the world can claim a more storied past than the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz, where the G7 rich nation summiteers will sit in splendour to discuss world poverty this weekend. Guarded by hundreds of riot police, Emmanuel Macron and his guests will meet inside what the French newspaper Libération this week called their “gold bunker” – the ornate Second Empire hotel that stands on the beach at the heart of a luxury Atlantic coast resort town that is still, as Libé put it in the original Franglais, “une des capitales françaises du bling-bling”. Boris Johnson will not be the first serving British prime minister to set foot in the hotel that was once a favourite of Napoleon III and Queen Victoria. That’s because the Hôtel du Palais occupies a special niche in British political history. It is the only building outside this country in which a prime minister has ever kissed hands and been asked to form a government. This happened in April 1908, when King Edward VII, who was a regular at the hotel, summoned the Liberal chancellor of the exchequer, Herbert Asquith, from London to succeed the terminally ill Henry Campbell-Bannerman in Downing Street.	0
JUL15	Spoiler alert: it’s getting harder to keep plot lines from readers	“I can’t be the only one in the boat on this,” complained a reader about separate newspaper interviews in which actors discussed the fates of characters they had played in two immensely popular television series, Game of Thrones and Line of Duty. Don’t click the hyperlinks in this article if you are in the same boat. In the reader’s view, “There’s now an explosion of content and not everyone gets to watch on the day of broadcast. I can’t afford HBO and I don’t download illegally, so I haven’t seen GoT [season] 8 yet. And it’s only been a few weeks since it was shown.” I sympathise, especially as premium sporting events move from free-to-air to pay TV. But it is precisely because communications have changed so much that the main responsibility for avoiding information that discloses a plot line, the fate of a character or the result of a sports contest is shifting from media professionals to individual audience members.	0
OCT2	Johnson has run out of road. Other people’s outrage is all he’s got now	Boris Johnson is routinely dismissed as a liar for whom the truth is just another fling. So it is all the more perplexing that his bluster about a no-deal Brexit is taken seriously. The truth is that Johnson does not want a no-deal Brexit – and certainly not one that precedes a general election. Let’s start with the genesis of no-deal Brexit. It was an exemplar of Theresa May’s politics: a tactic invented to force her will on parliament rather than to engage in the hard graft of consensus-building political leadership. It was also an embarrassingly misguided attempt to threaten the European Union.	1
MAR15	The problem is not so much Theresa May – it’s that Britain is now ungovernable	Dramas need characters, politics requires politicians and a storm must have an eye. Which is why at the dead centre of Brexit – the biggest and most multifaceted crisis to face this country in more than 60 years – there is just one person. She stands at a Commons dispatch box in an elegant outfit day after day, knowing that the evening will cover her in yet another dung-heap of humiliation that will be daubed all over the next morning’s front pages. All along her frontbench are colleagues just waiting for her to go, so they can take her job and move into her Downing Street home. On her backbenches are MPs who shamelessly boast to journalists their fantasies about putting her in a “noose” and “knifing her in the front”. She is derided, she is hated, she is the target for some of the most outrageous abuse ever to be heaped on a 62-year-old woman from Eastbourne. In a democracy intent on beating itself up, Theresa May has become the nation’s punchbag. On radio phone-ins, the callers pour bile upon her. On TV sofas, pundits speculate about how many days she has left at No 10. When she isn’t attracting derision, she attracts something arguably worse for a politician: pity. Her voice has gone and, the theory goes, soon she will follow.	1
MAR30	Barclays funds climate breakdown. We are determined to make it stop	From Cyclone Idai, which has killed hundreds in south-east Africa, to flooding in Bangladesh – where my family is from – for decades climate change has been devastating communities in the global south. More recently these effects have begun to be felt by people in the UK too: just last month, wildfires raged on Saddleworth Moor, while where I live in Brixton, the air is so polluted I suffer from breathing problems. We all know that the impact of climate change is felt unequally, depending on where you live, how wealthy you are and how easily you can shield yourself from its effects. Less widely known, however, is that responsibility for the crisis is unequal too. In recent years we have been sold a lie: that ordinary people are to blame for the climate crisis. It’s our spending and our consumption habits that have created the mess we’re in, we are told, not the bankers, oil companies and a rich elite.	0
MAR13	I've been drafted into 'operation no deal'. And things here feel desperate	The real countdown has truly started. In Whitehall today, the clocks are striking 17 – the number of days left before we are due to leave the European Union. Tempers are running high. So too is the nation’s imagination – in the few weeks since my first article, the Brexit commentariat has created such a torrent of snarky metaphor – including many references to how terrified yet also strangely bored of Brexit we all are – that it feels like we’re being hit by a tsunami of tepid tapioca. Yet we can’t seem to get enough. Politico and other websites have even started collecting the best Brexaphors. There’s Mad Max, Hotel California, cake, the Titanic, a chocolate orange, a Mexican standoff, a blue furry monster (actually, the Dutch came up with that one, but it’s too cute to leave out). And it’s not too late to get your Brexit advent calendar.	1
FEB26	At last, Jeremy. Now Labour’s mission must be to prevent any Brexit	Sliding closer day by day, you can hear the swelling excitement of the catastrophists at the thrilling prospect of a no-deal smash-out. Into the unknown! Hurl all the old certainties into the air and see what new patterns the broken fragments make on the floor! Break all rules, start again, bring on the Brexit revolution! They take no heed when the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, cautioned them on Monday: “We are sleep-walking into no-deal scenario. It’s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you. Wake up. This is real. ? European council president Donald Tusk and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar added warnings of a “chaotic Brexit ?, the grown-ups trying to restrain the out-of-control teenagers punching each other up inside what purports to be the British government. Since there can’t be a reopening of the withdrawal agreement or a breaking of the backstop in the Irish border settlement, Tusk says: “It’s absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal. ? So Theresa May tiptoes closer to the edge, at serious risk of an accidental last-minute plunge.	1
FEB13	Why it matters to call external female genitalia ‘vulva’ not ‘vagina’	When you find yourself mansplaining the term “mansplaining” to a worked-up faction of Twitter on a Sunday evening, you can assume you’re not getting the best out of your leisure time. And that’s not even the most foolish thing a man called Paul Bullen did over the weekend. On Saturday, the Guardian published an extract from an upcoming book, Womanhood: The Bare Reality by the photographer and writer Laura Dodsworth. Alongside photographs of external genitalia was first-person testimony from the subjects pictured. Titled “Me and my vulva: 100 women reveal all”, it was an arresting story. Bullen spotted the article on Sunday, and responded with a tweet that he probably (well, hopefully) now regrets: “The correct word is vagina.”	0
JUN18	Should dating apps tell us how sexy we are?	Marks out of 10: how attractive do you think you are? Perhaps you’d describe yourself as a six on a good hair day, or seven when you’ve caught the sun? Attractiveness, after all, is subjective, and can change from day to day. Besides, isn’t beauty in the eye of the beholder? But the truth is, if you have ever used an internet dating app, your desirability has been rated. It has to be. User rankings are integral to how most mainstream dating apps, purportedly including Tinder and Bumble, function. So would you want to know how you scored? Last week, the dating app Once emailed users (including me) to tell them that they can now discover how they have ranked. “To help our matching algorithm, we ask our users to rate each other [sic] pictures,” reads the email. “We have decided to be transparent and release this rating.” It was nearly 4pm and as a long-suffering glutton for pain, I jumped at the chance to ruin my day. I logged in – for the first time in several years – to find out how I ranked based on photos from younger, thinner times in my 20s. I thought I’d be crushed, and readers, I was right.	0
