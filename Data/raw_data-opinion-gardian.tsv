JAN1	Human dignity is in danger. In 2019 we must stand as one to survive	What does it mean to be human? That question sits at the core of human rights. To be human has specific implications: human self-awareness and the actions taken to uphold human dignity – these are what gives the concept of humanity a special meaning. Human self-awareness and human actions determine the interplay between individual thought and language and the wider society. It is our actions as humans that deliver economic security, the right to education, the right to free association and free expression; and which create the conditions for protecting expression and encouraging bold thinking. When we abandon efforts to uphold human dignity, we forfeit the essential meaning of being human, and when we waver in our commitment to the idea of human rights, we abandon our moral principles. What follows is duplicity and folly, corruption and tyranny, and the endless stream of humanitarian crises that we see in the world today.
JAN1	I used to defend smacking children. Now I see it as an abuse of power	Brats do not endear themselves. Even when insulated from children, we nevertheless encounter our fair share of adults whom we suspect got their own way too much of the time as kids. The recent behaviour of some Conservative MPs could be a case in point. The foot-stamping of fanatical Brexiteers, unable to reconcile what they wish for with reality, is not unlike that of a child screaming their insistence that they won’t wear a coat even though it’s 2C outside. It’s not hard to imagine that they were rarely told no when they were young. Or that the finality of the word was seldom made concrete to them. They have become grandiose and overindulged, and we’re collectively suffering the consequences of their tantrum.
JAN1	Don’t expect Brexit to give us a British Alexander Hamilton	I spent most of 2018 hearing the same story of revolution, ambition and factional rivalry played on a loop. And when I wasn’t listening to the Hamilton soundtrack I wrote about Brexit. I’m late to the Hamilton party, I know. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical about the first US Treasury secretary opened on Broadway in 2015. I only got tickets to see it in London a few weeks ago, but by then I was word-perfect on the score. For the uninitiated, Hamilton tells the story of an orphan immigrant’s climb up the social and political ladders of newly independent America, culminating in a death that … well, let’s just say it puts the modern Twitter spat into perspective. Plus singing, dancing, rapping.
JAN1	There is a path to a second referendum – and only Labour can win it	If it was the season of peace and goodwill towards all, then politics failed to get the memo. Not only did hostilities continue through the Christmas period, some of the main protagonists announced in advance that they were incapable of taking a break. If anything, the holidays provided more opportunities for irate, booze-fuelled Twitter rants. One particular object of ire was Jeremy Corbyn’s pre-Christmas interview in the Guardian, where he appeared to dash the hopes of many on the left that Labour would immediately become the party of remain. As the political class sobers up in January and returns to Westminster, it will become apparent that little has changed. The size of the majority against the prime minister’s deal will have diminished but – as No 10 briefed in the run-up to the internal confidence vote in her leadership – it only takes a majority of one. Bizarrely, Downing Street has chosen to amplify the threat of no deal by announcing more money and even the deployment of troops. But this strategy seems set to backfire: it will only give comfort to the European Research Group hardliners that there can be a soft landing to jumping off the cliff edge.
JAN1	Brexiteers want Britain to ‘look east’. But their idea of Asia is a fantasy	In a few weeks, Singapore observes the 200th anniversary of Sir Stamford Raffles’ arrival. The spot where he landed is marked with a statue – arms folded, looking out to sea – while the 52-storey headquarters of a local bank towers behind him. It’s a popular selfie spot. Singapore’s government plans a series of exhibitions and historic walking trails that will turn the spotlight on the island’s long and successful history – both before and after the imperial adventurer strode ashore and planted the union flag in January 1819.
JAN1	Was 2018 a turning point for women? Yes, it exposed what we’re up against	A pale, slouching Harvey Weinstein has so far escaped criminal charges for the allegations of sexual assault against him. A “millionaire” is given a three-year jail sentence for killing a woman, who died from the 40 horrific injuries he inflicted on her, including having bleach poured over her face, because this was said to be “consensual” rough sex. The incredibly brave Kurdish women who have faced down Islamic State have now been totally abandoned by Trump’s policy on Syria. This is how we end the year, and though there are those reluctant still to give up the narrative of sunlit progress, it’s not been a great one for women. But there are so many great and good women out there who shine light into the darkness. I raise a glass to you for 2019
JAN1	‘Email will never catch on’: why are we so bad at predicting the future?	Who can resist this hinge in time, when one year ends and another begins, without indulging in a bit of light speculation about the future, if only to contemplate where, if anywhere, on Earth might be a safe space at the end of March. This interregnum between Christmas and new year is also when Whitehall’s records of old arguments and negotiations and decisions are released, at least partially. It’s a moment usually treated as an exercise in history, but really it’s a snapshot of the way people anticipate the future. The latest releases, published at the end of last week, are particularly interesting because they reflect the way Whitehall copes at a moment of extraordinary upheaval. They cover the early 1990s, the years after the Berlin Wall was breached. The Soviet Union was tottering. Nelson Mandela was newly freed, and a technological revolution was waiting to be unleashed. Yep, a new world was waiting to be born.
JAN1	Happy new year? Tell that to the natural world we are destroying	So the animals must pay for our dysfunctionality. Japan, swayed by some notion of nationhood, asserts itself by declaring its resumption of whaling. Revenge is being wreaked on the Save the Whale campaigns of the 1970s and 80s – the bedrock of modern environmentalism – and all those yoghurt-knitting hippies. Killer whales and belugas are kept in “whale jail” in the far east of Russia, as far from prying eyes as possible – ready to be sold to marine parks in China. Highly evolved animals are stolen from the sea and people buy tickets so their family can watch them perform in artificial pools thousands of miles from home. Meanwhile people stand on the banks of the Thames, at the aptly named Gravesend, hoping for a peek at a lone lost beluga. (I decline to call it by its presumptively gendered and anthropomorphic name). Animals have become entertainment, and must therefore bend to our will, adopt our demotic. There are protests when prisoners are allowed to pet goats for therapeutic purposes, but plaudits when spy cams are sent into the natural world as if in extension of our own over-surveilled and tracked existence, and serious public discussions as to whether a film crew in the Antarctic should dig some penguins out of a hole. As if we weren’t in a deep enough one already.
JAN1	The uncontacted tribes of Brazil face genocide under Jair Bolsonaro	On 1 January, Jair Bolsonaro will be sworn in as Brazil’s 38th president. He has expressed open disdain for the indigenous peoples of Brazil, and it is no exaggeration to say that some of the world’s most unique and diverse tribes are facing annihilation. Genocide is defined by the UN as “the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group ?. Large-scale mass genocides rightly receive global attention, yet countless others go unreported and unpunished because the victims number only a few hundred, or even a few dozen. Right now, deep in the Amazon rainforest, a small tribe of survivors is on the run. They are the Kawahiva, an uncontacted tribe of just a few dozen people, the victims of waves of horrific attacks which have pushed them to the brink of extinction. We know almost nothing about them, except that they are fleeing chainsaws in a region with the highest rate of deforestation in the Amazon. Brazil’s first ever investigation into the genocide of an uncontacted tribe was launched in 2005, and 29 people suspected of involvement in killing Kawahiva were detained but later released, including a former state governor and a senior policeman. The case stalled for lack of evidence.
JAN1	Advertising and academia are controlling our thoughts. Didn’t you know?	To what extent do we decide? We tell ourselves we choose our own life course, but is this ever true? If you or I had lived 500 years ago, our worldview, and the decisions we made as a result, would have been utterly different. Our minds are shaped by our social environment, in particular the belief systems projected by those in power: monarchs, aristocrats and theologians then; corporations, billionaires and the media today. Humans, the supremely social mammals, are ethical and intellectual sponges. We unconsciously absorb, for good or ill, the influences that surround us. Indeed, the very notion that we might form our own minds is a received idea that would have been quite alien to most people five centuries ago. This is not to suggest we have no capacity for independent thought. But to exercise it, we must – consciously and with great effort – swim against the social current that sweeps us along, mostly without our knowledge.
JAN2	Politicians could ease refugee suffering, but instead they stoke fear	The “major incident” is well and truly under way. Sajid Javid has signalled just how seriously he is taking the recent spike in refugee crossings across the Channel by interrupting his holiday to deal with the crisis. All manner of plans are now being devised to shore up our borders. Around 100 people have crossed the Channel since Christmas Day but while the government ramps up concern about this sudden “new” development – actually something that has been occurring since 2017 – context is lacking.
JAN2	If we must look to the past, let’s make it 1989 – a year of transformation	Whatever happened to the future? Brexiteers cling on to a fantastical mixture of empire, war and an England whose genius was supposedly embodied by Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. In the United States, Donald Trump harks back to an America of economic might: musclebound men toiling in car factories and coalmines, and splendid isolation. A recent issue of the Economist surveyed politics in Europe and the US and observed “an orgy of reminiscence”, partly traceable to the fact that millions of westerners cannot shake off a deep and understandable sense of decline. There’s an obvious irony in having to look back to find something better, but 2019 marks the 30th anniversary of a run of events that embodied pretty much the polar opposite: optimism, faith in the future and a sense of shared humanity that could not be more different from the polarised, rancorous mood of today. As this year unfolds, the events of 1989 – a year as replete with significance as 1848, 1945 or 1968 – will be celebrated and picked apart; in Berlin there will be an impressive run of commemorative events . Leafing through histories of the time, and thinking back to what happened, what most sticks out is a set of emotions and impulses that we would do well to revive: defiance, joy, an urge to run headlong into whatever happened next.
JAN2	Brexit is not an end to Britain’s liaison with Europe. It’s just a new beginning	They are sick of the whole thing. They just want it to be over. No more uncertainty. Brexiteers want resolution. They will be disappointed. Willing something does not make it so. Aethelred wanted Viking raids to stop. The kingdoms of Wales, Scotland and Ireland wished the Norman and Plantagenet monarchs of England would cease their predatory lunges into their territory. Neville Chamberlain hoped that Hitler would be content with Czechoslovakia. Oliver Letwin wished there was an island we could send all migrants to. The hopes of politicians and rulers are whispers in a gale. There is no end state in our relations with Europe. There is only millennia of collaboration, conquest, disputes, exchange, competition and alliance.
JAN2	Louis CK’s rant shows abusers are still casting themselves as victims	One of the more idiotic, if not wholly surprising, byproducts of the #MeToo era is how men who have been exposed as misogynists and abusers have recast themselves as victims. Lost livelihoods and broken reputations are, they tell us, an excessive price to pay for their transgressions. Lately, though, going hand in hand with this victim status, is a new hardened persona, one that comes bathed in fury and self-righteousness. “You thought that was bad,” they seem to say. “You ain’t seen the half of it.” Take Louis CK, the comedian who, in November 2017, admitted to repeatedly exposing himself to and masturbating in front of unconsenting women and, on being found out, declared: “I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen.” For CK, “a long time” meant nine months, after which he was back on stage at the Comedy Cellar in New York doing what comics tend to do: talking and saying what he wanted. Now, new audio has emerged from a fortnight ago, featuring a lengthy Louis CK rant – I would call it a comedy set but that would give it a credence it doesn’t deserve – recorded at a Long Island club. It finds him “jokingly” bemoaning the money he has lost in the past year, mocking the survivors of the shooting in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 students and staff members were killed, and lamenting the new political correctness that champions gender neutral pronouns and frowns on the use of words like “retarded”. Presumably sensing disapproval from his audience, he says: “What, are you going to take away my birthday? My life is over, I don’t give a shit. You can ... be offended, it’s OK. You can get mad at me. Anyway. So why do black guys have big dicks? Let’s talk about that for a minute.”
JAN2	I used to defend smacking children. Now I see it as an abuse of power	Brats do not endear themselves. Even when insulated from children, we nevertheless encounter our fair share of adults whom we suspect got their own way too much of the time as kids. The recent behaviour of some Conservative MPs could be a case in point. The foot-stamping of fanatical Brexiteers, unable to reconcile what they wish for with reality, is not unlike that of a child screaming their insistence that they won’t wear a coat even though it’s 2C outside. It’s not hard to imagine that they were rarely told no when they were young. Or that the finality of the word was seldom made concrete to them. They have become grandiose and overindulged, and we’re collectively suffering the consequences of their tantrum.

JAN3	Donald Trump has a point – the world should start solving its own problems	For a Briton to spend time in the US just now is a blessed relief. Whole days pass, and no talk of Brexit. It is as if a pall has lifted from the art of conversation. But the US has its own deep divide, slashing through the populist body politic. It is Donald Trump and “America first”. Trump has become a phenomenon. Like Samson in the temple, he seems able to topple the entire edifice of policy. Down crashes America’s government machine for the sake of a wall, world trade is devastated, stock markets plummet, alliances lie in ruins. It is astonishing what one man can do to the world, virtually alone.
JAN3	Elizabeth Warren’s ‘likability’? The US media has learned nothing from 2016	The countdown to the US 2020 election has only just begun, but it’s already starting to look like a hellish repeat of 2016. On Monday, senator Elizabeth Warren became the first major Democrat to announce her intention to run for president. As you may be aware, Warren is a woman, which means that it is basically illegal not to compare her with Hillary Clinton, despite the two being very different politicians. It is also mandatory to analyse her “likability”, which we all know is the most important issue when it comes to female candidates. Indeed, less than 24 hours after Warren had announced her bid, Politico published a story headlined “Warren battles the ghosts of Hillary”. They publicised the story with a widely derided tweet, asking: “How does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux – written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?”
JAN3	Charging forced marriage victims rescue fees is a Foreign Office racket	In recent days the abhorrent practice of the Foreign Office whereby it forces British nationals who are victims of forced marriage abroad to pay for their protection and rescue has again hit the headlines. It is left to the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to say he wants “to get to the bottom of the issue”. But this is not a new issue that has only just come to light. Southall Black Sisters, the charity I run, has sounded the alert about this for some time, but without success. The Guardian reported that this was happening over years ago. This is why Hunt’s appeal to British embassies for“more humanity and compassion” appears disingenuous.
JAN3	Fiona Onasanya is lucky. She’d be out of a job were it not for Brexit	It seems a strange thing to say about the disgraced Labour MP for Peterborough, but Fiona Onasanya is a lucky woman. Onasanya was found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice last month. She faces a prison sentence. She is contemplating the ruin of a career that included her public aspiration to become Britain’s first black female prime minister. I’m not sticking my neck out very far to say that this last is not now going to happen. Onasanya’s offence: she repeatedly denied to police that she was behind the wheel when her car was caught speeding in Cambridgeshire in 2017. She refused to say who was driving. In fact it was Onasanya, who is a qualified solicitor as well as an MP. After a first trial failed to agree a verdict, Onasanya was found guilty at the retrial. She will be sentenced soon.
JAN3	It’s not just Windrush. Britain’s immigration scandal will grow in 2019	Tasfin came to the UK in 1962 from Bangladesh, or what was then called East Pakistan. He was 19 years old. Orphaned during the brutal partition of India by the departing British, he had been working since the age of 12 for an American company in the port city of Chittagong. He made tea, unloaded containers, repaired cars and swept floors. And he eventually concluded that the only way to ensure a better life for himself was to scrape together the fare for a one-way ride to the Tilbury Docks. As a citizen of the Commonwealth, he enjoyed this right to move to the United Kingdom, as did all those now fondly referred to as the “Windrush generation”. Now 84, Tasfin lives in Tooting, south London, with the eldest of his three sons, surrounded by grandchildren, the youngest of whom will be sitting her GCSEs in a few months’ time. After working for over 40 years on the London Underground, he retired a few months after his wife passed away and struggles with chronic arthritis.
JAN3	Indian women just did a remarkable thing – they formed a wall of protest	On 1 January, in one of the biggest movements for women’s rights in India, 5 million women lined up across the length of the southern state of Kerala to “uphold Renaissance values”. What they were demanding was an end to violent agitations against women trying to enter Kerala’s Sabarimala temple, a popular Hindu pilgrimage site. This followed a ruling by the Indian supreme court in September, which forced the temple’s doors open to women of all ages in a sensational blow to religious tradition. “Where a man can enter, a woman can also go. What applies to a man, applies to a woman,” the bench said in its judgment. Since 1991, the temple has accepted only men and older women, in their millions every year, to preserve the mythological celibacy of the ruling deity, Ayyappa. In theory, the court order only reinforced Indian women’s constitutional right to enter places of worship as freely as men, but in practice it wreaked mayhem. Between 17 November and 24 December, more than a dozen women of menstrual age, including reporters, tried to enter the temple but were stopped, shoved and stoned by mobs of male devotees. None of the women could make it in, despite police protection and prohibitory orders. Both sides are far from giving in. Protests have since continued, though most women who were sent back by the mobs have vowed to return.
JAN3	The space race is back on – and is China in the lead?	China’s achievement in landing a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, announced by Beijing’s state media this morning, has ramifications that go far beyond the simple statement of this being a “first” for mankind. It puts China on the map of international space exploration on a par with the existing space powers of the United States and Russia – the European Union to a lesser extent – but also adds a new dimension. It is the first time a landing has been attempted on the far side of the moon, with the particular communications challenges this entails, and it has been a success. The first response from the US space agency, Nasa, was generous, as scientists to scientists: what China had managed was a “first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment”. The response in political and military quarters in Washington, as in Moscow, however, is likely to reflect trepidation. There is now a serious newcomer to be considered.
JAN3	The Channel migrant ‘crisis’ is really a tale of British hypocrisy	A lot of us have spent the past few weeks telling our children some fairly problematic stuff. That there’s an old man with a beard who breaks into our homes with a reindeer and watches them while they sleep. That it’s acceptable to talk about the ins and outs of a virgin’s womb. That there was a genocidal king who murdered newborn boys. I can’t think of any context in which we would tell these stories other than Christmas, but I suppose we feel they are balanced out by their happy endings. Santa is a creepy idea but he does leave presents. The traumatic experience of being homeless in another town with a birth imminent ends with a baby swaddled happily in a manger. We don’t tend to dwell on the next part, in which the holy family went on to become refugees in Egypt, although the Pope is among the religious figures who has suggested we should think about that more. You don’t even need to go that far to see what is wrong with this year’s Christmas message though, which, courtesy of Sajid Javid, is that there is officially No Room at the Inn. The home secretary cut short his £800-a-night luxury safari holiday in South Africa to appear to us as a Tory Ghost of Christmas Present, with the message that Britain is now facing a full-on “crisis”.
JAN3	The first lesson from my life as a carer? There is such a thing as society	It’s leaflets at the moment. If my son sees any, in a cafe for instance, he wants them all. Later he will want to go through them and then destroy each one, tearing them into tiny pieces. We’ve got him down to a maximum of three. This is progress. When he lived at home, it was books – each one to be looked through swiftly, then reshelved on the other side of the room. If we went outside, every item on display in the two village shops had to be named three times. I stopped going outside. I stopped trying to speak to anyone on the phone, because my son knew that if he stood next to me and shrieked like an agonised seagull no one could hear a thing. I have spent a large part of my life as a carer for my son, whom I shall call Huw (he is now a vulnerable adult) who has severe autism and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). I was helped for part of that time by my daughter, Rhiannon. There are around 7 million carers in the UK – that’s one in 10 people – and that doesn’t include parents whose children aren’t sick or disabled. So many carers’ stories go untold. Why? Probably because it’s exhausting, especially if lack of sleep is part of the picture (typical in cases of autism). It may be because unaffected people feel uncomfortable thinking about it, but it’s possible that they just don’t think about it, full stop – because our stories aren’t out there. And yet it’s possible we will all be carers at some point.
JAN4	A conversation about mental health has started. Let’s not waste it	When Ella Risbridger was at her lowest ebb, sitting with a psychiatrist trying to explain why she had wanted to throw herself under a bus, help came from a wholly unexpected source. Her mind was “looking for a puzzle” to occupy itself, as she put it, something to take her outside the horrible thoughts she was having. And it settled, most unexpectedly, on baking. She came home from hospital and made a pie, and from then on cooking became a sort of comfort and salvation. For her, the rhythmic and predictable act of making meals became a self-soothing ritual, a way not so much of curing her chronic anxiety as living through it. Even the recipe that provided the title of her wholly unconventional cookbook, Midnight Chicken, came from an afternoon spent lying on the floor wondering if she would ever be able to get up.
JAN4	Donald Trump has a point – the world should start solving its own problems	For a Briton to spend time in the US just now is a blessed relief. Whole days pass, and no talk of Brexit. It is as if a pall has lifted from the art of conversation. But the US has its own deep divide, slashing through the populist body politic. It is Donald Trump and “America first”.

It is astonishing what one man can do to the world, virtually alone.
JAN4	To save us from a Kafkaesque future, we must democratise AI	Picture a system that makes decisions with huge impacts on a person’s prospects – even decisions of life and death. Imagine that system is complex and opaque: it sorts people into winners and losers, but the criteria by which it does so are never made clear. Those being assessed do not know what data the system has gathered about them, or with what data theirs is being compared. And no one is willing to take responsibility for the system’s decisions – everyone claims to be fulfilling their own cog-like function. This is the vision offered to us by Franz Kafka in his 1915 novel, The Trial. In that book, Kafka tells a parodic tale of an encounter with the apparatus of an indifferent bureaucracy. The protagonist, Josef K, does not know why he has been arrested, or what the evidence against him is; no one is willing to take responsibility for the decision, or to give him a proper account of how the system works. And it ends gloomily, with Josef K utterly defeated, resigning himself to his fate.
JAN4	Elizabeth Warren’s ‘likability’?

As a citizen of the Commonwealth, he enjoyed this right to move to the United Kingdom, as did all those now fondly referred to as the “Windrush generation”. Now 84, Tasfin lives in Tooting, south London, with the eldest of his three sons, surrounded by grandchildren, the youngest of whom will be sitting her GCSEs in a few months’ time. After working for over 40 years on the London Underground, he retired a few months after his wife passed away and struggles with chronic arthritis.
JAN4	Indian women just did a remarkable thing – they formed a wall of protest	On 1 January, in one of the biggest movements for women’s rights in India, 5 million women lined up across the length of the southern state of Kerala to “uphold Renaissance values”. What they were demanding was an end to violent agitations against women trying to enter Kerala’s Sabarimala temple, a popular Hindu pilgrimage site. This followed a ruling by the Indian supreme court in September, which forced the temple’s doors open to women of all ages in a sensational blow to religious tradition. “Where a man can enter, a woman can also go. What applies to a man, applies to a woman,” the bench said in its judgment. Since 1991, the temple has accepted only men and older women, in their millions every year, to preserve the mythological celibacy of the ruling deity, Ayyappa. In theory, the court order only reinforced Indian women’s constitutional right to enter places of worship as freely as men, but in practice it wreaked mayhem. Between 17 November and 24 December, more than a dozen women of menstrual age, including reporters, tried to enter the temple but were stopped, shoved and stoned by mobs of male devotees. None of the women could make it in, despite police protection and prohibitory orders. Both sides are far from giving in. Protests have since continued, though most women who were sent back by the mobs have vowed to return.
JAN4	The space race is back on – and is China in the lead?	China’s achievement in landing a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, announced by Beijing’s state media this morning, has ramifications that go far beyond the simple statement of this being a “first” for mankind. It puts China on the map of international space exploration on a par with the existing space powers of the United States and Russia – the European Union to a lesser extent – but also adds a new dimension. It is the first time a landing has been attempted on the far side of the moon, with the particular communications challenges this entails, and it has been a success. The first response from the US space agency, Nasa, was generous, as scientists to scientists: what China had managed was a “first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment”. The response in political and military quarters in Washington, as in Moscow, however, is likely to reflect trepidation. There is now a serious newcomer to be considered.
JAN5	No-deal Brexit is like Dragons’ Den. No ferries, Chris? Sorry, I’m out	There’s a certain type of movie character that finds time to suggest a shag even in the midst of a crisis. If anything, the fact the bomb clock is ticking or planetary destruction is pending gets them in the mood. The Tories are like that, but with backstabbing. There are 84 days until Brexit, Theresa May’s deal is about to get voted down heavily and bump the UK a few weeks closer to a calamitous no-deal exit, and the first thought of certain Tory leadership hopefuls is, “Ooh, how can I do over ‘the Saj’?” If you missed this latest flurry of displacement activity, a report claimed the home secretary refers to himself in the third person during meetings. According to what a source told the Sun, and which Javid hotly denied: “He uses phrases like, ‘Just you watch what the Sajid is going to do about this’, or ‘the Saj will sort that out’.” Oof. These drive-bys made a charming companion piece to the articles suggesting that Javid was failing to get a grip on Britain’s nonexistent migrant “crisis”, and the very detailed articles about Javid’s very luxurious South African holiday.
JAN5	Democrats are battling Trump. But on Brexit, Labour is tongue-tied	I’m suffering from a bad case of opposition envy. Perhaps you missed this only-recently- discovered malady, among all the new year detox supplements and guides “to a new you”. In which case, let me fill you in. Spool back to the early summer of 2016, when twin horrors loomed on the horizon: Brexit and Trump. I imagined back then the devil offering progressive types one wish: they could either have Britain stay in the European Union or see Donald Trump lose the US presidential election. But they could not have both. I wrote then that, forced to make that diabolical choice, I’d opt for a remain victory in the referendum. Though four years of Trump would be a nightmare, Brexit would haunt us for generations.
JAN5	Think Riyadh’s Netflix ban was bad? Imagine if Hasan Minhaj was a Saudi citizen	The government of Saudi Arabia makes it very clear that resistance to its regime is futile. It will not tolerate dissent; it is untouchable. The kingdom has never claimed to be a democracy – or that it believed in free speech, the right to protest, or the right to collectively bargain for rights. There is no independent press.
JAN5	Beware the clever lie of a 'clean break Brexit'	Some days it can be hard to believe, but Brexit hasn’t actually happened yet. Until 11pm on 29 March 2019, when we leave the EU without a deal, enter into the transition period envisaged by Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, or don’t leave at all because the article 50 period has been extended, the fight over our future remains a battle of ideas. Such battles are won largely with words: in the absence of facts on the ground, we are swayed by assertions, characterisations and attempts to define – sorry Theresa – often rather nebulous concepts.
JAN5	All aboard Chris Grayling’s Brexit pizza ferry – what could possibly go wrong?	We’re about to “give back control” to a government that can’t tell the difference between P&O and Papa John’s pizza. I know you think that sounds good, but one day you’ll want insulin or a functioning health service rather than a pepperoni stuffed crust. In case you’ve missed everything, here’s a quick recap … In 2016 government members insisted that Brexit was easy and no deal was better than a bad deal. After realising that was shite, they discovered they had to do quite a lot of planning for no deal. This left them in the awkward position of going back to a public they’d just told that Brexit would improve their lives and assuring them there’d be food.
JAN5	Fat Cat Friday should shatter the myth that Britain’s bosses deserve their pay	Please raise a glass – if you’re not doing Dry January, of course – to our nation’s exceptionally talented CEOs and their superhuman work ethic and skills. For the average executive to have earned the equivalent of a worker’s average annual salary by 4 January is surely testament to an unimaginable amount of hard work and graft. They must truly deserve the 11% hike in their salaries since last year, unlike millions of good-for-nothing slackers like nurses and teachers who have endured years of stagnating pay. It is worth taking a moment to absorb how great the gap now is between the worker and the boss. Top executives now earn 133 times more than the average worker; in 1998, the ratio was 47. The salary of the average FTSE chief executive is the same as that of 386 Britons on minimum wage combined. This in a country where workers have suffered the worst squeeze in wages for generations, where most Britons languishing in poverty are actually in work, where child poverty has increased at its fastest rate for three decades, and where one in every 200 people are classed as homeless or in inadequate homes. It is not a trend restricted to Britain, of course: US top bosses earn 312 times the average worker’s wage.
JAN5	An invisible Irish border is crucial. That’s why we support the backstop	Life has become pretty normal for most people in Northern Ireland over the past 20 years or so. Like anyone else in the UK, people go to jobs near to them or in the next town. They go to doctors, chemists and hospitals near to them. They buy local fresh food. They use trains, buses and roads to get around. But if we in Britain get Brexit wrong, our friends in Northern Ireland will find all of these things harder to do. Why? Because of the border with Ireland, which is crossed 110 million times a year as people on either side go about their daily lives.
JAN5	Cheap rail fares would mainly benefit the rich? That’s muddled thinking	One of the most depressing things about politics in the UK is realising how easy it is for total nonsense to become common sense and received wisdom. Take this tweet from YouGov, following the recently announced rise in fares. “There will be calls for train fares to be frozen – the main beneficiaries will be those in wealthier households. 42% of those who made more than 50 train journeys last year are in households earning £40k+. Just 10% are in households on less than £20k”. Most of the poor, YouGov sagely intones, take the car, or bus, or walk. Therefore we should not lower the price because that means only rich people will benefit.
JAN5	Run, swim, cook: the new prescription for happiness	When Ella Risbridger was at her lowest ebb, sitting with a psychiatrist trying to explain why she had wanted to throw herself under a bus, help came from a wholly unexpected source. Her mind was “looking for a puzzle” to occupy itself, as she put it, something to take her outside the horrible thoughts she was having. And it settled, most unexpectedly, on baking. She came home from hospital and made a pie, and from then on cooking became a sort of comfort and salvation. For her, the rhythmic and predictable act of making meals became a self-soothing ritual, a way not so much of curing her chronic anxiety as living through it. Even the recipe that provided the title of her wholly unconventional cookbook, Midnight Chicken, came from an afternoon spent lying on the floor wondering if she would ever be able to get up.
JAN5	Women of colour fleeing violence need help – not penalties for who they are	Rotherham is a town now made infamous by grooming gangs and government agencies that assumed children as young as 11 could consent to sex with men old enough to be their fathers. Five minutes from a city centre that has perhaps seen better days, sits the black and minority ethnic (BME) violence against women and girls (VAWG) charity Apna Haq. Nestled behind a large mechanic’s garage, its location provides an apt visual metaphor. Not unlike wild flowers that bloom by busy roadsides, the charity exists and flourishes in spite of it all. Apna Haq, which in Urdu means “our right”, was set up in 1994 by manager Zlakha Ahmed. Back then, in her work as an English language tutor and then later as a youth worker, Ahmed had come across countless “beautiful intelligent women” whose experiences of abuse and social isolation would stay with her. In the end her frustration – a word she uses frequently – over “men controlling women’s behaviour” kickstarted the charity. Rooted in the community, it exemplifies the importance of specialist organisations in the women’s sector that cater for women from black and ethnic minority communities. Yet just five years into Tory austerity, Ahmed’s 20-year legacy was under threat after their contract to deliver domestic violence services was instead awarded to a generic provider.
JAN6	Our uncivil war over Brexit was fuelled by deceit, not one oddball	Right on cue, as the witching hour of Brexit closes in, we are offered an opportunity to reflect on the forces that brought us to this state of national disarray and division. One of the most eye-catching things about James Graham’s drama Brexit: The Uncivil War (screened on Channel 4 tomorrow evening), is that David Cameron proved too dull to make the final draft. The author of this whole catastrophe – the man who, in the interests of party management, put the referendum commitment into the manifesto and as prime minister made it happen – is thus reduced to the status of Gavrilo Princip, the assassin who unwittingly triggered the first world war. James Graham’s genius is for poking about in the stomach of the beast
JAN6	Will it be a black woman who turfs Trump out of the White House?	Life, as Donald Trump has known it for the last two years, has just changed forever. Quagmired in a government shutdown of his own making, Trump’s ability to manipulate his world is already severely constrained in this very new year. The more he struggles against his new surroundings, the more he sinks. Last week the president could only watch his beloved cable news channels as a bystander to the biggest tectonic shifts, as the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first candidate to officially emerge to run against him next year. And it won’t be long before the House launches several investigations into corruption and incompetence, while the Mueller investigation continues to tighten several nooses around all things Trumpian.
JAN6	‘Managed no deal’? That’s just more Brexit snake oil	Here we go again. As we return, haggard and hungover, from the Christmas break, the Brexit deal is heading back to parliament. And presumably the debate will also continue where it left off. Prepare for a succession of Brexiteers touting the idea of a “managed no deal” as an appealing alternative to either the deal on offer or the prospect of a no-deal outcome. They’re wrong. It’s worth tracing the “logic” deployed by proponents of this approach, because it has gone through three distinct stages.
JAN6	Our out-of-step press demonises desperate refugees	Where is our humanity? More to the point, where is the compassion that should inform the editorial agendas of our major news outlets? For the past couple of weeks, in a period we like to call the season of goodwill, Britain’s newspapers and broadcasters have been reporting the arrival of desperate men and women on our shores as if they are criminals unworthy of charity or understanding.
JAN6	I dislike the link to empire, but it felt wrong to turn down an OBE	Very occasionally, I wish I was French. The fantasy usually materialises just after a holiday, when I dream of living by the warmth of the Mediterranean, or after a trip to Paris during which I indulge fantasies of being a Left Bank cafe-bohemian. Such daydreams evaporate when I remember that my French is sub-GCSE standard, that as a strict vegetarian I am routinely the target of tutting derision by French waiters and that even the faintest waft of Gauloise smoke leaves me fumbling for my asthma inhaler. But at the end of last year I stumbled upon a new reason to indulge this fantasy.
JAN6	To stop Brexit, Labour supporters will have to revolt against their leader	Since nearly all of his career has been spent in rebellion against his own party, I guess we should not be too surprised that Jeremy Corbyn seems so determined to defy it over Brexit. Labour members hate Brexit and they want it reversed. With parliament deadlocked and growing public support for taking the question back to the people, a large majority of Labour voters, and an even larger majority of Labour members, wants the party to throw its weight behind another referendum. Compare and contrast with a Labour leader who doesn’t hate Brexit, doesn’t want it to be reversed and will not help facilitate another referendum if he can possibly avoid it. That divide between leader and members has been pretty obvious for a long time to anyone who contemplated Mr Corbyn with clear eyes rather than wearing soft-focus lenses. The split has become more evident as the Labour frontbench has run through various tactical ruses to try to mask the tension between its members and its leader. He is what he is and that is a lifetime opponent of the EU. He has not once expressed a flicker of remorse about the result of the 2016 referendum and treats the momentum behind a second referendum not as an opportunity to be seized, but as a threat to be smothered.
JAN6	Power politics always drives space conquest. China’s coup is no different	Nasa rejected it as too difficult and costly an undertaking. Last week, China declared “mission accomplished” after landing a spacecraft, Chang’e-4, on the far side of the moon. It was a remarkable endeavour. As the far side of the moon never faces the Earth, mission control cannot communicate directly with the spacecraft, but only via an orbiting satellite. The terrain is more broken and cratered than the near side, so landing a craft is that much more difficult. Even Nasa was impressed: “a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment!”, the administrator tweeted.
JAN6	This is the Nancy Pelosi moment and Donald Trump should be very afraid	The Trump White House has frequently been called chaotic, wild, undisciplined, disorderly. But a better word might be “unruly,” because if there’s one thing Donald Trump can’t abide, it’s rules. Not only has the Trump administration signally failed to follow the rules, it’s not clear it ever bothered to learn them. But as the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives last week, that abruptly changed. Trump is about to get schooled in the rules of the game. For two years, thanks to a Republican Congress that chose not to honor its constitutional duty to maintain oversight of the executive branch, the American political drama has centred on special counsel’s Robert Mueller’s investigation. But that focus is about to widen, as Nancy Pelosi, the once and future Speaker of the House, reclaimed the gavel, promising to show Americans its power: the picture of her smiling as she wielded it went viral, for good reason.
JAN6	Brexiters ache to dish out a severe spanking, whether we like it or not	Wide-eyed foreigners long ago concluded that masochism was le vice anglais. Impressed by the volume of Victorian spanking pornography, the Italian critic Mario Praz wrote in the 1930s: “It seems to be an assured fact that sexual flagellation has been practised in England with greater frequency than elsewhere.” Or as a successful lawyer once declared on the theme: “Most people probably think S&M – spanking, bondage, whipping, role play like doctors and nurses, sheikhs and harems, guards and prisoners – is harmless and private and even funny.” The late Christopher Hitchens, who claimed with pride that Margaret Thatcher once “smote me on the rear with a rolled-up parliamentary order paper”, explained it thus: “There is almost no English surname, however ancient and dignified, that cannot be instantly improved by the prefix ‘Spanker’.”
JAN6	Keeping up with the Kardashians means paying other women to have your babies	Behold the handmaid (#2) of the Kardashians. Or at least, that of Kim, the celebrity, and Kanye, artist and Trump loyalist. The couple have just announced the commissioning of their fourth child, using the womb of a gestational carrier who will, since this is the US, be paid for the rental. In details shared after their previous carrier delivered, last year, Kim Kardashian explained to her millions of fans that she was the first person to have “skin on skin” contact with her baby and that the experience, from carrier vetting to the carrier’s organic diet to delivery, had gone so brilliantly she “would recommend surrogacy to anybody” (presumably as the purchaser rather than the provider). One of the few problems was remembering she was having a baby: “I’m totally gonna forget and then a month before I’m gonna be like holy shit, we need to get a nursery.” For the surrogacy industry, then, this ongoing Kimye promotion may be the most valuable publicity since Elton John and his partner acquired two delightful sons via a similar route – far more so, in fact, since Kardashian, though it could be risky for her to give birth again, at least had the not entirely tragic alternative to gestational assistance of remaining a mother of two healthy children. Conventionally, the attribution of desperation to infertile or gay would-be parents has been critical in eclipsing the other sorts of desperation that might make impoverished Indian, Greek or Ukrainian women consider becoming incubators for rich couples they are unlikely, post baby handover, to see again.

JAN8	Ten years after the first war on Gaza, Israel still plans endless brute force	This month marks the 10th anniversary of the first major military assault on the 2 million Palestinians of the Gaza Strip. After its unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, Israel turned the area into the biggest open-door prison on Earth. The two hallmarks of Israel’s treatment of Gaza since then have been mendacity and the utmost brutality towards civilians. On 27 December 2008, Israel launched Operation Cast Lead, pounding the densely populated strip from the air, sea and land for 22 days. It was not a war or even “asymmetric warfare” but a one-sided massacre. Israel had 13 dead; the Gazans had 1,417 dead, including 313 children, and more than 5,500 wounded. According to one estimate 83% of the casualties were civilians. Israel claimed to be acting in self-defence, protecting its civilians against Hamas rocket attacks. The evidence, however, points to a deliberate and punitive war of aggression. Israel had a diplomatic alternative, but it chose to ignore it and to resort to brute military force.
JAN8	At the heart of this NHS cash boost lies a dishonesty: tax	Something about a big government launch in January invites suspicion. It feels like one of those doomed new year resolutions that is all optimistic intent and no staying power. It smacks of a prime minister desperate to turn over a new leaf yet fated to relapse into bad old habits. Theresa May wants the new political season to kick off with a conversation about the NHS. She visited a children’s hospital in Liverpool bearing a “long-term plan” and a suitcase full of Treasury cash.
JAN8	A no-deal Brexit would be disastrous. My amendment will help prevent it	Just because most people don’t want something to happen doesn’t mean it won’t. So it is with a no-deal Brexit. I believe the majority of MPs, ministers and most people across the UK are opposed to the self-inflicted damage to our economy and security that would result from crashing out of the EU. But there are just 81 days left, and there is a growing danger that a combination of brinkmanship, political paralysis, siren voices and drift will push us over the cliff edge. This is too serious for parliament to stand by. That is why I have tabled an amendment to the finance bill with a group of other cross-party committee chairs to put safeguards in place against no deal.
JAN8	Britain is crippled by record personal debt while the Tories boast of a boom	With a government torn apart by Brexit and a country falling to pieces because of that government, Conservative MPs have a fallback they sometimes like to use as proof of their success: the UK has record employment levels. It’s a proud badge of honour they wear, fetishising work – it doesn’t matter what that work looks like or how much it pays – because it’s supposedly a sign that the economy is doing well. The thing is, people might be in work, but they’re also in debt. Britain’s household debt has reached a new high. According to the TUC, UK households now owe an average of £15,385 to credit card firms, banks and other lenders. There might be some quibbling over what’s included in these figures. Unlike the Bank of England, in its calculations the TUC includes increasingly exorbitant student loans, which have eye-wateringly high interest rates. But even if we were to take those out of the equation – leaving debt at half that estimated by the TUC – the level of debt, the nature of that borrowing and why it’s being accrued spells trouble. In 2017, academic Johnna Montgomerie called it “one of the biggest problems facing the United Kingdom’s economy and society”.
JAN8	No more tribal politics: MPs must be allowed a free vote on Brexit	Has anything changed over the holiday? Yes: 29 March is two weeks nearer. Like the imminence of death, it concentrates the mind. Parliament now moves into that darkly hallowed chamber known as the short term, its walls moving ever inwards. A few things are clearer. One is that Theresa May has the best deal on offer. Another is that only a sizeable handful of Tory last-ditchers and industrial anarchists believes a no-deal Brexit is in the nation’s interest. Yes, it may have been overlaid with hysteria, understandably in the case of farmers. But it does not add up.
JAN8	Caroline Lucas is wrong – a meat tax would only hurt the poor	Caroline Lucas called for a meat tax last week, something the environment secretary, Michael Gove, has suggested is the worst example of a nanny state. He is wrong. The idea isn’t authoritarian, it’s regressive. Like other proposals to impose taxes on dangerous products to save people from themselves, it is well intentioned. But the inevitable consequence is that poor people will suffer. This is by no means an argument that meat is good for people, or even necessarily cheaper. Red meat is associated with a host of health issues such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes, and chefs such as Jack Monroe have shown how people can eat healthy, vegan meals on a tight budget. But to incentivise behaviour by making things more expensive is to say that the rich can do whatever they please while the poor should go without. The weight of environmentally conscious decisions falls on those who can’t afford to pay rather than on society as a whole. It’s reverting to 18th-century rules: the poor can eat beans, while the rich eat meat. Choice becomes something only the rich deserve.
JAN8	There is no leftwing justification for Brexit. We must fight it to the last	Perhaps the only success of David Cameron’s reckless EU referendum gamble was that it took the Tories’ toxic split on Europe and shared it with the rest of the country. At least they are no longer the laughing stock: now we all are. Yet among the cluster of possible solutions around Norway this or Canada that, or a customs union of sorts, the danger remains that the bigger picture is being missed: the political effect of Brexit on the UK and our foreign relations. Brexit is one part of a project to reshape the politics of the west and set it in concrete. And too many on the left are happy to sleepwalk into that oblivion.
JAN8	A message to the mob: behave on social media as you would in real life	I love social media, I really do. I relish any opportunity to interact with people I may never meet in person, strangers with similar interests. Sadly, I am usually boring, sharing articles, posting about social issues, art, occasionally music and, increasingly, ornithology. I have relatively few followers and do not actively seek more by being self-consciously “witty”. I follow only those I know or find interesting. If I consider someone to be a septic pustule (Donald Trump, for example) why would I follow them when I would walk away if they joined my mates in a pub? I’ve made friends, have even met some in person: social media has provided an overwhelmingly positive experience. Recently, however, that changed. An article I had written went live at 4pm. By 6pm I realised a storm was brewing. Notified by Twitter (which mercifully and to my surprise did a great job) I applied all suggested filters, locking my account just in time to shield myself from the worst of the personal and spiteful abuse. Even so, still I felt isolated; as if I was buried beneath a pile of manure. It was intimidating when men (yes, it was mostly men) with few friends but a keen interest in wrestling requested to follow me.
JAN8	Together we can thwart the big-tech data grab. Here’s how	Our family got a Google Home Hub for Christmas. As comparative lifestyle Neanderthals, we have so far only used it as a glorified digital picture frame and music player, though this is clearly not what it was built for. Say “Hey, Google”, tell it what you want, and a whole universe of entertainment, advice and help can be supplied – up to and including instant control of internet-connected doorbells, thermostats and more. Contrary to their branding as “assistants”, the primary purpose of these devices is not to devotedly help the people who use them. At the risk of stating the blindingly obvious, once we have paid for the hardware, we get the services they can deliver largely for free, in return for limitless access to the small details of our lives. Big tech is therefore able to carry on making advertising more and more precisely targeted, and vastly increase the mountains of data that power its development of artificial intelligence. Smartphones, tablets and computers have been helpful, but evidently not helpful enough. Build data-gathering machines into the domestic sphere, and you break open whole streams of personal information.
JAN8	Detained at US immigration, I felt frightened. And very lucky	I flew back to the US from London last week, and after waiting for two hours at immigration I stood by as the officer frowned at my documents. My children’s US passports had been scanned without a problem. But looking at my green card, the officer asked: “Was this lost or stolen in the last year?” As it happens, it was. “Then I’m sorry,” he said, glancing down at my three-year-olds. After a seven-hour flight and all that waiting in line, they were doing breaststroke across the JFK floor. “You’ll have to step this way.” I have heard about the Congratulations, You Have Problems With Your Paperwork room at JFK, but until that moment had never actually seen it. It is a small, windowless room dominated by a raised bank of desks, behind which six or so officers sit, with several more patrolling the room. “No cellphones,” snapped a woman as I knelt on the floor, restraining a child with one hand while trying to text the cab driver waiting for us outside with the other.
JAN9	The Guardian view on Brexit: the government has failed – it’s time to go back to the people	Next week the House of Commons will take what is probably the most consequential vote of our era. Unless the government again gets cold feet, key aspects of this country’s economic model, social cohesion and international future will be shaped in the so-called “meaningful vote” over Theresa May’s Brexit deal. It will define what Britain is more than any other political event in modern times. It poses questions and choices that cannot be shirked. This newspaper supported Britain’s entry into the European Community in the 1970s. We opposed Britain’s departure from the European Union in 2016. We took these positions on the basis of the same long-term principles. Britain is a European nation by virtue of its geography and history. It shares enduring economic and cultural ties and values with the rest of Europe. Above all, Britain has a direct interest, born from the suffering of our peoples in decades of war, in the peace and harmony of Europe from which all can prosper. In the era of Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, Britain’s engagement in Europe is freshly urgent.
JAN9	The murder of my wife, Jo Cox, is being used to cow MPs. That’s not her legacy	I’ve spent the past few weeks desperately sorting hundreds of pictures of Jo to archive, print off and put in albums. My objective was to have finished the project by the new year so that the kids have access to as many pictures of their mum as they want; playing with them, dashing around on the campaign trail, on holiday together. Having spent way too long looking at pictures of her in the past few weeks, the thing that comes out in almost every photo is her spirit of generosity and kindness. Her smile is unmissable and unforgettable – even in the face of awful weather, precipitous rock climbs or on tough days. We miss her energy and positivity in our lives as much as anything.
JAN9	To accept an OBE is to condone the brutality of empire	Acentury ago the eminent Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore returned his knighthood to the viceroy of India. The “time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in their incongruous context of humiliation”, Tagore wrote in outrage as scores of peaceful protesters were massacred in Jallianwala Bagh. He would now “stand, shorn of all special distinctions, by the side of my countrymen”. In accepting the knighthood, Tagore had been unfairly accused of being a colonial flunkey, partly because he had expressed justifiable reservations about aspects of Indian nationalism. The 1919 atrocities in Amritsar jolted the Nobel laureate into accepting that that his Knight Commander of the British Empire (the KBE still in use today) could not be treated as unconnected to the bloodied realities of that empire’s operations.
JAN9	Vote Leave relied on racism. Brexit: The Uncivil War disguised that ugly truth	At the beginning of Channel 4’s drama Brexit: The Uncivil War, the ex-Tory Ukip MP Douglas Carswell tells Matthew Elliott and Dominic Cummings, newly appointed to run Vote Leave, that they will offer a “respectable alternative” to the “rightwing thugs” Nigel Farage and Arron Banks. Cummings, the “strategist” (and anti-hero of this semi-biopic), soon returns to the theme: the Conservative-led and soon to be officially recognised campaign “needs to be respectable”, appealing beyond Ukip’s base if it is to win 50% plus one and the referendum. Elliott drums the point home: “We need to get them [Farage and Banks’ Leave.EU] to do the heavy lifting on the migration stuff – then we keep our hands clean.” However Cummings has a problem. The EU’s supranational institutions, demonised by Brexiters, are “too complicated, too remote” to be the focus of the campaign. It needs a “simple message repeated over and over and over”, if it is to appeal to the “three million extra voters that the other side have no idea exist” who Cummings’ new friend Zack Massingham, of the shadowy AggregateIQ, promises can tip Vote Leave over the line.
JAN9	Are the men in the news adults – or attention-seeking five-year-olds?	This could just be me showing my age, but watching the news at the moment is like tuning in to a particularly fraught episode of The Secret Life of 5 Year Olds. One little boy is feeling ignored by a girl he likes, so he’s pulling her hair and telling her that he wouldn’t be her friend anyway because he’s found out that she’s going to be six in a minute. Another can’t get the attention of the teacher by being a good boy so instead he is loudly spitting out his dinner under his desk. One of the older boys has noticed that the younger kids get more attention, so he’s regressing to baby talk and throwing all the toys out of a pram. Meanwhile, over by the Wendy house, a group of bullies is chasing after a little bossy girl and shouting in her ear that she is a big bum face. Oh, for sensible Dr Laverne Antrobus to appear in a secret viewing room and explain that this is a crucial but brief period of radical attention-seeking and it will all be OK again once the children have had a good night’s sleep and a cuddle. In the grownup world, however, attention-seeking behaviour is increasingly hard to ignore. This week, a 50-year-old French author hardly anybody had heard of decided to rattle a few cages by announcing that he just can’t fancy a woman his own age. French feminists threw up their hands in horror – one of them publishing a photo of a 52-year-old derriere on Instagram – which only seemed likely to reward his silliness. Fortunately, the British media and anyone who has ever using a dating website in the 21st century just rolled their eyes and turned to the next story: elderly bear shits in woods; see photos pages 3, 4, 5, 6 …
JAN9	This radical plan could be the way to get social housing back on track	Home should be a sanctuary. Warm and safe, it is a place where a door can be firmly closed on the trials, threats and stresses of the outside world. A place you can rest, and enjoy your leisure time. For as long as there have been people, they have needed homes. In Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, warmth and rest sit alongside food and water at the base of the pyramid. In his theory, only when those basic needs are met can we concern ourselves with higher goals.
JAN9	It’s time for May to pull the emergency brake and extend article 50	In a jam like this, when parliamentary discipline has broken down, No 10 has two last-ditch tactics up its sleeve. The first is to try to pull off the psychological trick of persuading MPs that the mood is changing, and that they had better fall in line before they miss the bus. The second is to blackmail them by painting a picture of how awful the alternative to the prime minister’s deal is, underlining that the responsibility for the ensuing chaos will lie with MPs who vote against her. Unfortunately for Theresa May, neither of these ruses is likely to work this time. No 10 has been briefing since before Christmas that it is making progress with the European Union on the backstop and will soon be able to unveil changes that will make the plan acceptable to the rebels. Downing St also says it is in talks with the Democratic Unionist party – and if the DUP changes position on her deal, so will most pro-Brexit Tory rebels. This is either whistling in the wind or, more likely, deliberately misleading.
JAN9	The sexism in surgery is shocking – from 'banter' to discrimination	In 2016 58% of people applying to medicine and dentistry courses were women. However, according to the Royal College of Surgeons of England, only about 12% of consultant surgeons in 2018 were women. Why? A small survey in the BMJ medical journal points to the level of discrimination. As a general surgical trainee, I have been shocked by the experiences reported by some female colleagues. The discrepancy in the number of women applying to medicine and those going on to become consultant surgeons can partly be explained by the higher dropout rate. Could inherent gender discrimination within surgery itself play a part in that? Female colleagues with children have struggled to be accepted and are seen as less than full-time surgeons, despite working similar hours in hospital to those surgeons with part-time hospital and research commitments. A female surgeon returning from maternity leave didn’t dare tell colleagues that she had a 10-month-old baby at home, fearing that she would be viewed as lacking “commitment to speciality”. Female surgeons are continually asked about their family plans. I was even asked at an international conference if colorectal surgery would be the correct career path if I plan to have children. These aren’t challenges that are unique to surgery – or to women, with more men taking longer paternity leave – yet the stigma seems more entrenched in surgery than other specialities. 
JAN9	Theresa May is taking us to the no-deal cliff but won’t march us over	They’re back but nothing has changed, so happy 2019 Groundhog Day. Ahead lies more perpetual Brexit hell, so get used to it. Don’t imagine the next fortnight of high parliamentary drama will lead to an ending where we can all return to politics as usual. This won’t end with the 15 January vote on the prime minister’s deal, nor with reprised attempts to revive it soon after. It won’t end by the supposed 21 January deadline either, nor will it all be over on 29 March, exit day. Barring extraordinary and dangerous shocks (yes, dreadful things are possible), Brexitry will go on and on for the foreseeable future. Awful prospect? Yes, but all alternatives are frighteningly worse than extending the process as we back off the precipice. For now this push-me-pull-you directionless government is leading us to the very edge. They want us to take a good look at the no-deal Tarpeian rock below which we will be dashed to pieces by the likes of Boris Johnson, who on Monday ditched his old Canada deal to back a naked no deal as soon as he saw the Tory membership swing that way.
JAN9	Carcinogens in your cosmetics? Welcome to Brexit Britain	How would you feel about putting a lovely dollop of formaldehyde on your nails? No? Well, perhaps I could interest you in a sprinkling of asbestos for your skin? Hmm, tricky customer, eh? OK, surely you couldn’t object to some coal tar on your eyelids, to really make them pop. Oh, come on, who wouldn’t risk a little light cancer for a really banging shade of eyeshadow? You wouldn’t? Too bad. In our brave new Brexit world, where EU legislation is no longer in force, and we are forced to accept trade deals on Trump’s terms, expect all these known carcinogens and more to be appearing on a beauty shelf near you. Since 2007 UK consumers have been protected by the EU’s “precautionary principle”. Essentially, the EU doesn’t think that chemicals that have been linked to cancer and birth defects belong in cosmetics, and so they are banned from use in consumer products. And who could argue with that?
JAN10	This was the great political power struggle of our times – and ministers lost	John Bercow can sometimes seem to be auditioning to play Shakespeare’s Malvolio. The House of Commons Speaker has at times a comic degree of self-esteem that is the equal of the arrogant steward in Twelfth Night. Like Malvolio, Bercow can also drive colleagues to distraction, as he did today. Today, though, Bercow took a brave stand to empower Britain’s parliament against Britain’s government on Brexit. And that qualifies him to be considered the most radical holder of his office in generations. Like Malvolio, a version of greatness has been thrust upon him. The vast majority of people are understandably not well versed in Commons procedure. So it may seem strange to claim that a decision to allow an amendment to be moved on a Commons timetable motion – and with no debate – is in any way immense. Nevertheless, Bercow’s decision to allow the all-party effort, led by the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve, to tie the government’s hands – it must come back with a plan B within three days if the Brexit deal is defeated next week – deserves such accolades.
JAN10	Trump’s border wall address was so lame, was it in fact a distraction?	Donald Trump is a master at manufacturing faux crises. He is not a master at faking humanitarian concern. He thought that speaking from the Oval Office and sitting behind the Resolute desk would help him invoke a grave national crisis. It’s the setting that JFK used to tell the country about life-threatening Cuban missiles. It’s where George W Bush tried to calm the country after 9/11.
JAN10	Never mind her politics, Kate Bush’s music speaks for itself	What does a Tory look like? Do they automatically come attired in Charles Tyrwhitt shirts and Barbour jackets, and have naturally booming voices? Does membership of the Conservative party automatically make you a subscriber to Horse & Hound magazine? Clearly such assumptions are ludicrous, but there is a sense among some music fans that Tory-loving pop stars should identify themselves – a badge, perhaps, or a special hat – in order that we may judge their acceptability. This certainly would have prevented a world of grief for Kate Bush, who has just ended two years on the naughty step when she released a statement clarifying her political views. In an interview with the Canadian magazine Maclean’s in 2016, Bush was reported as having expressed support for the new British prime minister, Theresa May, prompting a fit of the vapours among her admirers. Taken in context, the meaning of Bush’s quotes was obvious. During a discussion about Hillary Clinton and the fear of women’s power, she voiced enthusiasm for having a woman in charge. But nuance rarely being a characteristic of 21st-century discourse, this was lost in translation, and our Kate was branded a Tory. More heartache ensued in the flurry of press around the release of her remastered back catalogue and a book of lyrics late in 2018, prompting – finally – clarification on her website.
JAN10	When free societies copy Russian media tactics, there’s only one winner	How do you respond when a principle that forms part of the bedrock of your society is used to undermine it? This is the question facing liberal democracies across the world as Russia and others exploit free speech and its institutions – especially traditional and social media – through misinformation and electoral interference.
JAN10	Want to stop prisoners reoffending? Start by allowing phones and photos	These are dark days in a country torn by Brexit and years of austerity, which have widened the gap between rich and poor. And few places are as gloomy as the prison system, where shocking levels of violence and drug abuse mean there is little in the way of positivity for those tasked with inspecting the penal estate.
JAN10	Surviving R Kelly is a watershed moment for women of colour	It’s been several days since the Surviving R Kelly docuseries began on 3 January, reaching a channel record of 1.9 million viewers – and the hashtag is still trending. Conversations and debates about Lifetime’s intense six-part series are still evolving, as people digest the stories shared by Kelly’s survivors. And on Tuesday, news broke that investigators are looking into allegations in both Chicago and Atlanta as a result of the series. One could assume that the reason for the series’ success is a combination of good promotion, curiosity, outrage and excitement. But for many women, particularly black and brown women who have experienced sexual violence, I believe the premiere was both a long-awaited public moment of vindication for those Kelly has allegedly hurt (and for those fighting to hold him accountable), and a sign of the ever-growing resistance against him and others who inflict this kind of harm of women and girls in our communities.
JAN10	The botched Alex Salmond harassment inquiry could stop women speaking out	You would assume that civil servants faced with allegations of sexual assault by a former first minister of Scotland would proceed with the utmost caution; that they would fireproof themselves against a future appeal by making sure the procedure used to investigate those allegations was robust and that it was followed to the letter. With the #MeToo campaign in the headlines and a report suggesting that, despite its conceit of itself as family-friendly, Holyrood has the same level of sexual harassment as Westminster, the stakes surrounding the inquiry into Alex Salmond’s alleged behaviour towards two female members of staff in 2013 could scarcely have been higher. Knowing the former SNP leader would pore over every detail, as he had every right to do, they owed it to the women involved to ensure their handling of the complaints was beyond reproach. Instead, it emerged at Salmond’s judicial review, one aspect of the process was so flawed as to invalidate the entire investigation.
JAN10	Brexit proved our economy is broken, but our leaders still have no clue how to fix it	Just after midnight on 25 May 2016, a senior staffer in the remain campaign sent colleagues an urgent message. “Voters are very sceptical about our warnings on the economy,” began his email. “They don’t trust the numbers. They don’t trust the Treasury.” As head of strategy for Britain Stronger in Europe, Ryan Coetzee had bombarded Britons with evidence of the economic damage they would do to themselves if they didn’t stay in the EU. He and his team enlisted the Bank of England, the IMF, the OECD and pretty much every acronym that mattered. They’d wagged fingers, flung numbers around and pointed out the danger signs. From David Cameron down, leading remainers considered the economy their trump card. In the biggest single choice Britain had had to make for four decades, they were sure economics would be the deciding factor. But with less than a month to go before the vote, seasoned operative Coetzee could see the strategy was failing. Why, just a few days earlier, George Osborne had produced Treasury analysis that Brexit would send house prices plunging by as much as 18% – and BBC journalists reported being deluged with calls from would-be buyers asking where they could sign up.
JAN10	I was harassed outside parliament. These thugs must not stifle Brexit debate	The Brexit result split those who support it. The darker politics that was mixed in with the mainstream leave vote no longer feels the need to hide. On Monday, Anna Soubry, Owen Jones and I were confronted by it. But those who verbally attacked and physically harassed us do not speak for ordinary leave voters or the disadvantaged. They have nothing to do with the pro-Brexit protesters, with whom I respectfully disagree. I’ve encountered them before; talking to people around the country is what I do. I’ve engaged with them at People’s Vote marches in Sunderland and outside parliament. I even attended a rally led by the English Defence League’s so-called Tommy Robinson. A figure close to Robinson admitted to me (believing I was pro Brexit) that they knew Brexit would make the country poorer. Knowingly going ahead with a policy that leaves desperately squeezed people even worse off is a betrayal of those they claim to represent.
JAN10	Britain must rid itself of the delusion that it is big, bold and in charge	“Being powerful,” Margaret Thatcher once said, “is like being a lady. If you have to tell people you are, you aren’t.” It’s a lesson that could usefully be learned by Gavin Williamson, the elfin defence secretary who longs to inherit her job. Like a one-man military band, Williamson spent the Christmas period blowing the trumpet, twirling the baton and banging the drum for Brexit Britain. Leaving the EU, he told the Daily Telegraph, would restore Britain as “a truly global player”, determined once again to “play the role on the world stage that the world expects us to play”. Post Brexit, “Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Caribbean countries” and “nations right across Africa” would “look to us to provide the moral leadership, the military leadership and the global leadership” of which they had been too long deprived.
JAN11	Trump and the Brexiters must own the mess they lied us into	Three years ago, shortly after I arrived back in Britain after 12 years in the US, my gas meter was stolen. When the new one arrived it bore a note, insisting that it should not be stolen. It reminded me of the poster in the window of the Boys and Girls club at the top of my street in Chicago that read: “Stop killing people.” Some things, should not need to be said. So it was on Wednesday as MPs passed an amendment demanding the government come back with a plan B within three days, if the Brexit deal is defeated next Tuesday. The real scandal was not that the Speaker, John Bercow, had to creatively interpret parliamentary rules so that the vote could take place, but that the vote was necessary at all. Plan A isn’t up to much. It was withdrawn last month at the 11th hour because it was clearly going to be voted down. Nothing has changed. It will almost certainly be rejected next week. Time is running out. We have no hat and the EU wouldn’t lend us a rabbit to pull out of it even if we did. Under these circumstances the government shouldn’t be forced to come back with a plan B in a timely fashion. When it comes to backups they should be well down the alphabet by now.
JAN11	Cutting tuition fees will turn universities into vassals of the state	Meanwhile, back at the ranch – or in this case the campus – the mice are running riot. Ignored by Brexit, Britain’s universities are facing financial meltdown. I predict that within a decade they will become institutions wholly owned by the state, their academic autonomy unrecognisable. A few weeks ago, three universities were reported to be on the brink of bankruptcy. University debt has soared by £12bn in the past decade. Cardiff has borrowed £300m over 40 years, with experts suggesting it would take 2,000 years to repay if its current surplus does not improve. The backing for these loans is supposedly the ballooning scale of student fees, which David Cameron almost tripled to £9,000 in 2012 in England, and the removal of the cap on student numbers. Fees, rather than grants, now comprise the vast bulk of all university income for teaching undergraduates.
JAN11	London’s gangs have changed, and it’s driving a surge in pitiless violence	The murder of 14-year-old Jayden Moodie on Tuesday night highlights how youth violence continues to devastate the lives of young people, families and communities in London. Jayden’s death marks a new low point as he is the youngest victim to die on London’s streets so far this year. We don’t know whether Jayden was himself involved in gangs or if his death was gang-related. All we know is that he was struck by a vehicle while riding a moped, then chased by a group of three men and stabbed to death in what police believe was a targeted attack. However, Jayden was killed in Leyton, part of the east London borough of Waltham Forest where the threat of gangs and gang violence looms large.
JAN11	‘Do I look pretty?’ is my daughters’ favourite question and it’s worrying me	As I do most years, I watched the Golden Globes red carpet show last week. I like red carpet shows. Among other things, I like the parade of pretty frocks and the awkwardness of one group of adults milling around shouting the names of another group of adults nearby. This year, however, the entertainment was impaired by the sense that – as the parenting manuals like to say – I was showcasing bad behaviour for my daughters. Along with “can I have a treat?” and “when is it going to be my birthday?”, the question “do I look pretty?” now comes up regularly in my house – and the attraction of the rote answer, “yes”, has started to pall. I can’t put all the blame on the Disney princesses, although God knows they don’t help. The present generation of animated heroines have been given “feisty” attitudes and desires beyond marriage, but, with the exception of Moana, they still have tiny waists, tinier noses and, in the case of Elsa from Frozen, an amazing Dolly Parton chest that busts out at the climax of Let It Go, to the ongoing amazement of her four-year-old fans.
JAN11	An election would be a headache for Labour – and all-out war for the Tories	Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election in a speech in Wakefield on Thursday morning. That’s what oppositions do, so what’s new? The government’s essential, all-consuming, defining policy of our era is about to be voted down in parliament. The shadow of the loss of 5,000 Jaguar Land Rover jobs sharpens the immediacy of the nightmare – with Brexit said to be partly to blame. As Corbyn declared: “A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all.” That used to mean a government fell and a prime minister resigned, with an election inevitable. No longer. Instead, here is a government with no majority, surviving only on bungs to a handful of unionist extremists who don’t represent remain-voting Northern Ireland. Even then, it still loses vote after humiliating vote, with no intention of resigning in the honourable, old-fashioned way. If John Bercow – this morning called “speaker of the devil” by the Sun – is stretching the rules, he is only responding to this extraordinary constitutional crisis. The spirit of his role is to stand up for parliament, as this majority-less government makes serial attempts to deny MPs any say.
JAN11	Ocasio-Cortez has shown ‘shameless’ women are a powerful force	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has feet. And she washes sometimes. In order to do this she takes off her clothes, the brazen hussy. I presume this to be the case, although the picture of feet in the bath that the Daily Caller published seems to have been falsely ascribed to her. Experts have been brought in to analyse the length of the toes in the image, because this is clearly the biggest issue in America right now. This quite insane attempt to shame her is so bizarre after the video of her dancing on a rooftop at college backfired and she responded by dancing into her congressional office. She is more popular than ever. She excites the left because of her youth, her passion and her politics. She excites the right because she has a body – and, God knows, she may even enjoy that fact. This must be highlighted as sinful, over and over again.
JAN11	By mollycoddling our children, we're fuelling mental illness in teenagers	We talk incessantly about how to make children more “resilient”, but whatever we’re doing, it’s not working. Rates of anxiety disorders and depression are rising rapidly among teenagers, and in the US universities can’t hire therapists fast enough to keep up with the demand. What are we doing wrong? Nassim Taleb invented the word “antifragile” and used it in his book by the same name to describe a small but very important class of systems that gain from shocks, challenges, and disorder. Bones and the banking system are two examples; both get weaker – and more prone to catastrophic failure – if they go for a long time without any stressors and then face a major challenge. The immune system is an even better example: it requires exposure to certain kinds of germs and potential allergens in childhood in order to develop to its full capacity. Parents who treat their children as if they are fragile (for example, by keeping them away from dirt and potential allergens, such as peanuts) are depriving their children’s immature immune systems of the learning experiences those systems need to develop their maximum protective capacity.
JAN11	Why your chicken wings mean we’ve entered a new epoch	Have you ever thought much about the bones that remain littered in front of you after finishing a plate of chicken wings? New research suggests that Gallus gallus domesticus – the modern factory farmed chicken – might not be just a Sunday lunch staple but instead a marker of a new age in Earth’s history. The 11,700 or so years following the last major ice age are collectively called the Holocene, a geological chapter in earth’s biography that includes the development of all human civilization. Some experts argue that humans have fundamentally altered the earth’s biosphere to the point where we now live in a new age called the Anthropocene, an amalgamation of the Greek words for “new” and “human”. Copernicus was wrong: the earth doesn’t revolve around the sun anymore. It revolves around us.
JAN11	Social care is ageist – and the new NHS plan doesn’t even try to fix it	“We are taking a big step to secure the future of the NHS for our children and their children,” Theresa May told an audience in Liverpool on Monday as she launched the NHS 10-year plan. May’s emphasis on generations of NHS users may be cliched political rhetoric – the children, as they say, are our future – but by pitching public services as a deal between the generations, she quite unintentionally landed on something important. This country’s health and care system is currently riddled with a damaging generational divide, one that manifests itself in anything from a deficit in joined up services to outright bad feeling.
JAN11	It’s not perfect, but Norway plus may be Labour’s least worst option	There are no good options for Labour on Brexit. Accepting this fact is both depressing and liberating. Being on the left is supposed to be about unbounded optimism, a belief that what is deemed politically impossible by the “sensible grownups” of politics can be realised, with sufficient imagination and determination. But recognising that there is no magic button that will end the Brexit debate is to be freed of the stress of searching for the impossible. Supporters of every position on Brexit should be honest about the downsides of their chosen strategies. Labour’s priority is, rightly, a general election. When Theresa May declared from a Downing Street podium that she was seeking to dissolve parliament in April 2017, she wanted to make the election entirely about Brexit. Labour did not allow her to do so, shifting the conversation on to domestic issues, where it was strong, from hiking taxes on the rich to investing in public services to public ownership: issues that unite remainers and leavers. Even though voters have priorities other than Brexit, such as stagnating wages, housing and the NHS, repeating the 2017 strategy this time would be far more challenging, to put it mildly. Labour’s electoral coalition, which encompasses both pro-remain Kensington and pro-leave Ashfield – will be placed under severe strain. The fact that Brexit dominates political debate is bad for Labour because it suppresses its anti-establishment politics; its leading figures are left looking like triangulating politicians, the same as the all the rest.
JAN12	Brexit disaster looms. Can MPs unite quickly enough to save us?	The iceberg is approaching and now the scramble for the lifeboats begins. The iceberg in question is the catastrophe of a no-deal crashout from the European Union, its contours and texture becoming ever sharper as 29 March gets closer. For now, most MPs are vehement in their insistence that they dislike the iceberg very much, and that they are passionately opposed to sailing right into it. But the law is clear: Britain leaves the EU on that date unless another law is passed to change course. In other words, standing on the deck shouting at the berg will not help. MPs have to agree a plan to get out of the way – and they have to do it very soon. Here’s how fast things are moving. On Tuesday night, Theresa May will watch as her deal sinks in the Commons. It might not take the battering predicted by BBC News, which projects a defeat by more than 220 votes. Indeed, it might end up being much narrower. That’s thanks to an amendment tabled by Labour’s Hilary Benn, which will give MPs the chance simultaneously to reject both May’s deal and a no-deal. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s crowd won’t want to do that – they think a collision with the iceberg will be bracing, shake things up a bit – so May might suffer a milder humiliation than was otherwise looming. 
JAN12	Even Mordor was less toxic than Brexit Britain, this nation beyond parody	Well, there you are, then. Another epic political week has passed in off-brand Westeros, a septic isle from which there is no real escape, only a bloodstained booth where Chris Grayling is offering to sell you a ferry ticket. Every few days I change my mind about what I’d pop in the time capsule to explain to future generations just how inspirational this era was. This week, though, the choice could only be Wednesday’s parliamentary exchange between House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and Tory MP Adam Holloway, which I have lightly edited for space reasons.
JAN12	Theresa May is about to find out that Brexit is bigger than her	Whatever else happens with Brexit, no one in British politics will ever again underestimate the power of a timetable. The pressure of the article 50 clock ticking down forced Theresa May into the compromises that make her deal unpalatable to MPs. She has tried to pass the pain on to MPs, hoping that the grim consequences of missing the deadline would force them to settle for her plan. Earlier this week, in an act of parliamentary jujitsu, the former attorney general Dominic Grieve turned the timetable weapon back on May, securing an amendment that sets a limit of three days for the prime minister to say what comes next if her deal collapses. Running down the clock should eliminate options and force decisions. So far that hasn’t worked. Instead, the same volume of Brexit bluster has been compressed into an ever tighter space, which, in accordance with the laws of political thermodynamics, raises the temperature and increases the danger of something blowing up.
JAN12	Andy Murray taught us Scots to dream big and show emotion	Small, wet, overweight countries should not – and usually do not – produce tennis superstars. And although it was a time his many followers in Scotland and beyond had been expecting for a while, the pain and frustration etched on Andy Murray’s face as he announced his retirement from tennis at a tearful press conference in Australia, still came as a shock. The fairytale Federer-style comeback we all wished for was not to be. The visceral authenticity of the emotion made it difficult to watch. But it said everything you need to know about Murray: still utterly committed to the game he loves, struggling to free himself from the only life he has ever known – even though it is now causing him excruciating pain.
JAN12	We don’t think John Finnis should teach at Oxford University. Here’s why	This week, along with other students, we started a petition to stop Professor John Finnis teaching at Oxford University. As anticipated, the petition has been criticised on the grounds that its proposals would undermine academic and – though Finnis himself says his views are “strictly philosophical” – religious freedom. We were called “snowflake” students who were simply incapable of arguing against opposing views. We believe these criticisms miss the point. Here are some of the reasons for the petition: in a 1995 paper Finnis sets out that the judgment that homosexual conduct is “evil” can be defended. He draws an analogy between the “copulation of humans with animals” and homosexuality. In a 2011 article, he laments restrictions on the discussion of “the reversibility of sexual orientation or the relation if any between sexual orientation and child-abuse”.
JAN12	Don’t be fooled by Amber Rudd’s phoney attempt at compassion	Imagine launching a leadership bid by promising not to rob quite as many children as you were originally planning to do. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, is far from alone in circling the carcass of Theresa May’s premiership – although quite how a remainer is to triumph in a vote of the Ukip-ised Tory grassroots is difficult to answer – and her speech today, appropriately in a jobcentre, certainly represents positioning. As well as suggesting the benefits freeze may, possibly, end next year, her heavily trailed announcement is that the retrospective implementation of the two-child limit on universal credit won’t happen. The newly born third child of a supermarket worker, nurse or admin assistant – from the “just about managing” families May claimed to champion – will still have their support taken away.
JAN12	Labour must back a people’s vote before the clock runs out	Over the next few weeks, Britain faces a stark binary choice. It is not the blackmail choice that Theresa May misleadingly poses: my deal or no deal. Nor is it the choice Jeremy Corbyn still implausibly claims: her bad Brexit or his much better Brexit. The real choice we must make before B-day (currently 29 March) is this: blindfold Brexit or democratic timeout. As parliament takes back control, we urgently need the Labour front bench to join MPs from all parties in getting us to the timeout. By timeout I mean a period of democratic deliberation leading up to a second referendum, in which we decide, on the basis of everything we now know, how we should address the real problems that contributed to the vote for Brexit in 2016, what kind of country we really want to be – and whether we can do that better outside or inside the EU. For this, our EU partners will extend article 50 and give us the necessary time.
JAN12	The aliens are coming. And they’ve caught us with our pants down	Earlier this week, astronomers announced that they had observed repeated bursts of radio waves coming from deep space, with some experts suggesting this could be evidence of alien life. Is this it? Could extraterrestrials finally be trying to contact us? I hope not. Let me provide an analogy, and I think you’ll see what I mean.
JAN12	Tech firms have a duty to face down antisemitism	Beyond a quick read of a Wikipedia page, what can the internet really tell us about antisemitism in the United Kingdom? The answer is, a great deal. It has been shown that people are remarkably honest when they search for information online. Their Google searches and queries reveal interests, prejudices and hatreds that they might otherwise keep hidden from friends, family members, neighbours, surveys and even themselves. These searches have been shown to share their health secrets, sexual preferences, and hostility towards other groups. As part of my work with the Antisemitism Policy Trust and the Community Security Trust, I put this to the test to see what Google searches made by people in the UK could tell us about attitudes towards Jewish people. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, we found that, every year, people in the UK express antisemitic thoughts through their internet searches.
JAN13	Don’t give in to the age of fatalism. Fight back and secure your future	Anyone reading the outpouring of writing the global crisis has provoked must be prepared for anticlimax. There are hundreds of denunciations of Trump’s America, Brexit Britain and the Putinesque dictatorial “democracies” appearing everywhere from Hungary to Venezuela, Turkey to the Philippines. You turn to the final chapter expecting to hear how to fight back and… answer comes there none. The endnotes flash by, the index rolls and that’s that. You should not be surprised. The global order that developed in the 1980s has failed and to date the only replacement on offer has been authoritarian nationalism that will impoverish and diminish its supporters as much as its opponents.
JAN13	Marie Kondo calls it clutter; to me they are mementoes	I wouldn’t say that I’m a hoarder, exactly, but I will admit that there is no shelf in my flat left unadorned with photographs or trinkets or slightly pathetic miniature plants that could do with a good drink. As someone who moves house more often than I buy a new winter coat, this is not a practical trait, but still, I can find ledges where you would not believe. That flat part on top of the mirror? Perfect for postcards. Weird bit along the stairs that doesn’t seem to have any structural purpose? Exactly the right place for an exhibition of the exhibitions I’ve seen over the last couple of years, perked up with some holiday snaps and another plant. While it’s not quite at Channel 4 documentary intervention levels yet, I unashamedly love stuff.
JAN13	Brexit disaster looms. Can MPs unite quickly enough to save us?	The iceberg is approaching and now the scramble for the lifeboats begins. The iceberg in question is the catastrophe of a no-deal crashout from the European Union, its contours and texture becoming ever sharper as 29 March gets closer. For now, most MPs are vehement in their insistence that they dislike the iceberg very much, and that they are passionately opposed to sailing right into it. But the law is clear: Britain leaves the EU on that date unless another law is passed to change course. In other words, standing on the deck shouting at the berg will not help. MPs have to agree a plan to get out of the way – and they have to do it very soon. Here’s how fast things are moving. On Tuesday night, Theresa May will watch as her deal sinks in the Commons. It might not take the battering predicted by BBC News, which projects a defeat by more than 220 votes. Indeed, it might end up being much narrower. That’s thanks to an amendment tabled by Labour’s Hilary Benn, which will give MPs the chance simultaneously to reject both May’s deal and a no-deal. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s crowd won’t want to do that – they think a collision with the iceberg will be bracing, shake things up a bit – so May might suffer a milder humiliation than was otherwise looming. 
JAN13	Even Mordor was less toxic than Brexit Britain, this nation beyond parody	Well, there you are, then. Another epic political week has passed in off-brand Westeros, a septic isle from which there is no real escape, only a bloodstained booth where Chris Grayling is offering to sell you a ferry ticket. Every few days I change my mind about what I’d pop in the time capsule to explain to future generations just how inspirational this era was. This week, though, the choice could only be Wednesday’s parliamentary exchange between House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and Tory MP Adam Holloway, which I have lightly edited for space reasons.
JAN13	I’m a remainer. So why do I feel more and more sympathy for leave voters?	The outcome of the 2016 referendum horrified me. Despite my doubts about the European Union as an institution (its remoteness, lack of democracy, and inflexibility in dealing with crises such as the eurozone debt), I was, and remain, convinced that it’s better for nations to work together to deal with problems than apart. Since then, the chaotic fallout of the vote has made Brexit seem even more scary: we have witnessed an unstable government, inept negotiations, early signs of the economic damage to come, and a looming no-deal outcome.
JAN13	Theresa May is about to find out that Brexit is bigger than her	Whatever else happens with Brexit, no one in British politics will ever again underestimate the power of a timetable. The pressure of the article 50 clock ticking down forced Theresa May into the compromises that make her deal unpalatable to MPs. She has tried to pass the pain on to MPs, hoping that the grim consequences of missing the deadline would force them to settle for her plan. Earlier this week, in an act of parliamentary jujitsu, the former attorney general Dominic Grieve turned the timetable weapon back on May, securing an amendment that sets a limit of three days for the prime minister to say what comes next if her deal collapses. Running down the clock should eliminate options and force decisions. So far that hasn’t worked. Instead, the same volume of Brexit bluster has been compressed into an ever tighter space, which, in accordance with the laws of political thermodynamics, raises the temperature and increases the danger of something blowing up.
JAN13	The Met’s Gangs Matrix is racist policing in its purest form	In a review into the Metropolitan police service’s secretive Gangs Matrix, the London mayor’s office has been forced to publicly acknowledge that the database disproportionately targets black males. “The representation of young black males on the matrix is disproportionate to their likelihood of criminality and victimisation,” the report, sneaked out just before Christmas, admitted. Of the almost 4,000 names on the matrix at any given time, 78% are black and 9% are other ethnic minorities. Yet the review made no attempts to explain why this shocking disproportionality exists; nor did it seek to understand, or explain, the impact of this racist policing process on the individuals targeted, their families or the communities that they come from.
JAN13	Bread is on the rise again – but it’s time we Brits demanded a better loaf	Bread is back. In a major review hailed by critics of the low-carb trend, the World Health Organization has decreed that wholegrain breads can help combat a range of diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular problems and cancer. But did bread ever really go away? The headline news has looked dire in the last few years: white-sliced sales down 12% in the five years to 2017, according to retail analysts Mintel; M&S launching those weird high-protein sandwiches (“half the bread but all the filling”); storied baking powerhouse Warburtons launching gluten-free wraps. But this low-carb trend always felt like a fad awaiting a correction – long before the latest news.
JAN13	Andy Murray taught us Scots to dream big and show emotion	Small, wet, overweight countries should not – and usually do not – produce tennis superstars. And although it was a time his many followers in Scotland and beyond had been expecting for a while, the pain and frustration etched on Andy Murray’s face as he announced his retirement from tennis at a tearful press conference in Australia, still came as a shock. The fairytale Federer-style comeback we all wished for was not to be. The visceral authenticity of the emotion made it difficult to watch. But it said everything you need to know about Murray: still utterly committed to the game he loves, struggling to free himself from the only life he has ever known – even though it is now causing him excruciating pain.

He draws an analogy between the “copulation of humans with animals” and homosexuality. In a 2011 article, he laments restrictions on the discussion of “the reversibility of sexual orientation or the relation if any between sexual orientation and child-abuse”.
JAN14	Brexit has revealed MPs’ flaws – and our own	How do you find out someone’s character flaws? We all go to great lengths to conceal our own, producing improbable lines in job interviews about our greatest weakness being our tendency to work too hard. Politicians employ advisers who plot news grids to show how busy and effective their leaders are, even as those leaders regularly fail to take important decisions. Shakespeare liked to use two devices to get his characters to reveal their true selves: he either put them in disguise or got them drunk. In politics today, the device for unmasking people’s weaknesses is rather less fun than a masked ball or session with a tankard: it’s Brexit.
JAN14	David Cameron and the art of blaming other people	David Cameron really loved organising votes for things, didn’t he? That was his answer to everything. I was reminded of this when I read that the elected police and crime commissioners, which his government introduced to oversee the constabularies of England and Wales, aren’t doing a very good job. According to the head of the National Crime Agency, they’re all about stopping speeding and burglary, and not so hot on organised crime, online child abuse and modern slavery. It’s not surprising. Making some local elected officials the overseers of the police is effectively putting the Neighbourhood Watch in charge of law enforcement strategy. They’re going to address the issues most noticeable to the very small percentage of people who might turn out to vote for them. If they were in charge of healthcare, all the money would go to treating RSI caused by overenergetic net-curtain twitching. Their best chance of arresting a mafia boss is if he plays the music too loudly at his Christmas party.
JAN14	US TV networks put ratings over principle by airing Trump speech	Donald Trump’s speech on the Mexican “border crisis”, delivered live from the Oval Office last week, marked a milestone in his brief but historically chaotic presidency; it revealed serious errors of judgment that weren’t simply down to him. Unfortunately for commercial media outlets, it was their shortcomings that attracted almost as much attention and criticism as the scaremongering speech itself. It is the hallmark of many non-Democratic countries that tinpot dictators appear, at the drop of a hat, on national broadcast outlets. Even in functioning democracies you can measure the importance of a national moment by whether the head of state or government pops up in prime time. For this reason appearances by US presidents on all TV networks were traditionally a relatively rare occurrence. When they do happen, the decision to run them is made on an ad hoc basis by the heads of those networks.
JAN14	Out of the Brexit nightmare must emerge a more robust democracy	There’s a terrific scene in The Favourite, the film about the last of the Stuart monarchs, when Queen Anne is about to propose a European policy to her parliament. Just before she opens her mouth, the bewigged MPs make plain that they won’t have it. The queen faints with shock and hits the floor with a thump. I don’t expect Queen Theresa to collapse when she loses in parliament this week, not least because the rejection of her Brexit deal is not going to be a surprise to anyone, herself included. If we still lived by the traditional rules of British politics, defeat ought to be the final curtain for Mrs May. Brexit is the defining task of her premiership and she is about to fail it. We’d ordinarily expect the abdication of the PM to follow such a humiliating rejection. Yet no one, neither friend nor foe, expects her to respond to defeat by submitting her resignation. Brexit has so scrambled our politics that it has normalised dramas that we would once have regarded as extraordinary and made the unthinkable routine. We no longer know which of the rules still apply.
JAN14	Fraudulent reporters harm us all. Vigilance is essential	The name Claas Relotius recently joined those of Janet Cooke and Jayson Blair in the list of reporters whose deceptions massively harmed esteemed publications, and journalism more generally. Similarities in the cases offer lessons. Last December the prestigious German magazine Der Spiegel revealed the extent of the fraud of Relotius, one of its star writers. Disclosures continue, but it is already clear that large parts of his award-winning reporting were simply made up.
JAN14	The vandals destroying libraries should have the book thrown at them	It is a further triumph for The Favourite, with 12 Bafta nominations, to have propelled Ophelia Field’s 2002 biography of Sarah Churchill, the favourite in question, to the heights of Amazon’s gay and lesbian biography list. Anne Somerset’s 2012 biography of Queen Anne is also likely to benefit, as people attempt to discover more about the extraordinary incidents depicted in Yorgos Lanthimos’s film. How did 18th-century politicians train their racing ducks? Did Queen Anne ever get treatment for her raging bulimia? What became of Anne’s 17 little rabbits? And did Sarah really dress up as a highwayman – because it’s certainly not in Wikipedia?
JAN14	Leonardo was a man of the Renaissance, not narrow nationhood	He drew portraits for Italian dukes, sketched for the papacy and died at the court of a French king. If there is any artist who defies nationhood it is surely Leonardo da Vinci. Yet last week, Leonardo’s cosmopolitan legacy was caught up in an extraordinary intergovernmental spat when Rome renewed its threat to block Italian galleries from lending to the forthcoming Louvre exhibition commemorating the 500th anniversary of Leonardo’s death. Leonardo was Italian, after all. Why don’t they loan us the Mona Lisa?
JAN14	A divided Britain is not new. So why do today’s schisms seem intractable?	A few years ago, we stayed in a cottage in the Yorkshire Dales. One night, we went for a drink in the local. It was plastered inside and out with union jacks. The moment I saw the flags, the hairs on my neck stood up. Anyone black or Asian who had grown up in 70s and 80s Britain would probably have felt the same. The union jack in those days was a sign, meaning: “Beware, fascists around”. Littondale in the 2010s is, of course, a very different place from east London in the 1980s and the meaning of the union jack very different too. The pub was welcoming and friendly and we returned there more than once. And yet I know that the next time I see a pub plastered with union jacks, the hairs of my neck once more will stand up.
JAN14	Don’t give in to the age of fatalism. Fight back and secure your future	Anyone reading the outpouring of writing the global crisis has provoked must be prepared for anticlimax. There are hundreds of denunciations of Trump’s America, Brexit Britain and the Putinesque dictatorial “democracies” appearing everywhere from Hungary to Venezuela, Turkey to the Philippines. You turn to the final chapter expecting to hear how to fight back and… answer comes there none. The endnotes flash by, the index rolls and that’s that. You should not be surprised. The global order that developed in the 1980s has failed and to date the only replacement on offer has been authoritarian nationalism that will impoverish and diminish its supporters as much as its opponents.
JAN14	Angst, grief, pain: Europe is in turmoil as extremists form new alliances	It could simply be a coincidence. Or perhaps the decision to exhibit Edvard Munch’s most famous work, The Scream, at the British Museum in April, closely following Britain’s scheduled 29 March exit from the EU, is an artful piece of deliberate subversion. Either way, the Norwegian painter’s celebrated depiction of extreme pain occasioned by high anxiety, mental instability, grief, loneliness and separation seems especially well-suited to the times. Yet while Britain heads for a potentially spectacular nervous breakdown, an agitated Europe is not in much better shape. Nervousness abounds about the EU’s prospects and cohesion, with the focus on European parliament elections on 23-26 May. This normally dull, uninspiring contest is turning into a battlefield on which a definitive struggle over Europe’s direction may be fought and decided. The last elections in 2014 saw the lowest ever turnout; 2019 could be very different.
JAN15	This is only the end of the beginning of our Brexit civil war	Let no one think it will soon be over. This is only the end of the beginning, in a Brexit civil war that will last a generation. There is no end in sight, no healing in prospect, no solution to hand, whatever the outcome of myriad votes. Just get on with it, MPs find constituents complaining. They are “sick of the sight and sound” of Brexit, warned the Mail on Sunday leader, without moving an inch on its own support for Theresa May’s deal. Few do budge. So listen to no one who claims their particular answer will bring some miraculous national “closure”. None will. Better then to ignore snake-oil political “remedies”. Start with no deal, the most lethal ending, described as “national suicide” by Dominic Grieve. No need to rehearse the irrefutable reasons why crashing out would be a crippling economic blow and turn us into a pariah state. But note how devil-may-care David Davis would wantonly renege on certified EU debts with a blithe “We will keep the £39bn and spend it as we see fit”. Writing in the Sunday Times, he added: “Now is the time for the UK to call the shots.” No-dealer Dominic Raab tells May in the Telegraph to “send a clear message to Brussels that the UK will not be bullied”. His breezy talk of trading on WTO rules never reveals the killer terms they would entail.
JAN15	On Brexit our MPs have been in hiding. They must show themselves	The Palace of Westminster lends itself well to hide-and-seek. The Gothic labyrinth of interconnecting passageways and stairwells defies navigation. It contains a million places of concealment. But there are times when the division bell rings, and MPs must show themselves. The game ends and everyone sees who stands where. The vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal should be such a moment of revelation. It is two years since parliament voted to propel the UK out of the European Union, giving May authorisation to pull the article 50 trigger. Then the great game of hide-and-seek began. A small minority of MPs dared to declare Brexit a bad business from the start. They saw how reckless it was to set off on the journey without a map or a notion of the destination. But most hid, not in niches behind stone pillars but in bogus arguments and behind plastic loyalties.
JAN15	If Labour supports a public vote, we’ll take no lectures from Tories about democracy	In this week in 1910, the British electorate went to the polls. They did so because Herbert Asquith’s Liberal government had been unable to get Lloyd George’s famous People’s Budget through the House of Lords. Liberal posters defined the election as a choice between the peers and the people. They finally got their way after a second election that December. The fixed-term parliament act was never intended to prop up a zombie government
JAN15	In a world of joyless self-denial, what do we really want? Drunken Blind Daters, getting it on	Joanne and Morgan, a barista and a children’s social worker, have quite literally added to the gaiety of the nation with their brilliant blind date. As they told the Guardian’s Weekend magazine, they got drunk, fell over, crashed a party, fancied each other rotten. Knickers were lost. Mouths were full. They didn’t care about table manners or the food. Or, indeed, what any of us thought. What most of us thought, anyway, was: “Excellent behaviour!” Here were two young people having a wild time. For a brief moment, all was well with the world. Who cares whether they live happily ever after? I have never understood what a date actually is, except some sort of weird, creepy transaction where whoever pays gets to demand stuff from the other person. Often, I sit next to people on such dates and eavesdrop, and as far as I can ascertain they are worse than job interviews. They might as well be asking each other: “What qualities make you suitable for this role?”, “Would you describe yourself as a self-starter”, “You state on your application that you are 6ft; would you mind standing up?”
JAN15	Forget project fear. Remainers now need a ‘project patriotism’	If, as seems likely, the prime minister’s Brexit deal is rejected in parliament on Tuesday, it is arguably only the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who stands in the way of a second referendum. If he moves a no-confidence vote and it fails, Labour has already at its conference mandated that the party seek a second referendum. And given that there is no majority in parliament for any currently envisaged version of Brexit, including no deal, it is entirely plausible that the current Brexit stasis could indeed be eventually “settled” by another referendum. So what would those who wish Britain to stay in the EU need to do differently to win it? Recent tracker polls have shown an increasing swing to remain, with the highest scores for “Britain was wrong to leave the EU” being recorded in the last two months. But the long-term trends show that few voters are switching (remain’s ranks are being swelled by new younger voters joining the electorate and their elders leaving it). If anything, positions may have hardened and polarised further.
JAN15	It’s not too late for Trump and Turkey to reach a compromise over Syria	Since last month’s announcement that the US will imminently withdraw its troops from Syria, President Trump has backtracked. The White House has declared that the withdrawal may yet take a number of months, amid a series of other contradictory remarks from senior American officials over whether the US plans to withdraw its troops entirely or to maintain some presence in eastern Syria. On Sunday Trump generated further confusion by declaring plans for a “safe zone” in Syria across the border with Turkey (without explaining who would enforce this zone, and where it would be located), even declaring that the US would “devastate Turkey economically” if it attacked Syria’s Kurds. A precipitous withdrawal would be indeed be bad news: it could pave the way for an Islamic State resurgence – the jihadist organisation is thought to still have 30,000 fighters at large in Syria and Iraq – as well as expanded Iranian influence.
JAN15	Do you think the Irish citizens' assembly on abortion was a good idea?	In 2018, Ireland voted in a referendum to legalise abortion. Irish politics had been debating this divisive and emotive issue for decades, however the Irish citizens’ assembly, which deliberated on the matter prior to the referendum, was cited as a successful process in helping people understand the complex issues. The citizens’ assembly was established in 2016 by parliament and its purpose was to deliberate on a number of issues, including the eighth amendment that outlawed abortion. The 99 citizen members of the assembly were selected to be electorally representative and included those in favour of the change, those against and those undecideds. Over the course of five weekends, between the end of 2016 and early 2017, the assembly listened to people on all sides of the abortion debate, including experts and those sharing their personal experiences.
JAN15	Why are we so obsessed with young, successful people like Sally Rooney?	When 27-year-old novelist Sally Rooney became the youngest-ever winner of the Costa Book Prize last week, it was to deafening cheers of critical acclaim that have characterised her brief career. Rooney has already been heralded as “the first great millennial novelist”, and a “Salinger for the Snapchat generation”. And these Snapchatting millennials have since been overwhelming booksellers in the rush to read their author, prompting shops to advertise that they still have copies of her novel, Normal People, in stock. Yet, for all her obvious talent, the fanfare around Rooney’s award made this millennial’s heart sink slightly. The slightly frenzied reaction to Rooney seems to be symptomatic of the way we now greet achievements by young people. Last year, another 27-year-old author, Daisy Johnson, became the youngest person to be shortlisted for the Man Booker prize for her debut novel, Everything Under. Likewise, some of 17-year-old Autumn de Forest’s expressionist paintings have been valued at $7m (£5.5m), poet Ocean Vuong was only 28 when he won the TS Eliot prize for his debut collection in 2017, and Christopher Paolini published the first of his bestselling Inheritance series when he was in his teens. It seems we increasingly celebrate youthfulness as a marker of success in and of itself; Teen Vogue’s 21 Under 21 list began in 2017. This year’s cohort includes 11-year-old designer Kheris Rogers and seven-year-old “activist” Havana Chapman-Edwards.
JAN15	A nation ‘bored of Brexit’ risks sleepwalking into disaster	Just before Christmas, I spent a day in Cowley, a working-class suburb of Oxford where a factory now owned by BMW manufactures that great British icon, the Mini. The plant closes its doors for an annual “maintenance period”, usually timed to coincide with local schools’ summer holidays. But this year, amid the company’s concerns about Britain’s future relationship with Europe, the shutdown will not only be longer than usual but is scheduled to begin the day after we formally leave the European Union – a decision taken, says the company, to “minimise the risk of any possible short-term parts supply disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit”. You might imagine the surrounding streets would be full of anxiety and urgency. But once BMW had declined my request to visit the factory and I had resigned myself to long hours spent vox-popping, I was not entirely surprised to find the complete opposite: questions about Brexit being met with an exasperated indifference, as if it were something in which people were barely interested.
JAN16	After this staggering defeat for May, our country is left lost and adrift	This was a defeat on a scale without precedent in the era of universal suffrage, a rebuff more humiliating than any endured even by Ramsay MacDonald in 1924. Some 118 Conservatives voted against the signature policy of their own party tonight, thereby triggering a motion of no confidence that, in any normal era, would see the government toppled within hours. But such are these extraordinary times, that is not even the most significant story from tonight. What matters more than the fate of this government or this prime minister is the fate of the country and its decision to leave the European Union, which is now suspended in a state of limbo if not purgatory. The law says Britain will leave the EU in 70-odd days. Yet tonight it has rejected the only firm exit path that exists. It means that, unless something changes and MPs can reach an agreement with each other, Britain will crash out of the EU on 29 March without a deal – an outcome all but the most wild-eyed Brexiteers regard as an economic and social catastrophe for these islands.
JAN16	The Guardian view on May’s Brexit deal: it’s over, but what’s next?	The overwhelming and decisive rejection by MPs of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement to leave the European Union is a shattering blow to the authority of the prime minister. She has spent two years negotiating a deal, which in substance was the opposite of what she said she wanted in public, only to see it repudiated by parliament. Her minority government has now been defeated on no fewer than 28 occasions. Britain is leaving the EU in weeks and Mrs May leads a cabinet that is hopelessly split, a party that is riven with disagreements and a country that is deeply divided. So emphatic is the Commons historic rebuff that Mrs May’s deal is finished. Mrs May lost by 230 votes – the greatest defeat of a government ever. The scale of the opposition means it is not credible Mrs May could bring the motion back to the Commons, modified with a few tweaks from Brussels, and hope for success a second time round. We do not have to settle for the Hobson’s choice of the May deal or no deal. The trouble is the Tory party is split between those who want a deal and those who do not. Mrs May has intensified the divisions within her party, rather than resolve them. She chose to start negotiations over Brexit not with the EU but with her own hardliners. The red lines Mrs May subsequently set made it impossible for her to get a deal that would bring her fractious party together, let alone reach out to her political opponents. Her agreement ended up shaped by Mrs May’s obsession with immigration and placating Brexit extremists. The result is a “blindfold Brexit” – where almost everything about the future relationship with Europe is up in the air for two more years. It required a leap of faith to place trust in a prime minister who, the Commons wisely decided, deserved very little.
JAN16	The fear that lies behind toxic masculinity	What strikes me most is the fragility. Gillette makes an advertisement calling on men to challenge abusive behaviour, and thousands furiously proclaim they will never use its products again. The American Psychological Association (APA) issues new clinical guidelines advising that a masculinity characterised by dominance, aggression and emotional repression can be harmful to men’s mental health, and the world’s conservative media falls into a collective faint. So much for the strong and silent types. If “real men”, according to the men’s rights movement, are tough and commanding, why are the exponents of this doctrine so easily discomposed? Why does the slightest challenge to the norms they proclaim – by a razor ad or an academic body they had probably never encountered before – trigger this frenzied testeria?
JAN16	Rod Liddle is wrong about the causes of black teenage deaths	They say don’t speak ill of the dead, and especially not of dead children. But it seems there is an exception to that rule when the subject is black and poor, and meets a violent death. In fact, certain rightwing commentators claim they are are doing us a special favour by suggesting that victims of violent crime, such as 14-year-old Jaden Moodie, are somewhat “gangsta”. Led by figures such as Rod Liddle, who among other things questioned why Jaden was out “at night” (6.30pm actually) and criticised his “fatuous gangsta moves”, these talking heads believe they are courageously owning the identification of a cultural problem: one about which the progressive voices in our society stay silent, for fear of being called racist or politically incorrect. Of course most violent crime is conducted by white people and the majority of stabbing victims in Britain are white. But as long as any black children are tragically dying on the streets, it is hugely important to debate the causes. The Liddles of this world posit two diagnoses for the problem of black youth violence: absent fathers, and the related claim that the black family is uniquely dysfunctional (and, more nebulously, “black culture”, which is perceived as flawed and nefarious). Yet in direct contrast to the rightwing commentators who exploit this problem to pursue their poisonous agendas, there are people who have been researching and writing about the “ecology” of violence in our cities for decades, making sense of what we are often told is “senseless”. They have found young people living in an “alternative cognitive landscape” in which you stab first and ask questions later; where distrust of the authorities and hostile strangers results in people – and especially young men – arming themselves and acting in aggressive and threatening ways in order to pre-empt attacks.
JAN16	Moaning is a crucial part of parenting. So give Duncan Jones a break	Among the great lies of our time are: the Brexit agreement will be “one of the easiest in human history”; “Mexico is going to pay for the wall”; “We tried to deliver your parcel but you weren’t in”; and “Nobody ever tells you how hard it is to be a parent”. The latest person to tell us how hard it is to be a parent is Duncan Jones, a filmmaker, father of two and the son of David Bowie. He “sparked debate” (AKA a social media pile-on) this week with a series of tweets about life with children aged two-and-a-half and nine months. “I’ll tell you something I never see anyone admit,” he wrote. “They are exhausting, frustrating and life-destabilizing. They are rarely fun. Sure, smiles are great, hugs are lovely, but it’s HARD & not obviously a good choice in life.”
JAN16	Donald Trump's fast food banquet – feeding the people Whoppers, as ever	It’s another day, and that means another slice of absurdity served up in Trump’s America, guys! Or in this particular case, slices of pizza. And some hamburgers and other assortments of fast food. This is the spread the president put on for the visiting Clemson University football team, who had won the College Football Playoff National Championship. Trump made sure to point out numerous times that he paid for the food out of his own pocket. Many federal employees are not being paid at all, given the ongoing government shutdown (now the longest ever), which is why the president had to order food in the first place, because catering staff are on furlough (which, again, he blamed on the Democrats).
JAN16	I’ve withdrawn my amendment so parliament can reject May’s failed deal	At 7pm this evening, we as MPs will be asked to take the single most important decision that any of us have faced during our time in parliament. The outcome will affect the future of our country, our economy and the lives of the people we represent. The Brexit referendum showed us to be divided, and those of us who campaigned for remain have to accept that we lost. But that does not mean that we have to agree to the deal the prime minister has brought back – a deal that satisfies no one.
JAN16	Gillette’s ad is not PC guff, Piers Morgan – look beyond the macho stereotype	What would the advertising industry do without Piers Morgan? Whenever they need a grumpy middle-aged man to be triggered, there he is, reliable as clockwork. He did it with Greggs’ vegan sausage roll, helping catapult their January marketing wheeze onto the front pages by complaining that it was a monstrosity. And he’s done it again with the new Gillette ad targeting toxic masculinity, which twists its familiar “the best a man can get” tagline to suggest that men can do a lot better than Harvey Weinstein and fighting in the street. It ends on a heroic note, with images of men in general and fathers in particular showing their sons a better way. But that didn’t stop Morgan dismissing it as “absurd virtue-signalling PC guff” that might drive him to get his razors elsewhere. “Let boys be damn boys. Let men be damn men,” he harrumphed on Twitter.
JAN16	A London DJ's punishment sheds light on Singapore's caning shame	Any day now, 29-year-old Ye Ming Yuen could be escorted out of his cell at Singapore’s Changi prison and whipped 24 times with a rattan cane. This comes on top of the 20-year sentence he’s already serving after being convicted of seven drug offences in a country that takes pride in its uncompromising approach when it comes to law-breaking. The story of Yuen, a former British public schoolboy and London DJ, has captured the attention of the British press, but he’s far from the only one awaiting caning. Judicial corporal punishment has been a long-time fixture in the south-east Asian city state. It was first introduced by British colonialists in the 19th century, but has been retained and even expanded by the post-independence government. Today, it’s applicable to more than 30 offences, from violent crimes like rape and robbery to nonviolent breaches of the law such as vandalism or overstaying one’s visa for over 90 days. Between January and October 2016, the courts handed down caning sentences to 1,257 people; 987 sentences were carried out in that time.
JAN16	Hate the Sopranos finale? You're not a real fan of the series	Let’s get one thing straight. Tony Soprano didn’t die at the end of The Sopranos. He sat down with his family, put Journey on a jukebox and chomped on some onion rings. Then the screen went black. What happened after that – whether Tony was assassinated by the bloke who walked into the toilet moments before the blackout, or if he lived and had to listen to Meadow discuss her terrible parallel parking – is an unknown and will always remain so. As it should do. At the end of last week, a book – released to coincide with the show’s 20th anniversary – made headlines for an interview with the series creator, David Chase, by the TV critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz. During the interview ,Chase referred to the final scene as the “death scene” and the “fatal scene”. That was enough for those who have trawled for an “answer” to what happened when the screen went black in June 2007 to start the ending engine up again. The Times dedicated a story to whether or not the issue of Tony Soprano’s fate had finally been put to bed. Of course, it hasn’t and isn’t. In 2014, the Vox writer Martha P Nochimson claimed Chase had told her that Tony wasn’t dead. Finally, there was an answer. Until Chase released a statement saying the story was untrue and that the “final scene of The Sopranos raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer”.
JAN17	It’s now or never for May. Time to compromise on Brexit	It is said that the past is a foreign country. But after the Brexit referendum, it is the present, not the past, where we do things differently. No government in British history has taken such a Commons beating as Theresa May suffered on Tuesday. Yet, 24 hours later, the selfsame MPs who had thrown out her UK-EU Brexit deal by 432 votes to 202 now handed her premiership a fresh lifeline. The 118 Conservative MPs who voted her policy down on Tuesday backed her on Wednesday, as though it were the most natural thing in the world to do. By voting by 325 to 306 that they still had confidence in May’s government, the House of Commons turned the ordinary meaning of words on their head. But this wasn’t a vote of confidence in any normal sense. It was a suboptimal tribal choice between a government led by May and one led by Jeremy Corbyn. It was a knockabout partisan diversion from the main national issue, which now resumes. The loss leaves Corbyn with fewer defences against Labour’s second-vote campaigners. But the victory also finds May still wedded to her defeated Brexit policy, and settled in for another year in Downing Street.
JAN17	Only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo	The pound rose, and all was calm on the stock market. As far as the financial markets were concerned, the message was clear: the voting down by MPs of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement means a delayed Brexit, a softer Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all. Those with serious wealth in Britain have always been worried that Brexit will lead to radical change. They now think that there will be a perpetuation of the status quo – or something not far removed from it. Hence the pound getting stronger. There’s no question that opting for the quiet life has its attractions. There would be a boost to the economy as companies decided to push ahead with investment plans that had been delayed while the outcome of Brexit was uncertain. And, of course, any economic costs of no deal would be avoided.
JAN17	Labour must pursue a better Brexit deal, not a second referendum	It is, perversely, a sign of the government’s weakness, not its strength, that it has inevitably seen off a vote of no confidence. All that unites a bitterly fractious Conservative party is panic at the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government coming to power in a general election, a likelihood many are admirably honest about. If Theresa May was confident about the Tories’ prospects, she would risk throwing the dice. But Labour started the last election campaign 24 percentage points behind the Tories in the polls, and ended two points behind six weeks later. Today, the polling average has Labour slightly ahead. Conservatives fear that a Corbyn-led administration would not be like a “normal” Labour government, and would upend an economic consensus established by Margaret Thatcher. And they would be right. The media will now attempt to shift the narrative, claiming that it is Labour under pressure. This is absurd. The government has just suffered the biggest parliamentary defeat in the history of British democracy. A disastrous near-decade of Tory rule has left Britain in its worst combined political and social crisis in modern times, the consequence of ideologically driven austerity and catastrophic political decisions by both David Cameron and May. Labour will be pilloried for not having a magical solution – when there is none – to a crisis engineered by its opponents.
JAN17	The Guardian view on Brexit and parliament: now dissolve the red lines	A Commons vote affirming confidence in Her Majesty’s government does not indicate that parliament trusts Theresa May. Her reprieve on Wednesday night, by a margin of 19, largely expresses Tory and DUP reluctance to risk a general election. Power is still flowing away from the prime minister. In 2017 voters deprived the Tories of a majority. Last December the government was found in contempt of parliament. One-third of Tory MPs have said they have no confidence in Mrs May as their party’s leader. On Tuesday, the prime minister’s Brexit deal was crushed in a Commons defeat greater than any recorded in the modern era. Mrs May’s authority has been stripped away; her credibility is gone. Every precedent guides her towards resignation. But not much about Brexit follows precedent.
JAN17	MPs alone won’t solve the Brexit deadlock. We need a citizens’ assembly	The Brexit process has become almost unspeakably awful. Like a foul smell that nobody really wants to deal with, without action it will only get worse. As party unity collapses in parliament, how we find consensus on the greatest issue of our time will determine what the outcome is – whether that turns out to be a second referendum or the next stage of negotiation. We believe the best path to such a consensus involves setting up a citizens’ assembly. Just like the Labour party, we represent contrasting communities that nevertheless have much in common. Wigan voted 60%-40% to leave the EU, Walthamstow 60%-40% to remain. One is a northern town fighting to regain the good jobs and dignity that were once commonplace. The other is an inner-city area fighting an epidemic of knife crime and the rise of gentrification. Separated by 200 miles, in both places people are angry, deeply affected by poverty and disempowered by a system that does not respond to their needs.
JAN17	Welcome to the Westminster apocalypse. Have you thought about theocracy instead?	The world’s most densely betwatted space at the best of times, Westminster became even more wantonly apocalyptic in the days and hours leading up to the historic defeat of Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Behold, a bell-tolling, haute remainer, yellow-vested, journalist-infested, shitbird-MP-crawling, flashmobbed performance art piece entitled: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THEOCRACY INSTEAD? If not, don’t rule it out. An awful lot of things are apparently back on the table after May’s flame-out, including – but not limited to – default no deal, extending article 50, a Norway-style arrangement, second referendum, and return to absolute monarchy, by either the Queen or David Attenborough.
JAN17	Arrogant remainers want a second vote. That would be a bad day for democracy	Remainers often argue as if they had a monopoly on what counts as reasonable and rational decision-making. Supporting the EU comes from the head whereas wishing to leave the EU comes from the heart, as the MP Rachel Reeves once put it. And yet, the attitude of some towards a second referendum is breathtakingly reckless and cavalier. Almost anything – as long as it brings us one step closer to the UK staying in the EU – is countenanced and justified. I remember one Cambridge lunch, on a day when cabinet ministers were resigning over Theresa May’s deal, in which a colleague told me he would cheer every time a new resignation was announced. The more chaotic the better, he said, because chaos makes shelving Brexit that much more likely.
JAN17	I took part in a citizens' assembly – it could help break the Brexit deadlock	In August 2016 there was a knock on my front door. A man from a polling company introduced himself – he was selecting people to take part in a national forum to discuss social issues in Ireland. One of the topics to be debated was our country’s strict abortion laws. I said yes, not entirely sure what I was signing up for. A week later there was a phone call to verify that I was on the register to vote, and then my place as one of the 100 members of the Citizens’ Assembly was confirmed. An explainer booklet came in the post along with an invitation to Dublin Castle for the inaugural meeting in October 2016.
JAN17	Theresa May needs to realise she can’t keep every Tory happy	The House of Commons has spoken but what has it actually said? A clear and resounding “no” to a complex deal the UK and the EU have spent nearly two years negotiating. And behind the emphatic no lies an unlikely coalition of hard Brexiteers, ardent remainers and those in between, collaborating to kick the deal – and the prime minister. Unfortunately, the kick was directionless.
JAN17	Cutting police homicide teams is the sure sign of a failing society	In August 1982, 17-year-old Yiannoulla Yianni was raped and murdered in her home while preparing food for her family. Thirty-four years later, in 2016, my former team at the Metropolitan police led an investigation that convicted her killer. After the trial, Yiannoulla’s brother, Rick, commented that the family never gave up hoping and were “truly grateful to the police for finally bringing him to justice”. Every murder cries out for justice. That’s why the Met never closes an unsolved homicide.
JAN18	Theresa May’s survival is just a Tory confidence trick	Back in 2017, when “strong and stable” was still a campaign slogan and not a laugh line, I sat in on a focus group of undecided voters in Harrow – home to two marginal seats in north-west London. Even then they didn’t like Theresa May much. Assuming she would be an effective negotiator, they appreciated her steeliness – the word “strong” came up twice, as did “Thatcher” and “clever”. But overall they found her unreliable and unrelatable. They described her, among other things, as a “liar”, “headmistress”, “busybody”, “uncaring” and “untrustworthy”. Comparing her to Jeremy Corbyn, one said: “He’d buy a round, Theresa wouldn’t.” When asked if they would trust her to look after their home while they were on holiday, the consensus was: “The house, yes. But not the pets.” This is Britain. If she can’t be trusted to get a round in or look after pets, I doubt May would have passed one of her own Home Office “British values” tests.
JAN18	On Saturday the UK turns remain. Parliament must force a second referendum	You could call it swing Saturday or crossover day, for this Saturday, 19 January, marks an important moment. This is the day, in theory, when the country turns remain. Even if not a single person has changed their mind since the referendum, the demographic shift alone will have done the heavy lifting. Enough old leavers will have died and enough young remainers will have come on to the electoral register to turn the dial on what the country thinks about Brexit. The psephologist and founding YouGov president, Peter Kellner, calculates that the leave vote has been declining by about 1,350 a day, taking into account the differential turnout: the young turn out to vote much less often than the old. By using exactly the same proportion of every age group turning out to vote exactly as they did in 2016, demographics alone will have transformed the UK into a remainer nation.
JAN18	Why did Tulip Siddiq have to vote in person? Cold Conservative calculation	Obscure parliamentary procedures are currently all the rage, from John Bercow’s controversial deviation from precedence in selecting amendments to business motions and the arcane voting procedure requiring MPs to physically go through division lobbies, or be “nodded through” (for which they still have to be on parliament grounds), for their vote to be counted. The decision by the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq to delay the caesarean birth of her second child to vote in the crucial Brexit debate on Tuesday night and the confidence vote on Wednesday night has reignited the debate over proxy voting – and reminded the country that the Conservatives have a fundamental problem with women. Despite parliament agreeing in principle last February to implement proxy voting, party whips have yet to facilitate a system for those MPs who most need it, mainly pregnant people and parents.
JAN18	Don’t rely on Germany to solve Brexit, it doesn’t need to help Britain	Remember when Boris Johnson was telling you that Germany would force the EU to accept almost any conditions for Brexit – basically, Britain having its cake and eating it, too – because “they need us more than we need them”? Didn’t happen. But, in desperate Brexit times the hope for a deus ex machina to solve the whole damn thing persists. Recently, there have been more suggestions that Angela Merkel will somehow rescue Theresa May by offering Britain a new and better deal. That isn’t going to happen either. Here’s why. First, back to Johnson. He argued that Germany wanted to export cars to Britain, so it would make sure that Britain and Europe had free access to each other’s markets no matter what. True, Britons bought 768,896 German cars in 2017, almost every fifth car Germany exported. But car exports to Britain were down by 3%, whereas exports to China and Japan were up by 11% and 14% respectively. May talks about “global Britain”, but Germany thinks globally, too, and in the scheme of things, Asia and the US are more important. And by the way, while British politicians were bickering about whether the country should belong to a customs union, which supposedly stops Britain from striking free trade deals with “global partners”, the EU signed a free trade agreement with Japan which should bring Germany export gains of €8.6bn a year.
JAN18	Only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo	The pound rose, and all was calm on the stock market. As far as the financial markets were concerned, the message was clear: the voting down by MPs of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement means a delayed Brexit, a softer Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all.

And, of course, any economic costs of no deal would be avoided.
JAN18	It’s not just the Fyre festival – this is the golden age of the social media con	The psychology of the con artist is such, say those who study them, that the very best fraudsters are able to sail through lie-detector tests because they don’t believe themselves to be lying. This fact came to light in Fyre Fraud, one of two documentaries released this week about the 2017 Fyre music festival, a fiasco that traumatised hundreds of social media influencers and for which organiser Billy McFarland is serving a six-year prison sentence. What’s fascinating about the story, as told in both the Netflix and Hulu shows, is how deeply McFarland tapped into the self-deception of his targets, and how the companies that enabled him continue to thrive. The art of the con feels like the great expression of our age and McFarland – a grifter who, as well as having the brainwave to put on a music festival in the Bahamas, ran a credit card company and sold fraudulent tickets to exclusive events – is the sort of vapid buffoon whose naked untrustworthiness is so undisguised as to make him seem almost transparent.
JAN18	A semi-Brexit, with just England and Wales leaving the EU, is the solution	When all solutions are bad, it’s time to reinvent the problem. Is it still possible to honour the initial Brexit referendum without crossing the EU’s red lines? Yes – through semi-Brexit. The UK is divided into four nations, two of which voted remain and two of which voted leave. The British government could honour those decisions and allow Scotland and Northern Ireland to remain in the EU as the successor state to the UK, while permitting England and Wales (if it still wants to) to exit.
JAN18	Labour must pursue a better Brexit deal, not a second referendum	It is, perversely, a sign of the government’s weakness, not its strength, that it has inevitably seen off a vote of no confidence. All that unites a bitterly fractious Conservative party is panic at the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government coming to power in a general election, a likelihood many are admirably honest about.

A disastrous near-decade of Tory rule has left Britain in its worst combined political and social crisis in modern times, the consequence of ideologically driven austerity and catastrophic political decisions by both David Cameron and May. Labour will be pilloried for not having a magical solution – when there is none – to a crisis engineered by its opponents.
JAN18	Amber Rudd’s denial of the benefits crisis takes political spin to a new level	Watching the government jostle to survive this week, I couldn’t help but think how “spin” – that frantic, Thick of It-type politics most associated with the Blair years – seems almost mild in today’s climate. In an era in which politicians can now offer “facts” that openly contradict reality, a “spin” barely seems to cover it. This was surely on Amber Rudd’s mind when taking over at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in November. There are few more toxic domestic briefs in government, not least because of universal credit. Her predecessor, Esther McVey, tried the direct route, simultaneously misleading parliament while accusing critics of peddling “fake news”.
JAN19	What we don’t talk about when we only talk about Brexit	One of Brexit’s more pernicious aspects, even before you get to its actual flaws, is its tendency to suck all available oxygen unto itself, to drain resources that might otherwise have gone elsewhere. Before the referendum, civil servants warned that such a task – untangling 40 years of legal agreements, ripping out a delicate web of connections that had become embedded – would consume all their energies. Naturally, their warnings were dismissed as Project Fear. But even the head of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, before he took on the form of Benedict Cumberbatch, conceded via Twitter that leaving the European Union would present the British state with the “hardest job since beating Nazis”. Just think of what else we could have done with all that time and money, including the £4bn we’re spending to guard against the entirely avoidable and self-inflicted calamity of a no-deal crash-out from the EU. The effort we could have made for jobs or housing, or to repair the damage inflicted by austerity; the work that could have been done to improve life for those left behind by three decades of change, globalisation and automation. But Whitehall didn’t have the bandwidth. Governments might be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, but walking while shooting yourself in both feet – that, it turns out, is impossible.
JAN19	How a Cotswolds river became a name that defined history	Sometime in 1983, a friendly chain of events not untypical of India took me to a shipping office in Kolkata, there to meet the nephew of an Anglo-Indian woman I had met quite casually a month or two earlier in Bihar. It was dusk. The office was in a large, gloomy building by the river. Unshaded bulbs shed a yellow light on walls decorated with calendars from companies that made ceiling fans and water pumps, but there was also a picture of a ship with a black and white funnel and a bow wave creasing a blue sea. “SS Nuddea” said the caption. Nuddea! It had been a big name in my childhood. My father had sailed on an earlier Nuddea owned by the same shipping line, the British-India Steam Navigation Company, and the family album had pictures of him aboard in his white tropical uniform. Not a very smart ship, one of the workaday N-class (Nerbudda, Nowshera) that tramped slowly to Australia and back; my father had wanted a berth on one of the bigger M-class (Madura, Modasa) that took passengers as well as cargo. Nevertheless, I had thought proudly of the Nuddea as “Daddy’s ship”, and never imagined that the name could represent anything beyond a cargo steamer built in Glasgow in 1919.
JAN19	Second referendum campaigners’ biggest problem? The ‘elitist’ tag	Short of being photographed skiing at Davos with Bono, nothing says “global elite” like trotting up the steps to your very own private plane. So no wonder Channel 4 pounced delightedly on the revelation that Nigel Farage recently chartered a private jet to reach Strasbourg, in an interview with the man himself that swiftly went viral. Who’s the man of the people now, eh?
JAN19	Theresa May will do anything for love, but she won’t do that, or that, or that …	For better or for worse, one of post-imperial Britain’s favoured methods of understanding itself has been through the prism of the royal family. We come together at royal weddings and jubilees, some like to say, while others do so in front of box sets of The Crown. Brexit, on the other hand, has long been a straight-up car metaphor. Cars are far and away the most popular way of understanding what might be happening to us. Remainers warn of “a car being driven off a cliff” or of Theresa May “running out of road”; Brexiteers talk of “taking the wheel” and “the open road”. Sensationally, these two streams have crossed (DON’T CROSS THE STREAMS!) in the matter of Prince Philip’s road accident. The crash – widely believed to have been orchestrated by Mohamed Al Fayed and MI6, though you won’t read that in the mainstream media – comes at a moment of high Brexit drama. And looking at HRH’s upturned vehicle, I wonder what its import can be, other than that certain things might be regarded as recklessly beyond the capabilities of our decrepit political system?
JAN19	Why are people cheering for no deal? Because they’re thinking about it the wrong way	There are moments in life when your heart sinks. I had one last night, right at the start of my terrifying debut on Question Time. Isabel Oakeshott had just said we should leave the EU with no deal. And the audience cheered. Not a subdued, start-of-the-evening, not-quite-warmed-up cheer. But a roar. A loud one. Shit, I thought. Do I dare point out the problems with this? Because there are problems aplenty. Metaphors matter. And Brexit has become a metaphorical cornucopia (if you see what I mean). Perhaps nowhere is this more true, and more damagingly and misleadingly so, than when it comes to the question of “no deal”.
JAN19	It was never about Europe. Brexit is Britain’s reckoning with itself	At least the Sun thrives on chaos. The savage parliamentary mauling of Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the European Union allowed Rupert Murdoch’s pet tabloid to unveil on Wednesday morning a front page of grandly gleeful malevolence. Under the headline Brextinct, it conjured a creepy chimera of Theresa May’s head pasted on to the body of a dodo. But the thing about such surreal pictures is that it is not easy to control their interpretation. From the outside, this one seemed to suggest much more than the immediately intended message that both May and her deal are politically dead. When, it prompted one to ask, did Brextinction really happen? Was this strange creature ever really alive or was it not always a grotesquely Photoshopped image of something else, a crisis of belonging that has attached itself to the wrong union? Do the events of this week point us, not towards the EU, but to the travails of a radically disunited kingdom? The dodo, after all, may be proverbially dead but it has a vivid afterlife in that great trawl of the English unconscious, Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. It is the Dodo, when various characters have fallen into a pool of tears, who suggests how they might dry themselves – the Caucus-race. “There was no ‘One, two, three, and away’, but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, ‘The race is over!’ and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, ‘But who has won?’”
JAN19	These Steiner ‘failures’ are really a failure of the free school agenda	Ofsted inspectors have found three of the UK’s four Steiner state schools “inadequate”, in reports that will be published this week. Their core concerns are believed to be safeguarding, bullying and a lack of support for children with special educational needs. A number of private Steiner schools have also been deemed inadequate. In a brilliant primer written in 2014, when free schools were still a jewel in the crown of the coalition government, the BBC journalist Chris Cook described the core controversies that might be thrown up by Steiner schools. At that point, and to this day, these are mainly private schools. In a way, the handful that opened on the state’s dollar were the apotheosis of Michael Gove’s promise to parents: if you want to replicate a private education, even at its very wackiest, and you have the energy, you have our blessing.
JAN19	‘Back in 2019, Britain was much larger’: what the history books will say	It’s always odd when politicians make an appeal to “the history books” – it’s like an actor making an appeal to reviewers midway through the film. But it took on a new surreal meaning on Monday, when Theresa May asked us to consider what the history books would say about the vote on her deal. It takes truly great commitment to your own mediocrity to sort through a catalogue of your own mistakes, find the largest and most avoidable, and then tell the gods of history that yep, this national humiliation is the way you want future generations to remember you. It’s like calling up the Oxford English Dictionary and requesting that “to cock something up irrevocably, to the point that people feel a pang of despair when they hear your name” be for ever known as “doing a Theresa”.
JAN19	Cate Blanchett’s S&M; play is just the shock that tepid theatre needs	If you love theatre and want to read a measured review of a play that you can go and see, stop right here. The play that I am talking about, Martin Crimp’s When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other, which I feel could be the title of much of what I have sat through in the theatre, is one you are unlikely to see either. It is at the National Theatre and is completely sold out. Tickets could only be obtained by public ballot. It stars Cate Blanchett, who is of course bloody wonderful, and is full of sex and violence. I am not a theatre buff (though I have been a film critic), but most of what I have seen in the theatre in the last 40 years has been mediocre beyond belief. I love Beckett and recently loved the Pinter revival. But what is so brilliant about Pinter is how much fear and menace he conjures just off stage. Every line a threat, every character is implicit in the horror. Its not in your face, it just gets in your head.
JAN19	The great thing about my coming out later in life? Nobody judged me	I first came out in my early 40s, following a destructive affair with a colleague. Coming out was not nearly as stressful as recovering from the affair, or the period surrounding it during which I questioned and eventually began to understand my sexuality. I had been married for 15 years to the father of my children, and the changes these realisations brought about were complicated and challenging to navigate. I had wondered about my sexuality after my second child was born (in my mid-30s) but due to the trauma of my brother’s suicide at around that time all my emotional energy was taken up with surviving, alongside parenting small children and depression. By the time I fell for the woman at work I had lost any remaining affection for my husband, and the chaos of an affair was a distraction from my emotional emptiness. I remember thinking, “Fuck it – I’ve got nothing left to lose,” and throwing myself headlong into the affair, ending my relationship with my husband within about a fortnight.
JAN20	Its compass smashed, the ghost ship Brexit sails into ever darker waters	The curse on the crew of the Flying Dutchman damned them to sail the seas for eternity with no hope of ever reaching port. It came to mind during the dark tempests in which parliament first dismasted the government by rejecting its Brexit deal and then voted to leave that same government afloat. In the hope of gathering some intelligence about how the captain of the Brexit ghost ship intends to navigate her way out of this hell, I turned to a senior and clever Tory who is a close shipmate of the prime minister. How will it end? Came his sagacious reply: “I haven’t got a fucking clue.” This much we do know. At 11pm on 29 March, one of three things must happen. Britain will crash out of the EU without a withdrawal agreement or a transition period. This will mean the overnight termination of decades of legal and trading agreements with both our continent and the rest of the world, an outcome that will deal severe reputational damage to this country and unleash disruption for which it is not at all prepared. Or Britain’s politicians will have to collectively confess that they cannot find a solution and seek to prolong or revoke the withdrawal process, damning us to sail on without landfall in sight unless this is accompanied by the promise of another referendum to resolve the deadlock. Or parliament will, very hard against the deadline, finally give its approval to something. This may not be a safe harbour, but the approval of a withdrawal agreement would be a port of sorts until the beginning of the next stage of the negotiations covering future relations.
JAN20	Cut tuition fees and you shut the door to poor students	Last week, universities in England were preparing reports on how they have diversified their student populations. These reports will be submitted to the director of fair access at the Office for Students. My university, King’s College London, will report, happily, that our undergraduate intake is now 77% state school, more than 52% ethnic minority and has the fastest growing population of low-income students in the Russell Group. And what has made all this progress and vital work possible? The very thing that many believe to be the enemy of educational opportunity – tuition fees.
JAN20	Council houses were once a glory of the public realm. Let’s return to those days	Build more council homes. Not so long ago, this idea was, although not new, radical. So thoroughly had Margaret Thatcher schooled the nation in the virtues of private property that, decades after her departure, it still seemed outlandish to mainstream politicians to go back to what had been the main way of addressing housing need. Now, as it has finally sunk in that the private sector cannot, will not and should not be expected to fill all the gaps in the supply of homes, even Conservative politicians are calling for local authorities to be given the powers to do so instead. However, whenever the case is made, it raises the obvious question, which is where to find the money. Everyone knows that housing is expensive. Everyone knows – or did, before it was found that national wealth can be frittered and forsworn in the great Brexit adventure – that the government has been in the grip of austerity for all of this decade. It’s a reasonable point.
JAN20	The Tories now treat the nation as they have long treated the poor	Brexit did not come from nowhere. The jerry-built utopianism, the indifference to and ignorance of how the British live and what they need to keep them safe, the know-nothing pride in ignorant generalisations and the cocksure love of sweeping solutions have their roots in the right that emerged a decade ago. Before the Brexiters wrecked the country, they wrecked the lives of the poor. Universal credit was the Conservatives’ fantasy when they took power 2010. Iain Duncan Smith offered a dream so seductive that even his natural critics could not find it in their hearts to condemn him unequivocally. His grand project would remove disincentives to work. It would simplify the complicated and create a benefits system that was “a doorway to real aspiration and achievement”.
JAN20	Here’s me and the Mona Lisa. Who says that art and selfies can’t mix?	So, there you are, having worked your way through a crowd denser than a Brexit negotiation, standing in front of your prize. The Mona Lisa in the Louvre. What do you do? Look more closely at that enigmatic smile? Wonder at the subtle gradations of light and shadow in Leonardo’s rendering of the face? Admire the illusion of depth? No, of course not. You turn your back on the painting, whip out your phone and take a selfie. And then you move on to your next prize.
JAN20	Why it sticks in the craw to see billionaire Trump ‘slumming it’	It comes to something when the perfect way to demonstrate wealth and status is by “slumming it” with junk food. First up, President Donald Trump. Finding himself without catering staff (oh, you know, the shutdown unpleasantness) for a visit from the Clemson University football team, Trump piled tables with his beloved takeaway burgers (various brands). Or, as he initially tweeted, “hamberders”, stinking and steaming away in polystyrene cartons, presumably, after so many hours, giving off the kind of whiff you’d associate with an unregulated abattoir in a heatwave.
JAN20	Jasmin Paris’s amazing feat gives new meaning to endurance	Last week, Jasmin Paris won the Montane Spine Race, for which the word “gruelling” seems horribly inadequate. Like Diana Nyad swimming from Cuba to Florida at the age of 64 or Serena Williams winning her 23rd grand slam, there are some feats of human endurance that scramble the mind and running 268 miles along the Pennine Way is one of them. But these triumphs go beyond personal victories. They should lift our collective spirit, because sometimes people are incredible and how wonderful it is to be reminded of that.
JAN20	What we don’t talk about when we only talk about Brexit	One of Brexit’s more pernicious aspects, even before you get to its actual flaws, is its tendency to suck all available oxygen unto itself, to drain resources that might otherwise have gone elsewhere. Before the referendum, civil servants warned that such a task – untangling 40 years of legal agreements, ripping out a delicate web of connections that had become embedded – would consume all their energies. Naturally, their warnings were dismissed as Project Fear. But even the head of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, before he took on the form of Benedict Cumberbatch, conceded via Twitter that leaving the European Union would present the British state with the “hardest job since beating Nazis”. Just think of what else we could have done with all that time and money, including the £4bn we’re spending to guard against the entirely avoidable and self-inflicted calamity of a no-deal crash-out from the EU. The effort we could have made for jobs or housing, or to repair the damage inflicted by austerity; the work that could have been done to improve life for those left behind by three decades of change, globalisation and automation. But Whitehall didn’t have the bandwidth. Governments might be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, but walking while shooting yourself in both feet – that, it turns out, is impossible.
JAN20	May I have a word about… Marcelo Bielsa	What a truly extraordinary week in the febrile world of the B-word. I refer not to the pustulant Bercow or the vexatious Brexit, but the Leeds United head coach, Marcelo Bielsa. If you missed this story, and I really can’t credit that your mind has been elsewhere, a brief recap. An official from the club was collared for spying on their opponents, Derby County, prompting a veritable deluge of outrage and opprobrium quite in keeping with an event that shook the noble game to its very foundations (feel free to add your own cataclysmic cliche).
JAN20	How a Cotswolds river became a name that defined history	Sometime in 1983, a friendly chain of events not untypical of India took me to a shipping office in Kolkata, there to meet the nephew of an Anglo-Indian woman I had met quite casually a month or two earlier in Bihar. It was dusk. The office was in a large, gloomy building by the river. Unshaded bulbs shed a yellow light on walls decorated with calendars from companies that made ceiling fans and water pumps, but there was also a picture of a ship with a black and white funnel and a bow wave creasing a blue sea. “SS Nuddea” said the caption. Nuddea! It had been a big name in my childhood. My father had sailed on an earlier Nuddea owned by the same shipping line, the British-India Steam Navigation Company, and the family album had pictures of him aboard in his white tropical uniform. Not a very smart ship, one of the workaday N-class (Nerbudda, Nowshera) that tramped slowly to Australia and back; my father had wanted a berth on one of the bigger M-class (Madura, Modasa) that took passengers as well as cargo. Nevertheless, I had thought proudly of the Nuddea as “Daddy’s ship”, and never imagined that the name could represent anything beyond a cargo steamer built in Glasgow in 1919.
JAN21	England’s rebel spirit is rising – and it wants a no-deal Brexit	In my innocence, I didn’t expect many people to be in a central Portsmouth Wetherspoons at 10.30am on a Friday morning. But there they all were, in their droves: passionate supporters of Brexit, there to hear the pub chain’s founder and chairman, Tim Martin, make the case for Britain leaving the EU with no deal. Martin has been on the road since November, with the aim of visiting at least 100 of his boozers. The day we crossed paths, he was traversing the south coast, moving on to Southampton and Weymouth: given that it has whetted the appetite of what remains of the country’s local press, drawn large crowds and shifted huge amounts of food and drink, the whole thing looks to have been an unlikely success. Martin’s case was unconvincing to the point of tedium: a half-argument that ignored what a no-deal Brexit would mean for British exports, and too blithely dismissed all those concerns about supply chains, and chaos at UK ports, let alone what a no-deal scenario would mean for the island of Ireland. But on the level of political sociology, the spectacle presented was compelling: the hardest of the Brexit hardcore, many of them on the pints and riled to snapping point before the speech even got going, and then taken into incandescence by the posse of local Liberal Democrats interrupting Martin’s speech at every turn.
JAN21	We can’t leave a no-deal decision in the hands of wiped-out Theresa May	It is nothing less than despicable that, when our opposition and our government can clearly see they need to work together to get us out of this Brexit chaos, they are refusing to do so. And that means Theresa May could quite conceivably allow Britain to exit the EU without a deal, without any serious plans in place, and without reference to parliament. To prevent a no-deal outcome requires MPs to proactively replace this legal default position with something else. If the court case I brought against the government over article 50 was about anything at all, it was about parliamentary sovereignty. That meant the will of the overwhelming majority of our MPs should prevail on the major issues of the day. It is their duty to represent their constituency, their party and the interests of the country. It is a tenet of representative democracy that MPs are not delegates for their constituents. This means that their decisions and actions are ultimately governed by putting the best interests of all their constituency before all else.
JAN21	Where are George Clooney and co now that Sudan needs them?	In 2017, a US law firm signed a contract with the Sudanese government, to assist in efforts to lift the economic sanctions that had been suffocating the country since 1997. Within weeks, George Clooney and John Prendergast, veteran activists for human rights in Sudan, wrote a letter in Time magazine, objecting to this. They asked rhetorically, did the law firm’s senior ranks, filled with ex-senators and congressmen, not know that president Omar al-Bashir’s regime had committed mass atrocities? That it was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Darfur? That it persecuted Christians? “The question of their firm working in the service of such a brutal and vile regime can only be answered by the simplest of terms,” they concluded. “Probably, they just don’t know.” The sanctions were lifted, but it made little difference. The world had forgotten Sudan and was in no rush to be reminded. All that was associated with the country, ticked off neatly in the Clooney/Prendergast letter, was unsavoury. So allow me to remind you. For the past four weeks, Sudan has been seized by a popular uprising on the part of a people that has been suffering under a brutal dictatorship for 30 years, and from the effects of the global human rights machine that cut them off from the world for 20.
JAN21	Opioids don’t work for chronic pain. So why do we still prescribe them?	One of the key principles you learn in medical school is that doctors should “do no harm”. But what should doctors do when our patients insist that we do things that we know are harmful? This is the dilemma that thousands of doctors face on a daily basis when tasked with helping patients with chronic pain. Pain is a universal human experience that alerts us to bodily harm. Most pain is transient and requires no specific intervention other than the passage of time. For more severe acute pain (pain that lasts hours, days or weeks) and cancer pain at the end of life, modern medicine has several very effective treatments – pills, injections and the like. But chronic pain (which persists for months or years) is a very different entity.
JAN21	It’s the defining issue of Brexit, but who understands Northern Ireland?	Have you ever visited Northern Ireland? You should go – it’s a fascinating place. In fact, if it were less fascinating – that is to say, less complicated – then the UK’s departure from the EU would have been easier. You have that to thank us, or resent us, for. Before you visit you should familiarise yourself with some of the basic geography. First of all, where is Northern Ireland? Obviously it’s in Ireland, but only in one version of Ireland. It is on the island of Ireland, but not in the political state legally named Ireland. So it’s in Britain? Not quite, it is not on the island of Britain but it is in the United Kingdom – the state often referred to as Britain. It can therefore be described as being in both Britain and Ireland, one politically and the other physically. But unpack that sentence further: it is not on the island of Britain or in the state of Ireland. It is neither and both at the same time.
JAN21	The lure of ancient Egypt is a way to revitalise faded industrial towns	Museums teach us to dream. Since the Victorian age it’s been Egyptian mummies – matched only by dinosaurs – that have captivated children. Being taken to see the mummies is a rite of passage, and one accessible across the country, not just to those in London who have the British Museum on their doorstep. But local authority culture budgets are being slashed, so how can regional arts institutions survive? What should they do about the pressure to return looted objects? And how do they show their relevance to modern audiences? I have been exploring the history of three northern Egyptian museums, which have four remarkable Victorian women at the heart of their story. For those looking for entries for one of those currently popular anthologies of plucky rebel ladies from history, they all fit the bill.
JAN21	A citizens’ assembly is now the only way to break the Brexit deadlock	Parliament must inflict a second defeat on the government – by voting next Tuesday to extend article 50 for a year. Not as a delaying tactic, but for a purpose: to enable a process of nationwide consultation and reflection. Key to this would be a series of citizens’ assemblies whose thinking would then lead to constructive reconsideration by parliament of our relations with Europe, including the option of a renegotiation followed by a referendum. The direct engagement of the British people is now essential in order to address the triple challenge of a government defying the sovereignty of parliament, an ever more divided country, and mounting distrust between parliament and people.
JAN21	How admirable that MPs want to amend Brexit. It won’t work	Constitutional folklore is notoriously unreliable. Liberal statesman John Bright, for instance, did not, as is so often claimed, declare in 1865 that the British legislature was “the mother of all parliaments”. That particular distinction he accorded to England. Likewise, and more importantly, it is not true that parliament is sovereign. That authority is vested in “the Queen-in-parliament”: which is to say, ministers of the Crown acting in tandem with the Commons and the Lords. The question, always, is where the balance between government and parliament lies. Since the second world war, the general trend has been towards the aggregation of power in the executive. In 1976, former lord high chancellor Lord Hailsham went as far as saying we live in an “elective dictatorship”. Tony Blair’s chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, spoke of the creation of a “Napoleonic” state. Yet last week’s historic defeat of Theresa May’s Brexit deal in the Commons was a milestone in a quiet counter-revolution. Ever since Iraq, parliament has assumed that it has a right of veto over any significant declaration of military hostilities; select committees, though still no match for their US counterparts, have flexed their muscles.
JAN21	There’s one thing that really puts me off veganism: Peta	I’ve been vegetarian for ages and have been considering going vegan. One reason I haven’t yet is pizza: vegan cheese is a crime against tastebuds. Another thing putting me off is Peta. The animal rights organisation seems to launch itself into the headlines every few months with an obnoxious advertising campaign that makes vegans look like pea-brains with whom no right-minded person would want to be associated. Peta’s latest act of tofu terrorism is a new ad centred around masculinity. “Traditional masculinity is DEAD,” it announces. “The secret to male sexual stamina is veggies.” It brought this thesis to life with a puerile video featuring men vigorously waving vegetable genitalia. Nothing has ever made me want to eat a carrot less. Or an aubergine. Congrats, Peta: you’ve put me off fruit and veg. I’m craving a hamberder, as I believe the meat-treats are called in the White House.
JAN22	Brexit is a mess – what would Yes Minister’s Sir Humphrey do?	“What is the function of the civil service? To help the government implement its policies. But with Brexit – the most important constitutional issue for decades – every cabinet minister has his or her own policy. Without a written constitution and with only norms, traditions and precedents to guide us, this unprecedented situation has made everyone in government into a headless chicken. “I was merely a humble vessel into which ministers, the people’s representatives, poured their thoughts and hopes. My job was to help turn this jumble into workable policies – no mean task. We were loyal to each government and each prime minister in turn, supporting their manifestos, their hopes and their dreams where practicable, whatever our private opinions.
JAN22	Only empathy can break the cycle of violence in Israel-Palestine	Empathy is all about imagining other minds, appreciating that different people have different perspectives, and responding to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion. After a career studying autism and the nature of empathy, I see empathy as one of our most valuable natural resources. It has particular promise as an approach to conflict resolution, one that has advantages over viewing a problem through a chiefly military, economic or legal lens. We can see this if we look at the Israel-Palestine conflict, where both communities have different views of the same historic period, both claim the same piece of land and both have valid emotional reactions to the conflict that must be acknowledged. I am not an expert in that dispute nor so naive to believe that there is a single, simple solution to it. But I do believe empathy can help.
JAN22	A year ago I was raped. Here’s what I have learned	On a grey autumn evening in London just over a year ago, I went out for drinks with a friend to celebrate a new job. Eight hours later I was raped by somebody I’d never met before. My assault happened in late 2017, when the #MeToo movement was still fresh and gaining momentum every day; I felt lucky for this. (Lucky in the way you might feel if you’d escaped a house fire, thinking you were alone, only to find that the people next door had escaped a house fire too.) In the state of shock that followed, which lasted for several months, I became obsessed with this new wave of feminism.
JAN22	Prince Philip’s crash should mark a turning point in our royal sycophancy	So much is made of the harm that sections of the British media have done to the royals over the years that it often completely overshadows the terrible harm the royals do to the media. For something strange and awful seems to come over the industry when tasked with covering the monarchy: it becomes servile, oddly pious, nerdily preoccupied with such things as the dates of building restorations and the royal protocol on tights. People are often mean about the BBC’s sycophantic royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, but his is a disease that infects anyone who touches his subject. First, and perhaps worst, is the fixation on detail, which serves to make the country look like deranged stalkers convinced their victims are sending them secret love signals through the curtains. Take the reaction to the car crash in which the Duke of Edinburgh wasn’t injured: there were artist’s impressions of Philip in its aftermath, “fact files” about the vehicle he was driving, stories about the Queen being (as usual) driven to church (in a different car) “just days” after the accident, and what it might have meant that Philip wasn’t with her.
JAN22	'Transparency and fairness': Irish readers on why the Citizens' Assembly worked	While the Brexit debacle rumbles ever on, several outcomes are on the table, including the possibility of a second referendum. Some, including this newspaper, have suggested that if a second referendum were to happen, a way forward could be for the UK to follow the model adopted by Ireland to try and break the stalemate over an emotive issue that had dogged its politics for decades: abortion. In 2016 Ireland’s Citizens’ Assembly was established by parliament to deliberate on a number of issues, including gay marriage and the eighth amendment that outlawed abortion. The 99 citizen members of the assembly were selected to be electorally representative and included people who were in favour of the change, some who were against and some who were undecided. The findings were published in a report at the end of 2017 and debated in parliament in 2018. Though the findings weren’t initially popular with the public, the result of last year’s referendum – 66.6% wanted to repeal the 8th amendment – was very close to the assembly’s 64% in favour of having no restrictions on termination in early pregnancy.
JAN22	If Russell Brand wants to change the world, he could try changing a few more nappies	I am way too woke to be part of the backlash against Russell Brand, which was sparked by an interview this weekend in which he talked about fatherhood. I’m so woke I was part of the frontlash. But you don’t really want to cross a man whose revolutionary consciousness involves legal letters – so all I can say is well done Swami Russ for reproducing – and reaching a higher state of evolution than I imagined possible. After all, it is certainly neither right nor sensible to prefer the womanising, drug-addled Essex thesaurus to his latest incarnation, but then I am not here to be right or sensible. His voyage towards sobriety may have helped many. He rewrote the 12-step programme in his book Recovery; married Katy Perry; told everyone not to vote in 2015 (before changing his mind); oh, and had sex four or five times a day. He was beloved by brocialists as he demanded revolution, but then he forgot how to be funny. He made the political YouTube series The Trews because the bad old MSM (mainstream media) was not to be trusted.
JAN22	We can’t leave a no-deal decision in the hands of wiped-out Theresa May	It is nothing less than despicable that, when our opposition and our government can clearly see they need to work together to get us out of this Brexit chaos, they are refusing to do so.

JAN22	Cancer in your 20s is terrifying – too many of us are left to cope alone	When I was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2013, aged 22, I was shocked to find out how little survival rates had improved among young people with cancer in recent decades. Research had left us “forgotten in the middle” between children and older adults, as one study put it, with improvements in outcomes among teens and twentysomethings lagging behind the dramatic advances seen among the general population. So the encouraging trends revealed by last week’s Teenage Cancer Trust (TCT) report, the first detailed analysis of 13- to 24-year-olds with cancer in the UK, are cause for celebration. Mortality rates for all cancers in the age group have fallen by almost a third, from 42.9 per million in 2001 to 32.3 per million in 2015. Five-year survival rates have risen by four percentage points (from 83% in females/80% males in 2001-05 to 87% females/84% males in the 2007-11 period).
JAN22	At last, the Elizabeth v Mary catfight trope of history is being reassessed	The argument that history is written by the winners depends on your definition of winning. Who “wins” in the struggle between Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots may seem obvious in the director Josie Rourke’s new film, with its opening scene of Mary’s execution on Elizabeth’s orders in February 1587. But in naming the film after Mary, Rourke and screenwriter Beau Willimon imply that although Elizabeth won the battle over her Scottish cousin, it was Mary who triumphed in the longer historical war of sympathy and affection. For the first time in this story’s cinematic history, the two female leads are directed by a woman who avoids the catfight trope and instead sees Elizabeth and Mary as potentially kindred spirits, whose antagonism is manufactured by their fearful and violent male lovers and counsellors.
JAN22	Opioids don't work for most people with chronic pain. So why do we still prescribe them?	One of the key principles you learn in medical school is that doctors should “do no harm”.

But chronic pain (which persists for months or years) is a very different entity.
JAN23	Panic is on the agenda at Davos – but it’s too little too late	Pity the poor billionaire, for today he feels a new and unsettling emotion: fear. The world order he once clung to is crumbling faster than the value of the pound. In its place, he frets, will come chaos. Remember this, as the plutocrats gather this week high above us in the ski resort of Davos: they are terrified. Whatever dog-eared platitudes they may recycle for the TV cameras, what grips them is the havoc far below. Just look at the new report from the summit organisers that begins by asking plaintively, “Is the world sleepwalking into a crisis?” In the accompanying survey of a thousand bosses, money men (because finance, like wealth, is still mainly a male thing) and other “Davos decision-makers”, nine out of 10 say they fear a trade war or other “economic confrontation between major powers”. Most confess to mounting anxieties about “populist and nativist agendas” and “public anger against elites”. As the cause of this political earthquake, they identify two shifting tectonic plates: climate change and “increasing polarisation of societies”.
JAN23	Young people look for meaning. But poetry doesn’t always offer clarity	Clarity is a murky word despite itself, sittingon the topsoil of reasons I’m supposedto embrace this odd alchemy / this wayof sharing thought / this beautifully bizarre approach to scattered words in some time strange shapes. I’m certain some feel different to me, certain many pick up poems and hope to see through them, but I have always searchedfor the opaque / always been dazzled by the haze of vagueness poetry seems toinspire. I’m scared like we all are – or all aren’t, which is perhaps even scarier –but a poem can be a kingdom inwhich blindfolded foresight makes perfect sense and the political and personal align like nowhere else. Perhaps it would be easy to label my attachment a modern phenomenon / attribute the groundswell of love towards volumes ofverse to the uniqueness of my peers / claim the rise in buying and reading pagesbound and bulbous with poems is a newresponse to recent chaos, but surely we poets know better. We know the world screams as loudly as it always has done, the young are the same as the young always are, poetry is a language we have spoken since we could speak, and most of usdon’t ask poetry for clarity, butfor an escape / for the chance to run far,far away from the unmistakable.
JAN23	We’ll never see a cross-party deal on Brexit: tribalism runs too deep	Imagination, agility, empathy, diplomacy – all the qualities of an effective negotiator that Theresa May lacks. She was unsuited to the task of getting a good deal in Brussels and now looks incapable of steering a bad deal through parliament. But the prime minister is not without skill. She has an exceptional ability to drain the drama from a crisis, to eke dullness out of an emergency. It is practically a superpower. Only May could make a live broadcast in a drastic breaking-news situation feel as missable as a daytime repeat. As one former Downing Street aide tells it, May has one political technique that she applies to every situation: “She just grinds you down.” It seemed inconceivable that May would try to rehabilitate her Brexit plan after it was rejected in the biggest Commons defeat for a sitting government in modern times. MPs on all sides cheered the deal’s annihilation, believing that the scale of the shock would jolt the prime minister into a change of course. It has not. May returned to parliament this week looking like an earthquake survivor unable to take in the magnitude of the devastation, pottering numbly around a ruined house, rehanging pictures on half-collapsed walls, perching ornaments on the rubble that was once a mantelpiece.
JAN23	Hasan Patel’s place at Eton will help break the vicious circle of privilege	When I picture an Etonian, a distinct image comes to mind. I think of a foppish, fair-haired boy, with a country house in one of the more fake-sounding “shires” (“Oh, you must visit our manor in Pompoushire”). I don’t imagine a boy like Hasan Patel. The 16-year-old’s background is seriously unconventional for a prospective Etonian. He grew up on a council estate in east London, sharing a two-bedroom flat with his parents and brothers. His father lived in “abject poverty” in India before moving to the UK. He has spent his young life fighting for change; last year he became the youngest person ever to speak at a political party conference.
JAN23	Women who allege abuse face terrifying libel threats. This is a disaster	Despite the various calls to reform the UK libel law to prevent “libel tourism” and prevent vexatious allegations designed to quash debate and freedom of expression, the door is open for wealthy men to use a range of legal mechanisms (such as superinjunctions and non-disclosure orders) as an effective way to shut women up. Imagine the following scenario: a woman is raped, and reports this to police, as well as disclosing to mutual friends. When the case is passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), it is decided that there is not enough evidence to bring charges, perhaps due to the culture of disbelief within the criminal justice system, or to avoid prosecuting what are considered to be “difficult cases”. The victim is subsequently issued with a terrifying threat of libel from the rapist. There is no legal aid to defend a libel action, and she has no money. She endures the hell of a trial, facing the man who raped her. If she loses, which she may well – bearing in mind the prejudicial attitudes and belief systems around women’s culpability, and the disproportionate media coverage about false allegations – she could be in financial ruin, and will have to pay not only the massive legal fees, but also substantive damages to her rapist.
JAN23	Can Emmanuel Macron’s ‘great national debate’ save his presidency?	Earlier this month, in an open letter to French citizens, President Emmanuel Macron suggested that introducing immigration quotas might help address the gilets jaunes crisis. This predictably made many on the left cringe. It also brought to mind a Hillary Clinton interview in the Guardian last year, in which she gave her views on the root cause of rightwing populism. “I think Europe needs to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame,” she said. Clinton argued that populists should be fought on their own ground and that liberal parties should develop a tougher line on immigration. With Europe just months away from an EU parliamentary election, the urgent task is to burst the bubbles we live in
JAN23	When is it time to call it a day? In this country, we have no idea	I still remember the frustration I felt as a teenager at the plethora of inconsistent rules that governed what I could and could not do, on the basis solely of my age: when I could vote, marry, drive a car or buy drinks. I am now reaching the stage in life when a whole new set of age-based cans and can’ts are starting to determine what I’m allowed to do. We are living longer, working longer and remaining active for longer. By 2040, nearly one in seven people living in Britain will be over 75. The Office for National Statistics figures show the number of people living to 90 and beyond has almost trebled in the past 30 years. But once you reach your 70s, you suddenly realise that life is full of anomalies, inconsistencies, prejudices and mixed messages. Isn’t it about time we examined these and worked to construct a more rational approach to later life?
JAN23	I was a natural cosmopolitan. Sweden, and the far right, changed all that	I was born in Turkey and am now based in Lund, on the southern tip of Sweden. Most of my life I’ve probably been the quintessential cosmopolitan, and proudly so. But I’ve also spent too many hours in the consulates and airports of various EU countries coveting a multiple-entry Schengen visa, or enduring the suspicious looks of customs officers, to believe that I could be a “citizen of nowhere” with a Turkish passport. My cosmopolitanism was more a moral ideal based on compassion, and did not preclude a yearning for belonging or roots. It simply defined them in a different way. I could have roots in many places, and I could nourish my need for belonging from a variety of sources.
JAN23	Katie Price is right. Disabled people shouldn’t be forced off the internet by abuse	What sort of person repeatedly picks on a disabled child in the most vicious and cruel of terms? The answer, of course, is the sort of people the model Katie Price had in mind when she started campaigning for online abuse to become a specific criminal offence. Price’s 15-year-old son Harvey – who is blind, autistic and has Prader-Willi syndrome – has been hideously mocked and taunted. His mother quickly gathered more than 220,000 supportive signatures for a petition demanding online abuse be treated as a hate crime, and now the parliamentary petitions committee has accepted her argument that the law isn’t fit for purpose – or to be precise a part of that argument. (Price’s petition referred not just to disability but to homophobia, racism and even body-shaming of women; the MPs were careful to single out disability alone, arguing in their report that they didn’t want to cut across the work of others on the rest.)
JAN23	Only empathy can break the cycle of violence in Israel-Palestine	Empathy is all about imagining other minds, appreciating that different people have different perspectives, and responding to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion. After a career studying autism and the nature of empathy, I see empathy as one of our most valuable natural resources. It has particular promise as an approach to conflict resolution, one that has advantages over viewing a problem through a chiefly military, economic or legal lens. We can see this if we look at the Israel-Palestine conflict, where both communities have different views of the same historic period, both claim the same piece of land and both have valid emotional reactions to the conflict that must be acknowledged. I am not an expert in that dispute nor so naive to believe that there is a single, simple solution to it. But I do believe empathy can help.
JAN24	Could this local experiment be the start of a national transformation?	If there is hope, it lies here, in the most deprived borough in London. Barking and Dagenham has shocking levels of unemployment, homelessness, teenage pregnancy, domestic violence and early death. Until 2010, it was the main stronghold of the British National party. Its population turns over at astonishing speed: every year, about 8% of residents move out. But over the past year it has started to become known for something else: as a global leader in taking back control. Since the second world war, councils and national governments have sought to change people’s lives from the top down. Their efforts, during the first 30 years of this period at least, were highly effective, creating public services, public housing and a social safety net that radically improved people’s lives.
JAN24	The only Brexit compromise I can see coming is a bad one	Brexit is a reminder that two connected things need to happen in order for a political compromise to stick. First, partisan leaders must decide that it is better than any other achievable outcome. Second, the public must also converge to give it their backing. One movement towards the treaty table without the other doesn’t cut it. The Northern Ireland peace process was a classic example of this dual process. It took many years before mutually antagonistic political leaders decided that a peace deal was better than an unwinnable war. But it took even longer for the two communities in Northern Ireland to begin to make the same move. The peace process only worked because the political deal was followed by referendums that endorsed it.
JAN24	Think another general election is unlikely? Think again	Could a general election be looming? It might seem unlikely. Last time Theresa May dissolved parliament, she had a 24-point lead and higher personal ratings than Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair in their pomp. Labour had suffered one of its worst postwar defeats just two years earlier. And yet the Conservatives lost their majority. This time round, Labour are ahead in several polls. Jeremy Corbyn’s team, though tired after their journey from the political wilderness to the epicentre of the greatest political upheaval since the war, will begin an election with far more experience than last time. As senior Conservative officials have pointed out to the Sun, 40 Tory seats are held by a margin of less than 5%, with Labour in second place in 35 of them. How would voters view the fourth national vote in five years (the fifth for Scottish voters)? Brenda from Bristol would be considerably more irate this time. Would Tory MPs really let May take their party into an election, just weeks after 117 of them voted against her leadership? Are they not uniquely fearful of a Corbyn government, which they rightly judge to be a totally different prospect to a “normal” Labour administration? And yet. May’s Brexit deal has suffered the biggest defeat in the history of British democracy. If she halved the margin of defeat in another vote, it would still find a place in the five worst parliamentary routs. How on earth is she supposed to turn a 230-vote deficit into a victory of at least one, in a matter of weeks? She won’t get a meaningful concession on the backstop from the EU: how will she get the DUP, all the hard Brexiteers of the Tory ERG and Tory remainers on side? Jacob Rees-Mogg is showing signs of surrender to May, but a hardcore would not follow him. If she is expecting mass Labour defections to back her deal, disappointment beckons. May is in an impossible situation of her own making.
JAN24	Wealthy Brexiteers like James Dyson are jumping ship. Why might that be?	Let’s give James Dyson the benefit of the doubt. Let’s take at face value the assurances issued by his multibillion pound company – whose products involve the generation of hot air – as to why it is relocating its headquarters from Wiltshire to Singapore. Apparently, it has “nothing to do with Brexit”. What’s more, it’s barely a move at all, since it will see only two people, both top executives, actually moving to Singapore. Dyson will continue to employ 4,000 people in the UK, many of them in research and development, and the relocation is really just about wanting to keep a closer eye on the firm’s investments in Asia. That it chose to do that in Singapore, where companies pay a mere 17% in tax – rather than, say, India or South Korea – is surely pure coincidence.
JAN24	Let us condemn the heresy of workspaces in churches	Walking through Camden Town in north London recently – a place whose countercultural relevance dwindled sometime between the Libertines’ first and second albums – I came across a building labelled WORK.LIFE, plus the slogan, “Because life’s too short”. It seemed to symbolise everything that the late cultural theorist Mark Fisher meant when he coined the phrase “boring dystopia”. WORK.LIFE is one of those hubs for freelancers, or “digital nomads” – a handy phrase if that green juice cleanse isn’t providing the quite the level of purging that your body desires. Don’t flush yet, though, there’s more: “Nestled in one of London’s most iconic postcodes, there’s plenty of creative spirit here as well as a punk-rock approach to business.”
JAN24	To those leaving Labour: if you want to stop Brexit, stay and fight	If some reports are to be believed, large numbers of Labour members are leaving the party because of its position on Brexit. The suggested figure of 150,000 people walking away is difficult to corroborate and has been strenuously rebutted by the party. But Labour’s resistance to backing a fresh referendum, despite the overwhelming view of its members, has undeniably prompted some to leave. Labour cannot afford to be blase about the size and morale of its membership. The maths is simple: to win a general election, Labour will have to pull off a ground campaign bigger than it did in 2017. Around three quarters of its members want a fresh referendum. If there is a chasm between the views of members and the strategy of the leadership on such a defining issue, Labour’s ground troops will be demoralised, and it will lose. This process will rot away at the Corbyn project, pushing thousands of new members into inactivity or into the arms of Labour’s old establishment.
JAN24	We’ll never see a cross-party deal on Brexit: tribalism runs too deep	Imagination, agility, empathy, diplomacy – all the qualities of an effective negotiator that Theresa May lacks. She was unsuited to the task of getting a good deal in Brussels and now looks incapable of steering a bad deal through parliament. But the prime minister is not without skill. She has an exceptional ability to drain the drama from a crisis, to eke dullness out of an emergency. It is practically a superpower. Only May could make a live broadcast in a drastic breaking-news situation feel as missable as a daytime repeat. As one former Downing Street aide tells it, May has one political technique that she applies to every situation: “She just grinds you down.” It seemed inconceivable that May would try to rehabilitate her Brexit plan after it was rejected in the biggest Commons defeat for a sitting government in modern times. MPs on all sides cheered the deal’s annihilation, believing that the scale of the shock would jolt the prime minister into a change of course. It has not. May returned to parliament this week looking like an earthquake survivor unable to take in the magnitude of the devastation, pottering numbly around a ruined house, rehanging pictures on half-collapsed walls, perching ornaments on the rubble that was once a mantelpiece.
JAN24	Medical advice on the pill was wrong for 60 years. How convenient to blame the pope	Earlier this month, updated guidelines from the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) indicated that the seven-day break commonly recommended in most contraceptive pill regimens has no health benefits. Under the new guidelines, people taking the pill are free to reduce or stop this pause, allowing them to skip their monthly bleeds. Understandably, these changes were widely reported by the media, with most reports suggesting an unusual explanation for the original recommendation of the hormone-free break. Speaking to the Telegraph, Professor John Guillebaud, of University College London, said: “The gynaecologist John Rock devised [the break] because he hoped that the pope would accept the pill and make it acceptable for Catholics to use. Rock thought if it did imitate the natural cycle then the pope would accept it.”
JAN24	For the EU to prosper, Britain must leave	Until recently I was a committed remainer and wedded to the belief that the best way out of this Brexit mess for the EU was simply to try to ensure it didn’t happen. But the events of the past month illustrate why there is, rightly, a growing mood in Brussels for a completely different outcome: for the EU to prosper, Britain must leave. The rationale is simple, Brexit is – either now or in the not-so-distant future – inevitable. That is because Britain continues to demand impossible conditions for its membership of the community-based, compromise-led, multinational organisation the modern EU represents. Even in trying to exit, Britain is still arguing about “red lines” of its own making. This approach would only amplify if it somehow ended up remaining a member.  Britain already enjoys a privileged position in the EU, much to the chagrin of many other member states. Opt-outs from the euro, the Schengen agreement on passport-free travel, the charter of fundamental rights and on any European legislation related to freedom, justice and security have all been negotiated by successive British prime ministers.
JAN24	Panic is on the agenda at Davos – but it’s too little too late	Pity the poor billionaire, for today he feels a new and unsettling emotion: fear. The world order he once clung to is crumbling faster than the value of the pound. In its place, he frets, will come chaos. Remember this, as the plutocrats gather this week high above us in the ski resort of Davos: they are terrified. Whatever dog-eared platitudes they may recycle for the TV cameras, what grips them is the havoc far below. Just look at the new report from the summit organisers that begins by asking plaintively, “Is the world sleepwalking into a crisis?” In the accompanying survey of a thousand bosses, money men (because finance, like wealth, is still mainly a male thing) and other “Davos decision-makers”, nine out of 10 say they fear a trade war or other “economic confrontation between major powers”. Most confess to mounting anxieties about “populist and nativist agendas” and “public anger against elites”. As the cause of this political earthquake, they identify two shifting tectonic plates: climate change and “increasing polarisation of societies”.
JAN25	Is there a ‘right’ way to deal with children who commit crimes?	How does an 11-year-old boy end up alone in a London police cell? Eleven years old, for heaven’s sake. That means either still in primary school, or at best in the nervous beginnings of secondary. Eleven still says muddy knees, flapping around in a blazer several sizes too big, and wanting a bedtime story – or at least it does for the parents of the lucky children. Life is not like that for every 11-year-old, however, and it is the unlucky ones who are perhaps most likely to end up in the bowels of a police station. His solicitor didn’t say what he was accused of doing, when she posted on Twitter earlier this week that “no child should be in a cell. Period.” Her point was that a custody suite is no place for a kid that small, no matter what they might have done. But the mind makes leaps, anyway. Children as young as nine have been found carrying knives. Gangs organising so-called “county lines” operations, running drugs from the inner city deep out into rural towns, have been known to recruit from primary schools.
JAN25	How the right tricked people into supporting rampant inequality	Why don’t people rebel? The wonder of decades of rising inequality across the west is how placidly people put up with it. UK wages are still below 2008 levels, and a growing sector of jobs are nasty: non-unionised, achingly hard, with workers treated worse, the boot on the employer’s foot despite low unemployment. You might call Brexit a kind of protest, but that can be overdone. The vote was swung largely by comfortable older Tory voters in the shires, led – or misled – by privileged ideologues. Those on the progressive left have been perplexed that rising social injustice hasn’t led to much sign of the oppressed rising up, either at the ballot box or through more physical acts of protest. New research out on Wednesday suggests some explanations – though these will be of precious little comfort. Looking at surveys across 23 western countries since the 1980s, Dr Jonathan Mijs of the London School of Economics International Inequalities Institute monitors how, as countries become less equal, attitudes of the majority shift in the wrong direction.
JAN25	What does Boris Johnson have to do to stop people giving him money?	In 2014, the comedy website Funny Or Die published a patriarchy-lampooning video called “10 hours of walking around New York City as a man”. The white male subject of said video walks around city streets, being complimented, high-fived and offered everything from jobs to Starbucks gift cards. By the end, he is being carried around on a makeshift throne by adoring passersby, dressed in a crown and sceptre, while his new subjects chant: “King! King! King!” Do you think that’s what Boris Johnson’s life is like? I ask because it emerged yesterday that our former foreign secretary was given a £10,000 donation by JCB before delivering a speech at the company’s headquarters – a speech that contained four mentions of the company, was given in front of a large JCB vehicle and was plastered across the news.
JAN25	Donald Trump’s ship of fools is heading for the rocks in Venezuela	Donald Trump’s implicit threat of direct US military intervention in Venezuela is a high-risk gamble that could backfire calamitously. By publicly and aggressively backing the opposition’s bid to supplant him, Trump has presented Nicolás Maduro, the country’s incumbent president, with a very personal, existential challenge. If Maduro reacts, as he has in the past, by using violence to suppress his opponents, or if he arrests US diplomats who ignore his order to leave the country, Trump may face a daunting choice between rapid escalation, including possibly sending in US forces, and a humiliating climbdown.
JAN25	Clooney and Prendergast: We're not silent on Sudan – we're going after the regime's loot	“Where are George Clooney and co now that Sudan needs them?” asked an Opinion article in the Guardian this week. The oped assumed that a lack of public statements by us and others with a long association with Darfur, Sudan more broadly, and South Sudan meant that we were doing nothing in response to the Sudanese regime’s brutal crackdown of escalating protests throughout the country. This is indeed a critical moment in Sudan’s fraught history. The people of Sudan are rightly leading demands for change, and we believe our role is to support the cause of human rights for Sudanese people by using strategic and tactical advocacy in Europe, the US, and Africa focused on key points of leverage. As the demonstrations have unfolded this past month, our entire team has continuously engaged officials in governments around the world to take measures to hold the Bashir regime accountable. Much of this advocacy is not done in public.
JAN25	He may dress up as a firefighter. But Matteo Salvini is no saviour	A few weeks ago Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and leader of Italy’s far-right League party, conducted a press conference wearing the full uniform of Italy’s fire and rescue helicopter crew. More recently he wore a jacket belonging to the country’s mountain rescue unit, another time a firefighter’s uniform. Images of him in a police jacket are plastered all over his Instagram account – he’s frequently sighted wearing this outfit at political rallies. Clearly Salvini is not a policeman, a firefighter or a member of Italy’s mountain rescue crew. Saturating his social media feeds with pictures of him in these costumes is part of an elaborate ploy. Nicknamed “the captain” by his supporters, this wardrobe projects the vision of powerful leadership his fans crave. When he started out, it’s worth noting, Salvini resisted the more traditional outfits of political life, wearing sweaters and hoodies rather than suits to such an extent that his opponents dubbed him Felpetta (a twist on the Italian term for sweater – felpa), or even Felpetta Nera – a play on the infamous Italian fascist anthem Faccetta Nera.
JAN25	Could this local experiment be the start of a national transformation?	If there is hope, it lies here, in the most deprived borough in London. Barking and Dagenham has shocking levels of unemployment, homelessness, teenage pregnancy, domestic violence and early death. Until 2010, it was the main stronghold of the British National party. Its population turns over at astonishing speed: every year, about 8% of residents move out.

JAN25	The Brexit nightmare is entirely the Tories' fault. Don't blame Labour	There isn’t much that’s funny about Brexit. At least, not funny ha-ha. But there is one aspect of it that is at least curious: that this act of national foot-shooting has resulted in quite so many people putting the blame for it on the two main political parties – even though only one of them has been in power since 2010. Scroll through the comments or tweets on any story about Brexit and the online rage from remainers splits evenly. “I’ll never vote Labour again if they facilitate Brexit in any form” is a fairly representative comment, as is the idea that “supporting Labour means Brexit catastrophe”. When I tweeted an observation on this, I was told: “Both parties own this mess”, that “there are those of us who will never vote Tory, but also never vote Labour because they have enabled the whole thing”, and that the “main parties” were uncaring about voters thoughts on the EU.
JAN25	Nancy Pelosi is an alien species to Trump – and he has no idea what to do	Donald Trump might be the worst president in American history, but with his incompetence, belligerence and intellectual deficits come a perverse advantage: it’s tough to shame someone who has no shame; it’s hard to hold a man accountable for a lie when he doesn’t care if he’s a liar; you can’t chasten someone for breaking the rules when he never believed the rules applied to him. But while Trump has snaked and slithered his way in and out of scandal, corruption and self-dealing his entire life, there’s one force that seems to truly destabilize him: a competent woman. Which is why, in the Trump era, there’s no better speaker of the House than Nancy Pelosi.
JAN26	Diana Athill’s story was remarkable, and its end serene	Diana Athill had lots of confidence. She understood the social class she came from and could stand outside it, looking in, whenever she chose. As she wrote in Stet, her memoir of her years in the publishing trade, she was a member of a caste: “one of the London-dwelling, university-educated, upper-middle-class English people who took over publishing towards the end of the 19th century from the booksellers who used to run it ?. But she was also a white woman who had several black lovers in an age when that kind of relationship could be seen as a political statement; and she despised the “self-consciously beautiful writing ? of the “quintessentially caste writer ? Virginia Woolf. To her, “caste standards – it ought not to need saying – have no right to be considered sacrosanct ?. Her confidence helped her to be a writer, of course – it stands somewhere between “talent ? and “connection ? in the list of useful attributes – but it made her a fine editor, too. She was clear in her judgments and certain in her encouragement. We first met in the early 1980s, when a book I was allegedly writing for her publishing firm, André Deutsch, had long passed its delivery date. I took the work-in-no-progress to the office, where Diana read some of the first chapter aloud with such elegant enunciation that I was almost (though not quite) persuaded to carry on with the rest. At that time I didn’t know she’d been a writer, but then I read her two books of memoir, Instead of a Letter and After a Funeral, and was struck, as many others have been, by her frankness and clarity and the wonderful rhythm of her prose.
JAN26	The ‘will of the people’ on Brexit was not fixed for all time in June 2016	They have only one argument left. Back in the spring of 2016, the Brexiteers were promising sunshine and riches, untrammelled sovereignty and £350m a week: all the ice-cream of EU membership and none of the spinach. We would head out into the world and recover our destiny as a global trading nation, with more money in our pockets and independence in our hearts. You don’t hear much of that kind of talk these days, not when Airbus warns it could pull out of the UK – taking its 125,000 direct and indirect jobs with it – Sony relocates its European HQ from London to Amsterdam, and the carmaker Bentley says baldly: “It’s Brexit that’s the killer.” Instead the pro-leave case now boils down to one argument: it may be rough – “We won’t be able to get certain foods like bananas or tomatoes,” in the words of one senior Brexiteer, confident our Blitz spirit will get us through the coming storm – but we have to do it. We have no choice. It is the will of the people, and that will must be done. Theresa May is the most dogged exponent of this view. A remainer in 2016, she cannot bring herself to make a positive case for Brexit. Instead, she repeats over and over that we are compelled to leave because that is what the British people voted for. Any deviation would be a betrayal. We are a man taking off his socks, bracing himself to walk barefoot across hot coals – for no better reason than he promised he would.
JAN26	Rees-Mogg plays his queen as Brexit enters a state of emergency	Although he failed to emerge from an Airbus waving it, MP Mark Francois had in his hand a piece of paper. “My father, Reginald Francois, was a D-day veteran,” he thundered to the news cameras on Friday, shortly before ripping up the aforementioned document. “He never submitted to bullying by any German. Neither will his son.” Leaving aside the somewhat bathetic description of Rommel’s Atlantic Wall defences as “bullying”, can you guess what Mark’s piece of paper actually was? Certification of a history doctorate? (He amusingly already holds an MA in war studies.) A letter from his future self reading simply “Don’t be a thermonuclear dick, Mark – it ends badly”?
JAN26	Fake-history films like Vice and The Uncivil War are the new threat to truth	Is this the death of journalism – or just of history? This week sees the screening of Vice, a biopic of George W Bush’s vice-president, Dick Cheney, who is presented as the evil genius behind the Iraq war, torture and other misdemeanours. Its maker, Adam McKay, makes no bones about wishing to nail the misdeeds of a man “about to sail over the horizon”. His star, Christian Bale, even “thanked Satan for giving me inspiration to play the role”. Vice follows hard on the heels of the British dramatist James Graham’s Brexit: The Uncivil War, for Channel 4. That set out to reveal the truth about Brexit, with Benedict Cumberbatch as Dominic Cummings, the eccentric fixer behind the Vote Leave campaign. Graham declared a desire “to make sense of how the fault lines began … to do what journalism cannot do.”
JAN26	Ban school league tables. They’re not just misleading, they’re harmful	Yet another piece of academic research has been produced which shows grammar school performance in school league tables is not quite what it seems. You have to wonder how many more publicly funded research projects undertaken by leading academics it will require before such findings are taken seriously. This latest research, conducted by Bristol University, reveals what campaigners against academic selection and grammar schools have long argued: when social and economic factors are taken into consideration, grammar school performance is no better than any other school. It is a point also made by Stephen Gorard and Nadia Siddiqui of Durham University in their exhaustive analysis of pupil data published a few months ago. The reason grammar schools do well in league tables is because they select high attaining children who perform well in public exams. This fact is so obvious that any 10-year-old sitting the 11-plus exam would get it.
JAN26	Anti-vaxxers are thriving – because we live in a fact-phobic wild west	Half of all parents have seen anti-vaccination messages on social media, according to a report from the Royal Society for Public Health. It’s not all bad news: 90% of parents still have the sense to get their children vaccinated, whatever they read, just as almost all Mumsnet users stay in secure family units rather than moving to all-female communes, despite the proliferation of fake news on the site about what husbands are like. Yet, of course, this is serious: measles – upon which the anti-vaxxer conspiracy so often alights – requires 90-95% of the population to be immune in order for the inoculation to hold. This is only true of contagious diseases. If the anti-vaxxers concentrated on spreading nonsense about the tetanus jab, they would do no harm to anyone but themselves and their own children. But where would be the fun in that? They have surprisingly little to say on this soil-transmitted disease.
JAN26	Fight for Europe – or the wreckers will destroy it	The idea of Europe is in peril. From all sides there are criticisms, insults and desertions from the cause.
JAN26	London’s exploited tenants deserve proper rights – not just rent controls	When Anabel and her flatmates were told the rent in their Kentish Town houseshare was due to increase by £400 a month, all of them had to find a new place to live. In the space of just a few years, increases by Ghazal’s landlord left her paying 80% of her wages on her Forest Gate accommodation, on a monthly rent bill that jumped from £700 to £1,300. Kenny’s Clapton landlord is currently trying to up the rent from £2,000 to £2,400 on the three bedroom ex-council flat he shares with three others, just two years after a previous 20% hike. Renters in London struggle every month to make ends meet, spending the bulk of earnings to live in what’s often cramped, insecure and poor quality housing. Our rents rise faster than our wages, and we rarely get much choice over where we’re able to live. In Newham, some of the members of our London Renters Union spend 80% of their monthly income on housing, with little left for basics like food and clothing. Without big changes, many of us will be stuck paying rising monthly rents until we retire.
JAN26	Zimbabwe dared to hope. Then the military arrived	Like the fleeting blossom of Jacaranda trees in spring, faith in the government of Zimbabwe’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has waned, following another round of state violence towards unarmed citizens. A Harare woman wounded in the leg by a close-range gunshot from a soldier’s gun is ferried in a wheelbarrow to seek medical help. Elsewhere in the capital, a young footballer is killed for standing outside his home – his sole crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. These days, on the streets of Harare, an unnatural silence and fear have displaced the wild cheers of celebration that accompanied the 2017 resignation of Robert Mugabe as president. Hope has turned into mourning in cities around the country, where a general strike opposing Mnangagwa’s 150% fuel price hike turned bloody. At least 12 unarmed civilians have been killed and hundreds injured in a brutal crackdown led by the military.
JAN26	Britain is doing socialism for the rich again – this time for oil and gas	The “free market” is a creed that stirs up near religious devotion among its believers. It is in fact a con, a myth, a great deception. Take the latest striking example: according to the National Audit Office, British taxpayers are expected to cough up £24bn for tax relief given to oil and gas corporations, for the removal of North Sea wells, rigs and pipelines. Better start saving up, because if the companies suddenly go under, that bill will only increase. Indeed, some companies have already defaulted on the costs of decommissioning, leaving you and I to pay millions of pounds. Many questions arise here. While Britain’s Tory government frittered away its North Sea oil wealth, Norway invested the proceeds into a sovereign wealth fund which is now worth $1tn. We could have saved up the wealth to invest in the country’s future – what a tragic waste. It is also a damning indictment that we are splashing out on tax breaks for big oil rather than properly investing in tackling the existential crisis of climate change, and in doing so, creating vast numbers of jobs in renewable energy as Germany has done.
JAN27	No longer recognise your country? Look beyond our toxic public life...	When I was just starting out as a screenwriter, I was asked to go to Oslo to interview the great explorer Thor Heyerdahl. It was the most glamorous and thrilling thing I’d ever been asked to do. My daughter worried that if I was going far away on a plane I might not get back in time for her class assembly. I told her not to worry. Hopping on a plane to do lunch with global icons was what I did now. I might have noticed something was up the moment someone pointed out that I was in their seat. I just moved up. If I hadn’t been feeling so entitled I might have started to worry when the surprisingly extravagant in-flight meal was served. I just thought I was worth it. It wasn’t until I finished reading my book that I noticed that the two-hour flight was taking a long time. And covering a lot of ocean.
JAN27	Britons don’t grasp the EU’s essential motivation – a quest for the quiet life	What does the EU want? This simple question has foxed Brits throughout the Brexit talks. It is alleged that Brussels is desperate to retain Britain; that it yearns to get rid of it; that German car-makers and friendly states such as the Netherlands will force Angela Merkel to let Britain cherrypick the best of membership; that Europeans want to ruin Britain, sending it on its way with a punishment beating pour encourager les autres. None of this contradictory speculation has turned out to be right, and Britain’s negotiating efforts have been the poorer for it. European mainlanders can be hard to read. The Friday before last, prominent Germans including Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s heir presumptive, wrote a saccharine letter to the Times urging Britain to stay. On Monday the Polish foreign minister broke EU ranks to suggest that the Irish backstop be limited, to get Theresa May’s deal over the line. Yet on Wednesday Merkel seemingly contradicted her own colleagues, opining fatalistically that Britain, an island, had always had “patchy” relations with the EU and suggesting that its exit is inevitable. The day after, an exasperated Emmanuel Macron told a crowd near Lyon that Brexit has “torn British society apart” and “cannot be delivered”, his tone so critical that it moved a Spectator writer to ask why the French president “hates Britain so much”. The motivations and instincts of our continental partners sometimes baffle us Brits.
JAN27	Corrupt Maduro has broken his country. Now, democracy must have its day	Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro’s dwindling band of foreign supporters like to claim, is a theatre in a new cold war. Donald Trump’s administration and his hawkish foreign policy advisers, with their occasional threats of military intervention, provide the perfect props. So does Jair Bolsonaro, the new far-right president in Brazil. But the real contest in Venezuela is between democracy and dictatorship. Maduro leads a corrupt authoritarian regime that has stolen and broken a once-prosperous country, staging a coup against its own constitution. On Saturday 12 January, a power cut at the University Hospital in Caracas caused the deaths of six patients, according to a union representative. It was not an isolated incident: in the two months from mid-November, 40 hospitals in Venezuela monitored by a local doctors group suffered power cuts lasting an average of three hours a day. But the deaths at the University Hospital were a particular embarrassment to Maduro, Venezuela’s ruler since 2013. Highlighting his country’s descent into criminal public mismanagement, they happened just after he was inaugurated for a second six-year term as president, in a sparsely attended ceremony at the supreme court and not the national assembly, as the constitution requires.
JAN27	What’s a chap to do if he can’t be beastly to the Germans?	Mark Francois has made himself into the most famous ex-TA lieutenant since Gareth Keenan in The Office by insisting on tearing up a letter he happened to have on him when the BBC was trying to ask him about something else. The letter came from the chief executive of a vast and successful company, formed in 1967 as a government initiative between the UK, France and West Germany and which employs more than 14,000 skilled people in this country. Its boss was pointing out that just because factories are based in the UK now, that doesn’t mean they will stay here if we decide to leave the largest free trade bloc on Earth. Well and good, you might think. Sound, free-market common sense, with which James Dyson would smile and agree (although not with the cameras running). But Francois’s eagle infantryman’s eye had spotted a gap in the Brexit enemy’s defences and a chance to become memorable, live on TV. You see, the current CEO of Airbus isn’t just a businessman pointing out economic problems. He is also a square-headed, jackbooted, scar-faced, sausage-noshing, Sieg-Heiling swab! Cripes, Lt Francois, sir, we ain’t gonna let the likes of ’im shove us around, are we?!
JAN27	As awards season kicks off, how can we tell who are the real good guys?	Awards season is upon us – first the Golden Globes and now Oscar nominations – and it has struck me just how odd it is that these Hollywood functions have come to be connected to #MeToo and Time’s Up. Was there ever an industry so comically unsuited to driving an equality movement? Take the struggles of the Academy to catch up with the times, one year in. The day after it selected Bohemian Rhapsody as a nominee for best picture (reviews had been scathing, but it did after all feature Aids and a bisexual storyline), multiple allegations of sexual assault emerged against its director, Bryan Singer. Singer denied the accusations, but they had not come out of the blue: rumours of sexual misconduct had followed him for some years.
JAN27	Brexiters never had a real exit plan. No wonder they avoided the issue	The secret history of modern Britain is made in obscure corners between men and women taken seriously by no one but themselves. A good time to begin it would be in the winter of 2013/14 when the Institute of Economic Affairs, a rightist outfit that won’t reveal where its money comes from, offered a €100,000 prize to whoever could devise a means of leaving the European Union. The reason why politicians are now stumbling towards disaster like prisoners marching to the scaffold ought to have been clear from that moment. Obviously, Britain can leave the EU, but only if it is willing to pay an extortionate price. Yet first the institute’s judges, led by Nigel Lawson and Gisela Stuart, then the Leave campaigns of Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Dominic Cummings and, finally, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, who even now cannot speak plainly, have refused to acknowledge the harsh truth.
JAN27	The academy revolution has swept England. It has left casualties in its wake	Walk into a school and some things will strike you right away. Is the atmosphere respectful and warm? How do children interact with their teachers? What sort of project work takes pride of place on the corridor walls? One thing that you can’t immediately tell from wandering from classroom to classroom is whether the school is an academy, run by a not-for-profit organisation independent of the local council, or a “maintained” school under local council oversight. When things are going well, parents may barely notice the difference. But when things are going badly, it matters and that’s why the extraordinary growth of academy schools has become one of the most hotly contested developments in education policy.
JAN27	Demography is not destiny. Politics should be about winning minds	Peter Kellner’s “crossover day” has caused some commotion. Last Saturday, according to the veteran pollster, Britain became a majority Remain nation through demographic changes alone. Kellner’s calculations suggested that in the period since the 2016 referendum, sufficient old folk (who largely voted Leave) had died and enough teenagers, overwhelmingly Remain, had reached voting age to have wiped out the majority for Brexit. Remainers seized on Kellner’s projections as ammunition for a second referendum. Critics (not all Leave supporters) condemned them as being, in the words of the Labour MP Caroline Flint, “unhelpful, ageist and divisive”. Whichever view one takes, the ruckus over “crossover day” reveals the way that political demography – the study of the relationship between population changes and political attitudes – has become increasingly central to public debate.
JAN27	This is no time to make political capital out of Alex Salmond’s arrest	It’s impossible to overstate the sense of shock that swept across Scotland when it was revealed what charges Alex Salmond is facing after his appearance on petition at Edinburgh sheriff court last Thursday. Scotland’s former first minister has been charged with two counts of attempted rape and multiple counts of sexual assault. He immediately said that he was “innocent of any criminality whatsoever” and would defend himself in court “to the utmost”. In Holyrood a little while later, Nicola Sturgeon cut a weary figure as she talked about how shocked “many people” would be at this news. Scotland is weeks away from being dragged out of the European Union against its overwhelmingly settled will, while even the most fervently rightwing publications have stopped pretending that all will be well across the nation following a possible no-deal Brexit. And yet this most profoundly damaging event will be submerged in terms of importance by the long list of very serious charges that Salmond must face. It’s highly unlikely that this case will be heard in court before another 12 months have elapsed.
JAN27	Who are you calling a diva? It’s just another way of damning women	It would seem that not only are high-profile lawsuits between celebrities and assistants becoming more common, increasingly they feature female stars. In 2013, Lady Gaga labelled her former personal assistant Jennifer O’Neill a “hood rat who is suing me for money she didn’t earn” in a case eventually settled out of court. Mariah Carey is suing Lianna Azarian for $3m, alleging that Azarian filmed her in order to blackmail her. Azarian is countersuing, alleging that Carey’s former manager, among other things, urinated on her while the singer watched (nice!). And so it goes on. Aside from lawsuits, the general rule seems to be that, somewhere along the line, the celebrity boss gets denounced for being a diva. It’s as though, when things go wrong, the power imbalance between employer and employee is redeployed as a powerful PR weapon.
JAN28	I believe in Tory values, but the party is becoming repellent	I have had it up to here with the Conservative party. Not, perhaps, an unusual sentiment to find expressed in the Guardian. But, as a centre-right columnist, I do not start from the proposition that all Tories are inherently evil champions of “neoliberalism” (whatever that means), intent on maximising suffering and despair. I don’t express this contempt for the party blithely or to prove a point. This is not an exercise in rhetoric. I mean it. By way of explanation: I used to edit the Spectator. I am proud to chair a centre-right thinktank, Bright Blue. I wrote a book about the Conservative-led coalition. And if you think that’s bad, I was one of the few people in the world who applauded aspects of Theresa May’s 2017 manifesto (that’s a really select club).
JAN28	If young women are dying of shame about their bodies, we need a rethink	God I miss pubic hair. During a recent bonding session with my teenager, we watched Carrie together. What is shocking now about the 1976 horror movie is not just how brilliant it is, – and brilliantly short – but also that opening shower scene. All that pubic hair on the teenage girls. “Where has it all gone?” I wondered, as my daughter shifted uncomfortably in her chair. I thought about it again reading about why so many young women are reluctant to have cervical smears. The latest statistics are alarming; the worst for 21 years. Only 71.4% of women in England who should be screened are getting tested. Between the ages of 25 and 49, women should have a smear test every three years, and currently only 69.1% do. Coverage is better for older women, with more than 76% showing up for screening. Robert Music, chief executive at Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said the figures were “highly frustrating and, coupled with rising cervical cancer diagnoses, an enormous worry”. Not to put too fine a point on it, cervical cancer kills. Yet, if it is detected early, most women are fine.
JAN28	Oscar-nominated Black Sheep is the bellwether of a merging media world	News last week that a Guardian-commissioned work has been nominated for an Oscar for best short documentary was an arresting reminder of the powerful effects of technology on media, and of the need to rethink some old frameworks. A 26-minute documentary from a UK-based newspaper is a contender at Hollywood’s annual Academy Awards – it’s as if a television network were in the running for a prestigious international literary prize. Congratulations to those who made Black Sheep, which tells a remarkable story of the distorting effects of racism.
JAN28	No longer recognise your country? Look beyond our toxic public life ...	When I was just starting out as a screenwriter, I was asked to go to Oslo to interview the great explorer Thor Heyerdahl. It was the most glamorous and thrilling thing I’d ever been asked to do. My daughter worried that if I was going far away on a plane I might not get back in time for her class assembly. I told her not to worry. Hopping on a plane to do lunch with global icons was what I did now. I might have noticed something was up the moment someone pointed out that I was in their seat. I just moved up. If I hadn’t been feeling so entitled I might have started to worry when the surprisingly extravagant in-flight meal was served. I just thought I was worth it. It wasn’t until I finished reading my book that I noticed that the two-hour flight was taking a long time. And covering a lot of ocean.
JAN28	Britons don’t grasp the EU’s essential motivation – a quest for the quiet life	What does the EU want? This simple question has foxed Brits throughout the Brexit talks. It is alleged that Brussels is desperate to retain Britain; that it yearns to get rid of it; that German car-makers and friendly states such as the Netherlands will force Angela Merkel to let Britain cherrypick the best of membership; that Europeans want to ruin Britain, sending it on its way with a punishment beating pour encourager les autres. None of this contradictory speculation has turned out to be right, and Britain’s negotiating efforts have been the poorer for it. European mainlanders can be hard to read. The Friday before last, prominent Germans including Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s heir presumptive, wrote a saccharine letter to the Times urging Britain to stay.

JAN29	Britannia rules the waves? After Brexit, it’ll be floundering	Never underestimate the Brexit romance, the tug for an island nation set in a silver sea unconquered for 10 centuries, proud of its insularity. The idea of the sea wrenches at British heartstrings: you can hear it when you listen to the language of the Brexit groundswell. Normandy landings, D-day pluck, empire, sailors – leave voters use this imagery, however far from the shore. Brexit leaders rub in that seafaring imagery but here’s the paradox: these buccaneers promoting free markets on the high seas are the same deregulators who have helped destroy British shipping.
JAN29	Labour councils and activists are at war. But it won’t stop austerity	Just because we stopped talking about austerity doesn’t mean it went away. The Centre for Cities published research this week on nearly a decade of Conservative fiscal tightening: councils have now lost 60p in every pound of funding they got from central government under Labour. Barnsley has suffered the greatest percentage cut in day-to-day spending on services, at 40%; Liverpool has had the deepest annual cuts per head, at £816. Three of the top five cities affected are in Yorkshire; there is a clear skew towards the north. A new funding formula explicitly redirects funds away from inner cities and towards the shires. This is far from new news: Simon Duffy, from the Centre for Welfare Reform, published an astonishing report in 2014 that detailed the cumulative effects of cuts to local authorities and to benefits. To be reliant on both local authority services and welfare over this period has meant suffering hardships that simply would not have been approved by any voter, had the consequences been spelled out in a manifesto. So the effect on local democracy sounds abstract, set against more concrete catastrophes such as that in adult social care. Yet there are lessons here, some harsh ones, if we’re ever going to get to the business of political renewal.
JAN29	France’s gilets jaunes used to cause chaos. Right now they’re just chaotic	The art of the street demo has a long and venerable tradition in France, but the era of the colour wars may be only just beginning. What started with guerrilla blockades of roundabouts by the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) in opposition to French president Emmanuel Macron’s new fuel tax has led to weekly marches in Paris and across France, some ending in violent stand-offs between protesters and the police. On Saturday, for “Act XI” (the rather portentous title given to the 11th protest) the yellow vests numbered 69,000 across France and 4,500 in Paris. Although down from the previous week, with 84,000 nationwide, the figures were higher than in December. The political wing is viewed with contempt by the gilets jaunes radicals, who remain devotees of a more grassroots style
JAN29	What I learned about Viktor Orbán on a road trip with my dad	Like many families, mine has been divided by politics in recent years. I am British; my dad has returned to his native Hungary. I work for the Guardian; he has become a supporter of Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán. It had become a festering sore. He loves talking politics, and resented the fact that he couldn’t discuss politics with me. I couldn’t talk about it, because I resented his politics. So we decided to go on a road trip together. We’d spend seven days in a car, travelling across Hungary and its political spectrum to have it all out. What could possibly go wrong?
JAN29	A second Brexit referendum would not benefit the EU	When the prime minister’s Brexit deal received its crushing defeat in parliament, European council president Donald Tusk tweeted: “If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?” This wasn’t the first time that Tusk has suggested the UK could remain in the EU. After the 2017 general election, Tusk discussed reversing Brexit. He said: “The European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible”, and then quoted John Lennon’s Imagine, adding, “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I am not the only one.” But is the EU serious about this? Have Brussels and member states really thought things through? If a new remain campaign focused on the benefits of EU membership, a new vote to leave would be a definitive rejection
JAN29	Stop ‘fighting’ cancer, and start treating it like any other illness	Do you have a cancer? Or are you “a brave hero fighting against the demon foe”? Have you something in your body that needs removing, or are you a heroic victim in a war you may “win or lose”? A poll by Macmillan Cancer Support has found that many people with cancer are fed up with the language of war. They want to be treated like anyone else who is ill. They want to discuss their treatment with a doctor. It is as simple as that. Anyone with experience of a cancer knows well the lugubrious looks you get. You poor thing. We are so sorry. How long have “they” given you? Be brave. Be positive. Fight back. Don’t give in and “lose”. It suggests you lacked courage and were “beaten”.
JAN29	The way we eat is killing us – and the planet	The distinguished medical journal The Lancet has issued not one but two apocalyptic warnings about our food in under a month. One of its special commissions reported earlier this month that civilisation itself was at risk from the effects of the current food system on both human health and the Earth’s ecosystems. This week comes the next instalment from another special Lancet commission which finds that pandemics of obesity and malnutrition are interacting with climate change in a feedback loop and represent an existential threat to humans and the planet. The modern western diet has become a highly damaging thing that needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe. It concluded that we need to halve global meat consumption, and more than double the volume of whole grains, pulses, nuts, fruit and vegetables we eat. Cue howls of indignation from big food and its cheerleaders, the libertarian right. Those nanny statists have gone nuts eating their own double dose of nuts! Cue cries of distress from champions of local, low-impact agriculture who include grass-fed animals, and their meat and manure, in their sustainable mix. These self-appointed experts don’t understand farming! Cue grim food wheels with only a quarter of a rasher of bacon or a fifth of an egg a day. Those miserabilist medics want us all to go vegan!
JAN29	Women still have to use their frozen eggs in 10 years – or lose them. Why?	Fertility experts are urging the government to dump legislation that demands women who have frozen their eggs must use them within 10 years. After this time fertility clinics are obliged to destroy the eggs, irrespective of what the woman they belong to wants – unless she has been through the egg-freezing process because her fertility is compromised, which can happen for a number of reasons. The law at present dictates that any woman who has had her eggs frozen for “social” reasons – that is, not medically indicated (for instance, she may not have met someone she wants to have children with yet) – has a maximum of 10 years in which to use them. Before we even begin to unpack the implications of such restrictions, though, the term “social” in itself warrants our attention. Pejorative is putting it lightly.
JAN29	Looking on the bright side of climate change, think of all the money corporations can make	You know what I love about capitalism? Its optimism. Even in the direst of circumstances, it is always able to find a silver lining. Take climate change, for example. After weird weather and ominous warnings of more to come, many of us are freaking out about an environmental apocalypse. Indeed, a new poll shows record numbers of Americans are worried about climate change and, after last year’s heatwave, concerns about the issue have soared in Britain.
JAN29	What has happened in Venezuela is a coup. Trump’s denial is dangerous	The picture shows him in the act of swearing himself in as “interim” president of Venezuela. His right hand raised to the heavens, as is proper of one who, having no popular mandate, proclaims himself in the name of God like the kings of old. Only this is no kingdom, but a revolutionary republic born of a people’s war. It has since protected its right to self-determination by means of people power and persistent anti-colonial struggle. In the 19th century the struggle was led by Simón Bolívar, “the liberator”. Rebelling against the laws of the time, Bolivar stood up to the might of the Spanish empire in alliance with then free Haiti. Bolivar made instant enemies of slaveholders in the newly formed US and the rest of the Americas upon embracing a universal right and call to happiness without hypocrisy. That promise was realised only in part.
JAN30	Worse than plastic waste: the burning tyres choking India	What we see is not the economy. What we see is the tiny fragment of economic life we are supposed to see: the products and services we buy. The rest – the mines, plantations, factories and dumps required to deliver and remove them – are kept as far from our minds as possible. Given the scale of global extraction and waste disposal, it is a remarkable feat of perception management. The recent enthusiasm for plastic porn – footage of the disgusting waste pouring into the sea – is a rare reminder that we are still living in a material world. But it has had no meaningful effect on government policy. When China banned imports of plastic waste a year ago, you might have hoped that the UK government would invest heavily in waste reduction and domestic recycling. Instead, it has sought new outlets for our filth. Among the lucky recipients are Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, none of which have adequate disposal systems – as I write, our plastic is doubtless flooding into their seas. There’s a term for this practice: waste colonialism.
JAN30	Parents can police screen time – but good luck telling your children that	This morning, I was in bed, listening to the Today programme’s headlines, including a new Ofcom study that finds children are watching less TV, and more YouTube, although since YouTube is a content delivery platform, a better headline would be, “children watch less telly, in preference for more telly”. My 11-year-old was downstairs, also in bed, watching YouTube. I knew this not because I have any kind of parental surveillance system, but because if he wasn’t, that would mean the internet had broken, and I’d have heard about it. The world of nostalgia can be divided in two: the people who just preferred life when they were young, because it was more enjoyable; and those who think the internet is inherently evil, and everything spinning out of it – including the personalities of coming up for two generations – is therefore, also, evil. For those who want to spread terror about screen time – that it can slow development, that it promotes, or at least enables, bullying, that it obliterates boredom and all the constructive thoughts that proceed from it, that it destroys social connections and tugs our young inexorably towards the state of hikikomori, the Japanese “modern-day hermit” – parents are easy meat. We know that screen time isn’t necessary, because we didn’t have it when we were young, unless you count half-watching Monkey and being cast into a pit of obscure martial-arts-philosophy despair. We know that almost everything non-screen related – flying kites, doing embroidery, making slime – is more wholesome. Yet we have – or rather, someone, somewhere has – found a way to take the entire scope of human knowledge and activity and locate it all in one portable device.
JAN30	When courts are closed in numbers like this, people are denied justice	Courts are strange places. Some, like Snaresbrook crown court in east London, could be mistaken from the outside for a stately home – a grand listed building set beside a lake. Once inside, though, there’s no mistaking its status as part of the unloved criminal justice estate – low ceilings, headache-inducing strip lighting, threadbare furnishings. Others are eerie, like Isleworth, south-west London, which used to be a mental institution. Many courts, however, are as unlovely as they are unloved. Postwar multiplexes with little going for them, tolerated by all who use them as a necessary evil in the work that we do. The government touted the closure of 230 of these buildings since 2010 as a good thing, because the income from selling them off would be ploughed back into improving the rest. But it’s no surprise, given the state of these courts, that they have failed to generate enough money to deliver on that promise. Guardian analysis shows that sales so far have generated just £34m – roughly what the government spent on just one “change management” consultancy contract from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The idea that you improve courts by closing them is just the latest in a cycle of dystopian logic in which cuts to public funding create delay and decay, thereby justifying further cuts.
JAN30	As schools are forced to be academies, the will of the people means nothing	Saturday morning, and Stevenage appears to be bracing itself for a riot. Police cars block off road after road. Sirens scythe the air. Officers hurry about in hi-vis. And at the eye of this storm is not some motley crew of furious insurgents, but hundreds of children and mums and dads, marching last weekend to save the school they love. “We are a small town and we aren’t used to staging demonstrations,” says councillor Josh Bennett Lovell, which explains both the law-and-order overkill and the bright-eyed kids enjoying all the excitement of a big day out. Only when the marchers hit the town square does the carnival spirit give way to speeches highlighting the seriousness of their situation.
JAN30	May thinks she’s won. But the reality of Brexit will soon hit her again	British politics now follows the tortured pattern of addiction. Inside the addict’s head the most important thing is getting to the next Brexit fix, scoring the best deal. But from the outside, to our European friends and family, it is obvious that the problem is the compulsive pursuit of a product that does us only harm. On Tuesday night Theresa May thought she had scored: a slender majority in parliament voted for an imaginary agreement in Brussels, stripped of the hated “backstop”. Tory Eurosceptic ultras and the DUP pledged conditional allegiance to the prime minister if she delivers “alternative arrangements” for a seamless border on Northern Ireland. But no one has any idea what those might be and the EU has already ruled out a renegotiation on terms that might satisfy the hardliners. The transient buzz of Tory unity will yield to the chilly comedown of Brexit reality, as it always does. Some MPs can see the situation spiralling out of control. Today 298 lined up to demand an intervention. They backed a cross-party bid to seize control of the Brexit agenda from the government and delay the day of departure if necessary. But the move failed. There is ample horror of the no-deal scenario across the Commons (a vaguer condemnation of that option won a narrow majority), but clearly the greater fear is association with anything that looks like an active plot to thwart Brexit. Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles, sponsors of the more controversial amendment, insisted their aim was only to guarantee an orderly departure, and there is no reason to doubt them. Parliament is packed with pro-Europeans who say no to the hard junk peddled by the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg but are still hooked on softer strains of the leave drug.
JAN30	Though parliament rejected no deal, we’re now closer to it than ever	Well this is all going swimmingly, isn’t it? Another evening of parliamentary pantomime after which nothing of substance has been achieved. But what pantomime! We’ve seen the prime minister join her party in demanding changes to the deal negotiated by – the prime minister. She backed an amendment that unpicked a deal she negotiated, thereby instructing herself to go back and try harder. Meanwhile, Labour demanded – and failed to get – a delay, without really knowing what it was for. But the bottom line is clear. Sixty days to go until we are scheduled to leave the European Union. And we still don’t know what we want. So what happened this evening? First, parliament proudly displayed its inability to decide. They decided, via the Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey amendment, that they don’t want no deal – though only in a non-binding manner. Heaven forbid options get definitively taken off the table. Second, they supported an amendment calling for changes to the infamous Northern Ireland backstop.
JAN30	Why I won't miss Tesco's fake 'posh' deli, fish and meat counters	The news that Tesco is to shut the fresh food counters at 90 of its UK stores was surprising in one detail: it has chosen to retain the butcher’s, cheese and deli counters at 700 more. Why? The remaining counters will surely be streamlined but, in 2019, is anyone really taken in by the supermarket fresh food counter, that sentimental harking back to a world of town squares and traditional retailers? Does anyone browse what Morrisons calls its Market Street and feel like they are in a market … or a street? No. In a 2012 Financial Times article, which identified fresh food as the next major supermarket battleground (tell that to up to 9,000 people now facing redundancy at Tesco), one expert revealingly described fresh food as “the biggest single determinant of the quality image of a superstore operator”. Key words there: quality image. As opposed to actual, objective quality. Retail magazine The Grocer this week described fresh food counters as key to customer “perception”, but “an expensive luxury” which, say analysts, have been “haemorrhaging” money for years. Unlike in continental hypermarkets (yes, even here we are diverging from Europe), fresh food counters contribute “microscopic” amounts to turnover.
JAN30	Here in Liverpool, we know what northern austerity looks like up close	This week started with me reporting a couple of things that many in Liverpool already know – that their city has been ravaged by the austerity agenda of the past nine years, and that the Conservatives don’t care too much about them and their lives. Most people in this city know it – and most people are angry about it – but this week’s report into local council funding cuts by the Centre for Cities thinktank brought into sharp focus just how unfair this all is.
JAN30	The Alex Iwobi ‘gorilla’ insult shines a light on south Asian anti-black racism	“Did you know Gandhi was racist?” A white friend sits opposite me, grinning so widely I wonder if there’s going to be a punchline. “We know,” I reply, “we all know.” Her smile fades quickly and she moves on. I stop listening, the noise in the cafe dies down and the soundtrack to a sad Bollywood film fills the moment. She thought I didn’t know. Why don’t I talk about it more? I hide the trauma of black people because Gandhi was one of the few saviours we had in our toxic community. Anti-blackness was a punchline I wasn’t expecting. One thing I remember from studying A-level sociology is the idea of how you develop through your primary and then your secondary education – something that contributes greatly to social dynamics. Primary education is what you learn from your family home, secondary education is what is passed on to us from institutions.
JAN30	The new 100% mortgage won’t help low-income Generation Rent	If there’s anything more British than talking about the weather, it’s obsessing about house prices. This is a country where it’s taboo to ask someone their salary but perfectly acceptable to ask how much their house is worth (and look it up on Rightmove if they won’t tell you). In recent years, it’s been harder to avoid talking about house prices than ever because, in many places around the country, they’re so out of control. According to the Office for National Statistics, the median price paid for a home leapt by 259% between 1997 and 2016, while earnings only rose by 68%.
JAN31	The backstop isn’t just about trade. Is that so hard to understand, Britain?	One of my earliest childhood memories is of a circling red light motioning cars to stop near the border, silencing all who encountered its fiery glare. That red light filled my young heart with fear. I didn’t know if the gloved hand holding the torch was that of the RUC, the British army, the IRA or the UVF. I grew up during the Troubles in the shadow of Cloghogue, one of the largest British army bases in Northern Ireland. Having to make detours to avoid customs and security checks along “bomb alley” – an atrocity-laden eight-mile stretch of road between Newry and Dundalk – was as frightening as it was familiar.
JAN31	If Corbyn gets his hands dirty he can avert a hard Brexit	In spite of the upbeat signals that came from Jeremy Corbyn’s meeting with Theresa May on Wednesday, experience suggests that it will not prove a turning point on Brexit. Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator. These gifts are not part of their skill sets. Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign. Corbyn’s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo’s Inspector Javert look like a libertine. May’s default mode towards Corbyn, on show again at question time this week, is to give him her full Lady Disdain. What is more, even if the two leaders wanted to patch something together, their respective Brexit positions do not allow for much common ground anyway. May’s red lines on leaving the single market and the customs union, ending free movement and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court are mostly mirror images of Corbyn’s. He wants a close relationship with the EU market and on customs, and supports his own version of free movement. The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen, preferably under a Conservative government.
JAN31	Why are the police suggesting women jog in packs?	After a jogger was sexually assaulted in Shepton Mallet last year, the local running club advised women to travel in packs. Extroverts hate running with other people; we don’t like company without chat, and talking while running is a literal waste of breath. Introverts hate running with other people, because they are other people. Avon and Somerset police, meanwhile, have recommended that runners don’t listen to music and vary their routes. (Everybody hates running without music and most hate changing their routes.) It’s fine, ladies, the police seem to say. We have got your back. You can still do that thing you enjoy, you just have to make yourself safer by enjoying it less. In the 90s, the What Women Want survey drew on the largest sample since the Hite report on sexuality in the 70s. It had the same methodological problems – it wasn’t a probability sample and women were self-selecting, simply choosing to fill in a postcard or not. And it wasn’t as sexy as the Hite report; women, given infinite choice to talk about utopia, talked a lot about the sunlit uplands of being able to go places without being attacked. When the survey was conducted again a couple of years ago, nothing had changed: young women who you would expect to demand better youth services were instead asking for street lighting; professionals whom might, in another world, be worrying about boardrooms were talking about safety as a tax, cabs because it’s late, gyms because the park was too dicey.
JAN31	‘Prepare to be bathed in woke': the Guy Who's guide to Valentine's Day	Valentine’s Day. 14 February. Known the world over as the most romantic day of the year (apologies, Shrove Tuesday). But were you aware that it is also peak break-up time for couples? That’s according to some statistics I’ve knowingly twisted to suit my own agenda. Either way, it’s certainly a busy time for me, the Guy You Meet Right After You Come Out of a Long-Term Relationship. Initially I’m just a friend … but that’s not what I’m after. I have a nice smile, an easy manner and no car. You’ll recognise me if you’re single, female and just trying to enjoy a quiet moment on your own. You’ll also recognise me if you’re male, single and just looking in a mirror. So prepare to be bathed in so much woke you’ll swear you’ve just been licked by Justin Trudeau.
JAN31	The left must be bold and back a green new deal	It’s often said that real change takes place at a time of crisis, but that’s not the whole story. A crisis makes change possible, but only when new ideas are knocking about does it actually happen. Otherwise, it is soon business as usual. The US economist Milton Friedman understood that fact, which is why he toiled away in the political wilderness to plot the downfall of postwar social democracy and was fully prepared when trouble arrived in the mid-1970s. The left was so in thrall to market forces and globalised capital that it blew a golden opportunity in 2007
JAN31	Labour can’t be held responsible for the Brexit fiasco	This week’s parliamentary votes on Brexit should mark the death of a delusion. This may seem an odd argument: parliament has just voted for an amendment demanding an alternative to the backstop, which has been repeatedly ruled out by the EU. Tory MPs voted for what they know is impossible. David Lidington, the prime minister’s number two, who three weeks ago denounced “fantasies about magical, alternative deals”, voted for what he knows is impossible. Theresa May, who has repeatedly declared that no alternative to her deal exists and then ludicrously whipped her MPs to vote against that deal, voted for what she knows is impossible. The DUP, which at least has the excuse of being stranded in the 17th century, voted for what it knows is impossible. The Tory party is subjecting the country to a pantomime, acting out a script it knows bears no relation to reality, and is prolonging Britain’s turmoil and our international humiliation, all for the sake of its own partisan interests. No, the delusion that died last night was the idea that Labour has any meaningful say over the substance of Brexit at all. Labour put forward an amendment to strike out no deal, and to provide the option of a second referendum. It backed Yvette Cooper’s amendment to extend article 50 by a mere three months and Dominic Grieve’s amendment to allow consultative votes on alternatives to May’s Brexit plan. All three of the amendments were voted down in parliament. The reason for this is that the Tories have a parliamentary majority, courtesy of the DUP, and Tory MPs – wherever they stand on the Brexit divide – prioritise stopping a party split over the nation’s interests. Along with their ideological obsession with austerity, this is the proximate cause of Britain’s crisis. This should be a statement of the obvious, but sometimes to state the obvious is a revolutionary act.
JAN31	Outsourcing education to Clarks shoes: only a Tory could think of that	Parents, we’ve all been there: a high-street shoe shop in early September. Everyone with a school-aged child has simultaneously realised that if they don’t get around to buying shoes today, the kids are going to have to start the year wearing flip-flops, or wellies. The queue is out of the door, heaps of small black lace-ups litter the aisles. Babies are wailing. Somebody’s toddler has got a foot stuck in the measuring machine. It’s too hot in the store, and there’s a heady scent of sweat and wee. Your own children are desperate to leave because you rashly bribed them to come here with the promise of a trip to the Lego shop and a doughnut. How, you might wonder, could this annual ritual get any more hellish? As ever, the government is one step ahead
JAN31	Labour’s immigration U-turn is a wake-up call for Corbyn supporters	We’re here, then. The point at which a Labour leadership that won support for being different ends up being the same. The stage that jaded observers warned was an inevitability of politics, no matter who was in charge. The day that a political project with impeccably pro-migration credentials triangulated into abstention on a miserable, destructive Conservative immigration bill. OK, so it didn’t fully triangulate in the end. Let’s start at the beginning. On Monday, the government’s immigration bill, their flagship legislation for what the country’s immigration policy would be after Brexit, was due a second reading. The Labour party announced in the afternoon that it would be abstaining, in other words, not voting it down. Within hours, after an excoriating backlash from Labour MPs and Jeremy Corbyn’s supporters alike, the party shifted from abstention to a one-line whip – and the government bill passed with 76 Labour MPs absent. This bill, among other things, ends freedom of movement and strips 3 million EU citizens of their rights in the UK, while threatening them with the hostile environment that others are already cruelly subjected to. It also cavalierly hands immigration powers to ministers and puts a £30,000 salary threshold on skilled worker visas for EU citizens – making it unattainable for skilled workers in key areas such as the NHS, social care and beyond. In this context, Labour’s approach to this bad bill really is staggering.
JAN31	As schools are forced to be academies, the will of the people means nothing	Saturday morning, and Stevenage appears to be bracing itself for a riot. Police cars block off road after road. Sirens scythe the air. Officers hurry about in hi-vis. And at the eye of this storm is not some motley crew of furious insurgents, but hundreds of children and mums and dads, marching last weekend to save the school they love. “We are a small town and we aren’t used to staging demonstrations,” says councillor Josh Bennett Lovell, which explains both the law-and-order overkill and the bright-eyed kids enjoying all the excitement of a big day out. Only when the marchers hit the town square does the carnival spirit give way to speeches highlighting the seriousness of their situation.
JAN31	It’s not just Meghan and Kate – all women need social media protection	Being a royal secures unfathomable perks. Whether it’s getting a £1m home refurbishment gifted by the taxpayer, ownership of all the swans or a lifetime of inherited privilege for you and your descendants, royal status shields the bestowed from life’s mundane troubles. But even a five-metre Givenchy wedding veil couldn’t save Meghan, Duchess of Sussex from misogynoir and a barrage of trolling. This week, Kensington Palace had to reach out for help from Twitter and Instagram, as staff members were spending hours each week reporting sexist and racist comments and threats aimed at Meghan and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. The diatribe is so dire that Hello! magazine has started a campaign #HelloToKindness.
FEB1	‘Stress interviews’: another way to make millennials’ lives hell	It sounds like the job interview from hell. Olivia Bland ended up crying at the bus stop, after what the 22-year-old describes as being deliberately torn to shreds over everything from her writing skills to her posture (apparently even “my arms were wrong, and the way I sat was wrong”). Tech company boss Craig Dean, the man on the other side of the desk, ended up posting what he called a “sleep-deprived and anxiety-driven” apology on Twitter after her account of it all went viral. Tell me your gender, age and political leanings and I can probably guess with reasonable certainty whether your sympathies lie with her or with him. But if nothing else, the rejection email she sent, explaining where Web Applications UK could stick the job it eventually offered her, certainly demonstrates the “timely, concise and effective” communications skills stipulated in the job description.
FEB1	An Android-only app for EU citizens' residency – finally, my time to shine!	Years of struggle have come to an end; finally, after a decade of taunting, my people’s time has come. It has not been easy, being mocked for the apps we inexplicably cannot get, and the Instagram pictures we post that look like they were taken by a drunk child, but now Android users have the upper hand. Maybe I should take the comical incompetency of the Home Office more seriously. It is, after all, somewhat bonkers that EU citizens in the UK (of which I am one) are only able to apply for residency on one type of smartphone, but if Brexit Britain has taught me anything, it is to look for the silver linings.
FEB1	Lazy homophobia signals the end of the road for Clarkson and co	It’s been a while since Jeremy Clarkson caused an upset. The days of him punching a producer, prompting his ejection from the BBC, or straining diplomatic relations in Argentina seem so long ago, it’s enough to make one nostalgic. But order has been restored with a fresh storm about homophobic remarks aired during the new series of The Grand Tour, highlighted on Twitter by the singer Will Young. “Enough is enough,” said Young. “I’m pissed and fed up. I want Amazon Prime and the producers of Grand Tour to meet young LGBT [people] who want to kill themselves because of shaming and laughter and normalising of shaming homophobic narratives.”
FEB1	The backstop isn’t just about trade. Is that so hard to understand, Britain?	One of my earliest childhood memories is of a circling red light motioning cars to stop near the border, silencing all who encountered its fiery glare. That red light filled my young heart with fear. I didn’t know if the gloved hand holding the torch was that of the RUC, the British army, the IRA or the UVF. I grew up during the Troubles in the shadow of Cloghogue, one of the largest British army bases in Northern Ireland. Having to make detours to avoid customs and security checks along “bomb alley” – an atrocity-laden eight-mile stretch of road between Newry and Dundalk – was as frightening as it was familiar.
FEB1	The World Bank and IMF are in crisis. It's time to push a radical new vision	The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, will step down on 1 February – three and a half years before the end of his term – in search of greener pastures. His readiness to resign from the leadership of one the two most powerful international financial institutions is a worrying omen. But it is also an important wake-up call. The World Bank and the IMF are the last remaining columns of the Bretton Woods edifice under which capitalism experienced its golden age in the 1950s and 1960s. While that system, and the fixed exchange rate regime it relied upon, bit the dust in 1971, the two institutions continued to support global finance along purely Atlanticist lines: with Europe’s establishment choosing the IMF’s managing director and the United States selecting the head of the World Bank.
FEB1	If the police step up stop-and-search tactics, trouble will follow	Last month it emerged that there had been a 400% rise in police use of “stop and search” powers. And according to a recent Guardian report, there is evidence that black people are being disproportionately targeted. This is profoundly depressing. There are real grounds for concern that, once again, use of this policing strategy is storing up trouble. Our new report, Beyond Contagion, published today, supports the view that stop and search can have unintended but significant social and psychological consequences. We examined patterns of data in the 2011 riots – in particular how these events arose and spread. The significance of the riots is indisputable: this was the largest wave of disorder in the UK since the 1980s, and involved an estimated 20,000 people, with more than 4,000 arrests. It is important to understand the underlying causes.
FEB1	Supermarkets say Brexit could empty shelves. That's a risk they chose to run	“The shops will be empty” and “the lights will go out” are the staple warnings of commercial interests that have an axe to grind or are looking for public support. But the letter this week from store bosses sounding an alert about the impact of a no-deal Brexithas added irony when delivered by some of Britain’s biggest supermarket retailers, whose centralised business model has done much to hollow out the economy, making it so vulnerable in the first place. The companies focus on the threat of disruption to food supplies. We’ve been here before, and recently. While shambolic Brexit negotiations continue, and place more stress on the system, a whole range of other dynamics in recent years has left our food system more frail and at risk.
FEB1	If Corbyn gets his hands dirty he can avert a hard Brexit	In spite of the upbeat signals that came from Jeremy Corbyn’s meeting with Theresa May on Wednesday, experience suggests that it will not prove a turning point on Brexit. Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator. These gifts are not part of their skill sets. Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign. Corbyn’s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo’s Inspector Javert look like a libertine. May’s default mode towards Corbyn, on show again at question time this week, is to give him her full Lady Disdain.

The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen, preferably under a Conservative government.
FEB1	The UK isn’t ready to Brexit. Instead it’s heading towards a no-deal tsunami	Shellshocked MPs of the sensible tendency are now seriously alarmed. You find them in a daze around Westminster and its news studio green-rooms stunned by Tuesday night’s failure of the modest Cooper amendment to prevent a no-deal crash-out. Each day the news gets worse, not forecasts, but actuality. Today it’s the UK motor manufacturers reporting a 50% drop in investment last year and Barclays whisking £166bn of assets off to Dublin, joining a torrential outflow, including Jacob Rees-Mogg’s own investment company.
FEB1	Like Anne Hathaway, I ditched alcohol so I could be a better parent	As a child, I used to lie to my mother about when parents’ evening at school was. Not because I had been underachieving, but because I was scared she would turn up, drunk, staggering around and slurring, again. My childhood was mostly spent caring for myself and my mother as she took to her bed, wailing, with bottles of vodka. She went in and out of hospital, eventually ending up in a care home in her early 60s after years of absolute darkness and chaos, having wrecked her mind and body.
FEB2	Brexit Britain is now the only argument on Earth for rising sea levels	So many people have been branded traitors in the past year of Brexit that many of us now have traitor fatigue. But everyone should salute Ukip leader Gerard Batten for totally revitalising the genre this week by calling the Queen a traitor. Gerard, a sort of radicalised Just For Men box, wrote to Her Majesty to ask her to prorogue parliament to save Brexit. He also took the opportunity to inform Queen Elizabeth II that she had committed treason when she signed the Maastricht treaty. “To presume to convey rights on or to impose duties on Your Majesty was, and remains, unlawful and treasonous under the bill of rights and the coronation oath,” wrote the Ukip leader, whose treatment for low-budget legal drama Better Call Gerard is thought not to have tempted the networks. “Your Majesty’s ministers were gravely in error and wrongly advised you.”
FEB2	May’s bribe won’t stop Brexit inflicting more pain on Labour's heartlands	It took 35 years but now, perhaps, comes the final act of the miners’ strike that tore Britain apart for one long, bitter year in the mid-1980s. Decades later, the second woman prime minister is promising balm to heal the wounds inflicted by the first, as Theresa May offers bundles of cash to areas of the country punched hard by Margaret Thatcher’s war on the pits. Of course, that’s not how it’s being presented. It’s true, too, that not every Labour leave-voting area now being pledged “transformative” investment was once marked by pitheads. Even so, a map of the Labour heartlands that voted to leave the European Union in 2016 does match up remarkably closely with the old coalfields. It would be easy to cast May’s proposed multibillion fund as an act of atonement for the damage the Tories did by crushing the miners, closing the pits and leaving many of those towns and villages to rot.
FEB2	How uplifting to hear David Bowie’s ‘girl with the mousy hair’ tell her story	How lovely to hear from Hermione Farthingale, the girl with the mousy hair and muse of David Bowie for his 1971 song Life on Mars. Finally we’ll be able to get closure on those questions that have baffled us for the best part of half a century. Why was her mother yelling no? Why did her father tell her to go? And why didn’t she consider some sort of colouring product to brighten up her hair? In fact, none of these questions is satisfactorily answered in the interview Farthingale gives for the forthcoming BBC film David Bowie: Finding Fame. We learn, though, that after they fell in love in 1968 (“He looked ridiculously young, he looked about eight”) they formed a band called Feathers. The following year the dancer and actor ditched him to make a film called Song of Norway.
FEB2	There’s something new on offer at these Nigerian elections – hope	Who would want to be president of Nigeria? Well, once upon a time, me. When I was 19, I set out my manifesto on the BBC Africa website. Some of my campaign promises included quality education, constant electricity and running water for all. I planned to use my honest smile as my most efficient tool to win votes and secure the presidency. By 21 I’d set my sights a little lower. After some research, I discovered that local government was the most effective place to implement real change. So I decided that by 30 I was going to be a local government chair in Lagos, my home state. I would be in charge of primary education, waste management and primary healthcare for over a million people. Two years from my deadline, I am still ensconced in the suburbs of London with not a campaign flyer in sight.
FEB2	So, poorer Brexiters voted to be worse off? There’s nothing wrong in that	In Uncle Tom’s Cabin, there is a moment when Augustine St Clare, who owns Tom, suggests that he is better off as a slave than he would be as a free man. “No,” insists Tom. “Why Tom?” asks St Clare. “You couldn’t possibly have earned, by your work, such clothes and such living as I have given you.” “Know’s all that Mas’r,” says Tom. “But I’d rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything and have ’em mine, than have the best, and have ’em any man else’s.” It has long been a challenge, particularly for those who are comfortable, to understand why anybody who is struggling would choose to be worse off. Liberals can take it particularly personally when those who would most benefit materially from a change in policy or circumstance opt to reject it. The assumption is that they must be misinformed, ill-informed, uninformed, stupid, naive or cruelly misled.
FEB2	These Tories won’t fix the rough sleeping crisis, no matter what they say	The latest official figures for homelessness show that, in England outside cities, the number of people sleeping rough on any one night is down 2%. But this is where the good news ends. Rough sleeping has increased by 165% since 2010, with rises of as much as 60% in major cities, compared with last year. The homeless charity Crisis’s own research estimates that more than 8,000 people sleep rough on any given night. Meanwhile deaths of homeless people have more than doubled in the past five years. Most people agree that rough sleeping shouldn’t exist in a healthy society – especially not in the sixth richest economy in the world. But it doesn’t appear out of nowhere; it’s the product of political decisions. So why is it being allowed to continue?
FEB2	Why Mariah Carey was wrong to play Saudi Arabia	All I want for 2019 is for much-loved pop stars to stop being inadvertent propagandists for mass-murdering dictatorships. Mariah Carey is the latest musician to perform in Saudi Arabia, following in the ignominious footsteps of Enrique Iglesias and the Black Eyed Peas in December. This is bad on a number of levels. Carey has famously always had a devoted gay fanbase: in Saudi Arabia, homosexuality is punishable by death. Women are deprived of fundamental rights, and despite Saudi propaganda claims that social progress is being made, scores of women’s rights activists were detained and incarcerated last year. One of them is Loujain Alhathloul, whose brother has denounced Carey’s concert as a “pathetic attempt to show that the country is becoming more tolerant toward women”, appealing for the singer to at least call for her release on stage. 
FEB2	Work isn’t working – but a four-day week would help fix it	Our current political moment is defined by a state of paralysis. By refusing to face the reality of a broken economic model, reactionary forces are driving us towards a future based on exclusion, continued deregulation and the scrapping of workers’ rights. Instead of conceding to this “inevitable” race to the bottom, progressive forces of all kinds need to meet the crises of the 21st century head-on by putting forward proposals that tangibly improve people’s lives. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has demonstrated in the US with the green new deal, fresh proposals can change political and economic narratives so as to embrace collective opportunity, potentially avert catastrophe and move us towards sustainable futures. What will make up our “new deal” here in the UK? A new report by Autonomy – a thinktank of which I am co-director – argues that a shorter working week should be a central pillar of our economic future.
FEB2	Theresa May is trying to bribe the people of Redcar. She can forget it	For nearly a decade my constituents have been told to put up with austerity in the name of the national interest. We were told the nation was broke, so grandmothers had to be forced out of their family homes by the bedroom tax, council workers had to lose their jobs, crimes had to go unsolved, disabled people had to lose financial support, NHS walk-in centres had to close, wages had to flatline with workers reliant on Redcar’s new food banks, and our steelworks had to close with no government bailout. These measures alone are enough to make us angry and resentful, particularly while other areas seemed to prosper and government investment continued to flow elsewhere. Yet we learned yesterday that there is, after all, money magically available for a “programme of national renewal” for areas like mine – on the condition I vote for Theresa May’s Brexit deal. It’s amazing how much money, which should have been distributed on the basis of need and fairness, can suddenly be found to bribe MPs to vote for a deal that was dismissed by the largest parliamentary margin in history.
FEB2	The polar vortex has turned New Yorkers into Brits for one week only	Once the basics are covered, and one’s face is set against the storm, there is nothing like a good weather event to excite bipartisan unity. For a British person in the US, the advent of the polar vortex this week has been an embarrassment of riches the like of which we haven’t seen since first encountering the term “thundersnow”. It was -18C with wind-chill in New York this week – and, in a household in which my children persistently refuse to put on their coats, the weather finally won: on the school run we all went the full Shackleton. I’m aware you have to squint slightly to make this experience a fully detribalised issue. The crashing temperatures, including a contender for the lowest ever on record in Chicago, are linked to Arctic air being pushed south by disruptions to the jet stream that experts say is caused by global warming. And enjoying both the frisson of cold air and repeated opportunity to use the word “vortex” relies on the luxury of minimal exposure.
FEB3	Leave Brigitte Macron alone. We French need to lay off our first ladies	It’s almost a ritual. In France, it takes only a few months after the election of a new president for essays, pamphlets, picture albums, novels even, about the great man’s political ideas – but also his “true” or “hidden” personal story – to start flooding bookshops. More surprisingly, and perhaps more revealingly, France’s first ladies get a similar treatment. Although Emmanuel Macron has been in power for only 18 months, his wife, Brigitte, has already been the subject of five books. In January 2018, Brigitte Macron: L’affranchie came out, followed four months later by Brigitte Macron: La confidente. We were also treated to Les Macron and Lettre Ouverte à Brigitte Macron, a plea for assisted dying by an author hoping she would pass the message on to her other half so he’d make it legal.
FEB3	One day, a second people’s vote will bring us back into the EU. But when?	I marched for a “people’s vote”. I co-wrote a book making the case for one, a case that included a massive programme of reform. I have argued for it in many public meetings. Britain can and must be a member of this club of like-minded European states at the global standard-setting centre of the world’s largest free-trading network. It transcends the World Trade Organization in importance and reach, confirmed on Friday by the Japan-EU trade deal. For the EU is the enabler of prosperity and guarantor of peace in Europe. It is the friend of every principal economic interest group – from farmers to magic circle law firms, from university lecturers to trade unionists. The British are culturally and philosophically Europeans, even though too many still believe in the myth of our Dunkirk spirit exceptionalism.
FEB3	The Tories should heed Oliver Letwin. They won’t be forgiven a no-deal Brexit	One of the better, because more honest, speeches delivered during parliament’s most recent Brexit debate came from Oliver Letwin. While other Tories carried on fantasising and wrangling about what they would or would not permit, Sir Oliver confessed that he was “past caring what deal we have” and would support whatever Mrs May comes up with next. He would do so, the former cabinet minister explained, because if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal and the consequences are bad, “my party will not be forgiven for many years”. Were I a Tory, I’d pay attention to that warning. Sir Oliver speaks with experience of what follows when politicians wilfully inflict abominations on their voters. He was one of the architects of the poll tax in the 1980s. Some readers may need reminding that this reckless experiment in changing local taxation without thinking through the consequences led to rioting in Trafalgar Square and the defenestration of Margaret Thatcher at the hands of her own party.
FEB3	We’re fixated by giving things up. After Dry January, I’m saying yes to indulgence	The dryness of January ended with overnight snowfall and, according to the app on my phone, the saving of 72 units of alcohol, £84 and 4,697 calories. The calendar shows I managed 29 drink-free days. One night is accounted for by a birthday party at which I drank three glasses of champagne and the hostess’s daughter surprisingly burst out of a cake. The night before, having an early-evening meal in an Italian restaurant, I became so exasperated by the boredom, the sheer even-keel of my days, their monotonous sameness of my mood, that I ordered an Aperol spritz and felt that familiar surge of temporary joy and satisfaction that I associate with the varied world of cocktails. I’ve never given anything up for Lent. I’ve never even managed 24 hours of Yom Kippur fasting. I’m new to this world. I didn’t think there was a problem with my drinking. I assumed I was a moderate drinker – one or two units, three or four times a week, less if I’m not going out, more if I’m on holiday, when a glass of chilly white wine is the boundary between swimming pool and dinner table. I don’t go to pubs, I almost never drink at lunchtime, I don’t go on benders. It’s many years since I had a hangover and it would never have occurred to me to give up alcohol were it not for the relentless nagging of the Dry January campaign, promising me undreamed-of benefits: better sleep, more money, more energy, weight loss and – this was a new whammy – lowering one’s risk of cancer.
FEB3	Forget philanthropy. The super-rich should be paying proper taxes	A half-lie dominates modern culture that is worse than a straight lie because it contains enough truth to persuade readers who otherwise wouldn’t be fooled. The people from somewhere have risen up against the people from nowhere, it runs. The globalised elites, once as comfortable in Manhattan as Davos, have been humbled by the left-behind working-class. The half of the lie that’s true is that Brexit, Trump and the rise of the European radical right are shocks to the system. Yet they are shocks that leave the holders of wealth and power remarkably unruffled.
FEB3	Using the big freeze to deny climate change... stupidity or cynicism?	The winters of the early 1970s were very cold and snowy in the northeastern United States where I grew up – as elsewhere around the US and Europe. I remember snowfalls that came up to my chin (though, of course, I was only a few feet tall back then). We now call those “old-fashioned winters”, precisely because they have grown so rare as a consequence of – yes – global warming. If you’re younger than I am (I became a demi-centenarian three years ago), those winters are likely to be outside the range of your experience. And so it may seem plausible to you that cold snaps, that in reality simply reflect the sort of weather that was commonplace just decades ago, might constitute “record” or “unprecedented” cold.
FEB3	Bullshit, not lies, is the corrosive influence blighting our public life	‘Bullshit,” the philosopher Harry Frankfurt observed in a seminal essay on the subject, “is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about.” He wrote that in 2005, but he might have been watching recent episodes of This Week, BBC’s late-night politics show, presided over by Andrew Neil. Over the past two weeks, it’s thrown up two car-crash interviews that serve as textbook illustrations of Frankfurt’s thesis. First, we had the rightwing writer James Delingpole waxing lyrical about a no-deal Brexit. If ever there were a case of someone talking without knowing what he was talking about, this was it. The simplest of questions reduced Delingpole, who clearly is as familiar with economics as Theresa May is with dancing, to incoherently mumbling: “I don’t know the answer.” Michel Barnier could probably have made a better fist of arguing for Brexit.
FEB3	At last someone has spoken up for the pleasures of a mixed community	There was much to enjoy about Jess Phillips’s speech on the new immigration bill defining a skilled worker as someone earning more than £30,000. As the MP for Birmingham Yardley pointed out, many people, including nurses and care workers, earn considerably less. However, while Phillips’s derision for overpaid thickos got most of the attention (“I’ve met lots of people who earn way more than £30,000 who have absolutely no discernible skills… not even one”), I was also struck by how warmly she talked about immigration. “It sticks slightly in the craw of a person who grew up in Birmingham,” she said, “to listen to people who don’t live among migrants… talk about how difficult it is for communities to have to live in places of high migration. Well, it’s not difficult at all – it’s a total pleasure.”
FEB3	Jeremy Hardy – true to his politics and his comedy	Even a decade ago, Jeremy Hardy used to worry about the vulnerability of his supposedly aged Radio 4 fanbase: “I hope we don’t have a harsh winter – I could lose half my audience.” This was characteristically modest, since he was loved and admired by comedy fans of all ages, from the spit’n’sawdust clubs where he started out in the early 80s to the Hay festival and the BBC Radio theatre. So many of the tributes pouring in after the announcement of his death from cancer on Friday, at only 57, have come from younger comics with stories to tell of his unstinting generosity, support and kindness towards those coming up in the business. Hardy was a comedian’s comedian, which is to say that he was steeped in a love of standup and was regarded in turn as a master of the craft by his contemporaries and those who aspired to follow him.
FEB3	Let the glories of the BBC be reborn on its new Scotland channel	Even now, almost 46 years after its release, the Thames television documentary The World at War retains its appalling beauty. Its 26 episodes continue to rattle around the twilight stations, beyond Channel 5, so that you are rarely more than a few months away from its presence somewhere. Sometimes, when I see that one of its chapters is unfolding, I watch what remains of it, knowing that Carl Davis’s haunting theme music will soon be making me cry again. The World at War, along with the BBC’s startling coverage of apartheid in the late 60s and Meryl Streep in the 1970s television mini-series Holocaust, probably formed my political conscience more than anything else. We liberals and lefties are occasionally fond of scolding the BBC for being too easily led by the establishment, but my parents deployed it sparingly and adroitly.
FEB4	An orderly Brexit depends on a united Tory party. So start stockpiling now	Let us take a stroll down the shabby corridors of Conservative history: it is June 1997, and the party leadership vacated by John Major after New Labour’s landslide is being contested, in the second round of the race, by William Hague, John Redwood and Kenneth Clarke. In a desperate bid to see off Hague, the arch-Europhile Clarke and the arch-Eurosceptic Redwood form a pact, founded on the principle that Europe will be an open issue in the party and that Tory MPs will not be bound by a strict party policy. There is much talk of a historic breakthrough, an end to the long Conservative civil war over Britain’s relationship with the EU, and a new era of internal party unity. But even those responsible for this brief alliance know it is nonsense on stilts. In his memoirs, Clarke jovially describes it as a “last desperate idea”, quickly condemned by MPs on both sides of the divide as a “Nazi-Soviet agreement”.
FEB4	Roma is a cinematic triumph. Can it teach Trump’s America the value of compassion?	Staying in Santiago, Chile, at the moment, I see echoes and reflections of Cleo – the servant at the heart of Alfonso Cuarón’s wondrous film Roma – everywhere. Cuarón’s consummate recreation of his Mexico City childhood in the early 1970s has garnered 10 Oscar nominations and is a favourite for the top prizes later this month – including best picture, best actress, for Yalitza Aparicio who plays Cleo, and best director for Cuarón. I see Cleo in the maids who trudge to work at seven in the morning after two hours of gruelling travel from the outskirts of the city. They hurry along so they can make a hot breakfast for their employers. I see Cleo in the caretaker who spends night after night sitting with an octogenarian friend who is dying of cancer. I see Cleo in the women who sweep the floors of a nearby hospital and those who serve the food at a cafeteria in the civil registry office. I see her in the female workers who water the municipal gardens in the morning and pick up the trash in the afternoons.
FEB4	I did Veganuary, and now I’m staying vegan. Here’s what I’ve learned so far	We know the world is eating too much meat, and we know that we as individuals have to do something about it. So I was one of the record 250,000 people who signed up to Veganuary this year. I haven’t actually eaten meat for 30 years, although I occasionally ate fish and felt bad about it. Two years ago, I visited a modern British dairy farm where the cows were kept in very clean conditions, indoors, all year round. I hated it. So I switched to oat milk, and last year gave up eating cheese. But there’s still plenty of animal products in cakes and biscuits. And so, until 1 January, I wasn’t vegan.
FEB4	With the right funding model, journalism can pay its way	The question most asked by journalists just now, aside from the routine one about Brexit, is how their trade will be funded in future. Indeed, at local level, there is increasing concern about whether there will be any trade at all. Look at the state of the big three regional publishers. JPI Media, owner of the i newspaper, the Scotsman, The Yorkshire Post and about 200 more titles, was founded last November from the ashes of Johnston Press after it went into administration. It began this year by announcing a series of cover price rises and followed up with a review aimed at relocating offices and merging newsrooms (a euphemism for reducing journalistic staff).
FEB4	Leave Brigitte Macron alone. We French need to lay off our first ladies	It’s almost a ritual. In France, it takes only a few months after the election of a new president for essays, pamphlets, picture albums, novels even, about the great man’s political ideas – but also his “true” or “hidden” personal story – to start flooding bookshops. More surprisingly, and perhaps more revealingly, France’s first ladies get a similar treatment. Although Emmanuel Macron has been in power for only 18 months, his wife, Brigitte, has already been the subject of five books. In January 2018, Brigitte Macron: L’affranchie came out, followed four months later by Brigitte Macron: La confidente. We were also treated to Les Macron and Lettre Ouverte à Brigitte Macron, a plea for assisted dying by an author hoping she would pass the message on to her other half so he’d make it legal.
FEB4	One day, a second people’s vote will bring us back into the EU. But when?	I marched for a “people’s vote”. I co-wrote a book making the case for one, a case that included a massive programme of reform. I have argued for it in many public meetings. Britain can and must be a member of this club of like-minded European states at the global standard-setting centre of the world’s largest free-trading network. It transcends the World Trade Organization in importance and reach, confirmed on Friday by the Japan-EU trade deal. For the EU is the enabler of prosperity and guarantor of peace in Europe. It is the friend of every principal economic interest group – from farmers to magic circle law firms, from university lecturers to trade unionists. The British are culturally and philosophically Europeans, even though too many still believe in the myth of our Dunkirk spirit exceptionalism.
FEB4	The Tories should heed Oliver Letwin. They won’t be forgiven a no-deal Brexit	One of the better, because more honest, speeches delivered during parliament’s most recent Brexit debate came from Oliver Letwin. While other Tories carried on fantasising and wrangling about what they would or would not permit, Sir Oliver confessed that he was “past caring what deal we have” and would support whatever Mrs May comes up with next. He would do so, the former cabinet minister explained, because if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal and the consequences are bad, “my party will not be forgiven for many years”. Were I a Tory, I’d pay attention to that warning. Sir Oliver speaks with experience of what follows when politicians wilfully inflict abominations on their voters. He was one of the architects of the poll tax in the 1980s. Some readers may need reminding that this reckless experiment in changing local taxation without thinking through the consequences led to rioting in Trafalgar Square and the defenestration of Margaret Thatcher at the hands of her own party.
FEB4	We’re fixated by giving things up. After Dry January, I’m saying yes to indulgence	The dryness of January ended with overnight snowfall and, according to the app on my phone, the saving of 72 units of alcohol, £84 and 4,697 calories. The calendar shows I managed 29 drink-free days. One night is accounted for by a birthday party at which I drank three glasses of champagne and the hostess’s daughter surprisingly burst out of a cake. The night before, having an early-evening meal in an Italian restaurant, I became so exasperated by the boredom, the sheer even-keel of my days, their monotonous sameness of my mood, that I ordered an Aperol spritz and felt that familiar surge of temporary joy and satisfaction that I associate with the varied world of cocktails. I’ve never given anything up for Lent. I’ve never even managed 24 hours of Yom Kippur fasting. I’m new to this world. I didn’t think there was a problem with my drinking. I assumed I was a moderate drinker – one or two units, three or four times a week, less if I’m not going out, more if I’m on holiday, when a glass of chilly white wine is the boundary between swimming pool and dinner table. I don’t go to pubs, I almost never drink at lunchtime, I don’t go on benders. It’s many years since I had a hangover and it would never have occurred to me to give up alcohol were it not for the relentless nagging of the Dry January campaign, promising me undreamed-of benefits: better sleep, more money, more energy, weight loss and – this was a new whammy – lowering one’s risk of cancer.

FEB5	Liam Neeson’s interview shows that for some, black people are still not fully human	“When I was coming up in Mississippi I never knew it was against the law to kill a black man,” the late Buford Posey told me when he was 79. “I learned that when I went in the army. I was 17 years old. When they told me I thought they were joking.” I was grateful for his candour. Back in the day they used to call it “nigger hunting”. A posse of “good ol’ boys” would head out in search of a black man to pay the price for his melanin and their inadequacies. It was a relief to have a white person offer an honest reflection on the racial mores of the time. So following Liam Neeson’s recent interview we should, at the very least, admire him for his candour. For all the talk of a post-racial society and Enlightenment values, here’s a white man who admits he literally went out for a week or more looking for a black man to murder. It seems the bad old days of Buford Posey’s youth aren’t as distant a memory as some would like to think. When it comes to race and racism we are not simply far from the place many thought we were; we are not even where even more still pretend to be. The next time someone asks me why I have a chip on my shoulder, I need no longer brush the question away with disdain. I can say, with all sincerity: “Because there may well be an Oscar-nominated actor out there who wants to kill me, so I have to be alert at all times.”
FEB5	So Revolut, I’m a single woman. How does that make me a sad, lonely loser?	Face it. You’re a loser. You’re a sad, lonely, loser. There you are, slumped on your sofa, gulping down a bowl of grease alone. And you thought you could keep it secret! Well, we know exactly what you’re doing and we think it’s tragic – but also quite funny. So we thought we’d get everyone else to titter at the mess you’ve made of your life. This appeared to be the message one company was keen to send out to single women this week. Next to a giant bank card on one of the billboard ads for financial technology company Revolut were the words: “To the 12,750 people who ordered a single takeaway on Valentine’s Day”. Followed by the punchline: “You OK, hun?”
FEB5	MPs, step away from the social media. Twitter is not your friend	In the early 2000s politicians sometimes made the mistake of agreeing to be interviewed by Ali G, the spoof character played by Sacha Baron Cohen. It never went well for them. In 2004, in the process of navigating Ali G’s confusion over BLTs (bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches) and WMDs (weapons of mass destruction), the American pundit Pat Buchanan ended up stating that Saddam Hussein was “at one time … using BLTs on the Kurds”. (“Is it ever worth fighting a war over sandwiches?” his interviewer replied). The Green party presidential candidate Ralph Nader was lured by his host’s questions into discussing the difficulties of getting cows to break wind into boxes so as to conserve energy. Any good these people had imagined might be done them by the exposure was always entirely undone by the nature of that exposure. They always ended up looking like idiots. A similar mistake is made when British politicians decide to join Twitter. Almost all MPs have an account now and some tweet more than 60 times a day. But Twitter is not there to help them. It is there to trip them up. First it lulls them into a false sense of security – rewarding chit chat about their pets or their constituency, welcoming them into an environment where other people (not MPs) are free to tweet unguarded thoughts and opinions – and then, at some unspecified but certain point, it brutally shames them in front of the whole world. Twitter has nothing to lose, and they do.
FEB5	The EU’s deal with Libya is sentencing refugees to death	Haftom, a 32-year-old Eritrean dentist, used to tell a joke that went like this: “God was watching the globe and saw Eritrea was green. ‘How did this country become so green,’ he wondered, and went to investigate. But when he got there he saw the green was overcrowded militias.” Of course this was black humour. Like tens of thousands of others, Haftom fled Eritrea, one of the most isolated dictatorships in the world. He wanted to get away from brutal leaders who controlled every aspect of his life, from his profession and his salary to where he could live and what he could speak about. Friends described him as a “quiet, smart” man, who had eventually despaired of any chance that things would get better.
FEB5	Who’s going to care about the women being forced out of work?	What would drive thousands of people a year out of jobs they love, or need, with no certainty about whether they will ever be able to come back? If you have parents of a certain age, you might already have guessed the answer. About 600 people a day are giving up their jobs to look after elderly or sick relatives, the charity Carers UK estimates, a hidden exodus from working life that we don’t discuss nearly enough. Young women are bombarded practically from the cradle with conflicting advice about how to “have it all” as working mothers, yet hear almost nothing about coping as working daughters in an age of unravelling safety nets. (And yes, about 42% of carers are male, which means many thousands of men are also toiling unpaid round the clock; but women are statistically more likely to care for parents and men for spouses, meaning men are more likely to care in retirement and women when they are still young enough to be working).
FEB5	Parliament voted to get a Brexit deal done now. So let’s make it happen	Parliamentary turmoil over Brexit has lasted almost 1,000 days and still the arguments rage. Last week saw a glimmer of a solution. Strip away the theatrics and the parliamentary proceduralism and it became pretty clear what parliament voted for.
FEB5	Fantasies of Dunkirk spirit couldn’t survive a no-deal Brexit	There’s a frisson of excitement in the air among Brexiters. The coming crisis brings an eve-of-battle thrill to those who invented all this pointlessness. They relish a cataclysm to blame on the “enemy” across the Channel. “There is hope,” says Jacob Rees-Mogg. “Tick tock goes the clock, and as it ticks down we get closer to leaving. And when we leave, we have taken back control, we are in charge!” Geronimo! No-deal Brexit will feel about as “in control” as a blindfold skiing novice pushed off-piste from a black run. But it certainly won’t be dull. We have lived 74 years of boring peace on our shores, so the Brexiters savour a faux-war to test our mettle. If you enjoy those olden-days TV shows, Back in Time for School/Dinner, no deal will let us play it at home. Can we still survive hard times? How’s your kitchen cupboard? How’s your nerve? How’s your business and your job? Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, it’s time to test our national fibre.
FEB5	Hermes is now delivering on workers’ rights. Is the gig economy changing?	In Greek mythology, Hermes is the god of trade, commerce, merchants, roads and travellers, but also the god of trickery. The parcel delivery firm that shares its name with a French fashion house, an asset management company and the Olympian deity, might be associated with all those things, except – as of this week – possibly the last on that list. After hundreds of Hermes couriers in summer 2018 won the right to be recognised as “workers” at an employment tribunal, the company this week offered guaranteed minimum wages and holiday pay to its drivers – the first such offer in the industry. The agreement means that the 15,000 individuals ferrying parcels up and down the country every day can still enjoy all the flexibilities associated with being self-employed if they choose to, but they will also be able to opt into contracts that provide far more favourable rights.
FEB5	I'm a civil servant. Trust me, we're nowhere near ready for no-deal Brexit	I’m a civil servant working for a UK government department. We haven’t been directly convulsed by Brexit yet, but hundreds of us will soon be conscripted into the Brexit crisis thunderdome. Welcome to Operation Yellowhammer. This is basically an emergency plan that prepares the government for a no-deal Brexit. It is currently winkling thousands of officials from across Whitehall out of their day jobs to focus on helping Brexit-facing departments – Defra, the Department for International Trade and the Home Office – to cope with the havoc that will engulf them if the worst happens. Yellowhammer, eh? Who dreams up these Brexit crisis-limitation codenames? It’s probably a secret cry for help from some wizened Treasury or Cabinet Office official. That’s why Operation Brock, which tested no-deal readiness to keep the British freight industry moving, was supposed to sound like an army exercise to prepare British people to safely find, kill and cook badger.
FEB5	Recognising Juan Guaidó risks a bloody civil war in Venezuela	The latest troubling events in Venezuela are the most recent episode in a political crisis that has been festering since the death of Hugo Chávez six years ago. Following President Nicolás Maduro’s inauguration for a disputed second term in January, the speaker of the opposition-dominated parliament, Juan Guaidó, declared himself “interim president” of the country. Guaidó was immediately recognised by the US, Canada and a group of Latin American conservative governments, who called upon the Venezuelan military to rise up against Maduro. And today the UK, France, Spain, Germany and other European countries recognised Guaidó after Maduro refused their demand to call fresh elections. Since Guaidó’s declaration, the Trump administration has imposed new sanctions on Maduro’s government, seized billions-worth of Venezuelan oil-related assets on US soil, and started making barely veiled threats of military intervention. Few would disagree that the country is in a disastrous economic and social situation, but before other governments take similar actions that could exacerbate Venezuela’s political polarisation and end up provoking a bloody civil war, we should first understand how it reached this state of crisis.

FEB6	The UK right loves this youth group. But it has a worrying US history	As political launches go, it fish-tailed, rather than flew. Amid a raft of endorsements from conservative and reactionary figures, Turning Point UK, a local offshoot of an American conservative youth movement, hit social media with all the grace of a pigeon slamming into a plate-glass window. Instead of a brave bunch of plucky young Britons ready to crowbar free the stranglehold the left supposedly has on UK youth, our heroes were subjected to a sustained shower of ridicule the likes of which hasn’t been seen on Twitter for, well, at least a fortnight. Turning Point UK says it aims to challenge the idea that young people are inherently left-leaning, and seeks to fight against “socialism, racism and identity politics”. But recommendations from such reactionary “bad boys” as Infowars’ Paul Joseph Watson, Breitbart’s James Delingpole and Westminster’s Michael Heaver weren’t enough to drown out the ridicule. Nor were the endorsements from Tory right MPs such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, Ben Bradley, Priti Patel, Chris Green and Steve Baker, among others. The wisecracks – particularly about star recruit Darren Grimes, who is still looking at a £20,000 fine from the Electoral Commission – simply wrote themselves.
FEB6	The EU’s deal with Libya is sentencing refugees to death	Haftom, a 32-year-old Eritrean dentist, used to tell a joke that went like this: “God was watching the globe and saw Eritrea was green. ‘How did this country become so green,’ he wondered, and went to investigate.

FEB6	Another Brexit referendum would be the EU’s worst nightmare	Is it not time for the (Dis)united Kingdom to adopt a new national anthem? A song more suited, perhaps, to the extraordinary spectacle that it has been putting on for the world since 23 June 2016?. I’d vote for Hotel California by the Eagles: “We are all just prisoners here, Of our own device [...] You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.” Britain reminds me of the drug addict of the song who wants to get clean but keeps failing.
FEB6	A statue of Margaret Thatcher? No plinth will be too high for the vandals	Place an obstacle in the path and many people will seek to overcome it. Urban planners build footpaths, pedestrians forge their own desire lines. Hanging a “Do not climb” plaque is often a psychological incentive for people to clamber on to the forbidden edifice. This aspect of human nature should have occurred to the people behind the proposed installation of an enormous Margaret Thatcher statue in her home town, Grantham, in Lincolnshire. In order to prevent the statue being besieged by vandals, it will have to stand atop a three-metre (10ft) plinth. Creative critics of Thatcher’s legacy have already proposed workarounds: paintball target practice, hammer-throwing competitions, and the simple but trusty ladder. The depth of antipathy to the former prime minister means no matter what is built in her honour, it will draw vandals and dissenters. Knowing in advance that a statue commemorating her is likely to be defaced immediately, it is mystifying to insist on erecting it at all. Thatcher’s legacy remains with us today, and is still comfortably within living memory: that history, therefore, is still contested and fought over. Her fans and critics are embroiled in a battle to have their perspective recognised and recorded in history’s narrative.

Last week saw a glimmer of a solution. Strip away the theatrics and the parliamentary proceduralism and it became pretty clear what parliament voted for.
FEB6	Fantasies of Dunkirk spirit couldn’t survive a no-deal Brexit	There’s a frisson of excitement in the air among Brexiters. The coming crisis brings an eve-of-battle thrill to those who invented all this pointlessness. They relish a cataclysm to blame on the “enemy” across the Channel. “There is hope,” says Jacob Rees-Mogg. “Tick tock goes the clock, and as it ticks down we get closer to leaving. And when we leave, we have taken back control, we are in charge!” Geronimo! No-deal Brexit will feel about as “in control” as a blindfold skiing novice pushed off-piste from a black run. But it certainly won’t be dull. We have lived 74 years of boring peace on our shores, so the Brexiters savour a faux-war to test our mettle. If you enjoy those olden-days TV shows, Back in Time for School/Dinner, no deal will let us play it at home. Can we still survive hard times? How’s your kitchen cupboard? How’s your nerve? How’s your business and your job? Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, it’s time to test our national fibre.
FEB7	Why disaster capitalists are praying for a no-deal Brexit	Part of me wants to smash it all up. I want to see the British bubble burst: the imperial nostalgia, the groundless belief in the inherent greatness of this nation; the casual dishonesty of those who govern us; the xenophobia; the intolerance; the denial; the complacency. I want those who have caused the coming disaster to own it, so that nobody ever believes them again. No-deal Brexit? Bring it on. Such dark thoughts do not last long. It will be the poor who get hurt, first and worst. The rich leavers demanding the hardest of possible Brexits, with their offshore accounts, homes abroad and lavish pensions, will be all right. I remember the eerie silence of the City of London. While the bosses of companies producing goods and tangible services write anxious letters to the papers, the financial sector has stayed largely shtum. Shorting sterling is just the first of its possible gains.
FEB7	Yes, I do give a sh*t about these sweary book covers	Among the boom in self-help books on the shelves this year there is a title by life coach Andrea Owen called How to Stop Feeling Like Sh*t. It has a quote on the cover from Jen Sincero, author of You Are a Badass, and comes hard on the heels of Unf*ck Yourself; F*ck Feelings; F**k Anxiety; Calm the F**k Down; Unf*ck Your Brain; How to Make Sh*t Happen; and the mother of all sweary self-help titles, Mark Manson’s 2016 juggernaut The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck. Most of these books present perfectly sensible ideas about how to stop jeopardising your own efforts and escape negative thought-loops. They compile lists of bad habits and address self-defeating behaviours and a few years ago, when the trend started taking off, they sounded naughty and arresting in a light-handed way.
FEB7	Labour will be punished by voters if it gives any backing at all to Brexit	Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to Theresa May last night offering to slightly soften his Brexit stance risks stirring a backlash from Labour supporters. A new poll makes it devastatingly clear that if Labour is perceived as having enabled Brexit, it will lose 45 seats – including five of its seven precious Scottish seats. Labour’s true heartlands are remain: four-fifths of Labour voters think May’s deal will hurt the British economy and 91% of them don’t trust the government to deliver a good Brexit. Remainers will desert and punish the party in droves unless it opposes Brexit. This outlook comes from a large poll of more than 5,000 people – it was commissioned by TSSA, the transport union, which has always backed Corbyn. It was meant to be private advice to him, but it leaked. “There can be no disguising the sense of disappointment and disillusionment with Labour if it fails to oppose Brexit, and there is every indication that it will be far more damaging to the party’s electoral fortunes than the Iraq war,” the polling document reports.
FEB7	Teaching all pupils to act more like Etonians won’t help solve inequality	It really does take a special kind of inattention to observe public life today and conclude that what we need is more public school swagger. Our politics is currently dominated by men who are so convinced of their own swag it’s dangerous. We know where politics as a debating society with no real-world consequences leads: Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson are exemplary only in their callous recklessness. Still, here we have the education secretary, Damian Hinds (I know no one knows who he is or what he does, as Brexit has vacuumed all policy into its void), suggesting that state school pupils should practise debating and public speaking to compete against Old Etonians in the workplace. “Public school confidence” is something he wants to “call time” on, so that all kinds of everyone can hold their own. Wow. This is hardly an unfamiliar idea, is it? That one can achieve privilege through class mimicry instead of, er … having actual privilege. In order to be taken seriously one must adhere to the mores of those who have effortlessly risen to the top because of their special education.
FEB7	How could a cheerleader for Ukip ever become CEO of Women’s Aid?	In early January, I was due to speak at the opening of an exhibition about the domestic violence refuges of the 1970s and 1980s. Out of curiosity, I Googled the woman who was to speak alongside me: Katie Ghose, at the time the CEO of Women’s Aid. What I discovered astounded me. In 2015, two years before she joined Women’s Aid, she had, as CEO of the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), spoken at the Ukip annual conference and enthused about the party’s “passion for a new way of doing politics”, referring to Douglas Carswell as “an outstanding MP” and praising Nigel Farage. At a fringe event organised by ERS at the Ukip conference, she had hosted Katie Hopkins, who had ranted about gassing members of the House of Lords.
FEB7	Labour MPs must not be fooled by Theresa May’s Brexit promises	Just when we think we have reached peak Brexit complexity, we always seem to go one better. As Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to Theresa May laying out Labour’s terms for supporting her deal made the headlines, I simultaneously got an email from a local party member decrying Labour “facilitating Brexit” and a text from a local resident saying, “Yay, this is clear and offers a soft Brexit.” Putting aside issues of where such a move leaves Labour with members and the electorate, where does this letter leave us in terms of the potential renegade Labour MPs willing to vote for May’s deal as long as there are sweeteners? In the absence of May being able to ensure a permanent customs union, it seems to make it more likely that Brexit bribes will be on offer, and potentially more likely that they’ll be taken up. It’s not just the political dangers of such a move that are a problem here, it’s that a politically motivated, half-baked, short-term regional investment programme will do nothing to address deep-rooted inequalities in the UK.
FEB7	Climate change is the deadliest legacy we will leave the young	One of the strange things that happens when you start work on a novel is that you realise what’s been preoccupying you – sometimes without you knowing it. I was about a third of the way into my new novel, The Wall, when I discovered that I was completely obsessed by intergenerational inequality. In particular, by the question of intergenerational inequality linked to climate change. Who knew? Certainly not me. Now, there’s nothing wrong with intergenerational inequality. At least, there’s nothing wrong with the version of it that existed in the developed world for much of the 20th century. That kind of inequality was based on the idea that life should be gradually better, from one generation to another – more secure, more prosperous, healthier, longer. That means that children got a better deal than their parents, but that was fine; indeed, in this version of the social contract, that was the whole point.
FEB7	Forget new trade deals – Britain’s struggling to keep the ones it has	“Global Britain” advocates often fail to acknowledge the long list of countries the UK already has free trade agreements (FTAs) with, by virtue of its EU membership. The EU’s trade partners include Turkey, Israel, Morocco, South Korea, South Africa, Chile, Mexico and, more recently, Canada and Japan. And these agreements matter to British business: up to 15% of UK exports are to countries the EU already has a trade agreement with. It is of little surprise that the Brexit priority for most British businesses – after securing a deep relationship with the UK’s most important trading partner, the EU – is not future free trade agreements with the US, New Zealand and others, but replacing those that already exist.
FEB7	Only a small, sad nation robs its people of arts and culture	As it emerged Grantham Museum will soon look out on to a bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher, I found myself thinking about the last time I stepped foot in there. Growing up in the town in the 1990s, the local museum was a cheap trip out for my primary school class, a sea of sticky fingers smudging the glass. I still remember the smell – a sort of musty air mixed with a whiff of adventure.
FEB7	Why are so many women writing about rough sex?	Recently I have found myself wondering about the prevalence of rough sex in new fiction written by women. It’s viscerally present in You Know You Want This, the new short-story collection by Kristen Roupenian (who shot to fame last year with Cat Person, published in the New Yorker): I found some of the scenes so unpalatable that I had to keep putting it down. They (spoiler alert) include a woman strangled to death as part of a sex game; a man who imagines his penis is a knife when he has sex; and a woman who says to the guy she is sleeping with: “I want you to punch me in the face as hard as you can. After you’ve punched me, when I’ve fallen down, I want you to kick me in the stomach. And then we can have sex.” Now, my personal discomfort with the sexual content is no comment on its quality – fiction that never challenges us isn’t good fiction at all. Each reader can make up their own mind about how good the work is. But what is interesting about this rough sex is what it tells us about the current cultural moment. It is supposed to be edgy and transgressive – in You Know You Want This, it feels deliberately put there to shock – and yet it’s everywhere. More often than not it is women writing it and female characters desiring it, and frequently those characters are using sadomasochistic sex as a way of processing their own trauma. The #MeToo and Time’s Up movements have shone a light on abuse and harassment, so it’s no wonder a new generation of women are exploring how that manifests itself in sexual relationships.

FEB9	In the age of Trump and Bezos, public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase	Is there a Russian piss-tape of Donald Trump? Did a government agency intercept Amazon boss Jeff Bezos’s dick pics? How did Trump’s cheerleaders at the National Enquirer get them? Is this part of Trump’s willy-waving at Bezos as owner of the Washington Post? Does the Enquirer’s apparent blackmail threat to Bezos breach its plea deal with Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation, which gave its owners, American Media Inc, immunity in exchange for evidence about Michael Cohen’s role in its policy of buying and killing Trump sex exposés? Is Riyadh somehow involved, given AMI’s business ties with senior Saudi figures, and given that Bezos owns the Washington Post, whose columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by the regime last October? Guys, I don’t know the answer to any of these questions, but I am enjoying this reminder of why literally every American president has had a penis and why more than 95% of Fortune 500 CEOs do, too. Face it: the plotlines are just better. Public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase.
FEB9	We can’t wait for a people’s vote: make the case against Brexit right now	Sounding the klaxon and warning of imminent disaster is, it turns out, an even older British tradition than you might think. A tour of the spellbinding Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms exhibition at the British Library confirms that back in the year 540, a scribbling sermoniser by the name of Gildas – surely the Guardian columnist of his day – was writing “on the ruin of Britain”. Even before the country properly existed, there were Cassandras to prophesy its demise. Still, that same exhibition leaves the visitor in no doubt that what will befall these islands in less than 50 days is of epic significance, breaking a thread that has run through our long history. Even in the age of Mercia, the kingdom strained hard to connect with its neighbours in “Francia”, Rome and Ireland. The 10th-century court of Æthelstan was a cosmopolitan magnet to scholars from all over the continent. And need we mention that the Anglo-Saxons were themselves migrants from northern Europe? The Faragiste tendency, which imagines a British past pure and unsullied by the taint of Europe, imagines a past that did not exist.
FEB9	Liam Neeson started a vital debate. To condemn him is to end it	Everyone seems to have had their say on the Liam Neeson’s “racist” interview, including me. I seem to be one of very few people defending him, and I’d like to explain why. I have been accused of being an apologist for a racist, but let me start off by saying that I’m sure that Neeson is as unconsciously racially biased as the next person. Myself included. This is perfectly understandable when you consider the value and worth ascribed to different groups by our society. This is deeply ingrained in our history, literature, news reporting and beyond – whether it’s Muslim grooming gangs, Nigerian conmen or Jamaican drug dealers.
FEB9	Whatever Luciana Berger’s politics, Labour members must stand with her against antisemitism	Some things in politics are far from being clear-cut. Here’s something that is. Luciana Berger, Labour’s MP for Liverpool Wavertree, is the victim of antisemitic abuse and harassment. She has suffered this for years. In October 2014, a neo-Nazi was jailed for sending her an antisemitic tweet. Another online troll was jailed for spewing racist bile at her two years later. Yet another was jailed in 2017 after calling Berger “Jewish scum ? and suggesting she would “get it like Jo Cox ?. Berger has used Twitter to highlight some of the vile antisemitic abuse she received – some of which looks like grotesque propaganda from 1930s Nazi Germany. Berger has been courageous in confronting the hatred directed against her because she is Jewish, and not only deserves solidarity, but requires it. The horror of antisemitism cannot be minimised. Last year, there were 1,652 antisemitic incidents in the UK, a 16% increase on the year before, including verbal abuse on the streets. If you fail to extend solidarity to a victim of antisemitism because you do not agree with their politics, then you do not truly oppose antisemitism at all. Neither Labour’s leadership nor the vast majority of Labour members are antisemitic; but antisemitism does exist on fringes of the left, and there has to be far more seriousness in rooting it out. Those who deny it exists at all – who think it’s entirely a smear campaign and nothing else – are part of the problem.
FEB9	Why disaster capitalists are praying for a no-deal Brexit	Part of me wants to smash it all up. I want to see the British bubble burst: the imperial nostalgia, the groundless belief in the inherent greatness of this nation; the casual dishonesty of those who govern us; the xenophobia; the intolerance; the denial; the complacency. I want those who have caused the coming disaster to own it, so that nobody ever believes them again. No-deal Brexit? Bring it on. Such dark thoughts do not last long. It will be the poor who get hurt, first and worst. The rich leavers demanding the hardest of possible Brexits, with their offshore accounts, homes abroad and lavish pensions, will be all right. I remember the eerie silence of the City of London. While the bosses of companies producing goods and tangible services write anxious letters to the papers, the financial sector has stayed largely shtum. Shorting sterling is just the first of its possible gains.
FEB9	Goop has a Netflix deal – this is a dangerous win for pseudoscience	Are you wary of experts? Do you enjoy a fact-free lifestyle? Are you itching to splurge on non-toxic skin creams and 24-carat-gold sex toys? Well, I’ve got brilliant news. Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s controversial lifestyle brand, has signed a deal with Netflix. Soon we will all be able to stream Paltrow’s glamorous strain of woo on demand. Keeping with the general theme of Goop, facts about the new Netflix project are hard to come by. All we know so far is that the docuseries’ 30-minute episodes will be hosted by Paltrow and Elise Loehnen, Goop’s chief content officer. Loehnen has also said the series “seeks to dial up the aesthetics and quality of storytelling surrounding issues like mental, physical and sexual health”. Which, again keeping with the general theme of Goop, sounds lovely but means little.
FEB9	My wife ended her life at Dignitas. Then the police came to talk to me	I could not fail to be moved when I read the Whaley family’s story this week. Geoff Whaley, who had terminal motor neurone disease, died on Thursday morning in the arms of his wife Ann at the Dignitas assisted dying facility in Switzerland. He was able to fulfil his final wish to have control over his end and die peacefully – rather than endure the final months of agony that his illness had in store for him. Their carefully laid plans had been jeopardised at the last moment when an anonymous call was made to social services, alerted the police of their intentions. Ann, acting purely out of love and compassion, was made to feel like a criminal for supporting her husband. Anyone would feel for the family, but this affected me more than most.
FEB9	The France-Italy row is theatrical – but such shows are dangerous for Europe	To describe this as the worst crisis between France and Italy since the second world war seems a bit of an overstatement. It’s not exactly as if troops are about to march across the Alps – as Mussolini’s did in 1940. Still, when France recalled its ambassador from Rome this week after Italy’s deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, had met a group of gilets jaunes protesters in central France, it felt as if European politics had taken a dangerous turn. Di Maio, a leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, had tweeted a photo of the meeting with the words: “the winds of change have crossed the Alps”. No two European countries are culturally and historically closer than France and Italy. They are founding members of the European project. The two countries obsess about food and fashion alike – they are Mediterranean and of a “Latin” culture.
FEB9	Think the backstop issue is insoluble? My Brexit plan will please everyone	What would prompt an academic from Germany to come up with a plan to try to end the current stalemate on the backstop – the mechanism designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit? The answer has three parts: experience in negotiations gained during my time with a multinational company, an academic interest in Brexit since 2016 including a study in which I compared it for complexity with the first moon landing and the third is that I’m a father of two who can vividly imagine the consequences for families on both sides of the UK/EU divide if these negotiations fail. My experience of business negotiations in China and Russia convinced me of how crucial trust is. Without it, any negotiation is doomed to failure. You have to put yourself in the shoes of the other side and, tough as that may be, accept that you are not always right. When we look at the deadlock between London and Brussels over the Northern Ireland backstop what we can observe after nearly two years of negotiations is the total breakdown of trust. Once you hear from both sides the words “this is a matter of principle …” you know you are very close to a showdown.
FEB9	Lung cancer needn’t be a killer. NHS mobile chest scans will save lives	A decade ago, I decided to devote my career to tackling what many saw as one of medicine’s biggest challenges: lung cancer, a “smokers’ disease” shrouded in unfair stigma, prevalent among the most disadvantaged. Patients would frequently arrive at clinic with the disease well advanced, with few options beyond harsh radiotherapy and chemotherapy to buy a few extra months. Curative surgery was effective only for a small, fortunate proportion of patients who were diagnosed early. Ten years on, much of this is still true. The disease still claims 35,000 lives prematurely every year, many from the more deprived sectors of society. Late diagnosis is still a huge issue, with two-thirds diagnosed at an advanced, incurable stage. In survival terms, we’re still doing worse than many comparable countries.
FEB10	A hidden government is preparing for Brexit… by keeping us in the dark	Brexit is killing many myths, but its chief victim is the belief that Britain is not an absurd country. The British establishment believed in our innate common sense, as did admiring foreigners. Weirdly, the supposedly cynical British public still does. Voters damn politicians, but assume they will somehow find a way through. I doubt their confidence will last and they will soon see our new United Kingdom of Absurdistan for what it is: a land where civil servants send military advisers into government departments, as if the mandarins were planning a coup, or draw up emergency measures to lift the Queen fall-of-Saigon style from Buckingham Palace or stockpile medicines as if we were at war. We are at war in a sense, only Brexit is a war the British have declared on themselves and still do not realise they are fighting.
FEB10	What does Liam Neeson’s ‘primal urge’ really tell us about racism?	It’s been one hell of a week in the wide, wide world of racism. On Monday, the Egyptian international Mohamed Salah was subjected to alleged racist abuse during Liverpool’s match with West Ham. On Wednesday, memories of the Windrush scandal were awoken when 29 people were forcibly expelled from the UK on a charter flight to Jamaica. Then, on Thursday, Gucci released a polo neck jumper that covers the mouth and the chin of the wearer, making them resemble a blackface minstrel. You know, like you do. Anyone hoping to cut through the background hum of structural inequality and racial insensitivity was really going to have to pull something special out of the bag. Cue Liam Neeson, who revealed that 40 years ago he had entertained a racist lynching fantasy and actually gone out looking for a black man to murder. The response of Neeson’s co-star, Tom Bateman, who was sitting beside him, set the tone for what was to follow: “Holy shit.”
FEB10	Since when was it a police job to impose sanctions on drill musicians?	The authorities ban musicians from playing without official approval. The police prevent them from performing a song deemed unacceptable. The courts threaten to imprison them when they do play it. All this not in Russia or Iran but in Britain. Last month, two “drill” musicians, Skengdo and AM from the Brixton group 410, were given nine-month suspended sentences. Their crime? Performing their song Attempted 1.0 at a gig in December. In so doing, they breached a court injunction issued in August. It was, producer and writer Ian McQuaid observed, “a watershed moment for the censorship of culture”.

Guys, I don’t know the answer to any of these questions, but I am enjoying this reminder of why literally every American president has had a penis and why more than 95% of Fortune 500 CEOs do, too. Face it: the plotlines are just better. Public life is one big smutty ancient Greek vase.
FEB10	There will be no fake news in Martin Clunes’ Islands of America	The unwritten rules of documentary-making can be a more controversial topic than one might expect – remember Mary Beard’s courageous admission that she isn’t all that keen on re-enactments – but you know it’s time to listen when Martin Clunes, the king of gentle travel-ish shows with a side serving of animals, has something to say. In the run-up to his new series, Islands of America (last week: Hawaii, Alaska, bear cubs), Clunes told the Radio Times that he was not a fan of documentary cliches such as “pretending to meet people for the first time when you’ve already met them the night before. If the crew want to shoot me doing a meet and greet, it has to be genuine.” Coincidentally, I read this as I was watching the final season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. One of the episodes is a self-referential documentary for the streaming service “Houseflix”, in which a celebrity DJ attempts to uncover the truth about Jon Hamm’s incarcerated kidnapper and rapist, Richard Wayne Gary Wayne. It’s a collection of modern investigative documentary cliches, from the grainy home footage compilation in the opening credits to the scruffy but tenacious lawyer working from his home office.
FEB10	We can’t wait for a people’s vote: make the case against Brexit right now	Sounding the klaxon and warning of imminent disaster is, it turns out, an even older British tradition than you might think. A tour of the spellbinding Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms exhibition at the British Library confirms that back in the year 540, a scribbling sermoniser by the name of Gildas – surely the Guardian columnist of his day – was writing “on the ruin of Britain”. Even before the country properly existed, there were Cassandras to prophesy its demise. Still, that same exhibition leaves the visitor in no doubt that what will befall these islands in less than 50 days is of epic significance, breaking a thread that has run through our long history. Even in the age of Mercia, the kingdom strained hard to connect with its neighbours in “Francia”, Rome and Ireland. The 10th-century court of Æthelstan was a cosmopolitan magnet to scholars from all over the continent. And need we mention that the Anglo-Saxons were themselves migrants from northern Europe? The Faragiste tendency, which imagines a British past pure and unsullied by the taint of Europe, imagines a past that did not exist.
FEB10	Liam Neeson started a vital debate. To condemn him is to end it	Everyone seems to have had their say on the Liam Neeson’s “racist” interview, including me. I seem to be one of very few people defending him, and I’d like to explain why. I have been accused of being an apologist for a racist, but let me start off by saying that I’m sure that Neeson is as unconsciously racially biased as the next person. Myself included. This is perfectly understandable when you consider the value and worth ascribed to different groups by our society. This is deeply ingrained in our history, literature, news reporting and beyond – whether it’s Muslim grooming gangs, Nigerian conmen or Jamaican drug dealers.
FEB10	Whatever Luciana Berger’s politics, Labour members must stand with her against antisemitism	Some things in politics are far from being clear-cut. Here’s something that is. Luciana Berger, Labour’s MP for Liverpool Wavertree, is the victim of antisemitic abuse and harassment. She has suffered this for years. In October 2014, a neo-Nazi was jailed for sending her an antisemitic tweet. Another online troll was jailed for spewing racist bile at her two years later. Yet another was jailed in 2017 after calling Berger “Jewish scum ? and suggesting she would “get it like Jo Cox ?. Berger has used Twitter to highlight some of the vile antisemitic abuse she received – some of which looks like grotesque propaganda from 1930s Nazi Germany. Berger has been courageous in confronting the hatred directed against her because she is Jewish, and not only deserves solidarity, but requires it. The horror of antisemitism cannot be minimised. Last year, there were 1,652 antisemitic incidents in the UK, a 16% increase on the year before, including verbal abuse on the streets. If you fail to extend solidarity to a victim of antisemitism because you do not agree with their politics, then you do not truly oppose antisemitism at all. Neither Labour’s leadership nor the vast majority of Labour members are antisemitic; but antisemitism does exist on fringes of the left, and there has to be far more seriousness in rooting it out. Those who deny it exists at all – who think it’s entirely a smear campaign and nothing else – are part of the problem.
FEB10	Why disaster capitalists are praying for a no-deal Brexit	Part of me wants to smash it all up. I want to see the British bubble burst: the imperial nostalgia, the groundless belief in the inherent greatness of this nation; the casual dishonesty of those who govern us; the xenophobia; the intolerance; the denial; the complacency. I want those who have caused the coming disaster to own it, so that nobody ever believes them again. No-deal Brexit? Bring it on. Such dark thoughts do not last long. It will be the poor who get hurt, first and worst. The rich leavers demanding the hardest of possible Brexits, with their offshore accounts, homes abroad and lavish pensions, will be all right. I remember the eerie silence of the City of London. While the bosses of companies producing goods and tangible services write anxious letters to the papers, the financial sector has stayed largely shtum. Shorting sterling is just the first of its possible gains.
FEB10	Goop has a Netflix deal – this is a dangerous win for pseudoscience	Are you wary of experts? Do you enjoy a fact-free lifestyle? Are you itching to splurge on non-toxic skin creams and 24-carat-gold sex toys? Well, I’ve got brilliant news. Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s controversial lifestyle brand, has signed a deal with Netflix. Soon we will all be able to stream Paltrow’s glamorous strain of woo on demand. Keeping with the general theme of Goop, facts about the new Netflix project are hard to come by. All we know so far is that the docuseries’ 30-minute episodes will be hosted by Paltrow and Elise Loehnen, Goop’s chief content officer. Loehnen has also said the series “seeks to dial up the aesthetics and quality of storytelling surrounding issues like mental, physical and sexual health”. Which, again keeping with the general theme of Goop, sounds lovely but means little.
FEB11	Have MPs, finally, come up with a decent Brexit proposal?	It all has the feel of the world’s most boring thriller. Though there are only just under seven weeks left until Britain’s official date of departure from the European Union, public life seems drowsy with a lethal brew of fatalism, insouciance and burrowing cowardice. On the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show this morning, James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, looked less like the minister charged with preparing local government for the social chaos of a no-deal outcome than a beaming salesman politely urging a client to renew his contents insurance policy.
FEB11	Why study English? We’re poorer in every sense without it	The lack of science, maths and language teachers has been talked about for years. But a shortage of English teachers has gone under the radar. Although last year’s target for new trainees was met, in the two previous years it was missed. English used to be among the most popular subjects, both to teach and to learn. Lessons had a reputation for being creative, thought-provoking – and even fun. Philip Pullman, David Almond and Joanne Harris were all teachers before they became authors. But dramatic reductions in the number of A-level entries and applications to study English at university suggest that some of the enthusiasm long associated with English has drained away. The figures are most startling at A-level, where the number of students in England taking English language or literature has fallen 25% since 2013 (a pattern mirrored in Wales and Northern Ireland but not Scotland). While a demographic dip (fewer 18 year olds) partly explains this, the fall in English entries is far bigger than the overall 6.5% drop in entries – English has lost more students than other subjects. Undergraduate enrolments on English degrees have also fallen: from an all-time high of around 51,000 in 2011/12 to 39,000 last year, although the proportion of English A-level students who go on to study it at university has hovered around 14% for a decade.
FEB11	Why didn’t Liam Neeson just stick to the script?	Is it because of Liam Neeson, I wonder, that John Humphrys has announced he’s going to retire from the Today programme? Was Neeson’s astonishing interview in the Independent what finally made the great Radio 4 inquisitor realise quite how much you can get out of an interviewee if you give them a bit of space to speak? Interviews and interviewing have been in the news a lot. Not only was there the extraordinary confession Neeson volunteered in the middle of what was supposed to be a perfectly vacuous press junket, and Humphrys’s equally unexpected proclamation, but also Maureen Lipman, writing in the Radio Times, had a pop at the modern style of chatshow. “The sofa is crammed, like a chapel pew, with English actors telling their juiciest genitalia stories while the host sniggers in a three-piece suit,” was how she described the genre.
FEB11	In revering Trump, the religious right has laid bare its hypocrisy	The annual anachronism known as the National Prayer Breakfast attracted its usual array of clergy, military, and political leaders in Washington on 7 February. Most prominent of all, of course, was Donald Trump, who used the de facto pulpit to call for outlawing abortion, among other positions dear to the Religious Right. Yet the presidential comment that most typified all that has gone morally haywire with the supposedly moral majority came when Trump praised the “abolition of civil rights”. You can consider that statement an innocent, if embarrassing, misreading of the Teleprompter. Or you can hear it as a Freudian slip.
FEB11	Ignorance of the Holocaust is different to wilful disbelief	And what has the world learned of all this?” is the handwritten question by Holocaust survivor Henri Obstfeld, which appears beside his image in a 2017 book Survivor. Introducing his portraits of 103 survivors, the photographer Harry Borden writes: “I grew up on a farm in Devon, England. My dad, Charlie, was a resolutely atheist Jew who derived nothing from his background except a fear of antisemitism. When I was a boy he once told me that the Nazis would have killed us. I was shocked. I attended a Church of England primary school, sang in the choir and had always considered myself a Christian like my mum.” Disquieting also was the size of some responses to the assertion that 'the scale of the Holocaust is exaggerated'
FEB11	A hidden government is preparing for Brexit… by keeping us in the dark	Brexit is killing many myths, but its chief victim is the belief that Britain is not an absurd country. The British establishment believed in our innate common sense, as did admiring foreigners. Weirdly, the supposedly cynical British public still does. Voters damn politicians, but assume they will somehow find a way through. I doubt their confidence will last and they will soon see our new United Kingdom of Absurdistan for what it is: a land where civil servants send military advisers into government departments, as if the mandarins were planning a coup, or draw up emergency measures to lift the Queen fall-of-Saigon style from Buckingham Palace or stockpile medicines as if we were at war. We are at war in a sense, only Brexit is a war the British have declared on themselves and still do not realise they are fighting.
FEB11	Ivanka Trump’s a feminist? Yep – just like her father and her brothers	In a singular achievement for US conceptual art, an installation by Jennifer Rubell has prompted three – to date – of Donald Trump’s children to disclose their horror of sexism. The piece in question, Ivanka Vacuuming, recently opened in Washington DC. A video shows a woman in the Trump-preferred genre – young, high-heeled, blond – impassively pushing a vacuum cleaner around a pink carpet, on to which visitors are invited to throw crumbs, from a generous pile on a pedestal. “Inspired by a figure whose public persona incorporates an almost comically wide range of feminine identities – daughter, wife, mother, sister, model, working woman, blond– Ivanka Vacuuming is,” say the organisers, CulturalDC, “simultaneously a visual celebration of a contemporary icon; a portrait of our own relationship to that figure; and a questioning of our complicity in her role playing.”
FEB11	We rush to condemn fakers such as Dan Mallory but the world has made impostors of us all	What’s the difference between something going viral and a storm in a teacup? Not an awful lot, it often seems to me. Last week, everyone in publishing and quite a lot of people in the media were talking – I mean online, although presumably their offices were also ablaze with the subject, indignation rising from their desks like smoke – about a profile in the New Yorker. In the piece, it was revealed that Dan Mallory, aka AJ Finn, author of the bestselling thriller The Woman at the Window, is a fantasist who has told an awful lot of lies: a series of grandiose and frequently ghastly deceptions that, according to some, may have helped his extraordinarily successful career in the book trade. (Before he was a writer, he was a highly paid editor, most recently at William Morrow in New York.)
FEB11	Long untouchable, web giants now know what it feels like to be hunted	The key question to ask when a shocking tragedy comes to light is this: does it signify a scandal or a crisis? Scandals happen all the time in societies. They generate a lot of heat, outrage and public angst. But, eventually, the media caravan moves on and nothing much changes. When in 2011, for example, the Guardian printed shocking revelations of tabloid phone-hacking and, particularly, the news that reporters had hacked the mobile phone of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, many observers concluded that this indicated a crisis for the British newspaper industry. Initially, the signs were promising: solemn statement by the prime minister, ubiquitous shock-horror-outrage, closure of a big newspaper, a judicial inquiry – all the trappings of a democracy embarking on radical reform. But in the end, nothing much changed. British tabloids are as intrusive and crass as ever. And the industry remains “self-regulated”. It was just another scandal, after all.
FEB11	What does Liam Neeson’s ‘primal urge’ really tell us about racism?	It’s been one hell of a week in the wide, wide world of racism. On Monday, the Egyptian international Mohamed Salah was subjected to alleged racist abuse during Liverpool’s match with West Ham. On Wednesday, memories of the Windrush scandal were awoken when 29 people were forcibly expelled from the UK on a charter flight to Jamaica. Then, on Thursday, Gucci released a polo neck jumper that covers the mouth and the chin of the wearer, making them resemble a blackface minstrel. You know, like you do. Anyone hoping to cut through the background hum of structural inequality and racial insensitivity was really going to have to pull something special out of the bag. Cue Liam Neeson, who revealed that 40 years ago he had entertained a racist lynching fantasy and actually gone out looking for a black man to murder. The response of Neeson’s co-star, Tom Bateman, who was sitting beside him, set the tone for what was to follow: “Holy shit.”
FEB12	Trump offers socialism for the rich, capitalism for everyone else	“America will never be a socialist country,” Donald Trump declared in his State of the Union address. Someone should alert Trump that America is now a hotbed of socialism. But it is socialism for the rich. Everyone else is treated to harsh capitalism. In the conservative mind, socialism means getting something for doing nothing. That pretty much describes the $21bn saved by the nation’s largest banks last year thanks to Trump’s tax cuts, some of which went into massive bonuses for bank executives. On the other hand, more than 4,000 lower-level bank employees got a big dose of harsh capitalism. They lost their jobs.
FEB12	There’s only one way to head off May’s threat of no-deal chaos	In a strange new twist, Theresa May has replied to Labour’s suggestions on Brexit in terms so opaque that this newspaper has interpreted them as a rejection of Jeremy Corbyn’s terms, while the Times believes her to be ready to compromise. Like the death throes of a chess game, the moves available to her are small and few, and it’s hard to figure out what decision she has taken. In shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer’s lawyerly fashion, Labour’s terms were laid out fivefold: a permanent customs union; “close alignment” with the single market; dynamic alignment on workers’ rights, that is, for the UK to keep pace with the evolution of rights and protections in Europe; continued membership of EU-wide agencies and funding programmes; and an agreement on security arrangements such that we retain access to shared databases and the European arrest warrant.
FEB12	And the Bafta for most witlessly outdated awards ceremony goes to …	Deja vu is a common complaint during awards season. The same faces shuffle down a carpet. There are whopping frocks and usually some interpretative dance. There are heroes and baddies, causes célèbres and sacred cows, hot bandwagons and atrocious jokes – though rarely quite as dire as those told by Joanna Lumley last night. It’s often hard to keep track. Is this the year everyone refers to Harvey Weinstein as God or as the devil? Has Glenn Close really never won anything or is she always winning everything? Is that actor’s photo being beamed big because they’re triumphed or because they’ve died?
FEB12	British ‘lethality’? Gavin Williamson’s brain has gone absent without leave	The defence secretary’s brain has gone absent without leave. Gavin Williamson said in a speech today that he intends to send his new aircraft carrier, the HMS Queen Elizabeth, round the world to frighten China. He will equip it with a squadron of F-35 fighter jets, purchased from America. In addition he wants to build two British military bases, one in Asia and the other “in the Caribbean”. They are to “strengthen our global presence, enhance our lethality and increase our mass”. Brexit, says the defence secretary, “has brought us to a great moment in our history”, when we must be ready to deploy “hard power” against those who “flout international law”. What on earth is Williamson talking about – apart from a desire to be Tory leader? His budget was last week said to be £7bn adrift of reality. The Queen Elizabeth cannot sail until 2021. It has no business whatsoever in the South China Sea, where such a vast and unwieldy ship would be a sitting target. The Chinese could sink it in an hour. As for new military bases in the Caribbean and east of Suez, they would cost billions and be an invitation to terrorists. The Chinese must be laughing themselves sick.
FEB12	Surely British business can do better than Mike Ashley and Philip Green?	Here’s a question. Do you really think that two white billionaires with a penchant for excess, questionable morals and a slew of scandals to their name are the ideal face of business in a country scrambling to keep the surviving scraps of its international reputation intact? I didn’t think so. And yet, here we are. Mike Ashley and Philip Green shared the business headlines over the weekend with stories very different in nature, but nonetheless all serving as a reminder for why British businessmen are in desperate need of a dramatic image overhaul. Sports Direct, headed up by Ashley – the mouthy retail entrepreneur who also owns House of Fraser and Newcastle United – was last week hailed as a possible buyer of Patisserie Valerie after the cafe chain spectacularly crashed into administration in January putting hundreds of jobs at risk.
FEB12	Britain deports people who grew up here. This racialised system must end	Last week mass deportations resumed in Britain. It’s less than a year since the Windrush scandal broke – and the review into the events leading up to it hasn’t even reported back yet. This was a stark reminder that the government’s “compliant environment” policies have changed in name only: otherwise they remain as hostile as ever and continue to destroy the lives of black and ethnic minority people (BME) people – many of whom have lived in the UK since they were children. Before the deportation flight the home secretary, Sajid Javid, declared that many of the “foreign national offenders” on the flight had committed “very serious crimes” – but soon after this the Home Office admitted that most of the deportees had committed minor crimes such as single drug or driving offences. More worryingly, 13 people on the Jamaican charter flight had come to the UK as children – nine of them were under the age of 10, 11 had indefinite leave to remain (ILR), and one person even had a British passport. Not only were most of the people on this flight “more British than foreign”, they were also being punished twice (three times if you include immigration detention) for crimes they had already served sentences for.
FEB12	The country I walked through deserves better than Brexit	In May 2016, a few weeks before the EU referendum, I walked 340 miles from Liverpool to London to see what was happening to my country. I was travelling in the footsteps of a 1981 march against unemployment that my late father had helped to organise. In that year, Tory policies had devastated industry and sent unemployment skyrocketing. In 2016, Tory austerity was putting the final nail in the coffin of those broken communities. Even so, on my walk I was shocked by the level of poverty, by the sheer number of homeless people in doorways and parks, and by the high streets of boarded-up shops and pubs, full of payday loan outlets and bookies. People in those former industrial towns spoke of their anger and betrayal, of having being forgotten by Westminster politicians, of their communities having been destroyed as the manufacturing that had sustained them either folded or moved to low-wage economies.
FEB12	The Green New Deal offers radical environmental and economic change	The revival of the Green New Deal framework (first developed in a report published in 2008) and popularized by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Justice Democrats in the US, is a huge advance for green campaigners and, hopefully, for our threatened species. That is because it has a single radical ask: an ecological and economic transformation of the current system to end our addiction to fossil fuels and endless consumption of the earth’s finite assets. The Green New Deal demands major structural (governmental and inter-governmental) changes (not just behavioural change) in our approach to the ecosystem. In addition, and as in the 1930s, such change to be driven by radical structural transformation of the finance sector, and the economy. It was developed on the understanding that finance, the economy and the ecosystem are all tightly bound together. Protecting and restoring the ecosystem to balance cannot be tackled effectively without transformation of the other sectors. Financing the transformation of the economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels cannot be achieved without a transformation of the finance sector.
FEB12	If Sisi’s brutality in Egypt continues, the results could be dire for Europe	The outpouring of joy that followed Hosni Mubarak’s resignation was palpable. It was 11 February 2011 – eight years ago to this day. Egyptians of all faiths and ages and backgrounds, united by a desire for freedom, gathered in Tahrir Square to bring 30 years of tyranny to an end. We believed that as the people of the region’s most historic power, inspired by the success of the Tunisian revolution, we were setting in motion a chain of events that would guarantee Egypt’s freedom. But after 30 months the dream became a nightmare. Letting the military manage the transitional period was probably the biggest mistake of all; revolutions never give power to pillars of the old regime. Perhaps later on we were complacent: our first free presidential election, and the subsequent referendum on a new constitution, gave us confidence that the changes taking place could not be stopped or undone. But the solidarity that defined the protests in Tahrir Square was disintegrating, and neither the government of Mohamed Morsi nor any of the other political powers could resolve the differences or abate the fears – of the old regime, the political parties, the army and the people in the street – that had started to infuse public life.
FEB12	Have MPs, finally, come up with a decent Brexit proposal?	It all has the feel of the world’s most boring thriller. Though there are only just under seven weeks left until Britain’s official date of departure from the European Union, public life seems drowsy with a lethal brew of fatalism, insouciance and burrowing cowardice. On the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show this morning, James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, looked less like the minister charged with preparing local government for the social chaos of a no-deal outcome than a beaming salesman politely urging a client to renew his contents insurance policy.
FEB13	Deal or no deal, both Labour and the Tories will split over Brexit	A casual observer seeing Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn exchange rhetorical blows over Brexit in the Commons today might imagine that they stand on opposite sides of this totemic issue. But veterans of the debate know they are equal in determination that Britain should leave the EU. They are separated from consensus by small technical matters that can, for theatrical effect, be inflated into irreconcilable differences. That process is testimony to the hold that the two-party system exerts over English politics and to much of what is wrong with it. Brexit keeps promising to break party lines and then failing to do so. That is partly because pro-Europeanism and the British left stand on overlapping cultural ground. The remain proposition goes well beyond attachment to EU membership: it is driven by revulsion at the nativist spirit of Brexit’s marauding generals – Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg – and shock that they have hijacked Britain’s political identity. But that dismay is not exclusive to Labour. It is felt by liberal Tories and swing voters who just pine for competent, rational government.
FEB13	Polar bears in the playground, Insectageddon … and it’s all our fault	Children’s books are filled with fantastic friendships between humans and beasts. From a young age, we learn that if a tiger comes for tea we should expect it to eat all our sandwiches, and if a Peruvian bear drops in for lunch we had better have some marmalade in the cupboard. In this fantasy world, we can coexist peacefully with large mammals. Meanwhile, in real life, young people are having fewer wild interactions than ever before. In part this is a result of increased screen time and decreased access to wild spaces. Perhaps it doesn’t help that many countries drove out their most exciting inhabitants – lynx, bears and wolves – centuries ago.
FEB13	The EU looks like the Soviet Union in 1991 – on the verge of collapse	Europe is sleepwalking into oblivion and its people need to wake up before it is too late. If they don’t, the European Union will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991. Neither our leaders nor ordinary citizens seem to understand that we are experiencing a revolutionary moment, that the range of possibilities is very broad, and that the eventual outcome is thus highly uncertain. Most of us assume the future will more or less resemble the present, but this is not necessarily so. In a long and eventful life, I have witnessed many periods of what I call radical disequilibrium. We are living in such a period today.
FEB13	Why it matters to call external female genitalia ‘vulva’ not ‘vagina’	When you find yourself mansplaining the term “mansplaining” to a worked-up faction of Twitter on a Sunday evening, you can assume you’re not getting the best out of your leisure time. And that’s not even the most foolish thing a man called Paul Bullen did over the weekend. On Saturday, the Guardian published an extract from an upcoming book, Womanhood: The Bare Reality by the photographer and writer Laura Dodsworth. Alongside photographs of external genitalia was first-person testimony from the subjects pictured. Titled “Me and my vulva: 100 women reveal all”, it was an arresting story. Bullen spotted the article on Sunday, and responded with a tweet that he probably (well, hopefully) now regrets: “The correct word is vagina.”
FEB13	Humanity faces an existential crisis – Labour must join the fightback	Here’s the bad news. We are quite in a lot of trouble. A new study by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that a series of crises – from global warming to soil infertility – are set to hit us at the same time. The consequences could include massive destabilisation, not just in individual countries but on a global level. From the damage inflicted on human health, to a possible economic meltdown caused by mass insurance claims if the US is ravaged by floods and forest fires, we are not remotely prepared. Consider just one scenario. According to Laurie Laybourn-Langton, the lead author of the report, climate crisis could lead to 10 times more refugees from the Middle East than the 12 million who fled during the past few years of upheaval and turmoil. The far right skilfully manipulated and inflamed backlash over this last refugee crisis: that’s partly why Donald Trump is now president of the US, why the far right are in coalition governments in Italy and Austria, and why Viktor Orbán’s Hungarian regime has been able to consolidate its authoritarian rule. What will happen when refugees come in far greater numbers? A twisted irony beckons: that extremists in the Trump administration, aptly labelled climate change “arsonists” by writer Naomi Klein, will make mass forced migration more likely because of their environment-wrecking policies, and then reap perverse political benefits by whipping up hatred against the resulting tide of human misery.
FEB13	The #ligueduLOL cyberbullying case is the French media’s day of reckoning	The French media world has been in the grip of a deep crisis for the past few days. The people at the heart of the scandal say it started as a “joke”, and stemmed from a desire to share some “black humour”. If that is the case, the #ligueduLOL controversy has turned out to be something much darker, and has exposed the everyday abuse that women and minorities face on social media. The Ligue du LOL is the name of a closed Facebook group in which about 30 young and successful journalists, media professionals and early-day Twitter influencers allegedly coordinated cyberbullying, trolling and Twitter campaigns against other social media users (mostly women, as well as feminist and LGBT activists) between 2009 and 2012. Some of them continued their activities for years after the group was closed.
FEB13	Free money wouldn’t make people lazy – but it could revolutionise work	The danger of so-called “free money” not only underpins critiques of universal basic income (UBI), but also the incredibly strong narratives that underlie the attitudes to work in the UK (and elsewhere) – and our unemployment benefit system. Paid employment is held up as one of the ultimate markers of being a valuable member of society, with those not in paid work (always described in these narratives as a voluntary position, rather than as the result of issues outside their control) seen as a drain on society. Those out of work are positioned in direct contrast to those in paid employment: the shirkers versus the strivers, the “welfare dependent” versus the hardworking families. For those in paid work, working hard and being constantly busy are worn as a badge of pride, and there are whole industries promising to make us more productive and efficient. For some, hard work is enforced through workplace monitoring, impossibly short breaks or expectations of staff being “always on”, for example responding to emails outside work hours. Work is idealised as providing meaning in our lives, while at the same time removing us from other sources of meaning, such as family, friends and our communities, through long hours and unpaid overtime. The negative psychological, social and physical effects of these narratives and assumptions are now being investigated, and the centrality of work in our lives and society questioned.
FEB13	Northern Ireland’s young people know their history. If only the rest of Britain did too	Touts are a three-piece rock band from Derry. The name is a reference to the Northern Irish colloquialism for a police informer, which is scrawled and sprayed around their home city; the music they make is full of a sense of Derry’s violent past and its uneasy present. It harks back to the distant days of punk rock, but its sheer velocity also speaks of an urge to get on with the future, whatever that might be. The band are part of a lineage of music interwoven with Northern Ireland’s difficult politics and history: as the Belfast-based music writer Stuart Bailie’s brilliant book Trouble Songs puts it, raw art that has “challenged given stories” and provided “succour and a sense of collective worth”. All three Touts members were born at a time when the Troubles were receding into history; two of them were too young to vote in the 2016 EU referendum. Last week, I watched them rehearse, in a freezing room on an edge-of-town industrial estate. They talked about Northern Ireland’s political predicament with the kind of incisive eloquence that most English musicians seem to have lost. “Politics is just inescapable, coming from here,” said 21-year-old bassist and co-vocalist, Luke McLaughlin. “If you have a platform, you may as well say something.”
FEB13	Spain’s trial of Catalan separatists is an alarming act of state repression	The most important political trial in Catalonia’s recent history is about to begin in Madrid. The trial is against members of the former government of Catalonia, the speaker of the Catalan parliament at that time and the leaders of Catalonia’s two largest pro-independence civil society groups. These individuals will be prosecuted for having organised Catalonia’s referendum on self-determination on 1 October 2017. The charges, brought by the public prosecutor’s office and by the far-right Vox party representing the private accusation, are among the most serious of those envisaged by the Spanish criminal code: rebellion, misappropriation of public funds and civil disobedience.
FEB13	The NHS lives by co-operation. The privatisers are still trying to wreck it	Some bad ideas are very hard to kill. The NHS in England is finally trying to strangle the notion that competition between hospitals is like competition between supermarkets, an anti-cartel spur to quality and low prices. But, zombie-like, the competition mania keeps being resurrected by those who think nothing works without red-in-tooth-and-claw markets. This ideological fight has battered the NHS for decades. The latest NHS England 10-year plan is all about urging everyone into closer collaboration between community, GPs and hospitals, and – at a stretch – social care too, without pointless duplication or destructive competition for staff and resources. With lengthening waiting lists, where’s the spare capacity to compete for patients? If that sounds like blindingly obvious common sense, it isn’t to privatisers and marketisers. 
FEB14	Carney is right. Brexit could lead to a better, fairer kind of globalisation	It all seemed so simple back in the 1990s. Barriers were coming down, the free market was advancing to all corners of the world, and in return for production being shifted to low-cost countries, consumers in the west were getting cheaper clothes and gizmos. Globalisation was said to be unstoppable. The end of history was nigh. The financial crisis and its aftermath have changed the political weather, with a decade of low growth, unevenly distributed pain and business as usual prompting a backlash. Voters in the west have started to focus on globalisation’s dark side: the multinational companies that avoid paying tax; the towns hollowed out by de-industrialisation; the loss of democratic control over market forces; the uneasy sense that the entire edifice is poised precariously on a mountain of debt.
FEB14	Let’s give citizens free cash to save not-for-profit journalism	A flourishing, diverse media is essential to a functioning democracy. We have neither. An already broken model faces an existential crisis. Back in 1948, the media mogul Lord Beaverbrook told a royal commission on the press that he ran the Daily Express “purely for the purpose of making propaganda and with no other object ... I look at it as a purely propagandist project.” Today, most of the British press remains the plaything of media moguls who profit from a broken status quo. Ideas such as public ownership are popular with the public: a poll by one rightwing thinktank found that 83% back nationalisation of the water industry, as do more than three-quarters with regard to electricity, gas and the railways. The vast majority of people back higher taxes on the rich. Yet these are fringe ideas within most of the mainstream media, which marginalises those who support them.
FEB14	For Theresa, bad jam is better than no jam – that's just common sense	Yesterday in Brexit news: stockpiling bodybags. Today: scraping the mould off jam. Because this is where we are now. Never mind the special place in hell Donald Tusk hopes is reserved for key Brexiters, we are already there. Truly, daily, the flames are licking. There was a time when waking up in the morning and seeing the headline, “Theresa May: I scrape the mould off the top of jam and eat what’s underneath” would be surprising – it’s the kind of thing someone randomly and without context would come out with in group therapy to an awkward silence. But no longer. There was a time when an MP moaning that there was a lack of positivity around Brexit news – which was prompted by the aforementioned news of stockpiled bodybags – would have struck me as odd. But no longer. (The MP was Kate Hoey, by the way, to absolutely no one’s surprise).
FEB14	Football is addicted to gambling – and it’s harming children	It’s a fair bet that the new rules announced today aimed at preventing the gambling industry from targeting children will be welcomed by almost everyone. Who could be against a ban on betting ads popping up on sites, computer games or apps popular with kids, such as the promos that were once embedded in the I’m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here or Mario Kart apps? Given the extraordinary stats that show no fewer than 370,000 children aged 11 to 16 gamble each week – with 25,000 of those classed as problem gamblers – surely any move to keep young eyes away from temptation is to be applauded. But you only have to set out the planned steps to see why they don’t go far enough. The new rules from the Committee of Advertising Practice insist, for example, that gambling companies stop featuring celebrities or others who look under 25 in their ads. Sounds good, until you reflect that the betting companies could simply find a footballer who’s 26 or older to do the job instead: John Stones (24), say, could be subbed off, to be replaced by, I don’t know, the new £400,000-a-week man Aaron Ramsey (28).
FEB14	Dark money is pushing for a no-deal Brexit. Who is behind it?	Modern governments respond to only two varieties of emergency: those whose solution is bombs and bullets, and those whose solution is bailouts for the banks. But what if they decided to take other threats as seriously? This week’s revelations of a catastrophic collapse in insect populations, jeopardising all terrestrial life, would prompt the equivalent of an emergency meeting of the UN security council. The escalating disasters of climate breakdown and soil loss would trigger spending at least as great as the quantitative easing after the financial crisis. Instead, politicians carry on as if nothing is amiss.
FEB14	The self-driving car is a marvel doomed by unpredictable humans	A few years ago, I wrote a Guardian article about jetpacks. A mode of transport that seemingly everyone wants and has been expecting (and angrily demanding of us scientists) for a good while, but which is still essentially nowhere in sight. I did my best to write about why jetpacks are not likely to be a household item any time soon.
FEB14	Forty years for a mosque killer, when murderers of white victims get 75?	Two years ago Alexandre Bissonnette walked into a Quebec City mosque and opened fire on men at prayer, killing six, injuring 19 and ensuring that 17 children would grow up without their fathers. Known to Quebec feminist and refugee support groups as an internet troll, Bissonnette’s search history suggested he had been influenced by racist, misogynistic shooters such as Dylann Roof, Elliot Rodger and Marc Lépine. After the attack Bissonnette told a social worker he regretted not having killed more people. In court, he pleaded guilty and expressed remorse. Last Friday, in an unusual judgment, Bissonnette was sentenced to life in prison, with 40 years before he is eligible for parole.
FEB14	Take that, Salvini! How musical justice was served in Sanremo	Italy’s Sanremo Music Festival, the model for everything from Eurovision to The X-Factor, is one of the oldest and most prestigious of its kind. On Saturday evening 26-year-old Alessandro Mahmoud, who goes by the stage name Mahmood, won the 69th edition of the festival with his song Soldi (Money). But this was no ordinary win. This win was about much more than music – it was political and important. Mahmood was born in Milan to an Italian mother and an Egyptian father. His winning song contains Arabic, and references Ramadan. He has criticised discrimination against gay men in Italy and Egypt. The singer embodies much of what Matteo Salvini and other far-right figures in Italy would love to erase from their notion of traditional “Italian” identity: the white, Christian, heterosexual, “northern” model from which Salvini’s party, the League, first took its name.
FEB14	Nationalist strongmen are bent on controlling women’s bodies	When Brazil, where I am writing from this week, became worried that almost two-thirds of its population was black or mixed race, radical steps were taken. Never mind that the blackness of its population was thanks to its own dependence on African slavery: in the first part of the 20th century, Brazil actively recruited European migrants with the explicit aim of whitening itself, or keeping, in the words of a presidential decree of 1945, “the most convenient features of its European ancestry”. The resulting class and race inequalities in the South American country are part of a complex mix that has resulted in Brazil’s own variation on the populist theme. Now, under the Trump of the tropics, as Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro is sometimes described, reproductive fascism is back, and focused – so far – on controlling women’s bodies.
FEB14	Voter ID trials are dangerous. That’s why I’m taking the government to court	On Wednesday, I received a date to attend the high court to fight against the government’s dangerous voter ID plans. This case is particularly significant for everyone who lives in my community because next May, for the first time ever, we will be asked to show identification in order to cast our vote at the local government election. Braintree district council, my local authority in Essex, is one of 10 boroughs across England taking part in the government’s pilot scheme, before it plans to roll out voter ID at the next general election.
FEB15	History will not forgive May’s reckless push to the no-deal precipice	Just another Brexit day of dither, delay and dawdling. Just another humiliating defeat for Theresa May at the hands of the party within her party that she dare not confront. Clever Anna Soubry won a significant victory: the Conservative MP forced the government to agree to publish its no-deal advice – we shall now know what the cabinet knows. We shall see the full horror of the damage a no-deal Brexit would do to business and trade. Those who brought us to this pitch should remember that a day of judgment will come. Someday a judicial inquiry will expose the reckless Brexit chaos into which the Conservative party cast this country. Inquiries go on for years, but in the end a mighty Domesday tome will record what was done, by whom and why. If anyone in Labour aided and abetted Brexit, they too will be recorded in the annals. The civil service knows: observers note the scrupulous care with which officials insist ministers personally sign every decision, delay or absurdity they are ordered to carry out. They know someday the recording angels will write down the names of everyone to blame.
FEB15	Shamima Begum is just a teenager. Britain should be strong enough to take her back	Shamima Begum, who achieved notoriety in 2015 as one of three young schoolgirls from Bethnal Green who left the country to join Islamic State, has re-emerged in a refugee camp controlled by the Syrian Defence Forces in north-eastern Syria. Understandably, given her situation – she is about to give birth and has already lost two children – she would like to get home. But where is home, and what does home mean? By her account, as reported in The Times, she enjoyed living under Isis control, even as it beheaded its enemies and left their remains for all to see. She was married to a Dutch member of the group who was presumably fighting for the cause, and she was ready to bear children who could follow in his footsteps to the frontline. She appeared therefore not only to have abandoned her family but also to have firmly rejected the broader society in which she grew up.
FEB15	The Churchill row is part of the glib approach to history that gave us Brexit	Churchill, hero or villain? Prince Charles, goodie or baddie? Jesus Christ, yes or no? John McDonnell, modern Herodotus or fool? Tick the boxes and pass the GCSE. Welcome to the new history. McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is entitled to dislike Winston Churchill, but why for Tonypandy? Churchill happened to be Liberal home secretary in 1910 and was asked to authorise a small company of soldiers to help local police during the Rhondda disturbances. He did so with reluctance and later professed sympathy for the miners. The one man who later died was hit on the head by a Glamorganshire policeman. The soldiers were not involved. What is this really about? The answer is yah-boo history: binary storytelling charged with fake emotion, sucked dry of fact or balance. It is history as partisan docudrama. Why did McDonnell not mention Churchill’s role in the death of hundreds of thousands of innocent Germans? Does he not care about dead Germans? Is he for bombing civilians?
FEB15	From Tahrir to Trump: nationalism has hijacked the hope of the people	Thousands of people in Tahrir Square chanted the slogan: “Bread! Dignity! Freedom!” It was 2011, and the height of the Arab spring. Standing on my own in the crowd, I recalled a middle-aged worker I’d met in Buenos Aires a decade earlier telling me why he and his colleagues had taken over a factory during Argentina’s economic collapse. He rattled off reasons such as hunger, poverty and inequality. But then his voice changed: “And the boss … ” he said. “Well, he never said good morning to us and, you know, that destroys your dignity.” Defending one’s dignity sometimes tastes sweeter than the bread – yes, even when you’re hungry
FEB15	Who’s the biggest failure in the Brexit cabinet: Chris Grayling – or Liam Fox?	How badly do you have to mess up, these days, before you’re not allowed in Theresa May’s cabinet? Just how far does tolerance stretch? You might imagine Chris Grayling to be the ultimate prototype in this real-world experiment, with his granting then cancelling of a £13.8m ferry contract to a ferry company with no ferries, but let us also observe the progress of Liam Fox. Fox is one of the most vocal and optimistic Brexiteers in politics. In 2016, he declared that a trade deal with the EU would be “one of the easiest in human history”. In 2017, he promised to “replicate the 40 EU free trade agreements that exist before we leave the European Union so we’ve got no disruption of trade”, and they would be ready “one second after midnight in March 2019”.
FEB15	Shamima Begum was groomed. She deserves the chance of rehabilitation	It’s impossible not to feel a jolt of shock when confronted with the photo of Shamima Begum on the front page of this morning’s Times. Four years ago – when we last saw her – it was accepted that Begum had been brainwashed. There was consensus that she was an innocent child who’d been groomed online. Begum was allowed to be the victim in the nation’s narrative – one that over decades had grasped the power and dangers of grooming – because that demanded nothing from us. She was the little girl who’d been caught up in a dangerous death cult; the pixelated image of a kid caught on CCTV about to fly, and that was sad. It was also made easier by her absence. We only needed to empathise with Begum’s situation in the abstract. Of course, we wanted her to be rescued and returned to Britain immediately. But that was just a fantasy. I can’t have been alone in assuming these girls would simply meet a horrible fate in the fighting abroad. Having been found alive and nine months pregnant in a Syrian refugee camp, Begum is no longer an abstract concept. Instinctively it feels a little harder to say we should bring her back to her home in the United Kingdom – especially given her apparent lack of remorse. And yet is she not still a victim of grooming? Still a British citizen we should be looking to help? 
FEB15	The secret to happiness? Health, housing and job security	For some time, sensible people have been arguing that governments need to focus less on economic growth and more on the wellbeing of citizens. Be careful what you wish for. In response to this demand, from 2011 David Cameron instructed the Office for National Statistics to gather data on people’s self-reported happiness and life satisfaction. Little practical good has come from this so far, but a new report by George Bangham for the Resolution Foundation is one of the best attempts to make useful sense of the data. He concludes: “The best prospects for policymakers targeting future increases in national wellbeing lie in raising job quality, raising incomes, particularly at the lower end, and policies to improve security in the housing market.”
FEB15	Chimpanzees ‘talk’ just like humans. It’s time to realise how similar we are	It’s a bit garbled but you can definitely hear it in the mobile phone footage. As the chimpanzees arrange their branches into a makeshift ladder and one of them makes its daring escape from its Belfast zoo enclosure, some words ring out loud and clear: “Don’t escape, you bad little gorilla!” a child onlooker shouts from the crowd. And … POP … with that a tiny explosion goes off inside my head. Something knocks me back about this sentence. It’s a “kids-say-the-funniest things” kind of sentence, and in any other situation I’d offer a warm smile and a chuckle of approval. But not this time. This statement has brought out the pedant in me. At this point, you may wonder if I’m capable of fleshing out a 700-word article chastising a toddler for mistakenly referring to a chimpanzee as a gorilla. The good news is that, though I am more than capable of such a callous feat, I don’t intend to write about this child’s naive zoological error. In fact, this piece isn’t really about the (gorgeous, I’m sure) child. It’s about us. You and me, and the words we use.
FEB15	Ignore the free-trade evangelists. Brexit can create a fairer economy	It all seemed so simple back in the 1990s. Barriers were coming down, the free market was advancing to all corners of the world, and in return for production being shifted to low-cost countries, consumers in the west were getting cheaper clothes and gizmos. Globalisation was said to be unstoppable. The end of history was nigh. The financial crisis and its aftermath have changed the political weather, with a decade of low growth, unevenly distributed pain and business as usual prompting a backlash.

FEB15	Confused? Here’s my guide to Valentine’s Day in the #MeToo era	I’ve always liked Valentine’s Day, and believe men who dismiss it as commercialised nonsense are joyless tightwads. My enthusiasm dates back to primary school. My teacher made us cut scraps of shiny red paper into heart shapes, glue them to flimsy cards, and write messages inside to our mums – although I remember wanting to give my card to a girl named Demelza. Ernest Hemingway said he had to be in love to be able to write. When I was a teenager in the 1990s, I had to be in love to go to school. My love was usually unrequited, so Valentine’s Day offered an annual shot at redemption. In year 9, I loved Tammy, so I wrote a haiku inside a Valentine’s card and placed it on her desk, along with a Terry’s Chocolate Orange. “Thanks,” said Tammy. I said I loved her. “You don’t know what love is,” she said, and went to maths.
FEB16	The school climate change strikes are inspiring – but they should shame us	Such is the upside-down, topsy-turvy state of our world, that the children are now the adults and the adults are the children. In Westminster, our supposed leaders – men and women of mature vintage – keep stamping their feet and demanding what no one can give them. They insist they should be allowed to gobble up all the birthday cake and still have cake left to eat, threatening to storm out of the European Union and slam the door behind them. As Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, rightly puts it: “Threatening to leave is the behaviour of a three-year-old who says that they are going to hold their breath if they do not get the toy that they want.”
FEB16	Our destiny is in the hands of Rees-Mogg’s unfinished robot sidekick	Where are you on Steve Baker, on a scale of one to so-completely-over-him? The deputy chair of the European Research Group took to the airwaves today to warn mildly that parliament passing Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement would “collapse the government”. Furthermore, Baker complained: “I really do rather object to being called ‘hardline’.” Oh dear. Given the need to find alternative arrangements for describing Steve Baker, let’s look at technological solutions. It’s as if someone had half an idea to build a fun, geeky robot sidekick for Jacob Rees-Mogg, then became so bored or repulsed by the task that they gave up before they’d fitted him with a cool metallic exoskeleton. Somehow, the unfinished unit picked itself off the workshop floor and found its way to parliament. By rights, Steve Baker is just the innards of something that – had it been completed – you might find in the background of a Mos Espa docking-bay scene in The Phantom Menace. Instead, he’s one of the fanatics holding our national destiny in his partially assembled hands. The more versatile politicians of this golden age have two expressions; Steve Baker has one. Steve Baker’s sole expression is cocking his head slightly to the side as if to say “I’m listening politely and reasonably”, when what he is actually saying is, “Let’s just fucking burn it all down and see what happens.”
FEB16	My generation trashed the planet. So I salute the children striking back	The Youth Strike 4 Climate gives me more hope than I have felt in 30 years of campaigning. Before this week, I believed it was all over. I thought, given the indifference and hostility of those who govern us, and the passivity of most of my generation, that climate breakdown and ecological collapse were inevitable. Now, for the first time in years, I think we can turn them around. My generation and the generations that went before have failed you. We failed to grasp the basic premise of intergenerational justice: that you cannot apply discount rates to human life. In other words, the life of someone who has not been born will be of no less value than the life of someone who already exists. We have lived as if your lives had no importance, as if any resource we encountered was ours and ours alone to use as we wished, regardless of the impact on future generations. In doing so, we created a cannibal economy: we ate your future to satisfy our greed.
FEB16	AI can write just like me. Brace for the robot apocalypse	Elon Musk, recently busying himself with calling people “pedo” on Twitter and potentially violating US securities law with what was perhaps just a joke about weed – both perfectly normal activities – is now involved in a move to terrify us all. The non-profit he backs, OpenAI, has developed an AI system so good it had me quaking in my trainers when it was fed an article of mine and wrote an extension of it that was a perfect act of journalistic ventriloquism. As my colleague Alex Hern wrote yesterday: “The system [GPT2] is pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible, both in terms of the quality of the output, and the wide variety of potential uses.” GPT2 is so efficient that the full research is not being released publicly yet because of the risk of misuse.
FEB16	I swallowed the Brexit lies. Now I regret telling curry house workers to vote leave	One of the many myths and mysteries of the 2016 referendum campaign is that people from the south-east Asian community backed a leave campaign that was so often linked to bigotry. The truth is, they didn’t. A majority of voters of south-east Asian heritage supported remain – but more of us voted for Brexit than anyone expected. Not only was I one of them; I also bear some responsibility, as the head of an organisation that urged our 150,000 members and 12,000 restaurants to vote leave.
FEB16	Call the Midwife takes women’s side over abortion. But the BBC is failing us	Call the Midwife is a wonderfully successful programme, a slice of dramatised social history that centres on women’s experience. It tackles many “difficult” issues: recently we saw a young woman find out that she was intersex, and the introduction of the cervical smear. It manages to be warm and moving, while reflecting the quiet bravery of so many women. A triumph. It is, if you like, always on “our side”. I never thought of it this way before, even though I know the BBC as an institution is not always great for women. It does not promote women into its senior management roles, it does not pay women equally and it is happy to crank out routine misogyny on many of its flagship shows, such as Today, in the guise of “banter”.
FEB16	Measles is on the rise. But telling anti-vaxxers they’re stupid won’t fix it	After reading the news that cases of measles have soared by 50% in the last year, I recalled the first time I heard an anti-vaccination conspiracy theory. It wasn’t from a member of Donald Trump’s administration, or part of a frenetic, grammatically challenged Facebook post – it was from a classmate when I was at school. Her family wasn’t waging a crusade against medical science: they simply gave credence to disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield’s study that wrongly asserted a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Back then, the study had not yet been discredited. One only has to stray into anti-vaxxer internet forums for a few minutes to see that they’re stuffed with conspiracy theorists, opportunists, reactionaries, and – worst of all – hubristic idiots. This is the vanguard of the anti-vaxxer movement. But behind that vanguard are a lot of concerned parents who are being convinced of wild and dangerous ideas because we – and by we, I mean those of us who recognise the incontrovertible fact that vaccines are essential – aren’t talking to them properly. A number of the anti-vaxxer vanguard may have started life as concerned parents, but have gradually sunk into increasingly extreme positions because the only communication they’re getting from the other side is that they’re foolish and irresponsible. Almost every week the internet produces another diatribe against anti-vaxxers, or a listicle of their “horrifyingly stupid” social media posts.
FEB16	Attacks on the media show Duterte’s Philippines is heading for despotism	“I will do the right thing,” Maria Ressa, CEO of the Philippines news site Rappler, told reporters as she was led away by police officers having been served a warrant for her arrest in her own newsroom. Agents from the Philippines’ National Bureau of Investigations arrested Ressa concerning a continuing and much inflated digital libel case this Wednesday in Manila. She was freed a day later having paid a bond of 100,000 Philippine pesos. This is now the sixth time the veteran journalist has been obliged to post bail. In what has been a damaging but depressingly predictable blow to press freedom in the Philippines, it’s yet another warning sign that President Rodrigo Duterte is accelerating towards an all-out authoritarian state.
FEB16	The arts were supposed to champion diversity. What went wrong?	In February 1999, the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence made 70 recommendations for eradicating institutional racism within the police. Although the arts, culture and media sectors were not a target of the report, we can similarly trace the uptake of what would later become known as cultural diversity within these institutions – particularly at a time when the political context was invested, at least rhetorically, in eradicating racial prejudice. This week, 20 years on from the report, Arts Council England published its annual report on diversity within the arts sector, showing that in some areas arts organisations are “treading water”.
FEB17	Andrea Levy gave a voice to all my silenced forebears	Andrea Levy wrote to understand where she came from; I read her to understand where we come from. I was 23 when Small Island was published in 2004 and had just started working at the London Review Bookshop. The voice of the protagonist, Hortense, a Jamaican woman who worked hard and expected more from everyone, reminded me of my maternal grandma and her nursing friends, all of whom I respectfully called “aunty”. It was the first time I had read a depiction of people like my relations in the pages of a novel. I had already encountered another Jamaican Hortense in literary fiction in Zadie Smith’s triumphant debut, White Teeth. However, it is Levy’s Hortense, who is devoted to Britain – the Mother Country – who truly brought me a deeper understanding of home. How often, it seems, the Windrush generation is often more British than the British; their upbringing was strict, under traditional British colonialism. They honoured and adored the Queen as their head of state, their language is formal and accented RP, and their manners correct; they are so serious that you cannot help but smile.
FEB17	Tormenting Meghan Markle has become a national sport that shames us	In the period when the acquisition of the former Meghan Markle was depicted as little short of a national triumph, much was written in the British press about her various accomplishments. These are, after all, roughly as common in royal spouses as successful independent careers. Meghan, the actress and blogger and charity worker, is also, it emerged, a skilled calligrapher. “I’ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well,” she once told an Esquire journalist, who’d described her writing as “incredible”. “What it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning.”
FEB17	Nan Goldin on art, opioids and the need for positive action	Netflix recently sent up the art world in its feature film, Velvet Buzzsaw. It’s a strange hybrid of spoof and horror, but an early section, in which ludicrous money is thrown around and gross consumption and cut-throat competition are par for the course, is the most successful. (A later gag, in which a gallerist mistakes a pile of bin bags for a new work, is surely the dad joke of satire.) It descends into a mess of blood and gore when the paintings of a freshly discovered outsider artist become sentient and take their revenge on the people who profited from them. The artist Nan Goldin, famous for her intimate photographs of a certain kind of New York life, is continuing her admirable fight to highlight the more gruesome aspects of the real art world. After a call to arms on Instagram, Goldin and her activist collective Pain (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now) staged a die-in at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, scattering fake prescriptions, chanting and unfurling signs. The statistics laid bare by the red-and-black banners were stark: “400,000 dead”; “200 dead each day”;“Shame on Sackler,” read one. ‘Take down their name,” read another.

FEB17	Tate Modern’s neighbours missed the point: cities make voyeurs of us all	When you live in the city, the world is full of nosy parkers. I should know because I am one. I remember my early forays up to London from the West Country on the National Express coach, coming in via the Westway as the sun was setting. As the sky turned indigo, lights would flicker on in the flats that overlooked the dual carriageway, giving me a direct view into the lives of strangers. I would glimpse them standing at stoves, slumped on sofas, or sitting on the phone clutching a fag and a bottle of beer. These domestic scenes were, for the teenage me, fleeting urban postcards, idyllic snapshots of what my own life could be.
FEB17	The trip from London to Lincolnshire showed me the Brexit divide’s depth	What was it the Queen said? “As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture.” She spoke those words last month at the centenary of the Sandringham Women’s Institute (humble occasions are no enemies of wisdom), and they are understood to refer to the social and political division caused by the Brexit vote. I remembered the gist of them last weekend as our train trundled towards Boston in Lincolnshire, a town on the other side of the Wash from the monarch’s Norfolk estate. The division between migrants and natives long predated Brexit, and the vote was a consequence rather than a cause of it

FEB17	To survive, councils need more money. But council tax is broken	“The most boring and complicated subject in all of public life,” declared William Waldegrave, former minister and an architect of the fateful poll tax, when speaking of local government finance. But this is misleading: the consequences of local government austerity are anything but boring for those on the lowest incomes. The design of the council tax system – and recent reforms to it – hits the poorest hardest. Here’s why. Since 2010, the central government grant to local government has been cut by almost 60%. This has had a devastating impact on local public services with spending falling in real terms by nearly one-fifth (excluding education and public health) since the start of the decade. So it’s little surprise that council taxpayers in England face substantial increases in their bills, with nearly all councils set to increase them this April.
FEB18	Theresa May would rather risk an election than lose a referendum	Fifty years ago, in an address to the nation, the US president Richard Nixon immortalised the phrase “silent majority”. In the febrile context of 1969, he was referring to the millions of law-abiding Americans who were not involved with, or sympathetic to, 1960s counter-culture, the protests against the Vietnam war and angry campus campaigning. Does the idea still have meaning? Social media, smartphones and the resulting digital cacophony have pretty much seen off the possibility of “silent” anything. But noise is not the same as democracy.
FEB18	Mrs May and Mr Corbyn are complicit in Britain’s drift towards disaster	High noon. Mexican standoff. Last chance saloon. There’s been no end of opportunities to deploy metaphors drawn from the Wild West to describe Brexit. This is kind of appropriate since the benighted enterprise was triggered by a bunch of cowboys and peddled by snake-oil salesmen. In another way, talk of shootouts and showdowns is a bad journalistic habit of which I’ve been occasionally guilty myself. Describing Brexit in these dramatic terms suggests we are about to reach some kind of resolution and the end credits can finally roll. Yet we never do. Every exchange of gunfire at the Not O.K. Corral is followed by the grim realisation that the plot has not been advanced at all. We are still stuck where we have been marooned for months: without a deal that parliament will pass and without a proved majority for any alternative. In Brexitland, it is always crisis and never catharsis.
FEB18	Can a 16th-century martyr help to save Italy from rightwing populism?	Every year on 17 February, a crowd gathers in Rome’s Campo de’ Fiori to place wreaths, poems and candles at the foot of the statue that glowers towards the Vatican from beneath its friar’s cowl. The man it memorialises, the Neapolitan philosopher Giordano Bruno, was burned alive by the Inquisition on that spot in 1600, for heresies including several books in which he advocated the heliocentric cosmology of Copernicus and argued that the universe was infinite and contained multiple other worlds. The charges were similar to those brought against Galileo 16 years later; unlike Galileo, who recanted, Bruno’s defiance has lent an air of heroism to his execution. A witness at his trial reported that, when the death sentence was pronounced, Bruno replied: “You may be more afraid to bring that sentence against me than I am to accept it.”
FEB18	Without territory or new recruits, Islamic State is in its death throes	The last fighters are holding out, just. The leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is still alive but hiding somewhere in the desert. We have already had one “final defeat” of Islamic State. This came 18 months ago when the organisation’s capital, Raqqa, fell. Once, it held territory the size of the UK; now, it holds a square kilometre of the remote town of Baghouz in eastern Syria. Soon, it will no longer hold even that. There is a strong argument for caution before anyone talks of “mission accomplished”. Many of the circumstances that favoured the rise of the organisation remain. In Iraq, these include the weakness of the state and security forces, the dominance of the Shia majority and the shortsightedness of its leaders, as well as the alienation and marginalisation of the Iraqi Sunni minority, long the extremists’ core constituency. Deeply rooted criminal networks don’t help, nor does the legacy of radicalisation and brutalisation of decades of violence. Syria remains an anarchic battleground of factions, militia and forces, where powers great and small, near and far, still seek advantage. So it should be no surprise that recent attacks in Iraq suggest that a new Isis-led insurgent campaign is well under way.
FEB18	Metro’s success is good news for life beyond the web	I am sitting in a newspaper conference listening to the news editor reciting her list of goodies for tomorrow’s issue: new Brexit controversy, latest Trump shenanigans, ongoing Venezuelan dramas, a hunt for a missing girl, a warning of 70mph gales. The editor and his team react appropriately: a concerned comment here; a murmur of sympathy there; and the occasional joke, especially in reaction to the day’s really surprising story. The pope has revealed that priests used an order of French nuns as sex slaves.
FEB18	An absurd vanity project for our age – Boris Johnson’s garden bridge	We are invited to embark on an adventure. It will be an emblem of the enterprise of a proud people. Its cost will be zero, or not much, or a sum that, if quite large, will absolutely be worth it. Naysayers are pooh-poohed. Practical objections are for losers. A deadline is imposed, meaning we have to rush ahead with it at all costs. And driving it all forward are the quipping, gurning, dissembling features of Boris Johnson. For Brexit, read the garden bridge, an earlier vanity project promoted by the former mayor of London and foreign secretary. For it was Johnson who picked up the charming-sounding idea, conceived by Joanna Lumley, of building a flower-filled crossing from London’s South Bank to the Temple. For whatever selfless or selfish reasons (you decide), he chose to throw his mayoral power behind it, steamroller objection and commit public money to an architectural unicorn.
FEB18	Tormenting Meghan Markle has become a national sport that shames us	In the period when the acquisition of the former Meghan Markle was depicted as little short of a national triumph, much was written in the British press about her various accomplishments. These are, after all, roughly as common in royal spouses as successful independent careers. Meghan, the actress and blogger and charity worker, is also, it emerged, a skilled calligrapher. “I’ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well,” she once told an Esquire journalist, who’d described her writing as “incredible”. “What it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning.”
FEB18	Brexit extremism is going nowhere. Now the moderate millions must act	For three years, the worst of Britain has been in charge. The Britain that says it is elitist to tell the electorate it can’t have the impossible. The Britain that has patted itself on the back for threatening the rule of law and the independence of MPs. The Britain where it is normal for supporters of Jeremy Corbyn to call the BBC’s political editor a bitch and a whore and demand her dismissal for crimes against the party line and for supporters of Nigel Farage to send death threats to MPs. The Britain with no middle, only extremes. Millions have been airbrushed from the national story: Conservatives who voted to remain; Europeans who have made Britain their home for so long they are British in everything except their paperwork; British citizens living in the EU; and everyone in the UK who wants to live in the EU but whose rights are being taken away in a vast state power grab.
FEB18	Andrea Levy gave a voice to all my silenced forebears	Andrea Levy wrote to understand where she came from; I read her to understand where we come from. I was 23 when Small Island was published in 2004 and had just started working at the London Review Bookshop. The voice of the protagonist, Hortense, a Jamaican woman who worked hard and expected more from everyone, reminded me of my maternal grandma and her nursing friends, all of whom I respectfully called “aunty”. It was the first time I had read a depiction of people like my relations in the pages of a novel. I had already encountered another Jamaican Hortense in literary fiction in Zadie Smith’s triumphant debut, White Teeth. However, it is Levy’s Hortense, who is devoted to Britain – the Mother Country – who truly brought me a deeper understanding of home. How often, it seems, the Windrush generation is often more British than the British; their upbringing was strict, under traditional British colonialism. They honoured and adored the Queen as their head of state, their language is formal and accented RP, and their manners correct; they are so serious that you cannot help but smile.
FEB18	The possibility of redemption is central to a humane society	How do you solve a problem like Shamima? In February 2015, 15-year-old east London schoolgirl Shamima Begum travelled to Syria with two friends, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana, to join Islamic State. Last week, she was discovered in al-Hawl, a Syrian refugee camp, by the Times reporter Anthony Loyd. She is nine months pregnant and wants to return to Britain. For some, Begum is a victim, a child brainwashed into jihad. For others, she is a villain who willingly joined Isis and should be barred from this country. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, insists that he “will not hesitate to prevent” her return if necessary.
FEB19	I backed the SDP. But this Labour schism makes no sense at all	The great Brexit crisis slices through both parties, dividing families, friends, neighbours and colleagues. It may yet break apart the moribund political system. But that seismic rupture didn’t happen today when seven MPs walked out of the Labour party. Seven is a pitifully small number. The timing is monstrously badly judged and the reasons the MPs give are oddly scattergun, lacking political punch and focus. To be sure, they are not alone in thinking Jeremy Corbyn a weak leader with many failings: his poll ratings show most of the country agrees, as did the 172 Labour MPs who voted no confidence in him two and half years ago, as his “kinder gentler politics” turned poisonous.
FEB19	Britain could deradicalise Shamima Begum – with compassion	The CCTV images of the three teenage girls Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase passing through Gatwick airport four years ago en route to join the Islamic State “caliphate” were shocking for much of the British public. That Isis was radicalising people online was no surprise, but the fact these three girls were as young as 15 and from the same academy school in Bethnal Green, east London, cast the risks of radicalisation closer to home. The discredited counter-radicalisation strategy, Prevent, was meant to stem the recruitment of “homegrown” terrorists, including those recruited into the far right, but has disproportionately focused on Islamist extremism without yielding any significant concrete results. Last year, for example, an essay by the late Marxist political theorist Norman Geras on the political uses of violence was deemed so dangerous under the Prevent programme that Reading University students were warned not to leave it lying around where it could be seen “by those who are not prepared to view it”. The university flagged the text as an extremist piece of work that should only be read in a secure setting.
FEB19	History will judge the selfish breakaway Independent Group	The reasons offered by the Independent Group for their departure from Labour at their launch press conference simply do not stand up to scrutiny. First, Brexit. Labour has opposed the Tories at every stage, fighting Theresa May’s broken exit plan, voting against no deal and putting Labour’s policy, including the possibility of a further referendum, to a vote by MPs.
FEB19	Wake up, humanity! A hi-tech dystopian future is not inevitable	When is the future no longer the future? Only a decade ago, air travel seemed to be moving ineluctably towards giant planes, or “superjumbos”. But last week Airbus announced it will cease manufacturing its A380, the world’s fattest passenger jet, as current trends favour smaller and more fuel-efficient craft. Progress changed course. A more vivid reminder of lost dreams will come in a few weeks: 2 March marks the 50th anniversary of the maiden flight of Concorde. Once upon a time, all aviation was going to be supersonic. But sometimes, the future is cancelled. What if what we think is going to be the future right now is cancelled in its turn? We are supposedly on an unstoppable path towards driverless vehicles, fully automated internet-connected “smart homes”, and godlike artificial intelligence – but, then, we’ve been promised flying cars for half a century, and they are still (allegedly) just around the corner. We live in a time when technological change is portrayed as an inexorable, impersonal force: we’d better learn how to surf the tsunami or drown. But as a society, we always have a choice about which direction we take next. And sometimes we make the wrong decision.
FEB19	If Corbyn doesn’t want the Labour split to worsen, he has to listen	The ball is now in Jeremy Corbyn’s court. Whether the new “Independent Group” of MPs that split from the Labour party on Monday takes off largely depends upon what the leader does now to address the three crisis issues dividing him from the mainstream in his party: Europe, antisemitism and the attempted mass deselection of Labour MPs. The group, if it coalesces into a party of some kind, will struggle in the unforgiving world of our first-past-the-post electoral system. The SDP, of which I was an enthusiastic founder member shortly after my 18th birthday because of my admiration for Roy Jenkins and Shirley Williams, is not an encouraging precedent. The SDP got to 25% of the vote in alliance with the Liberals in the 1983 election, but the two parties combined won only 23 seats and most of the 28 Labour MPs who defected to it lost their seats. Significantly for the Independent Group, far more Labour MPs lost their seats from joining the SDP than from deselection at the hands of far left activists.
FEB19	You get the heroes you deserve. And Brexit Britain has Gavin Williamson	What a time to be alive for Conservative former chief whip-turned-defence secretary Gavin Williamson. Keen to turn back the clock to the days when Britain’s men in uniform could brutally quash a native uprising in the morning, appropriate half of India’s wealth in the afternoon and enjoy a G&T or seven in the evening, the man who once kept a pet tarantula in his office to cultivate an air of ruthless cunning has appropriated an image befitting his new role: action man.
FEB19	Facebook is out of control and politicians have no idea what to do	Death threats, bullying, mental torture, privacy invasion, election rigging, fake news, monopoly abuse: as was said of a medieval pope, this is merely to suppress more serious charges. It is hard to recall the social media of 15 years ago and its offer of universal love, democracy and global peace. Britain’s parliament has finally caught up, and today’s Commons report is at least unequivocal. A menace stalks the land, and must be curbed. Some of the report’s accusations are astonishing. Facebook “purposefully obstructed” the committee. Its boss, Mark Zuckerberg, who “continues to choose profit over data security,” held parliament in contempt. His rambling empire is portrayed as lying, thieving “digital gangsterism”. Yet British electoral law is puny. It is “unfit for purpose,” leaving elections “vulnerable to foreign influence, disinformation and voter manipulation”. Not a week passes without evidence that cybersecurity is inadequate and public services have been left vulnerable to hacking.
FEB19	Stop the online conspiracy theorists before they break democracy	Organised conspiracy theorist networks have launched an all-out information war across Europe. At the heart of this is the QAnon movement. It expanded from the US to Europe and the UK at rapid speed, hijacking political debates on social media as well as mass protests in the streets in recent months. Our new analysis at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue shows that European conspiracy theorists run increasingly sophisticated campaigns around critical junctions in national, regional and global politics. They even carried out social media operations to influence voters in German state elections, including the 2018 election in Bavaria. The QAnon community, which began on the message-board site 4chan, strongly overlaps with the support networks of far-right movements such as the EDL and Pegida. Most recently, it co-opted yellow vest demonstrations and boosted hardline Brexit campaigns and Tommy Robinson protests. By injecting conspiratorial narratives into these movements, its members can leverage existing networks and alter their political direction. A commonly used tactic is to combine conspiricist hashtags with those of viral campaigns and trending topics. The scale this generates is disproportional enough to distort public perception: In 2018, ISD identified close to 30m uses of the word “QAnon” across Twitter, YouTube and forums such as Reddit and 4chan.
FEB19	Brexit-led nationalism is destroying Britain’s overseas aid effort	Wearing a colourful dashiki shirt given to him by the president of Rwanda, Andrew Mitchell leaned forward in his armchair, eyes gleaming, and explained why the Conservative party’s pledge to spend 0.7% of GDP on international development was solid. Any attempt to change party policy on aid would fail, Mitchell told me because “there are too many of us who won’t put up with it”. That might have been the case when we met 18 months ago – it’s not now. The political consensus on aid, which has lasted two decades and led to Britain becoming a world leader in aid and development, has fallen apart.
FEB19	England lacks white working-class graduates. Quick fixes won’t change that	At half of England’s universities, fewer than 5% of students are classified as being from disadvantaged white backgrounds, according to a new report from the National Education Opportunities Network (Neon). This fact is bluntly stated as being a problem in the introduction of the report rather than the conclusion, but it is worth looking beyond these headline figures. What do reports like this really tell us? Who attends university, and which university they attend, is a question that captures commentators and policymakers, for reasons that are related to but not fundamentally about education. Universities are both pathways and gateways. They can help train you to get somewhere new, but they also work to make sure that only the right sort of people get into positions of power. These functions overlap, but aren’t the same.
FEB20	The choice is clear for Labour MPs. Stay with Corbyn or leave the party	There is a phrase that has a lot of currency among Labour MPs who hate the direction their party has taken under Jeremy Corbyn. They say they will “stay and fight”. The vow is sometimes taken in private, sometimes declared on social media alongside a plea for others to do the same. It has become so familiar that its meaning is rarely interrogated. But what is this fight? Who is it against? What does victory look like? The answers are not comfortable for the stayers. The enemy is the elected leader of their party and he enjoys the overwhelming support of its members. Corbyn’s position is so unassailable that his would-be assailants hardly dare to criticise him. They grumble about Labour’s position on Brexit and agitate for the endorsement of a second referendum. They express horror at the way antisemitism has eaten into the party like gangrene and demand surgical intervention. But in public, the dissenters avoid pointing blame squarely at the leader or even at individuals in his entourage.
FEB20	Taking Shamima Begum's citizenship risks making her a martyr	The decision to strip Shamima Begum of her citizenship will turn a young British woman into a martyr. In the same way Guantánamo Bay became a recruiting sergeant for extremism, cases like that of Begum will serve only to radicalise more young British Muslims.
FEB20	The return of King Rat Derek Hatton marks a new low for Labour	In a single day, the Labour party has lost Luciana Berger and “gained” Derek Hatton. As swaps go, this isn’t dissimilar to giving someone an orgasm and them giving you gonorrhoea: the loss of a hard-working, campaigning constituency MP (Berger was among seven MPs to resign from Labour) and the official welcoming back, by a three-person panel, of a man so odious that he infamously delivered redundancy notices by taxi to his own council staff. To sum up Hatton in a brief vignette: at the 2016 Labour party conference in Liverpool, I was in a coffee shop searching for wifi, and hit on a hotspot someone had called “Derek Twatton”.
FEB20	How would I deradicalise Shamima Begum? With Islamic scholarship	How do we deradicalise young, indoctrinated people like Shamima Begum? As part of their ideology, takfiri terrorist groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaida justify their aggression towards the west by creating a divide between Muslims and non-Muslims. They argue that the modern nation-state model of governance is incompatible with Islamic principles, and that the Muslim world must be governed by a caliphate based on medieval Sunni Islamic jurisprudence. From her recent interviews, it is clear that Begum is confused and conflicted about these issues: she has clear loyalty to Isis but did also criticise them and called Britain “home”. The medieval Muslim model of the world has been adapting and evolving for at least 700 years, and modern Islamic jurisprudence accepts that the nation-state system is entirely compatible with Islam.
FEB20	Carmakers quitting Britain won't blame Brexit – it's not in their interest	In 2012 a wave of anti-Japanese nationalism gripped China. Angry crowds burned down Japanese-owned factories, smashed Japanese-made cars and pelted Tokyo’s embassy in Beijing with eggs. It was an experience that jolted Japanese business leaders and they decided to make sure they never again relied on one country for essential widgets, and especially the finished article. In the months before the Brexit vote, Japan’s government warned that a victory for the leave campaign could have a negative impact on  investments in Britain. The Japan Business Federation, noting that more than 1,000 Japanese firms have a presence in Britain, joined the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in pleading with Britain to remain in the EU.
FEB20	At last, a Brexit dividend – shame it’s for the pedlars of fake medicine	Some crimes are just worse than others. When I tell people I research the market for fake and substandard medicines, their most common reaction is: “Fake cancer medicines? That’s horrible. Why would anyone do that?” The World Health Organization reported earlier this month that fake leukaemia medicine, packaged for the UK market to look like the genuine drug Iclusig, was circulating in Europe and the Americas. The short answer to why anyone would do something as morally awful as this, is of course: to make money. The fake leukaemia drug, containing mostly paracetamol, is being sold for $13,500 a pack – $450 a pill – in the US, or £5,000 a pack in the UK. There is now a far larger market for legal medicines than there is for illegal drugs, such as heroin or cocaine, and there’s a much smaller chance of getting caught. The (genuine) pills are for seriously sick people, so if a patient doesn’t blossom back to health after taking (fake) treatments, doctors generally blame the tumour, not the pill.
FEB20	A poll shows support for Labour’s defectors – it could tempt Tory MPs to follow	For a party that doesn’t actually exist yet, the movement born from the wreckage of what was once the Labour mainstream seems surprisingly popular. The first poll to test the water since seven MPs abandoned Jeremy Corbyn shows “a new centrist party against Brexit” in third place behind Labour and the Tories – and already beating the old centrist party against Brexit, otherwise known as the Liberal Democrats. Or to put it another way, in 24 hours it’s achieved the kind of market share that Ukip took decades to get near.
FEB20	Can Bernie Sanders repeat his surprising success this time around?	Bernie is back. It’s easy to forget the condescension and amusement that greeted himwhen he announced his first campaign for president, in May 2015.
FEB20	The British far right is leaderless – and all the more dangerous for it	Over the past year there have been a number of far-right demonstrations in London, some of which have attracted as many as 10,000 people. Whether it was the Free Tommy Robinson event in July or the “Brexit betrayal” demonstration in December, the far right descended on the capital in numbers not seen in decades, perhaps not since the interwar period of the 1930s. The primary focus of this string of demonstrations has ranged from the imprisonment of anti-Muslim activist Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), to the supposed suppression of free speech (especially in regards to speaking about Muslims), and the perceived betrayal of the Brexit vote by politicians and elites. Similarly, 2019 has kicked off with a number of small “yellow vest” demonstrations, also focusing on Brexit.
FEB20	Bees brought Bavarians together. And they have a lesson for us all	Last week, Bavarians forced their state legislature to change farming policies with the most successful petition in the state’s history. And while the law proposed by the petition covers a range of measures, it’s no surprise that campaigners’ rallying cry quickly became “save the bees”. Bees stand for diligence, dedication and orderliness. But they are also a symbol of our relationship with nature – and everything that has been wrong with it for decades. Bees are emblematic of how the fight to save our planet and stop runaway climate change cannot wait. They are our canary in the coalmine. Bees are essential for our food supply: apples, courgettes, almonds – one in every three bites we eat depends on bees and other pollinators. But soil sealing and industrial, monocultural agriculture using bee-harming pesticides have caused a massive decline in bee populations worldwide, to the extent that apple farmers in China have to pollinate their trees by hand.
FEB21	The splitting of the Tories and Labour could redefine British politics	Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston are not the first MPs to break away from the Conservative party. The list of Tory resigners goes back to Winston Churchill in 1904 and beyond. And they are unlikely to be the last. Back in October I had a coffee at the Tory conference with a cabinet minister who confessed: “Part of me is longing for Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg to become leader so the rest of us can just leave and join a new party.” Wednesday’s departure of “the three amigos”, as Allen called them at their press conference, does not make that much larger Tory fissure a certainty – much will depend on the Brexit endgame. But it makes it more likely. It also marks a potential watershed for the 21st-century Conservative party. When the three former Tory female MPs - and their gender is definitely part of the story -crossed the floor of the House of Commons this morning, they threw down the gauntlet to an entire generation of 21st-century Tory modernisers to either stand up or stand down.
FEB21	Whatever Meghan does, she’s damned. Let’s not repeat history	Last month I nominated Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, as a hate figure for the nation in 2019: the person we all need to get us through a difficult time, like your cousin’s girlfriend who waxes her eyebrows and yammers on about yoga at the start of a fraught Christmas. As I then explained about a million times on Twitter, I was joking: I do not hate Meghan, or even consider her vaguely hateful. I could no more despise the woman than I could flick through the pages of a magazine and take against a salt-and-pepper male model with a watch on. She wasn’t the point; the point was that society quests ceaselessly for an enemy, and if you’re going to have one, at least let it be one who probably won’t care. This was right in an ambient, premonitory way, but I was wrong to think it was funny. The poor woman is being vilified round the clock – this week for having the audacity to have a baby shower with her friends in New York. It has gone beyond the point of mattering what her personality is like, were anyone in any position to know: she would have to be so thoroughly bad to warrant this level of scrutiny, so devoid of human feeling, so malicious in every intention, that the media’s daily censure wouldn’t be enough. We’d have to paint her yellow and black like a bee.
FEB21	The Independent Group will at last give us real opposition to Brexit	Democracy abhors a vacuum. The realignment that is happening now in our politics is the inevitable consequence of 62% of the electorate feeling politically homeless. A majority of our people who feel that neither of our main parties share their values, principles and integrity. The decision of Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston to join the existing Labour members of the Independent Group begins what I hope will be a process that will finally give a voice to a so-far silent majority of voters. I admire them for beingwilling to put their heads above the parapet, to defy the onslaught of abuse I know too well, and to be brave enough to look beyond a vote taken nearly three years ago and to acknowledge the clear and present danger Brexit now poses to the livelihoods, jobs and quality of life of both leavers and remainers.
FEB21	UK museums should be honest about being stuffed with stolen goods	Museums are in crisis. In the past, their social role has been taken for granted – they’re spaces for preserving objects and educating the deferential public that comes to admire them. It’s a tidy, completist dream: wouldn’t it be nice to see the whole of human history, free and open to all? Except that history is nasty and ugly. It’s full of violence: every moment, every event, takes place within a power dynamic – there’s always a hierarchy in play. The whole concept of The Museum is a colonialist, imperialist fantasy, born from the fallacy that somehow the whole world can be neatly catalogued, contained in a single building, mapped out for easy digestion. There’s no such thing as a free object, and every piece in a museum has been moved from its original context. It’s uncomfortable and rude to look too closely at what that move involved.
FEB21	New York is right to ban hair discrimination. Now how about the UK?	New York City’s new legal guidance on discrimination based on hairstyle is a thing of beauty. It points out that “there is a widespread and fundamentally racist belief that black hairstyles are not suited for formal settings, and may be unhygienic, messy, disruptive, or unkempt”, and deems natural hair textures that are tightly coiled or tightly curled, and black hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, braids, fades, and afros, a protected racial characteristic. This means that is now illegal to target black people based on their hair or hairstyle at work, school or in any public place – and if you do, you may get fined. In a country where our elected representatives think it’s OK to describe ethnic minorities as having a “funny tinge” on live television, it appears that British conversations around the nature of hair texture and hairstyle discrimination, and how they intersect with race, are rudimentary at best. But now is the perfect time to consider the experiences of those of us living in Britain with kinky-coily hair, and whether Britain should introduce similar laws.
FEB21	The clitoris is a gift, so why is there an ingrained fear of talking about it?	The first UK conviction for female genital mutilation (FGM) this month was a milestone in the fight for the basic human rights of women and girls. But one of the things that stands out from the news reports of that case is how oddly furtive they were about communicating the key facts – in particular their avoidance of the C-word: clitoris. In reporting such a prominent case, are readers unable to be shown the correct medical terminology? Why do the media carefully avoid mentioning what occurred, using highly generalised anatomical terms before quickly moving on? If this lack of detail was to spare the victim the indignity of having such a personal matter discussed so publicly, I would have sympathy, however I do not think that this is the case here. What I think is at play, is a deep-rooted fear of the clitoris.
FEB21	Javid’s decision on Shamima Begum demeans his office	Politics has always, to some extent, been the art of combining doing what’s right with doing what’s in one’s own political interests. It would be naive to pretend otherwise. But in recent months – with a weak prime minister desperately trying to cling on to power, and senior Tories hungrily eyeing the top job – it feels like naked political ambition is shaping real-world outcomes more than ever before. Nowhere is that more evident than in Sajid Javid’s decision to revoke Shamima Begum’s British citizenship. In trying to position himself as Theresa May’s successor, the home secretary is signalling to the tabloid press just how tough he is on national security and immigration. Perhaps, as a son of immigrants, he feels he has more to prove.
FEB21	My grandfather was a Nazi. I’ve seen why we need the EU	Until his death in the early 1990s, my grandad was a committed Nazi. Most of his elder brothers died in one night at the battle of the Hartmannsweilerkopf in the first world war. In a bitterly traumatised interwar Germany, defined by hatred against foreigners, Jews and democracy as well as delusions of national grandeur, he was unemployed for most of the 1920s. He joined the Nazi party early, and volunteered to fight in 1940. He became a staff sergeant in the Wehrmacht and led a so-called “anti-partisan” unit on the eastern front, and participated in the capture of Kiev. We believe he took part in the September 1941 Babi Yar massacre, in which more than 33,000 Jewish inhabitants of Kiev were shot. Until his death he would rant about Jews, the French and the perfidious Albion. He never left the country again and he’d be in a near panic when coming close to a border.
FEB21	How to cure the shopping addiction that’s destroying our planet	I’ve always thought of myself as someone who cares about the environment. I’ve recycled for as long as I can remember, I’m on my way to having a plastic-free kitchen and I always try to take public transport instead of driving. But until last year I was guilty of unknowingly contributing to 1m tonnes of waste a year, more carbon emissions than the shipping and aviation industries combined, and microplastics ending up in the ocean – just by buying new clothes. A cross-party report has found that people today buy and discard clothes faster than ever, and it means we get rid of more than 1m tonnes of clothes a year, with £140m worth going to landfill every year. The implications of this are so bad that there have been recent claims that the fashion industry can be listed alongside the oil industry as one of the five most polluting industries in the world.
FEB21	Young climate strikers can win their fight. We must all help	This one has to succeed. It is not just that the youth climate strike, now building worldwide with tremendous speed, is our best (and possibly our last) hope of avoiding catastrophe. It is also that the impacts on the young people themselves, if their mobilisation and hopes collapse so early in their lives, could be devastating. To help this movement win, we should ask why others lost. We should ask, for instance, why Occupy, despite the energy and sacrifices of so many, came to an end, while the institutions it confronted remain intact. We should wonder why the global justice movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, despite the numbers involved, their courage and determination, has not changed the world. We should consider why Podemos, the Spanish party that rose so high on the optimism of the indignados movement, now seems to be spiralling into recriminatory collapse.
FEB22	Shamima Begum has a right to British citizenship, whether you like it or not	When I was 16 I stopped off in Holland, during a camping holiday with a friend. We bought as much marijuana as we could and smoked it all in an afternoon. Sat behind a housing estate in the border town of Nijmegen, we giggled, rambled and lay around until the local police came. They took us back to the campsite (we found the fact that they spoke Dutch hilarious), where we were asked for our passports and train tickets. They already had our number: a couple of idiots out of their minds and out of their depth. They told us to get on the next train in the direction of the port. We’d stopped laughing by then. We went home. Adolescents do stupid things. Often they know they are stupid at the time
FEB22	These Tory defectors are the Thelma and Louise of British politics	At the end of Thelma & Louise, as the net closes in on the outlaws, Geena Davis’s character turns to her friend and says she doesn’t ever remember feeling this awake. The freedom they craved may be violent and volatile compared to the steady suburban unhappiness of the lives they left behind, but at least now it feels as if there’s something to live for. There was a hint of something similar about a gleeful Heidi Allen declaring, as she left the Conservative party this week, that she was “tired of feeling numb” about politics; that she hadn’t felt this excited in years. The self-styled “three amigos” driving away from the Tories into an uncertain future as independents will no doubt have suffered their share of sleepless nights over this particular road trip. But compared with the rather grief-stricken press conference given by their colleagues leaving the Labour party, the excitement was palpable, and for a certain kind of female voter it’s undoubtedly infectious.
FEB22	The EU must resist impatience with Britain – for its own sake	“I will celebrate,” said an emphatic German voice behind me, while some dignitary on stage mouthed the conventional polite platitudes of regret about Britain’s departure from the EU. “I will celebrate when it’s over at last.” A week spent talking to politicians, officials and opinion-makers on the continent tells me that this captures the prevailing mood among Britain’s frustrated and increasingly contemptuous European partners: just get the negotiated withdrawal agreement across the line and Britain out of the door – then we can go back to fighting the real battles for Europe, starting with the European elections. While I understand all the feelings and calculations behind this view, it is profoundly shortsighted. It abandons those of us still fighting for Europe in Britain and underestimates the EU’s role in deciding Britain’s future. A divided country in the midst of a collective nervous breakdown is painfully dependent on the reaction of its now much stronger EU negotiating partner. This explains why every tweet from Donald Tusk, every hint from Jean-Claude Juncker, every nuance from Michel Barnier, is pored over in the British media with almost Sovietological attention. The EU is a major actor in the British debate, not merely a reactor to it. The conclusion is clear: it’s not just Britain that faces a big choice over Brexit, it’s also Europe.
FEB22	The City may thrive despite Brexit, but the rest of us won’t	An iron law of modern British government says that whatever London wants, London gets. On Monday, with no fuss or publicity, the Bank of England and a group of City interests reached an apparently boring deal in Paris with the European Security and Markets Authority. It follows a similar deal with the European commission last December. Both state, in effect, that, as far as the City is concerned, if there is a no-deal Brexit, Brexit did not happen. It was just play-acting by idiots down the road in Westminster. Up to £41tn in financial guarantees, insurances, hedges and other derivatives, all within the EU’s regulatory regime, is said to be at risk in the City’s clearing houses. For everyone involved, this is a grownup business, not to be left to the mercies of the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. The regulators have duly issued licences to the clearing houses, allowing Europe’s banks to disregard EU rules and continue trading on London’s derivatives platforms. Financially speaking, London is to become a “free port”. Sighs of relief all round.
FEB22	Barbie, a kitsch throwback? At least she wears it on her sleeve	There is a lot of excitement over the release, later this year, of the sequel to Frozen, but in my house, greater anticipation is reserved for the Barbie live action movie, due out in 2020, with Margot Robbie in the title role. For the last few years Mattel, Barbie’s makers, have been fighting competition from more modern Disney heroines, and the movie – in which Barbie is, reportedly, expelled from Barbie world for not being perfect enough – is part of the brand’s attempt at a feminist rejigging. I was never big into Barbie as a child. She and Ken seemed underpowered compared with my gang of hulking great Sindy dolls and their single beau, Action Man, with his weird felt hair and khaki jeep and switch at the back of his head that actually made his eyes swivel. Sindy has no presence in America, however, and among my daughters’ fourth birthday presents were palaeontologist Barbie and scientist Barbie. They are also committed to a seven-season Barbie animation on Netflix called Life in the Dreamhouse.
FEB22	Once Brexit is over, what’s left? A two-party system that kills optimism	Brexit breaks everything it touches, scything through the country, risking the union itself. Now it bites chunks out of both main parties, both richly deserving these desertions. More defections may follow: up to 30 from Labour are said to have considered it, while Heidi Allen claims a third of Tories would jump if no deal is in prospect – Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve have confirmed they are among them. This is as it should be, because Brexit is the most momentous political crisis of our lifetimes, overriding all other political issues, crossing party lines. Right now, in these crucial weeks, every good MP should put the fate of the country first and do all they can to stop Britain teetering over the Brexit precipice. They should threaten their rigid leaders with whatever damage they can inflict to make them change direction.
FEB22	Gay conversion therapy proves there’s still bigotry towards LGBT people	The results of a new survey on the evidence and impact of gay conversion therapy, in which same-sex attracted individuals are “treated” in order to become straight, are shocking. But I for one am not surprised that there still exists bigotry and prejudice towards us. As an out lesbian, I witness it on a regular basis. The survey by the Ozanne Foundation, led by Church of England lesbian activist Jayne Ozanne, attracted more than 4,600 responses. Of those, 458 people said they had tried to become straight; 91 had attempted suicide; and 22 had been forced to have sex with someone of the opposite sex.
FEB22	We cannot allow Liam Fox’s post-Brexit trade plans to go unscrutinised	The government cancelled parliament’s recess at short notice so as not to give the impression MPs were on holiday a matter of weeks before we face crashing out of the EU. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, is using the opportunity to avoid proper scrutiny of plans that threaten our rights, our environment and our democracy. He tabled a general debate on post-Brexit trade agreements with the US, Australia, New Zealand and the Trans-Pacific Partnership for Thursday. And he is expected to launch negotiations soon after the debate – with no chance for parliament to stop him.
FEB22	What next for the Independent Group? Here’s a winning manifesto	This week’s eruption of the new Independent Group in parliament has been caused in part by the toxic culture that has taken hold within each of the established parties. Bullying, intimidation and racism – covert and overt – have already persuaded 11 MPs to jump ship, probably to be followed by more in due course. But if they are to gain a permanent foothold in British politics, they will need to morph into a more normal party, and establish policies that distinguish them from Labour and the Conservatives. What policies might appeal to both social democrats and liberal conservatives alike? Start with this: the stale brand of politics practised on both frontbenches is inherently conservative. It looks back to a mythic past that never was and never could have been. Tories increasingly look askance at the liberal, open and cosmopolitan Britain that is emerging: many of them want to shut off the world, raise our borders, reduce immigration, insist on social modes and mores that went out of fashion decades ago. Labour now seems like something of a 1970s tribute band, champing at the bit to nationalise the public utilities, re-establish a ministry of labour, bring back sectoral wage bargaining and repeal most of the Trade Union Acts. Each of these pasts is a deeply nostalgic vision of a Britain that is not coming back, however much governments huff and puff.
FEB22	I served in the Met. The lack of progress on diversity is disgusting	The question that needs to be asked is not “are the Metropolitan police institutionally racist?”, or “why does black and minority ethnic recruitment for the police still lag so far behind the diversity of London as a whole?” It should simply be: “Why do young black and minority ethnic people reject the Metropolitan police as a career choice?” This week, marking 20 years since the landmark Macpherson report on institutional racism in the police, the Met said it would take 100 years for the force to mirror the wider diversity of London and will remain disproportionately white. Why?
FEB23	Charles Dickens was a ruthless Victorian husband. Like my great-grandfather	Domestic tyranny was a fact of Victorian life: men who were saintly in public could behave very cruelly behind their front doors. In 1878, close to the end of her life, Catherine Dickens began to confide to her neighbours in Camden, north London, a few details of how her late husband had treated her. Charles was by now eight years dead, and the couple had last lived together in 1858, around the time the novelist began his long affair with the young actress Ellen Ternan. But the public knew nothing of this relationship. Dickens’ worldwide reputation as a compassionate moralist – the enemy of humbug and suffering – continued to flourish untainted by the facts of his private life. Naturally the neighbours, Edward Dutton Cook and his wife, were shocked when Catherine told them how Charles had once tried to have her locked up as a madwoman.
FEB23	Just when the country needs Tom Hanks, we get Derek Hatton	Derek Hatton, George Galloway, Chris Williamson, Ken Livingstone: these guys may not physically sit together in public life, but I definitely think of them as “a grouping”. In fact, it is perfectly possible that over time they could be joined by “like-minded individuals” from the right. Galloway got on like a house on fire with Nigel Farage during the referendum. Unfortunately, both of them seem to have been pulled from the inferno unscathed. Yup, you can totally picture their independent minds dovetailing with disaffected #MeToo defendants or even defectors from the daytime schedules, such as Noel Edmonds. If things were different, they’d hang out more with their brother-from-another-mother Julian Assange. Like I said, it’s a mood; it’s a feeling. They don’t have to share every view. Most of them will have an objection to paying the licence fee, say, while only some of them will get slightly aroused when they think about Marine A. Quite a lot of them, actually. And not just the obvious ones.
FEB23	The odds are against them, but these MPs could yet change our politics	Westminster has a new parlour game. Since Monday, a conversation with anyone in or around politics will open with a round of “So what are the chances for this new Independent Group?” Players are encouraged to produce ever smarter reasons why the cluster of 11 MPs who broke from their former parties – eight from Labour, three from the Tories – is doomed to fail. Bonus points are awarded for historical references or imaginative use of polling data. By way of a warm-up, there are the obvious early arguments. New or third parties do notoriously badly under our first-past-the-post electoral system: just look at the SDP. There are no heavyweight figures to match the Gang of Four, who broke from Labour in 1981. The Independents have no leader and no clear policy stance. What’s more, within three hours of launching they were playing defence after one of their number, Angela Smith, seemingly referred to black and minority ethnic people as having a “funny tinge”, a racism so crude it was bewildering. Notice too how they struggle to surmount the contradiction of demanding a people’s vote on Brexit while refusing a people’s vote on themselves by refusing to trigger byelections in their own seats.
FEB23	The ugly truth about Karl Lagerfeld’s reign	Karl Lagerfeld is dead, and the fashion industry he presided over from the house of Chanel rends its garments and calls itself heartbroken. His muse, a white cat called Choupette, which exists largely on Twitter – a metaphor for his misanthropy so pure I thank him – was photographed in a mourning veil, thanking us for our words of condolence. That his best beloved was literally inhuman, and very small, is no surprise. (It is rumoured that, if she exists, she will inherit his fortune, though that is illegal in France.) I do not think Lagerfeld really liked women. It is impossible to watch his work and think he did. It is impossible to watch his face – immobile, from surgery or not, I can’t say – and think he liked himself. It is obvious, and often noted, that fashion doesn’t have to be misogynistic and exclusionary; fashion is merely expression, and expression is morally neutral. But it certainly became those things in the era when Lagerfeld was dominant. In a world that is pure hierarchy, he had the power of a medieval pope, and he could have used it to make fashion less exclusionary, and more joyful. Consider the changes that Edward Enninful is making at British Vogue. He employs Paris Lees, a trans woman, as a columnist, and his first cover featured Adwoa Aboah, a mixed-race woman. Lagerfeld was rarely so benevolent or brave: profit was his calling, and misogyny his method. At home, meanwhile, he preferred to idolise a cat.
FEB23	Calling everyone who criticises Corbyn ‘Blairite’ is crazy	Splitters. Traitors. The People’s Front of Judea. I am quite enjoying the current shenanigans of those people who say they just can’t take it any more. Some are sick of Brexit. Some want a people’s vote. Some are disgusted at the acceptance of antisemitism. Some are probably terrible careerists out only for themselves, though this seems a rather unlikely way to do it. Some may be people you want to go to the pub with. Some you would cross over the street to avoid. I couldn’t possibly comment. Never mind. Some probably just look at their own their leaders and wonder what they have to lose. Jeremy Corbyn, nonchalant about George Galloway being readmitted. Galloway! Oh why not? Degsy Hatton lasted all of two days in the in, out, shake it all about Labour party where you can say nasty things about Jews to some of the people just some of the time. As usual, none of this matters if you utter the magic word “neoliberalism” every other sentence.
FEB23	If news is dying, who will safeguard democracy?	Journalism has joined the list of endangered professions: teaching it appears to be more lucrative than doing it. A great deal of brilliant and high-quality journalism is still being pursued around the world every day, but the news industry is steadily shrinking. Why is that? Let’s make a distinction here between journalism and news. News is only one of the many kinds of journalistic output. News as a standardised, non-fiction literary form was invented more than 200 years ago in response to very specific social and cultural conditions, and was ignited by a new technology called the telegraph. The invention of the electric telegraph in the 1830s allowed the fast and international transmission of bursts of information in short, staccato messages, which were, ironically, not unlike tweets.
FEB23	France has an antisemitism problem – and not just from the gilets jaunes	The issue of antisemitism has taken centre stage in France in the last few days, following a spate of violent attacks – President Emmanuel Macron even said that it was at its worst level since the second world war. The gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement has also been infiltrated by this bigotry. Last weekend, gilets jaunes protesters hurled antisemitic slurs at Alain Finkielkraut – a prominent philosopher and ardent supporter of the movement – as he was walking by a rally. While the movement as a whole is not antisemitic, extremist groups, both far right and far left, have effectively co-opted it, turning it into a platform for a range of hateful narratives. As support continues to decline, the movement is becoming increasingly dominated by a radical, and sometimes extremist, minority. Yet reading the attack against Finkielkraut as an isolated episode or as a symptom of a movement spinning out of control misses an important truth: that, early on, the very nature of the movement has allowed hateful voices to weave their way into its ranks.
FEB23	Burberry’s noose hoodie is part of a shameful fashion tradition	A year ago Gucci put an offensive jumper on their Milan catwalk, although it took that long to actually cause offence. The wool balaclava jumper was black with a cut-out mouth and red lips which, when pulled up over the wearer’s face, bore a disturbing resemblance to blackface. At the time, no one seemed to notice. I missed it too, and I missed it again when it went on sale last autumn, both of which now seem inexcusable – looking at it, it couldn’t be anything else. Yet it wasn’t until February this year that flags were raised – on Twitter, as is often the case these days – and even then only within the context of Black History Month. Gucci apologised, and took the jumpers off the shelves, even though they had already sat there for a good six months.
FEB23	The EU must resist impatience with Britain – for its own sake	“I will celebrate,” said an emphatic German voice behind me, while some dignitary on stage mouthed the conventional polite platitudes of regret about Britain’s departure from the EU. “I will celebrate when it’s over at last.” A week spent talking to politicians, officials and opinion-makers on the continent tells me that this captures the prevailing mood among Britain’s frustrated and increasingly contemptuous European partners: just get the negotiated withdrawal agreement across the line and Britain out of the door – then we can go back to fighting the real battles for Europe, starting with the European elections. While I understand all the feelings and calculations behind this view, it is profoundly shortsighted. It abandons those of us still fighting for Europe in Britain and underestimates the EU’s role in deciding Britain’s future. A divided country in the midst of a collective nervous breakdown is painfully dependent on the reaction of its now much stronger EU negotiating partner. This explains why every tweet from Donald Tusk, every hint from Jean-Claude Juncker, every nuance from Michel Barnier, is pored over in the British media with almost Sovietological attention. The EU is a major actor in the British debate, not merely a reactor to it. The conclusion is clear: it’s not just Britain that faces a big choice over Brexit, it’s also Europe.
FEB23	Tory defectors are just getting involved in a Labour party tussle	I find it difficult to fathom why three Conservative MPs would wish to join the Independent Group formed by Labour MPs. They argue that the Conservative party has shifted away from them under Theresa May over the last year and a half. There is no evidence to support this. The party is rightly moving away from the austerity of the David Cameron/George Osborne years. It is highlighting the need to govern for the whole nation, and to take care of those places and people that need more support. It has championed the higher living wage, building on Labour’s introduction of the minimum wage. It has taken care to progress policies of toleration and support for minorities, to give more weight and money to mental health issues and has now announced major new funding for the NHS. These are all things I, as a supporter of the European Research Group, also support.
FEB24	Put yourself in Shamima Begum’s shoes before you damn her out of hand	Less than two weeks after Shamima Begum was discovered in a Syrian refugee camp, she’s public enemy number one. Eight in 10 people believe she should be stripped of her British citizenship; 65% say so, even if that leaves her stateless. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, might regard this as vindication of his disgraceful decision to deprive Begum of her citizenship last week. But others have expressed dismay at the level of public vitriol.
FEB24	May I have a word about… actors, hackers and shape-shifting balls	Did you know that there was a league table of state-sponsored hackers? No, me neither, but apparently Russia is the quickest out of the blocks for launching aggressive global cyber-attacks, with an average breakout time – the time it takes to move from a compromised computer to others in an organisation – of 18 minutes and 49 seconds, while Iran is a positive sluggard with an average breakout time of 5 hours and 9 minutes. This research comes from an organisation called CrowdStrike, which, as you might expect, goes big in its mission statement:
FEB24	Asbestos has haunted Scotland for decades and our children still at risk	In the dismal argot of government, few working-class families in west central Scotland have not been adversely affected by bad health “choices” and “outcomes”. Heart disease and cancer in particular seem to have developed a peculiar attachment to those who lived and worked near yards and factories and inhaled the fumes of mass production. Politicians, academics and health professionals – almost all of them sincere and intent on doing the right thing – like to reduce their analysis of these patterns of bad health into easily digestible bites that seem to make sense to the rest of us. If only we would all drink less, eat better and reduce our salt and sugar intake, why Scotland could become the gym bunny of Europe.
FEB24	Buoyed by freedom, the rebels are now able to follow their consciences	Of all the party’s factions, Labour First was the most practical. It wasn’t filled with rosy-cheeked Blairite missionaries from the upper-middle class, or with Corbynites who had never recovered from their first reading of Lenin as the joints were passed around in the 70s. Working class and hard headed, the Labour First rally at last year’s conference echoed to calls of “stay and fight” Corbyn. Show-offs would walk away, “hawking their conscience around from body to body asking to be told what to do with it”, as Ernie Bevin, hero of old Labour’s right, put it. Real Labourites would do the hard work to recapture the party from the far left.
FEB24	In exploring this united kingdom, I discovered a still proud separateness	I am English by birth and British by nationality; Brexit reminded me that I am Celtic by origin. Not for emotional reasons, but because my paternal grandfather was born in Newry, County Down. And that entitles me to Irish citizenship, which I was granted last year, and an Irish passport, which is being processed at the moment. Thanks to Dublin, I have salvaged my European identity which I hold as dear as I do my Englishness and Britishness. Growing up in London, I had no sense of an Irish or Scottish identity. But inspired by my newfound Irish citizenship, I found myself last month staring at an imposing stone oblong slab at St Patrick’s church in Newry, a couple of miles from the border with the Republic of Ireland. The words, The Glennys of Newry, were engraved in large letters and behind it lay the graves of my great-, my great-great- and my great-great-great-grandfathers. 
FEB24	‘Barking mad’... how Dickens led to our modern gaslighting men	If not exactly a local saint, like Churchill or Florence Nightingale, Charles Dickens comes close enough for his reputation to have largely survived, to date, the documented mistreatment of his wife, Catherine, mother of his 10 children. She was publicly dumped by him, denigrated and separated from all but one of their children, having become fat and – to Dickens – dull. Indeed, as the playwright Martin McDonagh demonstrated in a recent play, A Very Very Very Dark Matter, the reputational damage has been so scant that his hilarious reimagining of the creator of Tiny Tim – as a foulmouthed, lecherous fraud – came across as not so much counterfactual as wildly blasphemous.
FEB24	The Observer view on the robust action needed to curb 'online gangsters'	It would have been fascinating to be a fly on the wall, or a bug in the software, at last week’s meeting in San Francisco between Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, and Mark Zuckerberg, the elusive boss of Facebook. Mr Wright did not willingly share a lot of data afterwards, though who knows what might end up online. He described the talks as “useful”, while Facebook reported a “positive and productive conversation”. The fact that a cabinet minister was obliged to travel to California, after Mr Zuckerberg declined repeated invitations to appear before parliament, gives an insight into the relative balance of power as pressure grows to impose a semblance of order, integrity and legality on a chaotic online digital world. By deigning to meet, Mr Zuckerberg gave the impression that he was doing Wright a big favour.
FEB24	The Observer view on the future of the Independent Group	More than half of the UK electorate think the political system is broken. That’s according to a poll published by the charity Hope not Hate last week. Just under seven in 10 of those polled also said that they think none of the main political parties speaks for them. It’s not hard to imagine what’s motivating these sentiments. Parliament remains gridlocked on the most important question facing the country for decades. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are plainly putting their party interest before the national interest on Brexit. Other issues that matter to people – school funding, how we care for older people – have been all but squeezed out of the debate. Could a new political party go some way towards fixing these problems? That’s the question facing 12 newly independent MPs who left the Labour and Conservative parties last week, 11 of whom have formed a loose grouping, the Independent Group. There was something refreshing about watching these MPs call time on their parties’ floundering leaderships. And there was much to agree with in their critiques. For Labour, by far the most serious charge is the leadership’s failure to respond adequately to the antisemitic abuse being committed by some of its members. It is damning and shocking to witness a Jewish Labour MP leaving a party with a proud anti-racist history because the disgusting abuse shows no signs of abating in 2019. Of course, Mr Corbyn’s failure to adopt a coherent position on Brexit was also a big factor for most of the departing MPs.
FEB24	Breakdancing at the Olympics? Bring it on...	Good for Paco Boxy, the face of British breakdancing, who came out with a punchy – one might say nominatively characteristic – comment on hearing that the sport was to be included (pending ratification) in the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. “A lot of people will look at breakdancing as just spinning on your head or doing the worm,” he said, “but the people that I know train like athletes. They go to the gym swimming, train every day. For this to go in the Olympics is massive.”
FEB24	The Japanese aren’t daft – that’s why they’re getting out of Brexit Britain	One of the few remaining elegant wooden buildings in central Tokyo that survived allied bombing in the second world war is the Mitsubishi lodge. The Kaitokaku, set back from the main thoroughfares, its gardens overshadowed by skyscrapers, is a web of beautifully carved wood rooms where executives, bankers and clients who are part of the Mitsubishi keiretsu, or conglomerate network, socialise, with top officials from the phenomenally influential ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), and discuss business privately – drinking sake until three or four in the morning. Deals are done, new technologies discussed and consensus reached on what is happening geopolitically to Japan’s markets and how it should react. The closeness of the relationship between business, finance and state is a universe apart from anything we know in Britain. Critics argue that the keiretsu represents a destructive corporatism and an obstacle to the operation of free and open markets; admirers that it allows member companies to share risks, find synergies, lower financing costs and encourage long-termism – so informing Japan’s agile industrial policy and directly leading to Japan having dozens of world-beating companies and brands. By contrast, Britain is not at the races.
FEB25	If Labour aids a Tory Brexit it will be destroyed by what follows	Even now, after all that’s happened over the past few days and with everything to come, Labour politicians and their aides cling to one of two excuses for their position on Brexit. The first will come most often from an MP for some kicked-about northern seat. “I voted remain, of course,” they generally begin, “but my constituents wanted Brexit.” And so, despite all misgivings, Brexit they shall have. Soft Brexit, naturally, as soft and as yielding as a goosedown pillow, because our clear-eyed, good-hearted representative looks at the tragedy at Honda and knows they want no more of that – but enough Brexit, they hope, to satisfy the voters’ appetite. The second excuse usually comes from those closer to Jeremy Corbyn, by employment or inclination. For them, Brexit is something to be endured for the greater good of enabling Labour to kick out the Tories. So nail those six tests to the door even if they are, to use a technical term, “bollocks”; offer to help Theresa May with her deal; strike a tone both constructive and ambiguous.
FEB25	Jussie Smollett’s story shows how intolerant of ‘victims’ we really are	One of the many moral panics of our time is that of “victimhood culture”. Apparently, we are too indulgent of those who can claim victim status, a state especially rife among students. The story goes that this has turned us all into eternal babies, coddling us, protecting us from “micro aggressions” and signalling an erosion of individual grit and autonomy in favour of mimsy whining. In an effort to invert unfair power structures, some claim, victimhood culture has only succeeded in replacing them with different unfair power structures, where those who used to be at the bottom now hold the whip hand over those who used to be at the top. Women terrify men, who are forever fearful an offhand remark will become a harassment lawsuit, and racial minorities secure jobs at the expense of white people the moment their unusual names are spotted on a CV. The writer Lionel Shriver called it “privileging the disadvantaged”. Shriver also told BBC Radio 4 that white men in the UK are on the bottom rung of society, because they are considered to be the most powerful demographic (reader, I can reveal they are). Victimhood culture advocates engage in a lot of doublethink.
FEB25	I salute the new independent MPs – here is my advice to them	Let us start with the wisdom of Edmund Burke, the founding father of not-so-thoughtless conservatism: “The unfortunate independent member has nothing to offer but harsh refusal, or pitiful excuse, or despondent representation of a hopeless interest … In the House, he votes for ever in a dispirited minority … Can we conceive of a more discouraging post of duty than this?” I did it for four years, from 1997 to 2001, and believe that Burke was wrong. Looking back on it, I reflected that being an MP, like being a soldier, was something that I did not much enjoy doing, but I enjoyed having done. And I found a friendly space in the House of Commons. MPs on all sides treated me as an historical oddity rather than a threat to their party system. My parliamentary friends were of the awkward squad.
FEB25	There is now a force to disrupt Brexit. MPs, it’s time to act	One of the great lessons of the 20th century is that history has no direction: as Isaiah Berlin and Karl Popper argued, and as the transformative upheavals of 1989 showed to thrilling effect, there is no secular version of providence, no ideological script to follow. So it has been alarming, in the past few years, to watch the two main parties surrendering to different versions of the teleological delusion. The Conservative party has embraced Brexit as a mythic nativist destiny towards which we must all march loyally. Labour, meanwhile, is in thrall to the old left determinism, in which all the core debates have long since been settled, devotion to the leadership must be absolute, and all that remains is for those who are foolish enough to think otherwise to be stripped of their false consciousness. For those of us who believe in pluralist politics, it has been a depressing spectacle, a battle between desperate certainties that slide pointlessly over the gritty, unpredictable reality of 21st-century life. Which is the principal reason why the foundation of the 11-strong Independent Group of formerly Labour and Tory MPs has been so refreshing.
FEB25	Real pain lies behind the fiction of true-crime dramas	Though I’m better known as an arts journalist, for most of my career I’ve been a crime reporter. I’ve covered headline-making cases, from the serial killer Levi Bellfield – the subject of ITV’s recent drama Manhunt – to that of Shannon Matthews, whose abduction was the subject of the BBC drama The Moorside. I’m proud of the careful, responsible reporting of those cases by journalists, and am always inspired by the diligent work of police, lawyers and jurors in public courtrooms all over the country. That’s why I’m wary of fictionalised true crime. Writers of dramas take the trauma of real lives, but then without the same obligations of accuracy and fairness that journalists or documentarians have, can play fast and loose to make fiction about relatively recent crimes. Some is breathtakingly casual. Who did not wince at John Malkovich’s recent musings on the Today programme about David Mamet’s new “black farce about a very badly behaved movie mogul”? “It’s a terrific piece of writing,” he told us.
FEB25	Sajid Javid is pandering to rightwing press over Shamima Begum	A media rule of thumb: beware those moments when competing editors, leader writers and commentators agree with each other and politicians leap on the bandwagon. It always heralds a moral panic. This has been perfectly illustrated by the case of Shamima Begum, the 19-year-old Islamic State recruit who gave birth to her third child – the previous two having died – in a Syrian refugee camp. She would have been an easy target at any time. Now, with Britain’s parliament in disarray and the country hopelessly split over Brexit, here was a rallying point for collective outrage. Nobody, surely, could disagree.
FEB25	Why binary politics leaves Britain all at sea	Eton College’s most admirable attribute, I’ve long thought, is its motto. A Latin phrase, but not one that would have been familiar to the Romans, Floreat Etona translates as “May Eton flourish”. Contractually speaking, that’s watertight. No bombast and no virtue-signalling. Good luck anyone saying that particular institution has hypocritically betrayed its aims or principles. This place is about this place. It’s like someone proclaiming: “I’m all about me!” – it steals the thunder of any accusations of selfishness. On consulting the college’s website, however, I discovered that Floreat Etona is not, strictly speaking, its motto. “Eton’s motto is often thought to be Floreat Etona,” it says, “… but Esto perpetua (“May it last for ever”) came into usage if anything a little earlier.” I’m not sure what the “if anything” is doing for that sentence. I think if anything it’s superfluous. That’s to say, I think it’s a superfluous “if anything”. If anything. The website carries on: “In fact, neither phrase is officially a motto; they are unofficial creations that, over time, have stuck.”
FEB25	Shock value has its role for animal rights campaigners	Judging by its wiry, dun-coloured fur, its ears and snout, the dog was perhaps an airedale, lying side-on and close up to the camera. But identification was difficult because most of its body had been skinned and it seemed in the process of being barbecued whole. The arresting image was the title-screen still from a video about the protest methods of animal rights activists. Readers reacted quickly. “Please get this off our screens without delay. It is horrible that the Guardian would stoop so low and call it journalism.” One person complained that “the title and content of the article gives no clue that a close-up image of the face and body of a butchered animal will appear, and it is not directly related to the content, either”. In the context of serious video journalism exploring a strand of contemporary political activism, there was clear editorial justification for reporting, signposted, the mock barbecue staged by protesters in a shopping precinct in Sydney. (Their sign on the barbecue read: “If you wouldn’t eat a dog, why eat a lamb? Go vegan!”) 
FEB25	Independents offer hope to those who despair of our broken politics	Winston Churchill, who left the Tories to become a Liberal and then went back to the Conservatives, wryly congratulated himself: “Anyone can rat, but it takes a certain ingenuity to re-rat.” He is the exception to the rule that switchers don’t succeed in British politics. It is an enormous decision when an MP chooses to break with a party to which the politician will very often have committed decades of his or her life. It means the ruination of friendships and the wrecking of family relationships. And it is much more often than not a choice that leads to doom. This is why so many Labour and Conservative MPs stay within their parties even when they are in the most profound despair with where they are going or how they are being led. They resign themselves to bitter self-imprisonment in the belief that splitters never prosper.
FEB25	A new politics? That lies with the people, not the Independent Group	The launch of the new Independent Group was a golden opportunity to do politics differently. The most high-profile of its eight former Labour MPs, Chuka Umunna, even described it as the beginning of a “new politics”. Really? It all felt frustratingly, dispiritingly same old, same old. Politicians behind podiums, at a press conference a stone’s throw from parliament, telling us it’s about them, what they know, what they will do and why they should be in charge. This, categorically, is not a new politics – because that wouldn’t be about them, it would be about us. This is what those MPs should have done to demonstrate a new politics. They would have gone anywhere but Westminster – to a vibrant community hub, for example. They would have brought together lots of different people, from varied backgrounds, especially the young. They would have sat with them, not in front of them. The people would have talked first and the politicians would have responded. It would have been live streamed with people asking questions and making points from wherever they were. Climate change would have been a key issue.
FEB26	At last, Jeremy. Now Labour’s mission must be to prevent any Brexit	Sliding closer day by day, you can hear the swelling excitement of the catastrophists at the thrilling prospect of a no-deal smash-out. Into the unknown! Hurl all the old certainties into the air and see what new patterns the broken fragments make on the floor! Break all rules, start again, bring on the Brexit revolution! They take no heed when the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, cautioned them on Monday: “We are sleep-walking into no-deal scenario. It’s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you. Wake up. This is real. ? European council president Donald Tusk and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar added warnings of a “chaotic Brexit ?, the grown-ups trying to restrain the out-of-control teenagers punching each other up inside what purports to be the British government. Since there can’t be a reopening of the withdrawal agreement or a breaking of the backstop in the Irish border settlement, Tusk says: “It’s absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal. ? So Theresa May tiptoes closer to the edge, at serious risk of an accidental last-minute plunge.
FEB26	Green Book’s Oscar shows Hollywood still doesn’t get race	It’s now four years since the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag put Hollywood movie-making in the dock over its failure to acknowledge black achievement. A lot has happened since: Moonlight memorably won the best picture Oscar two years ago; Mahershala Ali and Viola Davis have won supporting actor prizes; and Jordan Peele has a best original screenplay gong. Alongside them, several other black artists have been nominated. But the OscarsSoWhite campaign was not meant merely as a tick-box exercise in counting the number of nominations. It was meant to make Hollywood rethink how it tells black people’s stories, and to reward black artists in the best possible way – by giving them the chance to have their voices heard.
FEB26	What lunch with the PM taught me: her dullness disguises a dangerous power mania	Have I told you about the very long lunch I once had with Theresa May? I was reminded of it as I watched a clip of her playing pool with the Italian prime minister at an EU summit at the weekend. The lunch went on for several hours – or so it seemed. All space and time came to a halt as I sat there, staring at my cutlery in a state of existential despair, failing, somehow, to communicate with her. I gave up the will to live between the starter and the main course and just kept glancing over at her security detail on another table, wishing I could be with them. Ordinary people talking. This was when I worked at a rightwing newspaper and would often be taken along as a token woman to meet Tory grandees. Some of them were quite a laugh. Some sort of fun and gossip could be had. Some were incredibly dull and thick. Some sent me into a trance, they were so boring. And some were just obnoxious. Ann Widdecombe, for instance, was, I felt, nasty to the waitress. To me that breaks the 11th commandment. I remember asking her what star sign she was, just to annoy her.
FEB26	If Labour aids a Tory Brexit it will be destroyed by what follows	Even now, after all that’s happened over the past few days and with everything to come, Labour politicians and their aides cling to one of two excuses for their position on Brexit. The first will come most often from an MP for some kicked-about northern seat. “I voted remain, of course,” they generally begin, “but my constituents wanted Brexit.” And so, despite all misgivings, Brexit they shall have. Soft Brexit, naturally, as soft and as yielding as a goosedown pillow, because our clear-eyed, good-hearted representative looks at the tragedy at Honda and knows they want no more of that – but enough Brexit, they hope, to satisfy the voters’ appetite. The second excuse usually comes from those closer to Jeremy Corbyn, by employment or inclination. For them, Brexit is something to be endured for the greater good of enabling Labour to kick out the Tories. So nail those six tests to the door even if they are, to use a technical term, “bollocks”; offer to help Theresa May with her deal; strike a tone both constructive and ambiguous.
FEB26	Brexit is too important to be rushed. Let’s calm down and press ‘pause’	Delay, delay, delay. Today’s parliament well mirrors the nation. It is implacably split. It cannot make up its mind on how to leave the EU next month. So it should just stop, calm down and think. There is a sensible way forward into the two-year transition period, and it is called Theresa May’s deal with the EU. But since some 80 Tory fundamentalists will not have it and hold her in an arm-lock, to move forward requires Labour cooperation. EU negotiators are at a loss as to why such cooperation has not been forthcoming. The answer is that Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn is as much an anarchist as the Tory fundamentalists. So there is stalemate. Hence the wisdom of delay. A decision has been made to leave the EU. Every bit of evidence, from business and trade to opinion polls and lobbyists, shows a desire to maintain “frictionless” trade, at least in goods and services, with a future Europe. It is equally plain that MPs have shown that finding such a compromise is beyond them. The 2017 House of Commons will stand with the 1648 Rump Parliament as among the worst in history.
FEB26	How big tobacco keeps cancer rates high in countries like mine	Caring for people with cancer in Bangladesh – as I do every day – should be getting easier. After all, we’ve had a decade-long economic boom, with extreme poverty rates halved. This, in turn, has led to dramatic health benefits, with large reductions in maternal and child mortality. So why aren’t we seeing similar improvements in cancer?
FEB26	A huge land grab is threatening India’s tribal people. They need global help	About 8 million indigenous people in India are in danger of being evicted from forests that their ancestors have lived in for millennia. This grave injustice follows a shocking supreme court ruling that rides roughshod over the rights of India’s indigenous people, known as Adivasi, or tribals. According to the 2011 census, these tribal people number 104 million – almost 9% of the country’s then 1.2 billion population. It is the largest indigenous population in any country in the world, occupying 22% of India’s geographical terrain.
FEB26	Don't trust the adults in the room on climate change	There’s an inspiring new slogan gaining traction among venerated pundits and politicians of a certain age that claim steadfast commitment to the cause of stopping catastrophic climate change: “Get off my lawn.” Most recently, California senator Dianne Feinstein, 85, scolded a group of middle-schoolers with the group Youth v Apocalypse, who had joined the Sunrise Movement to call on Feinstein to back a resolution in the Senate supporting a Green New Deal. In a now infamous exchange, Feinstein barked that “I know what I’m doing” and that she has “been doing this for 30 years”, so they better just bugger off and let the adults work. (To be fair, the video was edited to comply with Twitter’s content guidelines. In the full clip she also offers them an internship.)
FEB26	Homeless people need a home first, support second	As news breaks of the scarily high numbers of homeless people arriving in British hospitals with diseases we thought we’d left in the past, such as tuberculosis, there’s yet more soul-searching about what can be done to help. So what do homeless people really need? It sounds naive, and obvious, but the answer is: housing. They need homes more than anything else. Rough sleepers especially urgently need a permanent roof over their head, as of right. Recently, I have been sofa surfing. It was more difficult than I can really explain: I endured daily insecurity, often not knowing where I would stay that night. I applied successfully to be housed and have now been offered a home. Because that is what I needed; it doesn’t take a genius to work out that homeless people need some sort of a home.
FEB26	Deportation for being single? This shows the real bigotry gay people face	Last week, it was revealed that a 67-year-old man faces deportation to Malaysia because Home Office officials, and a tribunal judge, refuse to believe he is gay. Yew Fook Sam, known as Sam, came out two years ago and spent 10 months in Harmondsworth immigration removal centre. He arrived in the UK in 2005 after his wife found out he had been having sex with ladyboys in Thailand and left him. The Home Office has suggested the fact that Sam does not have a boyfriend raises suspicions about the legitimacy of his asylum claim, leading to a rejection of his claim. His lack of sexual partners lent weight to their suspicions.
FEB27	Another referendum has edged closer. With Labour behind it, remain can win	No unnamed Labour source can mask what’s happened, and no professional Corbyn-sceptics can derail it. There is now a real prospect of another referendum. Labour has committed to several parliamentary manoeuvres including one final stab at its own Brexit, which will certainly fail; another to support Yvette Cooper’s attempt to push no deal further into the realm of destructive fantasy, where it belongs; and a vote on an amendment demanding that any Brexit deal approved by the Commons must be ratified in a public referendum. In that public vote, Labour will campaign to remain in the EU. “Sources ? within Labour continue to deny this new reality, even as its senior frontbenchers have announced it. “It’s a disgrace, ? one told me, “that unelected, unsourced voices are briefing against Labour’s frontbench. ? “If they want to speak for the Labour party, ? a staffer said, “they should stand for the Labour party. ? The position as it stands now is not the seismic shift some suggest. It is a continuation of the policy adopted at Labour’s party conference last September. And credit for it belongs with the grassroots of the Labour party.
FEB27	What do Labour MPs think of the party’s shift on a second Brexit vote?	As the dust settles on Labour’s announcement this week, major problems emerge. The first is the belief that you can game the system from a desk in Westminster to get the outcome you want. When significant numbers of voters want to leave without a deal at all, a “choice” between May’s deal or remain is not democratic. MPs rightly want to avoid no deal, but to pretend we can settle “the will of the people” when a major, popular option is simply left off the ballot paper treats people as if they are stupid. They aren’t. Why aren’t we learning? The second problem is the message this decision sends to the wider Labour party. Apparently, you can have more impact on Labour policy by leaving the party than by staying in it. For a political party that seeks to govern effectively that is just not sustainable. Above all, none of these elite power-plays deal with the reality already upon us. In towns across Britain, the ongoing uncertainty is already costing jobs. There has been no effort to build consensus for a referendum in parliament, let alone the public. As a short-term tactic it may help the party through a difficult week, but look through a longer lens and the future looks much more fraught than it did a week ago, for us and more importantly for the country.
FEB27	For the Independent Group, even Nando's is a photo opportunity	It is day eight of the existence of the Independent Group, which is currently polling at 18% (according to YouGov). The group has said it will hold off calling byelections for now, and is not at this stage registered as a political party, but in its early days it is, of course, keen to raise its profile. This has led to a number of beautiful photo opportunities, press conferences and broadcast appearances. Let’s take a look, shall we? A photo of the group’s first outing was tweeted last night by Chuka Umunna. As so often with politicians trying to appeal to the people, it was a food-based photo opportunity:

FEB27	If we’re heading for a hard Brexit, then we’re heading for a united Ireland	The year is 2025 and the prime minister, David Lammy, has just phoned the Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, to congratulate her on victory in Ireland’s unification referendum. The deputy prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweets that she hopes Scotland will follow suit in the referendum she secured at the last election for taking the Scottish National party into coalition with Labour. Gerry Adams gives the dedication as a statue of Jacob Rees-Mogg is unveiled in Crossmaglen. The Tory leader, Amber Rudd, refuses to publicly blame her predecessor Boris Johnson for the breakup of the union but, like the rest of what’s left of the country, she knows the truth. As anyone involved in the Good Friday agreement will tell you, principles guarantee no deal. It’s why the current Brexit negotiations between the UK and itself are going so well. Theresa May has red lines, the European Research Group (ERG) has absolute red lines, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has blood-red lines, and Jeremy Corbyn has blurred lines featuring Pharrell. If they all hold firm, we’re heading for a hard Brexit. And a united Ireland.
FEB27	This change in the law on organ donation will save hundreds of lives	Lives will be saved. Hundreds of them, every year. That’s the first and most important thing to say about the organ donation (deemed consent) bill, which is expected to clear parliament today and become English law in 2020. You may already know it as Max and Keira’s Law, after the young boy and girl whose story inspired politicians of all parties to get behind a change that will take us from having to opt in as an organ donor to having to opt out. The government expects that as many as 700 lives a year may be saved – as Max Johnson’s was.
FEB27	Gunboat diplomacy can only harm Britain’s relationship with China	A certain British politician’s hyping up of the “China threat” in a recent speech struck a discordant note with the mainstream view in the UK that the country has a strong and constructive relationship with China. It has led me to think about how much could be learned from the world-class concerts by London’s leading symphony orchestra that I have attended, the beauty of which comes from the harmony of various sounds and the coordination between the players. If the China-UK relationship were compared to a symphony, its success would depend on close coordination between the two countries and a firm resistance to interruptions and noises. In this symphony, China and the UK rely on mutual respect and trust to keep us in tune, and keep out the noise of enmity and confrontation.
FEB27	Am I the only one who’s terrified about the warm weather?	They were everywhere in London on the weekend. The people in short sleeves or sandals. The ones with sunglasses ostentatiously hanging from the front of their shirts or balanced on top of their heads. The beer gardens and riverside pubs of the capital were heaving; corner shops ran out of ice-cream. Outside it was 17C (62F). Monday was another warm day, without a cloud in the sky, and in the late afternoon the light took on a magical, honey-coloured hue. It brought to mind one of those summer evenings you remember from childhood, when you’d be in the park all day and your parents let you stay out until bedtime, and you felt like you were doing something deliciously naughty just by being there.

FEB27	Why was Alesha MacPhail killed? Perhaps we should stop asking	One aims not to weep on the job, so I just about made it to the ladies’ after sitting through the pathologist’s report. The extent of the brutalisation endured by six-year-old Alesha MacPhail, who was found dead on the Isle of Bute last July, has not been reported by the media and I hope never will be. But it goes some way to explaining why experienced police officers and scientific experts struggled to maintain their composure while giving evidence during the nine-day trial of her killer. A 16-year-old boy was found guilty of Alesha’s abduction, rape and murder at the high court in Glasgow last Thursday. The following day, the trial judge agreed to lift the legal protection usually afforded to young people who are an accused, victim or witness in criminal trials in Scotland and allowed Aaron Campbell to be named.
FEB28	Time is on the side of remainers amid Brexit’s smoke and mirrors	Ever since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, two things have been clear. No serious attempt to reverse or even moderate the leave decision would ever be uncontroversial. And any such attempt would require a degree of present legitimacy that could be acquired only in the light of new events and with the passing of time. The question today is whether we have now reached such a moment. Very clearly, there was no such moment in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 referendum. It would have been too soon. It would have been merely a spasm of outrage. The voters had only just expressed their will. No government could defy that decision, even if it had wanted to. Theresa May rightly grasped that she had become prime minister with a mandate to deliver on the vote.
FEB28	For Kashmir, there is only one strategy left to try: peace	In the summer of 1999, I was standing outside our ancestral home in Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, when I saw fighter jets roar past in the skies above me. The Indian air force was carrying out sorties towards the mountainous district of Kargil to dislodge Pakistani militants and, as we found out later, Pakistani soldiers. The troops had quietly occupied the snow-capped peaks as part of a stealth operation masterminded by the then Pakistani general and future president Pervez Musharraf. The sight and sound of sophisticated military hardware provided a brief thrill, but it soon turned into panic. What if these bombers dropped their lethal cache on our home? At night, as I lay in bed, I imagined our neighbourhood as rubble from which acrid smoke rose. I imagined dear ones lying dead in homes and on streets, like in war films. I saw friends and myself as bodies in pools of blood. It was terrifying.
FEB28	Labour doesn’t have zero tolerance of antisemitism if Chris Williamson is an MP	Credit to Chris Williamson for originality. Not many have suggested that Labour’s chief problem with antisemitism within its ranks is that it has been too apologetic to the Jewish community, that it has shown an excess of concern and contrition. Yet that is the argument the Derby North MP made to activists in Sheffield last week, in footage obtained by the Yorkshire Post. “I’ve got to say I think our party’s response has been partly responsible,” he said. “Because, in my opinion, we’ve backed off far too much, we’ve given too much ground, we’ve been too apologetic.”
FEB28	How not to infuriate your spouse: a short guide to the marriage lessons all couples need	When I heard that a hotel was offering “groom courses” for fiances – with classes on making breakfast in bed and doing the laundry – I immediately assumed it was in Japan, where themed accommodation is commonplace. But the training is actually being offered at Rosslea Hall in Argyll and Bute. “We are calling all lovely brides-to-be before they say ‘I do’ so they can whip their men into shape and cut the mothers’ apron strings,” said a spokeswoman for the establishment, although it read like a Russian troll-bot, programmed to inflame men’s rights activists. And boy, did they bite. “Are these women looking for a husband or a servant?” asked one Twitter user, amid more generalised griping about how this was 2019, and how do people think men manage before they get married.
FEB28	Did Iran’s foreign minister ‘resign’ just to boost his influence at home?	Almost 36 hours after the apparent resignation of Iran’s foreign minister, there are finally some answers to the many questions it raised. For instance, his superior, president Hassan Rouhani, has not accepted his resignation, which is required under Iranian law. Neither has the top decision-maker in the country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – if one is to believe cryptic rumours of a “high-ranking official” having told the diplomat that his exit is not “expedient”. Mohammad Javad Zarif is back at work, joining Rouhani in greeting a visiting Armenian delegation early on Wednesday. But there is still the question of why Zarif suddenly decided to go on Instagram at midnight on Monday, expressing gratitude to “the dear and honourable Iranian people for the last 67 months” and apologising for his “incapacity” to continue serving in his post. Being under fire from all sides is certainly not a novelty for the ever-smiling Iranian chief diplomat. For years, he has been adored and despised for essentially the same thing: his ability to convincingly make Iran’s case to the world in fluent English, with a strong grasp of how western media works.
FEB28	Chagos Islanders remind us that Britain is a shameful coloniser, not a colony	At a time when Britain needs goodwill and great branding, the world was reminded this week of our nation’s shame, courtesy of the families of 2,000 people dispossessed from their Indian Ocean home in the 1960s and 70s. It’s a shame that looms large in the history of the Chagos Islands, an archipelago whose tiny size is in perfect contrast to the scale of the wrongs its people have witnessed. They are wrongs stretching back centuries, since the British formally acquired the islands from France – as part of the bigger colony of Mauritius – and forced slaves from Mozambique and Madagascar to work on British-owned coconut plantations. Britain the colonial power is not quite the image its leaders are trying to project just now
FEB28	Student halls for all? That's not an answer to Britain’s housing crisis, it's a living nightmare	Due to a lack of affordable housing, a new report suggests childless millennials should be offered living spaces that comprise a small bedroom with shower, plus shared kitchens and living areas. The report points to “co-living communities” already springing up in London, New York and Beijing, which make it “easier for people to interact with each other”. Let’s call a spade a tool for digging our graves. What they are talking about is living in student halls. For the rest of your days. When you’re young, dorm life can be thrilling. Listening to the pound of house music through plasterboard walls, battling for space on the kitchen hob like it’s Iwo Jima. A part of growing up. But that is the crucial aspect. No one should be sentenced to live like this once they no longer have their photo on their travel card. If normal-sized homes will in future be offered only to couples with babies, it is hard to not consider it a punishment for the childless. The idea could be a sticking plaster for the housing crisis, but a pint of vodka and Red Bull for the overpopulation crisis.
FEB28	This change in the law on organ donation will save hundreds of lives	Lives will be saved. Hundreds of them, every year. That’s the first and most important thing to say about the organ donation (deemed consent) bill, which is expected to clear parliament today and become English law in 2020. You may already know it as Max and Keira’s Law, after the young boy and girl whose story inspired politicians of all parties to get behind a change that will take us from having to opt in as an organ donor to having to opt out. The government expects that as many as 700 lives a year may be saved – as Max Johnson’s was.

If the China-UK relationship were compared to a symphony, its success would depend on close coordination between the two countries and a firm resistance to interruptions and noises. In this symphony, China and the UK rely on mutual respect and trust to keep us in tune, and keep out the noise of enmity and confrontation.

MAR1	Trump’s a racist conman – and that’s the brand America bought	Shortly before November’s midterm elections I interviewed a Donald Trump supporter, coming out of a debate between three local candidates in a congressional race, asking how she felt about the president’s attitude to women. “I need to see the facts and the actual documentation,” she said. “I can’t just do all this hearsay.” “What about when he says he personally grabs women and kisses them,” I prodded. “That was him saying that.”
MAR1	‘White saviours’ belong in the 1980s. Let’s keep them there	Bare-faced and clad in jeans, clutching a rather uncertain-looking black toddler on her hip, Stacey Dooley stands beaming in the dust of a parched African landscape. At first glance you could mistake it for a gap year snapshot, destined to be pinned up somewhere in a student bedroom. Dooley is, of course, one of the breakout stars of this year’s Strictly Come Dancing, and the picture was taken in Uganda, where she is making a film for the upcoming Comic Relief. Yet as with so many gap year experiences, it isn’t entirely easy to tell who is having the more emotionally rewarding time here: the volunteer who feels privileged to have seen what they’ve seen, or the children they’re actually supposed to be helping. Which is perhaps why the Labour MP David Lammy touched such a nerve when he responded to the image by tweeting that “the world doesn’t need any more white saviours”, or western do-gooders flying in, believing they are solving the developing world’s problems while blissfully ignorant of the colonial baggage they carry.
MAR1	Parents: don't panic about Momo – worry about YouTube Kids instead	I first heard about Momo in my local parents’ WhatsApp group. Someone had screenshotted a Facebook post about a creepy puppet that supposedly appeared in unsuspecting children’s phone messages and spliced into YouTube videos, dispensing advice on self-harm and violent acts. I reacted with suspicion: this would hardly be the first time that something on Facebook turned out not to be true, and the Momo challenge seemed a bit too on the nose – too obviously sinister – to be real. It turned out that Momo was indeed a hoax, a viral shock-story driven by a frightening image and well-intentioned worry about children’s safety online.
MAR1	Trump was out of his depth in Hanoi. This failure is his greatest flop yet	Donald Trump’s self-reverential style of personalised, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants diplomacy just crashed and burned in Hanoi. It is fitting, perhaps, that Vietnam – scene of past American humiliations – was the setting for the blunderer-in-chief’s greatest flop. Trump tried to wing it in nuclear talks with North Korea’s more canny leader, Kim Jong-un, and got what he deserved: precisely nothing. The summit, like last year’s effort in Singapore, was a Trump vanity project – and proved a labour in vain. In principle just about everybody, including close neighbours South Korea, China and Russia, would like to see North Korea’s nuclear arsenal brought under international supervision, and preferably eliminated altogether. To make such a mess of things, given this exceptional consensus, is a true measure of Trump’s incomparable incompetence. Yet this is barely a surprise. It is entirely of a piece with his amateurish approach to key foreign policy challenges the world over.
MAR1	Excellence is overrated. Let’s embrace being good enough instead	We live in a society obsessed with being exceptional. Whether it is as workers, parents, students, lovers or cooks, we are expected to be outstanding. We must strive to be the best employee, craft an outstanding body, have an amazing relationship, all while being exceptionally happy. Even the most ordinary institutions also are expected to be nothing less than excellent. Companies want to be “world class”, schools have become “academies of excellence”, and humble local GP surgeries strive to be “outstanding”. Being good enough is seen as simply not good enough. Our quest to be excellent has many positive consequences, but it also can be damaging. Lionising excellence can create huge inequalities. When high performers are showered with rewards, the great mass of us who are average miss out. This can spark resentment in those who feel that they don’t measure up. But the obsession with being exceptional does just harm the great mass of average people. It can also do damage to people at the top as well.
MAR1	The environment was once a safe space for activism in Iran. No longer	In early 2018, nine environmental experts and activists from the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation (PWHF) were arrested in Iran. Disregarding their international reputation for tireless efforts to protect Iran’s endangered Asiatic cheetahs, the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) accused them of being agents of the CIA, Mossad and MI6. The IRGC, which acts as an alternative, hardline centre of power in Iran, claimed that PWHF was using environmental activism as a cover for a mission to disrupt national security. It accused them of collecting “sensitive” environmental information and using camera traps to monitor Iran’s ballistic missile programme. A few weeks later, one of them, Kavous Seyed Emami, died suspiciously in an alleged suicide at Tehran’s notorious Evin prison. His grieving wife, Maryam Mombeini, is still banned from leaving the country to join her two sons in Canada. The rest of the group are still in “temporary detention”. Four of them have been charged with “spreading corruption on the earth”, a crime that can carry the death penalty. The rest face serious security charges for “cooperation with hostile governments” and “acts against national security”. Their 300-page indictment was finally disclosed to them in a trial behind closed doors that began a few weeks ago.
MAR1	The fight for EU citizens’ rights could become another Windrush	As theatre, Brexit loses out to drying paint. It is mostly excruciating. Time and again we are promised a high noon shoot-out with cabinet walkouts and armies of pitchfork-wielding Tory rebels, but then anti-climax: the real drama happens behind the scenes as our flawed heroine surrenders, leaving a damp squib finale in the Commons. It’s like the Richard II scene when the king calls off mortal combat between two nobles: that doesn’t end well. Today’s virtually Brexit–free front pages tell the story: no fighting is boring, boring, boring. Yet what happened this week in Brexit has been momentous, even if we were denied catharsis. Battle honours go to Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin demanding the Commons’ right to vote down a no deal and extend article 50. They have saved the nation from the utter catastrophe revealed in the no-deal documents Anna Soubry prised from the cabinet. Backing for the Cooper/Letwin amendment from an unprecedented 20 ministers threatening resignation forced Queen Theresa to concede: she is ordering her troops to vote for a contradiction to her every Brexit word so far.
MAR1	Nadine Dorries’ TV junk-food binge: now that’s a hard act to swallow	MPs should not go on reality TV. The results are conclusive. George Galloway shouldn’t have gone on Celebrity Big Brother: 13 years later, the image of Galloway pretending to lick milk from a bowl held by Rula Lenska, another contestant, still overshadows in most minds anything else he has ever done. Penny Mordaunt shouldn’t have gone on the diving show Splash: like it or not her political legacy will now include one spectacular belly flop, lovingly captured and replayed in slow motion from four angles during the show. And Nadine Dorries shouldn’t have gone on I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, for which she was suspended from the Tory party, just a few days before she was humiliatingly booted out of the jungle itself.
MAR1	Ivanka Trump occupies a different reality from most working women	Responding to a question about Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s proposed Green New Deal and its call for a federal job guarantee, Ivanka Trump this week offered sage wisdom: “I’ve spent a lot of time traveling around this country over the last four years, ? she said. “People want to work for what they get. So, I think that this idea of a guaranteed minimum is not something most people want. ? The statement sparked outrage, including from Ocasio-Cortez. She tweeted in response: “As a person who actually worked for tips & hourly wages in my life, instead of having to learn about it 2nd-hand, I can tell you that most people want to be paid enough to live. ?
MAR1	The Romans took their graffiti seriously – especially the phalluses	Leave an image of a penis up long enough, and it will become part of our national heritage. The rush to record inscriptions made in a Cumbrian quarry in AD 207 has cast a spotlight on the rich legacy of graffiti in Britain by the Romans. Masons sourcing stone blocks for the nearby fortifications of Hadrian’s Wall carved a date, a phallus and the caricature of an officer. They were not alone in leaving their mark. Hunting for images of phalluses is one of the great pleasures of walking the wall. Look attentively enough, and they can be found repeatedly along its line. Graffiti was always a mark of Roman life. In Rome, the right to draw it was widely regarded as a civic prerogative. In a society rigidly stratified by wealth and rank it provided an essential safety valve. Slogans scrawled across the city served up to everyone who could read such a relentless dishing of dirt that people fretted that its sheer weight might bring walls crashing down. Even the illiterate would defecate on the monuments of those who had offended them. Soldiers, by virtue of the oath of duty they swore when signing up to the army, had abdicated the rights that were the essence of citizenship – but many were the legionaries who sought to ease their boredom by scratching doodles on quarry walls. Tiles stamped with a unit’s name would often bear graffiti. Ferocious though military discipline invariably was, it did not serve to iron out all the habits of civilian life.
MAR2	Chris Grayling is the Berk du Soleil as Farage maps out a road to nowhere	Say what you like about Chris Grayling – and I’m about to – but his face at least has the decency to “get it”. No matter what bullish self-justification is coming out of the transport secretary’s mouth, the face knows the truth. Look at literally any photo of Chris Grayling – honestly, go to Google Images now – and you will see the eyes of a man whose inner monologue is telling him, right at that second, that this one was a follow-through. Now it’s just a question of butching it out till he’s off-camera. As I write this, Chris is on a hat-trick. On the very morning it emerged that Grayling’s probation reforms from his era as justice secretary will cost the taxpayer at least £171m, it also emerged that the government has been forced to pay £33m to Eurotunnel over his no-deal Brexit ferry fiasco. By the time I have finished typing, Chris could have lost a battle of wits with the A358, or de-invented trains. If you want to put how expensive Chris Grayling is into some kind of meaningful perspective, he’s cost more than new Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers’ entire transfer budget.
MAR2	We now know the great prize of Brexit: becoming Trump’s prey	Shall we take a gentle amble down memory lane, a nostalgic trip back to the heady days of the referendum campaign of 2016? So many sweet promises were murmured into our ear, it can be hard to remember them all. No talk then of shelling out £33m to settle a legal case with Eurotunnel or ferry contracts for companies with no ferries, or spending billions to prepare for the cataclysm of a no-deal departure. No, back then it was all cash bonanzas of £350m a week and assurances that Brexit would be smooth and seamless – the Europeans needed us more than we needed them, after all – so that, by the time 23 June 2016 came around, voting leave seemed like a painless, risk-free option. Not only was there nothing to lose, there was so much to gain. And top of the list was a big, shiny trade deal with the United States of America. “Within two years,” vowed the soon-to-be Brexit secretary, David Davis, a few short weeks after the vote, “we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU.” A deal with the US, along with China, would “give us a trade area almost twice the size of the EU”, he gushed, apparently unaware that, under European law, it was illegal for a Britain that had not formally exited the EU to so much as enter talks with those nations, let alone sign an agreement with them.
MAR2	Society is breaking down. Every day a new horror arises and I’m terrified	How many things is it possible to be scared of at the same time? I am asking for a friend. Actually for all my friends. Indeed, everyone I ever met. Every day a new horror arises. Sunbathing in February? Well, that’s not normal is it? Police tape up again. Another stabbing. Another young woman missing. Then various Apocalypse Now-style scenarios played out on Twitter by the minute. Donald Trump excusing more murder and torture. People I admire dying way too young. Bodies in sleeping bags on the street. Camps in China. Kashmir. People shooting at the face of Shamima Begum for fun, and on and on it goes. I used to watch a lot of horror films. Then I stopped and I don’t really know why; or perhaps I do. I used to think in a mindless way that some sort of technology would come along and solve everything, and now I feel I don’t know anything, despite the endless flow of information that technology enables.
MAR2	Long before Shamima Begum, Muslim women were targets	What progress, if any, have we made in the last decade when it comes to our understanding of Muslim women? I found myself asking this question when the BBC’s Bodyguard won best new drama last month at the National Television awards, having amassed 11 million viewers including 48% of the audience share for its finale. Spoiler alert: the Muslim woman at the heart of the story starts out as the groomed victim of a brutal jihadi husband, but by the end of the season her character is unmasked as the violent terrorist.
MAR2	Right to Rent’s demise should spell the end for the hostile environment	Seven years after the then home secretary Theresa May announced her intention to create “a really hostile environment” for undocumented residents in the UK, the high court has declared one of her flagship schemes to be unlawful. The Right to Rent scheme, which threatens landlords with unlimited fines and up to five years in jail if their tenants can’t produce all the right immigration paperwork, has been found to encourage racial discrimination against anybody with a foreign-sounding name or a foreign passport. The court has found that the government ignored evidence of these risks and, in turn, that it failed to provide any evidence the scheme delivers anything but misery and state-sanctioned hostility – targeted predominantly at minorities, people of colour, and people who just happen to have been born somewhere else.
MAR2	Justin Trudeau’s disgrace is like watching a unicorn get run over	For Canadian liberals, or indeed any of us who cling to outdated ideas such as good governance and liberal democratic values, it was like watching a unicorn get flattened by a lorry. Earlier this week, Canada’s undeniably gorgeous, halo-bound Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau – proud feminist, defender of minority rights, advocate for transparency, inclusivity and decency, and prince of the one-armed push-up – was morally eviscerated over four-hours of astonishing testimony by his own former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould – a woman of great integrity and a rare Indigenous Canadian cabinet minister. To recap, Wilson-Raybould was demoted to the position of veterans affairs minister in a cabinet shuffle earlier this year. Shortly thereafter, reports emerged that she and her staff had been subjected to a “sustained” campaign by the prime minister’s office over the handling of corruption charges against SNC-Lavalin, a Montreal-based engineering giant accused of bribing Libyan officials. It happens to be a large employer in Quebec, Trudeau’s home state – the prime minister’s office made sure to remind her of that, the job losses such charges might cause and the fact that it was an election year. There was a string of increasingly irate calls, texts and emails. Still, Wilson-Raybould held her ground. The prime minister lost the battle. Then she was demoted.
MAR2	There is no magic ‘stop Brexit’ button for Labour. There never has been	The problem with recommending good options for Labour on Brexit, with regards to their electoral prospects, is that none exist. Here is a party whose members and existing voters supported remain, but which cannot win a general election without leave voters. The only six seats lost by Labour in 2017 heavily opted for Brexit in the referendum, such as the ex-mining community of Mansfield and post-industrial Stoke-on-Trent South. And 41 of the top 54 Tory-held target seats – without which Labour cannot form a majority – voted leave. As long as Brexit dominates and defines political debate, Labour will suffer. Its popular domestic policies are sidelined. Corbynism is an insurgent project, with a clear sense of “the people versus the elite” at its heart; but in order to keep its electoral coalition together, it has been forced to triangulate on the most important political issue of our time, sapping it of the radical energy it thrives on. Brexit has unleashed a culture war, too, which divides and polarises Labour’s electoral coalition.
MAR2	Art rarely touches on disabled siblings – that’s why a new play made me cry	I don’t often cry when I go to the theatre. I certainly don’t often have to dig my fingernails into my palm in order to keep my feelings under control, but that is what happened during a performance of Christina Murdock’s one woman play Dangerous Giant Animals – next on at The Vaults in London between 6 and 10 March. Described as “a darkly comedic show about finding your voice amid your sister’s screams”, it tells the story of Christina’s San Francisco childhood with her younger sister, who has atypical Rett syndrome, speech apraxia and severe epilepsy. “She loves the spotlight, and movies like Jurassic Park and Jaws, hence the title of the show,” Murdock tells me. The play resonated with me because, as many Guardian readers will know from my writing, my own brother has severe autism. I encountered Murdock’s work for the first time last year at a meeting for the charity Sibs (for brothers and sisters of disabled siblings and adults), where I was making a speech. The day was an intensely moving experience, because it was the first time that I had ever sat in a room with people whose experiences were very much like mine, who understood profoundly the emotions that I was describing as the sibling of a vulnerable person; lurching between protectiveness and fury, sadness and hilarity, heartbreak and love.
MAR2	I backed Sadiq Khan – but now his racist minicab policy has betrayed me	They say you can get used to anything in time, but I am not sure that is true. Some things in life, such as the loss of a loved one, we must find the courage to accept. Others, like discrimination and exploitation, we must find the courage to fight. Two weeks ago, I lost my dear son, Hadi, to leukaemia at 12 and somehow my family and I must find a way to grieve and carry on, though I doubt we will ever get over it. I have worked as a minicab driver for Uber since Hadi first became ill. The job provided much-needed flexibility while my wife and I juggled lengthy stays at Great Ormond Street hospital and tried to keep things as normal as possible for Hadi’s two sisters at home. I borrowed money to buy a vehicle, applied for a Transport for London (TfL) minicab licence and went to work, trusting that I would be paid fairly. Shortly after, Uber dropped fare prices to grab market share and TfL flooded the streets, doubling the number of minicab licences in a few short years. Now, there are just too many drivers chasing too little work, leading to too much congestion and too little pay. The upshot is that drivers like me work as much as 70 hours each week to earn just £5 per hour.
MAR2	Democracy has failed in Nigeria when voters no longer care who wins	You know a democracy is in trouble when two out of three voters don’t bother to turn up for a presidential election. In Nigeria’s just-concluded presidential poll, incumbent Muhammadu Buhari was re-elected with the backing of 15.2 million voters compared to the 11.3 million votes his main rival Atiku Abubakar, was able to amass. Although this gave Buhari 56% of the total votes cast, in a country with a population of close to 200 million, including more than 84 million registered voters, 15.2 million votes hardly qualifies as a huge mandate. The 35% voter turnout was down from 44% in the 2015 presidential election and way down from the 54% turnout in 2011. In fact, turnout for Nigerian presidential elections has been dropping at an alarmingly consistent rate since 2003. So why are increasingly fewer Nigerians feeling the need to vote in elections that decide the most powerful political office?
MAR3	The Satanic Verses is still creating monsters, even new book-burners	Sometimes, you just have to shake your head to clear it and look again. Did he really write that? So it was when I read a review in the Independent by Sean O’Grady of The Satanic Verses: 30 Years On, a BBC documentary on the Rushdie affair and its legacy. But, yes, in the last paragraph, he really wrote: “Rushdie’s silly, childish book should be banned under today’s anti-hate legislation. It’s no better than racist graffiti on a bus stop. I wouldn’t have it in my house, out of respect to Muslim people and contempt for Rushdie, and because it sounds quite boring. I’d be quite inclined to burn it, in fact.”
MAR3	Thought for the day: is it time to silence BBC preachers who keep women down?	And welcome to the amoral maze, where our dilemma of the week is: just how insufferable does a spiritual leader have to be before he or she becomes unqualified to preach at the general public? Or to put it another way, why should the church have a monopoly on excommunication? The question is not, emphatically, restricted to the case of the ubiquitous prelate, blogger and speaker, Giles Fraser, although with his recent blog – chastising women who fail to stay near home for the future convenience of incontinent fathers – he has done more than most to focus attention on the sort of qualities that should, ideally, distinguish a Thought for the Day contributor from, say, Jacob Rees-Mogg.
MAR3	André Previn, the classical maestro who knew the value of pop culture	In 1977, André Previn was so famous that he had his own chatshow on BBC1. In one episode, wearing an expensive-looking brown suede safari jacket with big collar, and clutching his oversize glasses in his hands, he introduces the studio audience to Jonathan Miller. They discuss Miller’s new production of The Merchant of Venice, the director going on to predict the “slow disintegration” of English theatre. It’s a real spirit-of-the-age moment. There is no apology for the elevated tone of their conversation; the format is simple – two cultural polymaths ruminating on the arts on primetime television.
MAR3	Ariana Grande is the right person to lead Manchester’s Pride party	Ariana Grande headlining this year’s Manchester Pride seems, on the surface, as if it should be a perfect fit. After the horrendous tragedy of the Arena bombing in 2017, the singer has a unique and close connection to the city. She is one of the biggest pop stars in the world, if not the biggest; there are so many numbers on her Spotify or YouTube that they look like the answer to a final-grade University Challenge maths question. She has a back catalogue bursting with irresistible pop hits. Yet this is 2019 and the idea of any kind of announcement occurring without any kind of backlash immediately following it is as old fashioned as me wondering why Grande can’t use capital letters on her album tracklistings. In this case, the controversy came in two parts. Manchester Pride almost doubled the cost of tickets this year (organisers claim that it’s a new event and can’t be compared with last year’s pricing). When this was first revealed, at the end of January, many objected to one more indication that another Pride was being further commodified and made more exclusive. Pride was a protest, so the history teaches us. It wasn’t about booze brands issuing limited edition rainbow bottles and VIP wristbands – it was about fighting for one’s right to exist. You can see why charging people £60 to celebrate that history might stick in the teeth.
MAR3	Remember the days when we weren’t freaked out by freak weather?	There was a time on these temperate islands when freak weather thrilled us with its bouts of exceptional heat, wind, rain or snow. Unless you were at sea in a gale, fear was a rare emotion. Even in 1987, when the so-called Great Storm hurtled through southern England and northern France on a night in mid-October, it was possible to be more awed than afraid. Crashing branches and tumbling slates woke people, but when they turned to each other in bed it was to exclaim about the wind’s strength – “Would you just listen to that!” – rather than to see it as a portent of something larger or more terrible. Thirty-odd years later, most of the people who lived through the Great Storm remember it mainly because a BBC weatherman got the forecast wrong. In England, the wind gusted at 120mph that night, and at least 22 people were killed on both sides of the Channel. But unless you were among the bereaved, or had a tall oak fall through the roof, nobody felt anxiety or despair. There was no prevailing gloom.
MAR3	The Tories’ response to raging Islamophobia? Turn a blind eye	On Thursday’s BBC Politics Live show, the Conservative MP Henry Smith dismissed claims of Islamophobia in the Conservative party, citing the fact he personally had not seen any anti-Muslim discrimination. Yet we have a fair idea as to just how Islamophobia has taken hold among the party’s support base and how its leadership is responding to such attitudes.
MAR3	Chris Grayling is the Berk du Soleil as Farage maps out a road to nowhere	Say what you like about Chris Grayling – and I’m about to – but his face at least has the decency to “get it”.

MAR4	The Trump/Cohen revelations are awful. So why am I yawning?	There is an old Arabic joke about corruption. A thieving government minister is fired by the head of state and replaced, but the people who have long suffered under the minister don’t rejoice. When they’re asked why they’re not celebrating, one explains to the confused president: “Yes he was a thief, but he stole until he’d taken his fill. The new guy will be hungry.” Growing up under authoritarian regimes in the Arab world was great for the jokes. It was always dark humour, but that made it easier to accept the inevitabilities of living under a dictatorship than trying to fight them. There were so many violations of rights on a daily basis that survival required adaptation. It was exhausting, and futile, to be permanently scandalised. And so we spared our energy and joked instead.
MAR4	Could Gina Miller’s next move compel the EU to delay Brexit?	In a crisis, imagination is as important as commitment – and Gina Miller has both. As 29 March hoves ominously into view, the investment manager, who successfully challenged the government’s authority to invoke article 50 without parliamentary approval, is making another significant intervention in the Brexit process – more subtle this time, but no less worthy of political and legal attention. Having used the courts in 2017 to give parliament a say in the triggering of article 50, Miller is now, I gather, seeking to reframe the way in which Westminster and Brussels contemplate the possibility of its extension. Armed with a legal opinion written by Kieron Beal QC and three other senior lawyers, the co-founder of the pro-remain campaign Lead Not Leave  will argue that the EU council of ministers could itself, unilaterally, extend the article 50 deadline.
MAR4	Corporate-branded ‘communities’ prove you can’t buy taste	I find reading about rich people very depressing. Not because I am jealous they have so much money, but because I am frustrated they have so little imagination. Take a look at the recent New York Times piece that says a growing number of wealthy home-buyers are “choosing to live in corporate-branded communities”. Not just any branded communities, mind you, but luxury ones from the likes of Porsche, Armani and Bulgari. These expensive branded buildings have proliferated in the past few years, a trend that seems to be driven by the 1% having more money than they know what to do with. Slapping a fancy brand name on a residential development can add a price premium of 14% to 44%, according to the upmarket estate agency Savills. A report on the sector by another agency, Knight Frank, notes that there is a “direct correlation between wealth creation and demand for branded residences”.
MAR4	Why did the BBC let Andrew Neil combust?	Last week, supposedly unprecedented spring wildfires raged across dry, bushy and exposed areas. On Monday, having dealt with serious incidents at Saddleworth Moor and Hundred Acre Wood, teams of specialised firefighters also attended the small piece of Shredded Wheat that lives on top of Andrew Neil’s head. Dozens of grateful weevils were saved from certain death in the breakfast bisc inferno by the firefighters and rehoused in temporary accommodation in the nearby clumps of Andrew Neil’s ear hair, while his nostrils became emergency treatment centres for scorched pests.
MAR4	Labour’s balance of terror has shifted. Now Corbynites have cause to be fearful	Until recently, Tom Watson was a shrunken figure in every sense. Labour’s deputy leader had become more famous for his weight-shedding diet than for the influence he wielded in his party. He had earned the undying enmity of the Corbynites for attempting to persuade their hero to quit as leader and they schemed to replace him as deputy with someone more pliable. Labour moderates had given up on him for failing to deliver on reassurances that he could fix the party. Whenever he made public criticism of antisemitism or entryism by the far left, a gang of Corbynites in the shadow cabinet would be organised to verbally batter him at the body’s next meeting. At last autumn’s conference in Liverpool, the deputy leader was such a diminished figure that he was denied a speaking slot from the platform and all he could do was pretend to be happy about it.
MAR4	Kashmir is in a perilous state because of India’s pivot to nationalism	On Friday, the four-day-long military flare-up between Pakistan and India began winding down, with Islamabad handing back an Indian air force pilot taken captive by the Pakistan army two days earlier. He had been shot down in the first aerial fighter combat between the two South Asian enemies since a full-scale war in 1971. Yet, forgotten in the Indian euphoria is the fact that Kashmir, where the deaths of 40 security men in a suicide bomb attack last month triggered this latest crisis, continues to simmer. Even as the pilot walked free, four policemen died in an encounter with Kashmiri militants.
MAR4	Is the world ready for lab-grown meat?	Do people want to eat lab-grown meat? A new study, for which I was a peer-reviewer, is the first to rigorously assess consumer interest in plant-based and “clean meat” (also known as lab-grown or cultured meat) in the US, India and China. The study found “high levels of acceptance” in all three countries and “significantly higher acceptance” in India and China, where 86% and 93% respectively reported being at least “somewhat likely” to purchase clean meat. Chris Bryant, the lead author on the study in the journal Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, told me, “Across the world’s three most populous countries, consumers want plant-based and clean meat. The opportunities for innovators to change the meat industry in these countries are there.”
MAR4	Europe can only give us more time if we have a clear Brexit plan	President Macron is right. Any extension of the article 50 process should be for a reason. It should be to eliminate the blind Brexit Theresa May proposes. But first her deal must be defeated. The Brexiters will fall into line with her deal because they believe they can win the subsequent battle and impose a hard Brexit. The soft Brexit supporters and those who want a fresh referendum should unite to insist Britain knows the direction of its future relationship with Europe before we leave. We have learned a lot during this Brexit debacle. It has been a masterclass in political risk. We are now in a state of confusion, in which even those whose day job is to study the details find it hard to explain.
MAR4	At last we are turning away from our mania for hiving off public services	The Tredegar Workmen’s Medical Aid Society was a mini self-help medical co-operative established in the late 19th century on the principle that anyone in Tredegar should get free health as they needed. It is always credited as giving Nye Bevan, who worked there and sat on its board, the inspiration for the NHS. But it also inspired the author AJ Cronin, who also worked there, to write his 1937 bestseller The Citadel. It was this book, more than any other, that persuaded the English middle class that far from socialist, a national health system based on the same co-operative principles of mutuality was what everyone needed. Health was a lottery and those unfortunate to suffer illness should receive free help from, in effect, a vastly upscaled version of what worked in Tredegar.
MAR4	As immigration from outside Europe rises, hucksters foment racial hatred	If you want to understand the future, look at an experiment conducted at Manchester University on whether wealth should be redistributed from rich to poor. A majority thought it should and showed robust support for the proposition that money should be spent on educational opportunities for working-class children. This is real politics, is it not? Tax and spend and redistribution powered the debates of the 20th century. The culture wars that fill the airwaves today seem an ephemeral American import in comparison. America was the aberration of 20th-century western politics. Unlike European societies, it never found the social solidarity to develop a mass social democratic party. As a nation of immigrants, poisoned by the original sin of slavery, the US was concerned with race politics, while we were concerned with class.
MAR5	Dear Europe, Brexit is a lesson for all of us: it’s time for renewal	Citizens of Europe, if I am taking the liberty of addressing you directly, it is not only in the name of the history and values that unite us, but because time is of the essence. A few weeks from now the European elections will be decisive for the future of our continent. Never since the second world war has Europe been so essential. Yet never has Europe been in such danger. Brexit stands as the symbol of that. It symbolises the crisis of a Europe that has failed to respond to its peoples’ need for protection from the major shocks of the modern world. It also symbolises the European trap. The trap lies not in being part of the European Union; the trap is in the lie and the irresponsibility that can destroy it. Who told the British people the truth about their post-Brexit future? Who spoke to them about losing access to the EU market? Who mentioned the risks to peace in Ireland of restoring the border? Retreating into nationalism offers nothing; it is rejection without an alternative. And this is the trap that threatens the whole of Europe: the anger mongers, backed by fake news, promise anything and everything.
MAR5	The anti-EU lies are back to exploit Britain’s weak spot again	“Just got through reading the Lisbon treaty! OMG!!!” and “Why is no one talking about the Lisbon treaty that comes into force in 2020???” Suddenly it’s viral. If you see this everywhere online you may puzzle how the treaty’s 3,000 dense pages have become such hot reading across Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. Look, for example, at what one (now deleted) tweet claims of what staying in the EU means: “Just been reading some of the Lisbon treaty, very worrying. By 2020 we lose our veto, control over fishing, agriculture and more. Also by 2022 all countries must adopt the euro. How can Theresa May and our MPs want to keep us in such an appalling club?” This new wave of fakery about the Lisbon treaty is a useful warning about what the remain cause faces
MAR5	Liz ‘the Truss’: truly a politician for our times	The rumour is that Liz Truss likes to call herself “the Truss” while speaking to colleagues, a horrifying echo of when Sajid Javid started calling himself “the Saj”. Since there is no surer way to discredit a politician, indeed, human being, than to alert the public to their self-aggrandisement, it sounds almost too bad to be true. It might have been invented by a hostile colleague, trying to stain the Treasury secretary and also associate her with surgical dressings and muscle strain. But is that reading too much into it? Could she simply be that bad? Javid, incidentally, denies the third-personning which, considering all the other rhetorical behaviour he’ll exhibit right out in the open, illustrates just how damaging a slur it is. Only one thing is certain: the constant stream of malevolent tittle-tattle, designed to discredit everyone, named and unnamed, is the only element of government business still functioning.
MAR5	Enough is enough: Michael Jackson's music is dead to me now	Nothing should interfere with my personal listening pleasure. Nothing at all. Great art is often made by terrible people. These truths I have held to be self-evident. Certainly, as a woman, you have to get over yourself a lot of the time because the canon of literature, of cinema, of art, is the canon of lauded misogyny and in order to function critically, you have to inhabit it. Hannah Gadsby’s wonderful comedy show Nanette includes a takedown of Picasso, but it doesn’t work for me. I like Picasso too much. I can’t not look at his paintings. Just as I can’t not wonder at the words of William Burroughs, who killed his wife (accidentally, we are meant to believe).
MAR5	May’s Brexit bung to the north is pathetic. It changes nothing	Theresa May’s bung is like Donald Trump’s wall. You give me my Northern Ireland border deal, she says to Labour, and I will give your people oodles of cash. Except that May has blown it. She has promised Labour MPs in the Midlands and north £1.6bn, but they have not promised her the deal. She is apparently relying on the kindness of their hearts. How stupid is that? She is even offering them a similar deal on workers’ rights, again with no reciprocity. She showered a billion on the DUP, and now look how it treats her. Will she not learn? The northern bung should be judged on two levels. May desperately needs her deal, and anything might be thought worth it that gets us through the current political chaos. But it is also proof of the cancer that hard Brexit has brought to modern government. The handout offers £1bn to deprived regions on a “needs” basis. This appears to be a mild adjustment of the last austerity-based formula of grants to councils. May says it is because “prosperity has been unfairly spread” between north and south. How was it fair when the formula was calculated last autumn, yet not now? As for the additional £600m, it is not unconditional. It will go to lucky towns that can bid for local partnership or city challenge projects.
MAR5	The world is in a bad way. Students need the skills to fix it	At a time when every week’s weird weather seems to bring fresh news of how manmade climate change could destroy everything we know and love, it seems almost trite to point out that the challenges we face as a society are vast and complex. Clearly, the next generation will need to be equipped to tackle them: but assuming that “tackling them” means “preventing them” (as opposed to, say, “riding out the catastrophe with a mixture of improvised weaponry and martial-arts skills”) it is unclear where, if anywhere, they might acquire the relevant skills. In the UK at least, higher education is overly focused on narrow degree courses, where institutional prestige often trumps the value of what students are taught. This reflects an academic research community in which various perverse incentives have created a climate where the arts and humanities have become overspecialised, often to the point of irrelevance, and where the whole integrity of the social and life sciences is threatened by the replication crisis.
MAR5	The unanswered question: why do antisemites think Labour is the party for them?	I had a conversation last week with a Jewish woman from a family of Holocaust survivors, and people murdered by the Nazis. She has been a Labour party member for nearly 40 years. “It feels like being in an abusive relationship,” she said. A year ago she made an official complaint to the party about what she has experienced, but aside from an acknowledgment, she has heard nothing. During debates in her constituency general committee about issues of antisemitism, she has been jeered – by as many as 30 people – for trying to point out the gravity of the issue. At one party event about hate speech, she was prevented from speaking. Some of her supposed comrades have said that claims of antisemitism have been invented to undermine Jeremy Corbyn; she knows of at least one suggestion that such accusations are the work of Israel. She told me that the people responsible seem to fall into two broad groups: a belligerent and relentless hard core including a few people who seem to be “attracted to conspiracy theories”, and an element who seem much less zealous, but are “swept up by a kind of tribalism”. “A lot of my Jewish friends have left Labour,” she told me. “I feel that I have to stay and fight. But I’m on the brink.”
MAR5	Lucía, 11, was raped. Then Argentina’s church conspired to deny her an abortion	Lucía is not called Lucía. Her name is the only fiction in this spine-chilling true story. But we must call her Lucía to protect her identity. Lucía is 11 years old. Four years ago, a court in Argentina placed Lucía in her grandmother’s care after her mother’s boyfriend reportedly abused her two older sisters. However, Lucía was not safe at her grandmother’s home either: she was raped by her grandmother’s boyfriend and became pregnant.
MAR5	Instagram is stripping its devotees of their basic humanity	Walking around my city recently, I’ve been experiencing an odd and dislocated feeling of vertigo, as though the world is veering on a precipice and, without wanting to sound too dramatic, we are approaching what pavement preachers refer to as “the end times”. My husband says it’s just a symptom of getting older, but I’m convinced my environment has something to do with it. Day by day, aspects of the city have started to blend into one another: the same chains popping up to replace local businesses, the flimsy-looking, so-called “affordable housing”, the upscale student accommodation blocks with their own cinemas, all becoming uncannily homogenous. These act as a backdrop to the tents and mattresses of so many desperate, homeless people. Things just feel wrong.
MAR5	Mentally ill people pay higher bills – and banks are partly to blame	Money management is not easy at the best of times. Choosing the right deal, setting up standing orders, checking you’re not over or underpaying, switching providers – the whole thing can be overwhelming. This is doubly true for those with mental health problems – and a new report from Citizens Advice has exposed just how difficult it can be. It found that when poor mental health reduces someone’s ability to carry out daily activities, it can end up costing them £1,110 to £1,550 a year. The reasons for this are manifold. Choosing services can be problematic – difficulty acting under pressure, poor working memory and poor response inhibition can prevent people from getting the right deal. Paying for services can be impacted by difficulties doing paperwork, and dealing with problems can be hindered by avoidance or a reluctance to communicate. This may not be the case for everyone – mental illness can manifest in any variety of ways. But inaccessible services and inadequate support are problems across the board, no matter the exact nature of someone’s illness.
MAR6	We’re divorcing the EU. So why do hard Brexiteers still feel jilted?	There is a jilted quality to the way some Tories talk about Brexit, which is odd, given that Britain is dumping the European Union. The resentment would make more sense if it were the other way round: if 27 member states had expelled Britain from their club. But after decades of treating everything European as a punishment inflicted on a nation against its will, the habit is hard to break. Even the act of leaving is configured by the Eurosceptic imagination as something done by them to us. There is an illustration in the resignation letter sent by George Eustice, an agriculture minister, to Theresa May last week. Eustice was appalled by the prospect of an article 50 extension, which would, he fretted, be “the final humiliation of our country”. He said the European commission had “not behaved honourably” and had “deliberately made progress slow and difficult”. Yes, George, it would all have been quick and easy without those meddling Brussels bureaucrats. It doesn’t require a romantic attachment to the EU to find such Brexiter tantrums tedious. All it takes is an ability to imagine what the process looks like from the other side of the negotiating table.
MAR6	Children are dying on our streets – May’s response is not good enough	Their faces are hauntingly impossible to ignore, staring out from the front pages. Some are in school uniform, little more than children; others all teenage bravado, hovering on the difficult cusp of adulthood. But all 27 teenagers were far too young to die like this, stabbed to death on the streets of Britain in the past 12 months. This is the kind of national moment that demands a swift, reassuring and comprehensive response from politicians. And yet what it gets is Theresa May, stiffly insisting that there is “no direct correlation” between the rising tide of knife crime and police numbers. Nothing has changed, or if it has then it definitely wasn’t her fault. It is a characteristically tone-deaf response to a public mood characterised by alarm and sorrow; why can’t she see that dead children requires something more emotionally literate than this? But the bigger problem is that what she’s saying flies in the face of common sense.
MAR6	Macron’s overblown vision for Europe shows how much it needs Britain	Emmanuel Macron’s open letter to Europe’s citizens, published in all 28 EU member states, is an ambitious attempt to stop the rot inside the EU and create a framework for progressive, democratic renewal. But in taking his best shot at saving Europe, France’s president has badly misfired, or – to use a duelling term adapted from the French – deloped. Europe’s future cohesion and coherence are of primary importance to Britain, in or out. Macron is right to warn that this is a pivotal moment. The corrosive, continent-wide onslaught of rightwing populist, nationalist and xenophobic forces is real and urgent. It found its most recent expression in Estonia at the weekend, where electoral support for the far right surged.
MAR6	Pupils shouldn’t be denied LGBT lessons – whatever their parents say	Parkfield community school in Birmingham has found itself in the headlines once again after protests against its No Outsiders lessons. The protests by the school’s largely Muslim parent body garnered a lot of coverage and raised a fundamental question: how can inclusive education reach every child when many households of faith remain deeply opposed? No Outsiders is a teaching package designed for primary school children. The lessons cover gender, sexual orientation and the idea that discrimination is wrong. Andrew Moffat, the author of the package and assistant headteacher of Parkfield, had been trialling the resource at the school when the controversy erupted.
MAR6	As foreign secretary I argued against an EU referendum. Now I back one	The Brexit debate is coming to a head at a moment when Britain’s political parties seem to be coming apart. Maybe that is not surprising. The 2016 referendum usurped the role of parliament and MPs. And both Labour and Conservative parties are being pulled by the far right and far left. The mess of Brexit is the result. Millions of voters are left feeling not only frustrated but homeless, with unprecedented strain on the stability and legitimacy of the two-party system. The defections from the main parties last month were not just about Brexit. Labour’s antisemitism crisis also reflects dangerous wider trends. It is horrifying to see the Jewish roots of MPs turned into a weapon against their political views; to see sectarianism so deep that reason is lost; to see the anonymity of social media toxify political debate.
MAR6	Bohemian Rhapsody’s release in China is a victory, despite the cuts	“Gay” and “Chinese”. Two words that have more cultural friction than a pair of bearded drag queens going in for a hairy hello kiss. China’s LGBT history has been difficult and fraught. Homosexuality only became legal in 1997 and same-sex scenes are still banned from their television. In fact, it was only last year that the social media giant Weibo decided to stop censoring “gay-themed” content after a huge online campaign, which gave birth to catchy hashtags like #iamgaynotapervert. So it’s no surprise to discover that when the Oscar-winning biopic Bohemian Rhapsody gets its release in China this month, censors will cut as much as two minutes of the homosexual scenes and drug use. It may not seem like a lot, but in a film which spends the latter third recreating Freddie Mercury’s enthralling Live Aid performance – it’s a decent chunk. For some, two minutes of gay intimacy constitutes an entire relationship with extra time for a post-coital cigarette. Censorship here is being used as a way to demonise drugs and gay kisses, both equally bad in the eyes of the state. 
MAR6	Rudd’s disability benefits move is nothing more than political gaslighting	Watching the government spin over anything from Brexit offers to money for deprived towns, there is an analogy that keeps coming to mind: a doctor amputates someone’s leg for no discernible reason, and then, when she notices the wound is bleeding, expects applause for offering a plaster. This image came to mind again today with work and pensions boss Amber Rudd’s announcement of reforms to the disability benefits system, including freeing disabled pensioners from “unnecessary benefit checks”. Under the policy, 270,000 older people will not have personal independence payments (Pip) regularly reviewed, and may be able to fill in a form rather than seeing an assessor in person. In a speech on Tuesday to the disability charity Scope, Rudd is also set to announce a small-scale trial to test the feasibility of bringing together the Pip tests and work capability assessments into one – the disaster-strewn test that determines whether a disabled person is “fit for work”.
MAR6	I will survive: how Failing Grayling made himself unsackable	What does it take to get sacked by Theresa May these days? That’s a question being asked on the other side of the Atlantic after the bumbling transport secretary, Chris Grayling, went global and became the subject of an editorial in the New York Times. Under the headline “How does he survive? The curious case of ‘Failing Grayling’ ?, the paper describes him as “a byword for haplessness in a golden age of political blundering in Britain ?. While the NYT has developed a reputation of late for gloomy coverage of UK politics, Grayling’s political survival is also the subject of increasing astonishment in the UK. The Labour party claims that, as a government minister, Grayling has cost the taxpayer a total of £2.7bn by way of political gaffes. Meanwhile, there are plenty of Conservative MPs who have grown impatient with their colleague over continuing train problems that have got their constituents seeing red. Most recently, Grayling made the news for a ferry fiasco, when he awarded a no-deal ferry contract to a company with no ferries and then had to pay out £33m to Eurotunnel over the decision.
MAR6	Virgin Atlantic’s sexism goes deeper than telling women what to wear	Obviously I didn’t think they were all virgins, just because they worked for a company with the V-word in the title. That would be ridiculous, wouldn’t it? But then I never imagined it was compulsory for female cabin crew at Virgin Atlantic to wear makeup and tight skirts when they were serving meals, dealing with sick children or – in the worst possible scenario – guiding terrified passengers through emergency exits on to inflatable slides. On Monday, in a sudden lurch into the 21st century, the company relaxed its strict dress rules, announcing that female cabin crew would no longer be obliged to work wearing full slap. It also decreed that trousers would be available as a standard item in the Virgin Atlantic uniform, instead of female flight attendants having to make a special request. I mean, how modern is that?
MAR6	Dear Europe, Brexit is a lesson for all of us: it’s time for renewal	Citizens of Europe, if I am taking the liberty of addressing you directly, it is not only in the name of the history and values that unite us, but because time is of the essence. A few weeks from now the European elections will be decisive for the future of our continent. Never since the second world war has Europe been so essential. Yet never has Europe been in such danger. Brexit stands as the symbol of that. It symbolises the crisis of a Europe that has failed to respond to its peoples’ need for protection from the major shocks of the modern world. It also symbolises the European trap. The trap lies not in being part of the European Union; the trap is in the lie and the irresponsibility that can destroy it.

And this is the trap that threatens the whole of Europe: the anger mongers, backed by fake news, promise anything and everything.
MAR7	Teenagers are being killed. But more policing is too simple an answer	While researching my book about all the young people and teens who were killed by guns on a random day in the United States, I would call the journalist who wrote the original story of the shooting and ask if they had any leads. With a handful of exceptions they didn’t. The victims were overwhelmingly working-class black and Latino killed in poor black and Latino neighbourhoods. The stories were often little more than rewrites of police reports. “People are desensitised to it,” said one journalist. “They figure that’s where bad things happen.” “Unfortunately, homicides are not uncommon in that area,” said another. “Unless something unexpected happened, it just wouldn’t be the kind of story we’d follow up on,” said a third. After a while, it was difficult to escape the notion that there were places where the shooting of a child did not challenge the general understanding of how a city or a society works, but confirmed it. The death was not news in the conventional sense. How could it be, when it was expected? And then there were places where children were not supposed to get shot – schools, suburbs, malls, cinemas and universities. A fatal shooting of a child in one of those places would contradict how people thought a city or society should work. This was news. How could it not be, when it had shocked so many people?
MAR7	Britain has cut itself adrift from Europe. I fear we may sink	In his novel The Stone Raft, the Portuguese writer José Saramago imagines that the Iberian peninsula breaks away physically from the rest of the European continent at the Pyrenees. The peninsula and its peoples detach from Europe and drift across the oceans, seemingly in search of a new home and contentment, which – spoiler alert – they never quite find. Saramago’s book is a brilliantly playful examination of several aspects of the Portuguese national mentality, not least the complex relationship with Spain. But the essence of his fantastical idea is easily transferable to Britain. As Brexit looms, it is not difficult to see the British as another disparate group of rub-along peoples caught aboard our own stone raft, beginning to drift into the dark ocean of the future.
MAR7	The Tories are tough on Islamophobia? What a joke	Conservatives are doubtless congratulating themselves for acting swiftly and decisively, following the suspension of 14 party members for allegedly making Islamophobic comments online – including calls to “get rid of all mosques” and to “turf all Muslims out of public office”. Tories will similarly point to yesterday’s resignation from the party of a local council candidate in Harlow as evidence that they are getting a grip. Peter Lamb – who in 2015 tweeted: “Islam [is] like alcoholism. The first step to recovery is admit you have a problem” – was suspended over that, and yet as picked once again to contest the local elections in May. Now he is gone. The Conservative top brass will hope that voters will see these moves as proof that the Tories have zero tolerance for racism in their ranks, drawing an implied contrast with Labour and its ongoing travails over antisemitism. And yet, the departure of these low-level activists serves only to draw attention to the Islamophobia exhibited by much more senior Tory figures, anti-Muslim prejudice that has gone entirely unpunished.
MAR7	The fabulous, feral Derry Girls are the new emblems of Northern Ireland	I’m a Derry girl. We never grow out of it. Waiting for the new series was like being pregnant with your second child. What if you didn’t love it as much as the first one? We needn’t have worried. The girls, and their cousin, the wee English fella, are more fabulous and feral than ever. The head nun, Sister Michael, only has to roll her eyes and curl her lip to have us falling about the place. Nearly everyone from the north of Ireland who grew up at any stage of the Troubles was sent out on forced encounters across the religious divide, just like the reconciliation weekend that provides the plot for the first episode of the new season. Bridge-building, as it is known. There was always a frisky interest in the “talent” on the other side. It didn’t always go well for us either, but few can have been as disappointed as Clare, played by Nicola Coughlan. Determined to befriend a “fully blown Protestant” to outdo smarmy Jenny who already knows a “half-Protestant”, she ends up dangling over a cliff squealing that the boy holding the rope is “a fenian-hating madman”.
MAR7	Set the children free – show them the joy of reading for reading’s sake	For many young people today, books are only for school and exams – the notion of reading for simple pleasure is greatly diminishing. This week, a survey of 27,000 children and young people carried out by the National Literacy Trust, ahead of Thursday’s World Book Day, found only 52% of eight to 18-year-olds read for pleasure. And just a quarter of those will read daily, dropping 17% from 2015 figures. It is a fact made worse by findings of Nielsen Book Research’s annual survey on British children’s reading habits, which found that as few as 32% of children under 13 are read to daily by an adult, for no other reason than the pure fun of it – this is down from 41% in 2012, with most parents stopping reading to their child by the age of eight.
MAR7	Stop talking about testosterone – there’s no such thing as a ‘true sex’	Debates are raging again over who should be allowed to compete in women’s sport. Take two recent examples that inflamed the internet. First the Sunday Times reported that the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) intended to classify women with higher natural testosterone as “biological males”– just as 800m runner Caster Semenya was headed to court to challenge IAAF regulations that would exclude her and others from competing owing to higher than typical testosterone levels. Then tennis great Martina Navratilova asserted that trans women “biologically, are still men”, and shouldn’t be allowed to compete in women’s events. The IAAF and Navratilova quickly backed away from these claims, but the damage was done. Many journalists intent on covering a mind-bogglingly complicated subject with authority have asked me the same question recently: “Are women with high T [testosterone] ‘biological males’?” The answer is that there is no simple definition of what a biological male is.
MAR7	Police spied on trade unionists for an illegal blacklist. We demand justice	Ten years ago today, the Guardian broke the story of an illegal blacklist orchestrated by the country’s largest building contractor. The Consulting Association spied on construction workers who had the temerity to stand up for their rights or raise concerns about safety. It directly carried on the work of the notorious Economic League, an organisation that kept a list of alleged leftwing “trouble makers” who were often denied jobs. When it was closed down in 2009, the Association’s database held personal information on more than 3,000 workers, who were repeatedly denied work and endured long periods of unemployment and family hardship as a consequence. On this anniversary, a new released police report proves that it was not just the building firms spying on us. The UK’s secret political police were also supplying information to the blacklist. Operation Reuben was the internal police investigation into blacklisting launched after disclosures in the media and parliament. The report by ex-chief constable Mick Creedon on Operation Reuben’s findings unequivocally states: “Police, including Special Branches and the security services supplied information to the blacklist funded by the country’s major construction firms, The Consulting Association.” 
MAR7	In an era of brutal cuts, one ordinary place has the imagination to fight back	The story of local government today can be summed up in one word: cuts. Brutal, life-changing, future-cancelling cuts. As many as 1,000 children’s centres have been closed by English councils since David Cameron took office in 2010. Almost 130 libraries closed across Britain last year alone. That’s people with disabilities trapped in their homes, grandparents denied adequate care and lifeline bus services scrapped. This is news that rarely makes the news. It is announced through notices tied around lamp-posts, rather than in the national newspapers. When Cameron and George Osborne designed their historic spending cuts to fall most heavily on local government, this was the outcome they wanted: private tragedies delivered through tens of thousands of brown envelopes plopping on to doormats across the land, rather than one glaring public outrage. Yet stack them all together and you can make two big bets about this country’s future.

MAR8	Cars are killing us. Within 10 years, we must phase them out	It’s the last straw. Parked outside the hospital doors is a minibus with its engine running. The driver is playing on his mobile phone. The fumes are blowing into the atrium. I step up to his window and ask him to turn the engine off. He does so, grumpily. Then I notice he’s wearing a health service uniform. I walk through the atrium, down a corridor and into the cancer department (not for cancer this time, but to talk about reconstructive surgery). I look around the huge waiting room and wonder how many of the people sitting here might be ill as a result of air pollution. I think of people in other departments: children with asthma attacks, patients being treated for road injuries, or suffering from a lifetime of inactivity, as wheels replaced their feet. And I’m struck by the amazing variety of ways in which cars have ruined our lives. Let’s abandon this disastrous experiment, recognise that this 19th-century technology is now doing more harm than good, and plan our way out of it. Let’s set a target to cut the use of cars by 90% over the next decade.
MAR8	Believe the victims of child sexual abuse? If only we did	Here are some things I don’t really want to think about but have had to over the years: Jimmy Savile’s penchant for tracksuits, as the bottoms can be pulled up and down so easily; vulnerable 13-year-old girls in Rochdale ignored by local police; seven-year-old boys sleeping in the bed of a pop star and being introduced to masturbation; or the day long ago when I was teaching film studies and a film I showed (Terence Davies’ Distant Voices, Still Lives) produced extreme distress for one of my mature students. Something in that film, a shot of a sofa I think, had caused a rush of terrible memories. In those days there were groups for survivors of sexual abuse and I was able to find some kind of help for them. Never for one moment did I disbelieve the distress I saw in front of me. Nor did I find it strange that sometimes people did not clearly remember what happened to them as children and that they could not talk about it till many years later.
MAR8	Macron reached out to all Europeans, and what does he get? Scorn	Emmanuel Macron’s letter to the “citizens of Europe”, calling for a European “renaissance”, was conveniently mocked or scorned by some, who picked at its lofty language (“we need to politically and culturally reinvent the shape of our civilisation”) or its seemingly unrealistic to-do list. Yet the crux of his message was found not in the roadmap he attempted to lay out, but in the audience he tried to address: the 510 million citizens of the EU’s member states. This was the first time a European head of state or government had reached out not to fellow nationals or other governments, nor to EU institutions, but to the entirety of the bloc’s citizens. The only other leader who has ever attempted such a thing was Barack Obama, in his 2016 speech in Hanover, “Address to the people of Europe”. That day Obama gave a pep talk to Europeans, as “the heirs to a struggle for freedom”. 
MAR8	Sick children being denied drugs are a grim foretaste of a post-Brexit NHS	Today, in front of the health select committee in the Commons one of the bravest and best elements of the NHS has been giving evidence against Vertex, a pantomime-villain US drug company. Caught in between are unfortunate patients also giving evidence today about their need for Vertex’s cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi, which Nice is so far refusing to approve. This is an everyday painful dilemma in the life of Nice – the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – one of the Blair government’s best creations. With transparent criteria, panels of expert and lay assessors examine the evidence to decide which new drugs offer enough new benefit at an acceptable price. The Nice rule of thumb (there are exceptions) is a price of some £30,000 for every good year of life gained by a patient – a QALY – a quality-adjusted life-year.
MAR8	Until they feel safe, young people will risk their lives by carrying knives	The senseless murders of two 17-year-olds, Jodie Chesney and Yousef Makki, have caused a national outrage. Even though the killings were 200 miles apart, were not linked and do not appear to be gang related, they have forced Sajid Javid, the home secretary, to finally call the growing number of knife attacks a national crisis. He’d had countless opportunities to do so since taking up his post nine months ago – there had been a number of black victims, including 14-year-old Jaden Moodie who was viciously murdered in January – yet he had refused. This had led many people, especially within the black community, to suggest that his declaration of a crisis, and the subsequent meeting with police chiefs, happened only because the latest victims were white and from the suburbs.
MAR8	Another broken promise on Grenfell puts the lives of survivors on hold	In the weeks after the fire at Grenfell Tower that killed 72 people, the prime minister promised a “swift inquiry”, “urgent recommendations” and a process that put the traumatised community at the heart of the process. A promise was made: justice would be done. Last night, bereaved families and survivors heard that the police investigation into the fire would be delayed until the inquiry had presented its final report. This means it could be at least the “latter part of 2021” before detectives assess whether they have enough evidence to pass a file to the Crown Prosecution Service. Then, the CPS will need to decide whether to prosecute. That will also take time. We are looking at 2022 before key decisions are thought about, let alone made. That’s five years after the fire before a prosecution is even considered.
MAR8	Labour‘s antisemitism problem is institutional. It needs investigation	When the Labour party set up the Equality and Human Rights Commission just over a decade ago, it probably never dreamed it could itself be the subject of a statutory investigation. The crisis over antisemitism in the party has again reached an acute point, with the resignations of MPs including heroic Luciana Berger, the suspension of Chris Williamson for saying the party had been “too apologetic ? over antisemitism, and the ongoing revelations about the leadership interfering with disciplinary processes.
MAR8	A 'privacy-focused' Facebook would kill Zuckerberg's business model	Plenty of people look back on their early 20s and regret the things they said and did. Few do it as publicly as Mark Zuckerberg. In a note posted to his social network on Wednesday, the 34-year-old Facebook chief executive of 2019 spent 3,000 words patiently explaining why the 24-year-old Facebook chief executive of 2009 was wrong to build a company predicated on the assumption that we would all want to live every second of our lives in the public sphere.
MAR8	It’s not the ‘white working class’. The real home of bigotry is elsewhere	New research this week has undermined the widely held view that to be prejudiced you must be poor. It turns out that, rather than the working class or the poorest, it is middle-income earners – those in households with combined salaries of £25k-£50k – who are more likely to feel threatened by immigrants: Muslims, Gypsies and Travellers. Tell me something I don’t know. For years, we have had a deeply divisive and incorrect conversation about the working class. We constantly hear the working class is white rather than multi-ethnic; that it is the white working class who disproportionately voted for Brexit, even though that is factually incorrect; and that it is among the white working class that we find the majority of British racism.
MAR8	The Tories’ Islamophobia will not be stopped from within	The news that 14 Conservative members were suspended this week, alongside the reinstatement of Peter Lamb, a Conservative council candidate in Harlow (who then resigned on Tuesday), demonstrates that the party has a significant amount of work to do to counter anti-Muslim hate. Lamb had previously tweeted: “Islam [is] like alcoholism. The first step to recovery is to admit that you have a problem.” Yet he was reintroduced into the party to be a council candidate. Sadly, as the founder and former director of the hate-crime reporting project Tell Mama, I know that views such as these have been picked up and circulated among groups that vehemently dislike Muslims. There has been a steady drip of cases of anti-Muslim bigotry in statements made by party members and councillors. Serving Conservative councillors such as Hashim Bhatti have talked about a deeper problem within the party, and the chair of the Conservative Muslim Forum, Mohammed Amin, said that the party has failed to take action against anti-Muslim bigotry.
MAR9	Worried about Brexit? What, with these geniuses in charge?	In the depths of Building 87 at Microsoft’s Washington state headquarters, there’s a laboratory rated the quietest place on the planet. This anechoic chamber is so silent that someone standing in it can hear not just their heart beating, but the blood flowing in their veins. People can’t handle the experience for more than minutes. Nasa has sent astronauts to a similar lab in Minnesota, to prepare them for the terrifying silence of space. Both of these facilities, however, are currently less silent than Michael Gove. Remember him? By way of a refresher course, Michael was one of the architects of Brexit. Or perhaps that’s the wrong word, given the mess. Describing someone as an architect of Brexit is like describing the Luftwaffe as an architect of London. Let’s say Michael was one of the frontmen of the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union, and is currently secretary of state for the environment. But you may recall him for his decision, in the immediate wake of the referendum, to knife leadership hopeful Boris Johnson. This treachery backfired spectacularly, with Michael’s behaviour widely regarded as too distasteful even for the Conservative party. Mindful that his personal brand was marginally more toxic than the Exxon Valdez, then, Michael has spent the past two and a half years cleaning up the fallout, via apologetic interviews, launching about six “big idea” consultations a week, and being photographed going into cabinet carrying a refillable coffee cup. The latter ruse was probably my favourite; I only wish Brutus had waved something similar round the Capitol in late March 44BC. It would have saved a lot of unpleasantness.
MAR9	An insane place where politics is done one day at a time – that’s Brexit Britain	So here we are. The government seems to be headed towards a free vote on whether the country should leave Europe with no deal. This is, in case you are wondering, an insane situation. No deal would plunge the country into a state of emergency, cause medicine and food shortages, and the government is refusing to take a position on whether or not that should happen. Here’s the timetable. On the 12 March, MPs will vote whether or not to back Theresa May’s deal. If it is voted down, on the 13 March there will be a vote on whether or not to leave the EU with no deal – a vote which, it is reported, the Tories will not whip, which means Conservative MPs do not need to vote along the party’s line. If the outcome is not to leave the EU, on the 14 March, MPs will decide whether to extend article 50, a vote which will either end in no deal, 29 March’s default outcome, or in a lengthening of the current state of affairs, which could still end in no deal. Let’s be clear: no deal is a situation the head of the Confederation of British Industry called a “threat to global stability” on Friday, and which medics have warned will cause thousands of British people to die.
MAR9	Michael Jackson’s trick was to groom an entire culture	It was hard this week – watching R Kelly jump up and down on CBS while claiming his greatest problem was being “big-hearted”, and sitting through four hours of Michael Jackson revelations – to hang on to the idea that the truth has implacable meaning. In both cases, the sense of outrage from the accused parties (in Jackson’s case, his estate) was palpable and brought to mind another example of male-pattern entitlement: that of Brett Kavanaugh during his supreme court confirmation hearing. “They are trying to bring us down,” Jackson was reported as saying to one of his victims, while asking him to lie in court. The double-think was part of the abuse. The narrative was only ever these men’s to control, and one suspects that control was in large part what they got off on. Guilt or innocence seemed secondary to the fury generated by the presumption of those who dared to doubt them.
MAR9	R Kelly and the art of the male meltdown	I’m sure you’ve seen the photo by now: Gayle King sitting serenely and staring calmly ahead, while R Kelly looms over her, gesticulating violently. The shot, taken during King’s interview with Kelly this week, quickly went viral. It wasn’t just the striking juxtaposition of King’s professional calm and Kelly’s frenzied rage that made the photo an instant classic. It was the fact the juxtaposition was so familiar. As many people noted, the image was a flashback to Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing before the Senate judiciary committee last year. Dr Christine Blasey Ford was composed and measured while she gave her testimony. She didn’t raise her voice; she didn’t let her emotions get the better of her. Kavanaugh, in contrast, ranted and raged. He didn’t care about being emotional because he knew he would never get called ‘hysterical’ or ‘irrational’ or ‘shrill’ or ‘crazy.’ He knew that we treat angry men very differently than we do angry women.
MAR9	The terrifying case of a six-week embryo suing an abortion clinic	In Alabama, a man is suing for what he believes is his right: to allow any man to force a female partner to give birth against her will. In a bizarre twist, a judge has allowed a no-longer-in-existence embryo to sue as well. It’s a case that highlights the fundamental divide between the pro-choice movement and the anti-abortion (and, often, anti-contraception) one: is the debate just about “life”? Or is it about allowing men and the government to control women – our lives, our futures, and the very skin, organs and bones we live in? This case brings the stakes into sharp clarity.
MAR9	Neither oppressed nor trailblazing, Muslim women need to be heard	The politics of the Muslim woman remains wrapped up in “debate”. The oppressed-terrorist-bride complex is rampant within our societal infrastructures – and it’s still deeply ingrained in the consciousness of the supposedly reasonable “man on the Clapham omnibus”. Are we now, though, seeing any visible difference in the representation of Muslim women within mainstream media and politics? I’m inclined to think not. Her identity is still up for discussion by others: if she is perceived to be oppressed, then the secular, white British media must highlight the oppressive nature of her religion and save her from it; if she is on the terrorist-bride-Shamima-Begum side of the scale, she must be reminded that she is not an actual citizen of this country and resides here at the mercy of public and political opinion.
MAR9	To fix its problems now, Labour must face the racism in its past	It would come to be known as one of the UK’s most racist pieces of legislation. But when the then Labour home secretary, James Callaghan, rushed the 1968 Commonwealth Immigrants Act through parliament in the space of three days, he was adamant it had nothing to do with race. A series of cabinet papers released years later proved what everyone already knew at the time: Callaghan wasn’t telling the truth. Asian people were facing expulsion from Kenya, and under the existing laws they would have been able to come safely and securely to the UK. But the 1968 act rewrote the UK government’s previous guarantees, stripping them of their right to come here almost overnight. The reason for these frantic changes was race. The intentional aim was to stop “coloured immigrants” from entering this country.
MAR9	Anti-English sentiment in Ireland had healed. But Brexit has brought it all flooding back	Brexit has created many nightmares, but a particularly unpleasant one is the rise of anti-English sentiment in Ireland. British-Irish relations have not just cooled on a diplomatic and political level, but among the Irish population. The anti-Englishness born of past oppression had, we thought, been confined to the past but has resurfaced. And whose fault is that? The emotional trauma of Ireland’s treatment by Britain, and England in particular, is usually delicately contained but now it is spilling over. I grew up in Dublin, far removed from the conflict north of the border but I went to an Irish-speaking secondary school, where boys wore balaclavas to school Gaelic football matches for a laugh, and “IRA” was carved into desks with maths compasses. As the painful peace process concluded, and the Good Friday agreement came into force, God Save the Queen was sung in Croke Park, the hallowed ground of Gaelic sports, and the Queen spoke in Irish at a state dinner in Dublin Castle. It seemed as if anti-British sentiment was at least covered over with a healing gauze if not completely healed. But Brexit, and the behaviour and rhetoric of British politicians, the tone of the trightwing British press, and the constant stream of ignorance about our island from across the Irish Sea, has ripped that bandage off. Everything is exposed now, and it’s a wound that has been, and can be again, mortal.
MAR9	Feminism without socialism will never cure our unequal society	The chair of the Institute of Directors, Charlotte Valeur, has used International Women’s Day to criticise FTSE 350 companies for not making enough effort to recruit and promote women and minority-ethnic directors. Scrolling through the list of FTSE 350 companies, one will find brands such as HSBC, which was fined £1.4bn for helping drug cartels launder money in Mexico; Sports Direct, where workers have been exploited to the extent that one woman gave birth in the toilets; and G4S, a company so mired in scandal that it has an entire Wikipedia page dedicated solely to the amount of controversies it has amassed. If a company behaves terribly but its director is a woman, is that still feminism? The reality of women’s work across the world is not that we’re duking it out to see who can make partner first: it’s exploitation, low pay and precariousness. Sexism is bad everywhere, including in boardrooms, but feminism must exist to improve the lives of the majority of women, or it is worth nothing. Valeur may get her wish for more female directors in the FTSE 350, but it makes little difference to the world unless those women use their new power to fundamentally alter the relations between women and capital.
MAR9	No matter what happens with Brexit, this toxic environment must end	Tuesday should have been the annual MPs v press pancake race for charity. Alas this year, due to the daily hostilities traded on the green outside parliament where it’s held, it was cancelled. The toxic Brexit-induced climate around the Palace of Westminster made it too risky. The speaker John Bercow expressed regret in the House. While most right-minded people abhor the extreme behaviour by some on the fringes, putting MPs and journos back in their boxes is supported by the public. Polling shows increasing faith in the military and royals, but dwindling public trust in politics, MPs and the traditional media. And politics is polarised on a scale unseen before. Brexit has meant that families, political parties, even the cabinet, are split. Three-quarters of Britons surveyed say the UK is divided, rising to 81% among 25- to 34-year-olds. Social media has had democratising effects. Once, if you wanted to contact an MP or sound off to the press, you’d have to go to the trouble of penning a letter, finding a stamp and envelope, then getting off your arse to post it. Today a bit of typing on your mobile and the hazards of being ignored by your recipient or the filter of editorial control are removed. Now everyone – no matter how extreme – has a platform.
MAR10	Only in Tory fantasy land does knife crime have nothing to do with austerity	A conservative is “a liberal who has been mugged by reality”, declared the American neo-conservative Irving Kristol in 1983, as he predicted that experience would batter the idealistic into accepting the value of order and holding the guilty responsible for their crimes. In the 21st century, it is conservatism’s turn to become unreal – and not only because Brexit has destroyed its claim to be the philosophy of the hard-headed. Brexit is a symptom of a wider Tory breakdown in which fantasies replace evidence, and temporary convenience trumps the public interest. Reality is mugging, knifing and killing the British, and all a Conservative prime minister, safe behind her bodyguards, can say is “there is no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers”.
MAR10	Playing politics with a child’s life shames us all, Mr Javid	Theresa May famously peddled a story about an illegal immigrant who had won his case because he had a cat and had used article 8 of the Human Rights Act – the right to a family life – to stay in the country. It wasn’t true but, hey, she didn’t care: she had a point to make about the Human Rights Act and she needed a headline-grabbing story. In the same speech, the then home secretary said: “We must end the Human Rights Act.” As we now know, she, very unfortunately, made it to the office of prime minister.
MAR10	Golf tycoons want to raid Scotland. It is our duty to defend its beauty	If there were an international beauty pageant for countries, Scotland would win it most years. In January it was voted the most beautiful country on the planet by the travel website Rough Guides. This follows similar awards by global travel specialists in three of the previous five years, as well as ancillary awards for “best island” (Lewis and Harris) and quality of living (Orkney, Edinburgh). Other countries have spectacular mountains and gorgeous lakes, but nature seems to have chosen Scotland as the location for her best work.
MAR10	Carolee Schneemann, the artist you definitely didn’t hear about at school	The artist Carolee Schneemann has died at the age of 79. Last summer, she was one of the most intriguing interviewees in Rebel Women: The Great Art Fightback, a wonderful BBC4 documentary about the emergence of feminist performance art in the 60s and 70s. That documentary is exactly my idea of a great night in, and it was the first time I had seen many incredible, revolutionary artists speaking, from Suzanne Lacy to Judy Chicago. Although their work was all strikingly different, the stories they told were pitifully similar. They were derided and rubbished, and it took decades for most of these pioneers to find even a modicum of recognition in the mainstream art world. Talking about her Interior Scroll, from 1975, which saw her pulling a long stream of paper out of her vagina and reading from it, Schneemann said, dryly, that it “probably cost her a lot of nice teaching jobs”.
MAR10	For 2,000 years we’ve linked Jews to money. It’s why antisemitism is so ingrained	I’m reluctant to add to the workload of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which this week announced the first step towards a statutory inquiry into Labour and antisemitism. If it goes ahead, it will be only the second time the commission has seen fit to investigate a British political party for racism – the first related to the BNP – and, given the number of complaints that have been reported, it’ll have its work cut out. Nevertheless, I have a research trip to suggest. First, though, a word of context. An oft-heard defence of Labour is that a party of its now vastly increased size is bound to reflect the wider population; since that population includes some antisemites, then, sadly but inevitably, so will Labour. But that swerves around a gloomier possibility: that anti-Jewish racism might exert a particular appeal to some on the left – even, paradoxically enough, those who might otherwise proudly regard themselves as anti-racists.
MAR10	This is not the week to push a people’s vote. May’s deal has to fail first	Here we go again. Another big weekend of political speculation ahead of another big vote in parliament. Cue the TV talking heads endlessly telling us “this really is crunch time … again”. Amid the noise and the millions of words said and written about Brexit, and the many interviews with ministers constantly telling us “the prime minister has been very clear about this”, in truth very little is clear at all. But this much is as clear as can be: Theresa May lost the first “meaningful vote” on her withdrawal agreement and the accompanying political declaration by an enormous margin of defeat; and the changes she said she would fight for in further negotiations in Brussels have not been forthcoming. This time, for once, she would be right in saying “nothing has changed”.
MAR10	Would you like your Brexit vanilla or Marmite? It’s time to choose	This is it. Next week sees the end of the beginning of Brexit – and the beginning of the end. Theresa May is determined to offer herself for ritual lynching by her mob of free-trade anarchists, having spent two years failing to face them down. Parliament will then liberate itself from her torture, and seek a new way forward. The plan is for May’s defeat on Tuesday to be followed by a vote against no deal, and then by its only sane consequence, a vote to delay article 50. To make that delay acceptable to the EU, there must be a plausible reason for it. That means a plausible alternative Brexit agreed by the British parliament. What is that alternative? The answer began to emerge last Wednesday from talks between the Nick Boles/Oliver Letwin group of Tories and Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn. It is for the UK to leave the EU, but remain a member of the European customs union. It avoids the Northern Ireland border issue, honours May’s commitment to “frictionless” trade, and meets a hundred other reasonable concerns of those involved in Britain’s dealings with Europe. There is no question that there would be a Commons majority for such a proposal, as there is already in the House of Lords. Only the glaring inadequacy of the two party leaders has prevented a multiparty agreement on remaining in the customs union being already reached.
MAR10	Worried about Brexit? What, with these geniuses in charge?	In the depths of Building 87 at Microsoft’s Washington state headquarters, there’s a laboratory rated the quietest place on the planet.

MAR10	The great betrayal: how Britain’s industrial towns died of neglect	Perhaps there have been trade-union banners on anti-Brexit marches, but I have never seen any. Faced with the greatest threat to jobs and prosperity the UK has faced since the Great Depression, organised labour refuses to be excited. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has a position: in order to maintain workers’ rights and preserve tariff-free, frictionless trade with the rest of Europe, it wants the UK to stay in the single market and customs union. But union members themselves are noticeably shy about endorsing that line, even in industries such as car-making that are otherwise heading for extinction. Some go against it completely. Reports suggest that most shop-floor workers at the Nissan plant in Sunderland want to leave the EU regardless of the consequences. A worker at the Jaguar plant at Solihull told the Guardian that he hadn’t bothered to vote, but he would have voted leave. Even at the risk to his job? “Yes, because it’s not about jobs. It’s about immigration.”
MAR10	The EU’s plan to rein in Facebook and Google will do exactly the opposite	The growth of the internet and user-generated content in the past 15 years has been underpinned by speed and ease of use. The foundations for this are commonly referred to as “safe harbour” provisions in copyright law. This means that organisations that allow users to upload content to their websites – Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook et al – are not liable for copyright infringement of their users, but are required to speedily remove content after the fact, if a copyright makes a complaint. Now, through article 13 of its new copyright directive, the EU is curtailing these safe harbour provisions, and thereby challenging the very basis of a free and open internet. Imagine that you upload content to a video-sharing website and then have to wait for days for it to appear after it is vetted. That could be the future of the internet in the EU.
MAR11	Why are our MPs putting blatant self-interest ahead of the Brexit vote?	In the parliamentary drama of the coming week, the term “Namierite” is one you are unlikely to hear often, if at all. But it matches perfectly this moment in the Brexit saga – wretchedly so, in fact. Sir Lewis Namier (1888-1960), one of the great historians of the 18th century, argued, on the basis of detailed forensic analysis, that most political behaviour is not motivated by high idealism, but the complex interaction of faction and connections, the search for personal advantage and the force of self-interest. In his masterpiece, The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III, he wrote: “Men … no more dreamt of a seat in the House in order to benefit humanity than a child dreams of a birthday cake that others may eat it … the seat in the House was not their ultimate goal but a means to ulterior aims.”
MAR11	Sajid Javid makes me question the value of Muslim politicians	Growing up, I rarely saw people who looked like me occupying important political positions. Minorities were far more likely to be represented in sport or entertainment than in real positions of power. But in 2019, there are more high-profile politicians from such backgrounds than ever – Sajid Javid, Chuka Umunna, Priti Patel, Sadiq Khan to name just four. So why, to me, doesn’t this actually feel like progress? When Khan won the London mayoral election as the Labour candidate in 2016, Sajid Javid tweeted: “From one son of a Pakistani bus driver to another, congratulations.” This seemed at the time like a touching message across party lines. Yet today it feels different.
MAR11	This is like Iraq all over again – we must extend article 50	It’s become clear that the prime minister’s strategy has been to run down the clock on parliament – and the EU – to push through her Brexit deal. And not for the first time in our recent history, parliamentarians have been backed into a corner by government ministers – with the immense power and control they have in our political system – and forced to choose between two unpalatable foreign policy options with dire consequences for the country. The framing of the choice is similar to the one MPs were presented with in the run-up to the Iraq war: military action against Saddam Hussein, or the risk of an attack on this country. The prime minister’s version is a similarly artificial choice: her deal, or a chaotic and disorderly exit from the EU that we know will have severe consequences for our communities. MPs are effectively being asked to choose between the frying pan and the fire, in the hope they will choose the former and that can somehow be declared a victory.
MAR11	Europe must abandon these foolish Brussels treaties	An alternative to what Europe could and should be exists to the one Emmanuel Macron described last week. If there is a need for a rebirth, then let it be of the sovereignty of the people, of enlightenment against the obscurantism of money and religion. In Europe, the time has come to speak the only truly international language capable of motivating peoples widely diverse in history, languages and culture. It is the language of common good, of its defence and its extension, of living together, of rebuilding after 30 years of ransacked rights and public services, and free and undistorted competition. It is a language for peace, in the face of frenzied belligerent, anti-Russian, warlike Nato provocations.
MAR11	Brexit is heading towards extra time. The question then is: to what purpose?	Election slogans are rarely amusing when they are served hot from the political kitchen. It is the cooling breeze of time that flavours the braggery of yesterday with a certain black comedy. Recall how David Cameron framed the choice at the 2015 election as one between “strong and stable government ? led by himself, or “a coalition of chaos ? under Ed Miliband. We have no way of knowing how chaotic life might have been under a Miliband government, but it is reasonable to guess that even at his most hapless he would have struggled to match the unblemished record of unleashing havoc achieved by the Tories in the four years since.
MAR11	Bezos v the Enquirer reminds us of the potential for abuse of media power	In exposing what he called an extortionate proposal from the US publication National Enquirer, Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, concentrated minds in newsrooms last month when he wrote in a blogpost: “Be assured, no real journalists ever propose anything like what is happening here.” The Enquirer’s proposal, in emails Bezos disclosed, was that if Bezos would state publicly that there was no basis for suggesting the Enquirer’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces, the Enquirer would stop publishing intensely private communications between Bezos and a woman with whom he was in a relationship.
MAR11	Only in Tory fantasy land does knife crime have nothing to do with austerity	A conservative is “a liberal who has been mugged by reality”, declared the American neo-conservative Irving Kristol in 1983, as he predicted that experience would batter the idealistic into accepting the value of order and holding the guilty responsible for their crimes. In the 21st century, it is conservatism’s turn to become unreal – and not only because Brexit has destroyed its claim to be the philosophy of the hard-headed.

MAR11	Playing politics with the life of Shamima Begum's baby shames us all, Mr Javid	Theresa May famously peddled a story about an illegal immigrant who had won his case because he had a cat and had used article 8 of the Human Rights Act – the right to a family life – to stay in the country. It wasn’t true but, hey, she didn’t care: she had a point to make about the Human Rights Act and she needed a headline-grabbing story. In the same speech, the then home secretary said: “We must end the Human Rights Act.” As we now know, she, very unfortunately, made it to the office of prime minister.
MAR12	Even if Theresa May’s rotten deal scrapes through, Brexit will fester for a generation	Bring on the mayhem, roll on the waves of chaos, let Brexit and its conflicted Brexiters writhe over the impossible contradictions of their revolutionary cause. The worse it gets, the better for the country as the less likely we are to leave. The prime minister’s evening dash to Strasbourg may still deliver deadlock – and a good thing too. If we end the week with no deal, a bar on no-deal exit and a delay with length and purpose unknown, the country inches closer to no Brexit. If her rotten deal does scrape through, this will not be the end: it will fester on, fought over for a generation, unless the people have agreed it with a vote. Hardliners fight tooth and claw against delaying withdrawal as they see Brexit slip away. Three long years since the referendum campaign makes that close result look more obsolete with each passing week: so much has happened, we know so much more. The more furiously Brexiters assert that one vote is the only valid “will of the people”, the more bogus their claim looks.
MAR12	Think the Commonwealth can save Brexit Britain? That’s utter delusion	I’m struck, as the British parliament moves towards the endgame on Brexit, with the number of times Australia, Canada, New Zealand and India have been advanced by the Brexiteers in the public debate as magical alternatives to Britain’s current trade and investment relationship with the European Union. This is the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments that have emerged from the Land of Hope and Glory set now masquerading as the authentic standard-bearers of British patriotism. It’s utter bollocks. If Britain proceeds with giving effect to what future historians will legitimately describe as the longest suicide note in history by leaving the union, the cold, hard reality is that the mathematics simply don’t stack up in terms of credible economic alternatives to Europe. Much as any Australian, Canadian and New Zealand governments of whichever persuasion would do whatever they could to frame new free-trade agreements with the UK, the bottom line is that 65 million of us do not come within a bull’s roar of Britain’s adjacent market of 450 million Europeans.
MAR12	The guff spoken about Jess Phillips shows how uneasy people still are about class	I am not so much angry with the working class as deeply disappointed. We are an embarrassment to our revolutionary leaders, to the middle classes, but mostly to ourselves. We do a lot of stupid stuff. We don’t even identify as a class half the time. And before you tell me I am not working class because I write in a newspaper and I like nice things, can I just say you are right in one way, wrong in others. The guff spoken about class after Jess Phillips gave an interview while wearing expensive clothes for a photoshoot showed just how uneasy and disingenuous about class some of the left remain. She was deemed not working-class enough. I like Phillips. She wants to sort out stuff and will get her hands dirty, but she is not sufficiently loyal to the leader. This is beyond tedious, as well as vastly hypocritical. The top of the Labour party is as close to the working class as I am to Prince Philip. These are public schoolboys who appear never to have heard of equal ops. Nepotism and privilege is rife, so their anxiety about class is understandable.
MAR12	Low-paid work is no longer a route to better pay – it is a trap	One of the few domestic political issues that occasionally manages to make itself heard over the Brexit cacophony is the rollout of universal credit. It is a huge and disruptive shake-up of the welfare system which will end up taking more than a decade from legislation to implementation. And it is no niche concern. One in three working-age households will be entitled to it once in place. Spending will top £70bn a year – roughly equivalent to what we spend on all primary and secondary education. And from April most benefits will have been frozen for the fourth year in a row. We’d normally expect the chancellor to be focusing on this issue at this time of year. But the traditional spring budget has been moved to the autumn, and the spring statement – which Philip Hammond will give on Wednesday – is not intended to be a major fiscal event, so policy and spending announcements are unlikely.
MAR12	Social media polarises and radicalises – and MPs aren’t immune to its effects	Barely a week goes by without government ministers or MPs warning Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube (a subsidiary of Google), Instagram or WhatsApp (both owned by Facebook) that they must do more to prevent radical or dangerous ideas being spread. A “crackdown” is always just around the corner to protect users from harmful content. Oddly, MPs never wonder whether they might be victims of the same effects of these tools that they, too, use all the time. Why not, though? We keep hearing that it’s a big problem for people to be repeatedly exposed to radical ideas and outspoken extremists. It’s just that for MPs, those tend to be within their own parties rather than on obscure YouTube channels.
MAR12	We exclude the Labour left from British politics at our peril	Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership is on borrowed time. That assumption has hung over it throughout his three and a half years in charge. It’s there during every Labour crisis. It’s there before every perilous election – such as the local polls this May. And after every bad or even so-so Labour result the end of Corbyn’s leadership is there in the minds of his many enemies, of many commentators, of many anxious Corbynistas. When the party is doing better under him, such as during and immediately after the 2017 election, this sense that he is on perpetual probation recedes, but never completely and never for long. In June 2017, two days after Labour had won its largest general election vote since Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide, the then Labour MP Chris Leslie told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We shouldn’t pretend that this is a famous victory. It is good … but it’s not going to be good enough.” Twenty months later, without waiting to see if his scepticism about Corbynism’s electoral potential was justified, he left the party to co-found the Independent Group.
MAR12	Why are our MPs putting blatant self-interest ahead of the Brexit vote?	In the parliamentary drama of the coming week, the term “Namierite” is one you are unlikely to hear often, if at all. But it matches perfectly this moment in the Brexit saga – wretchedly so, in fact. Sir Lewis Namier (1888-1960), one of the great historians of the 18th century, argued, on the basis of detailed forensic analysis, that most political behaviour is not motivated by high idealism, but the complex interaction of faction and connections, the search for personal advantage and the force of self-interest. In his masterpiece, The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III, he wrote: “Men … no more dreamt of a seat in the House in order to benefit humanity than a child dreams of a birthday cake that others may eat it … the seat in the House was not their ultimate goal but a means to ulterior aims.”
MAR12	Northern Ireland policing is in crisis. It could threaten peace	Ten years ago the late Martin McGuinness, then deputy first minister at the Northern Ireland assembly, stood beside his unionist counterpart Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist party first minister, and called the dissident republicans who had murdered a police officer “traitors to the island of Ireland”. Two weeks ago a senior Sinn Féin figure on the Northern Ireland Policing Board said that among the Catholic community (nationalist and republican) confidence in the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had hit rock bottom. Now Karen Bradley, the secretary of state, has trampled into the middle of this crisis and made matters a great deal worse. Bradley, who said last week that killings during the Troubles by members of the police and the British army were “not crimes”, has the authority to select the person tasked with investigating police wrongdoing, the police ombudsman, when the current incumbent leaves in the summer. This is absurd and untenable. Bradley offered a belated apology, claiming, bizarrely, that she did not mean what she said, and that it was not her view. However, at a Northern Ireland affairs committee hearing several months ago she supported a call to change the law so that army veterans and former police officers “do not face harassment in the courts”.
MAR12	The European Spring holds the answer to the fragmenting EU’s plight	The European Union is fragmenting at a time when Europeans need it the most. Emmanuel Macron is right to point this out. But he is wrong to push another top-down agenda that lacks credibility, fails to speak to Europeans’ concerns, and entrenches the democratic deficit at the heart of the EU. By entrusting Europe’s renewal to its unaccountable bureaucrats, Macron’s programme will only deepen the discontent that has given rise to the ultra-right he claims to oppose. Over the past 12 months, we have worked with political parties, activists and practitioners to develop a different kind of renewal programme – one that offers immediate solutions to Europe’s overlapping crises, that gives control back to citizens in their communities, and that sets out a long-term vision for our democratic union. It is called a New Deal for Europe and it will be put to voters across the continent in May’s European parliament elections by our European Spring – the transnational coalition of progressive forces brought together by Democracy in Europe Movement (DiEM25).
MAR12	There is a way to address the vile indignities heaped on homeless people	In Britain today, homelessness is effectively a criminal offence. A Guardian investigation shows at least 60 councils (up from 54 last year) have obtained the power to use public spaces protection orders (PSPOs). These orders criminalise people who put up tents, seek charity or engage in other behaviour associated with rough sleeping. They also give the council the power to hand out £100 fines to rough sleepers, which, if left unpaid, can result in conviction and a £1,000 fine. More than 320,000 people are homeless in Britain today. Rough sleeping is up by 169% since the Tories took power. At least 597 people died on our streets in 2017. 
MAR13	Theresa May’s Brexit lost to the ultimate adversary: reality	There might still be ways that Brexit can go badly; unexplored dead ends and byways of failure. But the road to success is now closed. Parliament’s second verdict on Theresa May’s deal is slightly less crushing than the first one in January. But a defeat by 149 votes, just weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU, indicates not only the last evacuation of any authority from the prime minister but a profound crisis in the project that is the only purpose of her government. She had one job, and she cannot do it. Vital questions about the future will now be settled in a state between despondency and panic. There is no strategy, no guiding intelligence. A plan must be salvaged from the wreckage of a bad idea badly executed. There was a moment, early today, when May thought she saw a way through. A path was briefly visible to the promised land of orderly Brexit. The prime minister had brought legal clarifications from Strasbourg to embellish her deal. But then the road was barred by Geoffrey Cox. The attorney general judged that the UK might still find itself in the notorious backstop – an EU customs union – with no unilateral means of dissolving the arrangement. Indefinite backstop is a deal-breaker for hardliners.
MAR13	Punchbag May is humiliated again. But for MPs the real crisis starts now	Well, that seemed interminable. It was gone 7.20pm by the time the tellers appeared. And the prime minister was hammered again. 391-242 would, in normal times, represent a total humiliation. But we don’t live in normal times. Nowadays, the second biggest defeat in the House of Commons since 1924 represents progress. The problem now confronting the prime minister is a relatively simple one. The endless, breathless speculation and rolling coverage of days such as today often feels more like football transfer deadline day than politics-as-usual. But as any football fan knows, deadline day depends on the existence of a fixed deadline that everyone accepts.
MAR13	Britain is trapped in the purposeless austerity that gave us Brexit	Slap bang in the middle of this week falls one parliamentary event likely to be greeted with near-silence. When Philip Hammond stands up tomorrow afternoon to deliver his spring statement on the health of Britain’s finances, he’ll know in his bones that it will provoke no feverish excitement among lobby journalists, nor command the front pages. Given a major economic policy announcement, newsreaders would previously devote their bulletins to his figures and forecasts; this time they will probably give it a mere moment’s notice. And who can blame them? A prime minister potentially faces her last days in office, her cabinet is in all-out mutiny and the country teeters on the brink of its biggest foreign policy decision in almost half a century. Herein lies a glorious chance to treat politics as Netflix, to gossip about court intrigues among Boris and Amber and Jacob, to refer in am-dram tones to Cox’s codpiece and the Malthouse compromise. Presented with all that, which puritan would plump instead for Spreadsheet Phil and his dry-bread sums?
MAR13	My complaints of Tory Islamophobia were ignored, so I had to resign	In January I took the heart-wrenching decision to resign as chair of South Shields Conservative Association. It was a difficult moment. My parents came to Britain from India in the 50s. My father worked as a coalminer for 40 years. I was born here and we were a typical “working-class family”. My father has been a Labour supporter all his life like so many first-generation immigrants, so it was a surprise to both my parents when I joined the Conservative party. But they were so proud when I was elected chairman of my local association. I have always been so grateful for the opportunities made available to me here, and I often reflect on how my life might have turned out had my father not embarked his arduous journey to these shores.
MAR13	I’m not the mother who left her baby at the airport. But I could have been	I have left my baby on walls, in public toilets, up trees, on trains, rolled under beds and, on one very memorable occasion, in an envelope at the bottom of my handbag. I had to fumble under keys, books, a spare jumper and some tissues to pull it out. Not in real life, you understand; but in a thousand sweaty, sleepless, eye-juddering, neck-clasping nightmares. For one woman this week, that nightmare became true. Like John Candy in his polka van seeking to bring solace to Kevin’s mother in Home Alone, I am not here to criticise the woman who left her baby in a Saudi airport as she boarded the plane to Kuala Lumpur. I have no right or any authority to question any other parent’s ability to cope under stress or navigate the unfamiliar. I certainly have no interest in puffing up my own sense of smug accomplishment by revelling in comparison and mother-bashing (here’s looking at you, YouTube commenters). I have left enough bags, coats, phones, tickets and keys on enough benches, buses and other people’s bonnets, while juggling and jiggling a helpless baby, to know that sometimes you simply do not have the capacity to carry all the disparate parts of your life along without occasionally faltering. About two months into motherhood I spent two hours in my own garden sitting on a plastic bag, entertaining the baby with clothes pegs and singing the songs from Aladdin because I had forgotten not just my keys and wallet, but also any snacks, toys, or phone.
MAR13	To my ERG colleagues, I urge you to hold your nose and support May’s deal	Theresa May’s deal has many issues within it, issues that are intended to be short-term. We don’t want to take EU rules over which we have no say; we don’t want to answer to European courts; and certainly not permanently. We asked May to go and make sure these issues should only be temporary, and she has achieved something. It’s not everything, it’s not perfect, but it’s something that shifts the balance of risk. As the attorney general Geoffrey Cox has said, this is a political decision which is informed by the legal advice. He is clear that the risk of our being tied in against our will is significantly reduced, and we’ve been clear about our intentions going forward. The unilateral declaration sets out our understanding of the agreement, and our intention to leave if obligations are not fulfilled. It’s not perfect, it’s a legal argument we would have to make at that time, but it does have legal weight and has been accepted by the EU. In conjunction with the joint statement making a commitment to acting immediately on finding alternative border arrangements and securing a better future relationship, one that does not have to be based on the existing backstop plans, the risks of foul play or entrapment by the EU are significantly reduced.
MAR13	Cox’s verdict on the backstop is the final nail in the coffin for May’s deal	“The legal risk remains that … the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting [the backstop].” And with that verdict from attorney general Geoffrey Cox on the modified withdrawal agreement, the chances of Theresa May’s deal getting through the Commons this evening have receded to almost nothing. The chances were always slim. But if Cox had declared that the concessions May had obtained – in the form of an addendum to the original withdrawal agreement – were transformative in terms of the backstop, the prime minister had hoped to be able to rally enough MPs behind her deal to at least minimise the scale of her defeat to less than 50 votes. This would have left the door open to her to bring back her deal for a third meaningful vote next week.
MAR13	Is ‘Future Britain’ the lifeline disenchanted Labourites need?	What on earth is Tom Watson up to now? People have been asking that question almost as long as Labour’s deputy leader has been in the Labour party, in fairness. All that has changed since the arch-fixer’s days of plotting to oust Tony Blair for Gordon Brown is the nature of who’s asking. But it’s always a question worth taking seriously, which is why this week’s inaugural meeting of Future Britain – a new grouping to uphold Labour’s social democratic and democratic socialist tradition, which Watson promised to create in the traumatic aftermath of nine MPs leaving the party – was packed to the rafters.
MAR13	I've been drafted into 'operation no deal'. And things here feel desperate	The real countdown has truly started. In Whitehall today, the clocks are striking 17 – the number of days left before we are due to leave the European Union. Tempers are running high. So too is the nation’s imagination – in the few weeks since my first article, the Brexit commentariat has created such a torrent of snarky metaphor – including many references to how terrified yet also strangely bored of Brexit we all are – that it feels like we’re being hit by a tsunami of tepid tapioca. Yet we can’t seem to get enough. Politico and other websites have even started collecting the best Brexaphors. There’s Mad Max, Hotel California, cake, the Titanic, a chocolate orange, a Mexican standoff, a blue furry monster (actually, the Dutch came up with that one, but it’s too cute to leave out). And it’s not too late to get your Brexit advent calendar.
MAR13	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is right – it's time for radical change, not more ‘meh’ politics	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is an equal-opportunity irritant. The newly elected congresswoman doesn’t just drive Republicans to distraction, she routinely riles establishment Democrats with her refusal to meekly toe the party line. Ocasio-Cortez, to the chagrin of many of her colleagues, has no interest in diluting her views and occupying a “safe” middle ground. If that wasn’t obvious enough already, AOC made her derision for political moderates extremely clear in a speech at South by Southwest on Saturday. “Moderate is not a stance. It’s just an attitude towards life of, like, ‘meh,’” Ocasio-Cortez told a packed room at the tech-centric festival in Austin, Texas. “We’ve become so cynical, that we view … cynicism as an intellectually superior attitude, and we view ambition as youthful naivety when ... the greatest things we have ever accomplished as a society have been ambitious acts of vision. The ‘meh’ is worshipped now. For what?”
MAR14	MPs have voted against no deal. Now here’s how to make that decision stick	MPs have just voted against a no-deal Brexit. But this vote doesn’t achieve much by itself, because it’s just an indicative vote. “No deal can’t be taken off the table; it is the table.” You’ll hear this clever soundbite in the Twitter feeds of MPs and commentators on both sides of the Brexit divide, but it suffers from the serious defect of being wrong. When we talk about no deal being the table, what we really mean is that it is the present default position. It is absolutely true that, unless we agree a deal, we will leave the EU without one – be that on the 29th of this month, if no extension is granted; or, if an extension is granted, when that extension expires. No deal is, as things stand, the ultimate default position.
MAR14	Theresa May is truly on the ropes. But there may yet be life in her deal	And so the Brexit options facing Theresa May tighten again, remorselessly and painfully, and with more pain to come. A day after a second decisive defeat for her withdrawal deal with the EU, and amid threats and chaos in the Westminster lobbies, MPs narrowly wrested control from May by four votes over the possibility of no deal. Then in a second vote they drove the message home again, this time by an unambiguous majority of 43. We are witnessing a watershed in the Brexit process, as power passes from May’s government to shifting coalitions of MPs on individual issues in front of our eyes. But the passing from one chapter of the story to another is unmistakable in spite of the confusion in the lobbies last night. The government that had first promised a free vote to Conservative MPs ended the evening by vainly trying to whip its MPs against the toughened no-deal motion, and still lost – lost badly.
MAR14	The middle ground is our only route out of this Brexit abyss	Brexit is a conundrum in search of a compromise. The referendum, after all, delivered a narrow majority for leave; the political convulsions ever since have torn at Britain’s democratic and social fabric; and no one credible believes a hard break from the EU can be achieved without significant economic pain. A rational approach, therefore, would focus on a compromise seeking to unite the country as much as possible, minimise economic damage and allow the conversation to shift on to what Theresa May diagnosed – and proceeded to fuel – as the “burning injustices” disfiguring British society. But the middle ground underpinning such a compromise has been deliberately shredded, torched, carpet-bombed from both directions. The British right and their media allies have played the decisive role. Tory media outlets and the Tory hierarchy – David Cameron included – spent years demonising migrants, scapegoating them for social problems – like stagnating wages or the housing crisis – that are actually caused by those with power. George Osborne’s ideologically driven austerity project failed.
MAR14	Did no one tell Philip Hammond that austerity is raging outside?	Listen to Philip Hammond and it’s easy to get lulled into a false sense that he is an adult making sober, cautious decisions. Not blessed with the (ahem) charisma of a Boris Johnson, he is happily less given to spouting headline-grabbing rubbish. While his colleagues have spent the past two and a half years promising voters the moon on a stick, the chancellor has kept his cool. The spring statement was classic Hammond. Sandwiched between Tuesday’s humiliation for Theresa May and the no-deal vote Wednesday night, he was never going to command any front pages. Watching, you could mistake him for the bank manager your branch doesn’t have: sensible, dull, unremarkable. In which case you’d have misjudged both him and his policies. Because Hammond has just taken two big risks. One of those was right and could damage him; the other a huge blunder and will hurt the rest of us.
MAR14	Silicon Valley is erecting a monument to itself. Will it be a giant robo-phallus?	Every city has a landmark that celebrates what its people love. France has the Eiffel Tower, which is both astonishingly beautiful and admittedly a bit penisy. New York has the Empire State Building, which is the same but bigger. Rome has the Colosseum, to celebrate an oiled-up Russell Crowe. Now Silicon Valley power-brokers want to honour the thing they truly love, by building their own massive monument to themselves. The San Jose Light Tower Corporation has raised $1m to create a statue that honours Silicon Valley itself. They hope to raise up to $150m for a “great idea”, according to the New York Times.
MAR14	With Theresa’s ‘turd’ deal flushed away, pray for an EU invasion	“It … sends a message … to the whole world,” croaked Theresa May to the Commons on Tuesday night, “about the sort of country … the United Kingdom will be … in the years and decades ahead.” Fairly sure the world has got the message by now. They are “up to speed” and “across the detail” of the sort of country the UK is. The question of whether Brexit represented a midlife crisis or the descent into senility appears to have been answered. The land that likes to picture itself as a David Niven world war two movie is in fact a look-away episode of The Jeremy Kyle Show. On close inspection, the “beacon of democracy” turns out to be a bin fire.
MAR14	May and Corbyn will never back a second referendum – but MPs must	It’s become the norm in these most extraordinary of political times: the prime minister suffers another humiliating defeat after two years of negotiations on the most important decision in decades, and no one in the House of Commons shouts: “Resign!” Although there is little, if any, sympathy for Theresa May (the consensus being that she is the author of her own misfortune), no leader of any party stands up and demands she steps down. Even though it’s widely recognised that the prime minister is largely the problem, it’s accepted that the Conservative party is unlikely to find anyone much better to replace her.
MAR14	Parliament is betraying voters, but a clean Brexit is the best option	Parliament is failing to respect the wishes of the majority in the referendum. Labour and Conservative MPs promised to implement the leave vote to get elected in 2017. The Conservative manifesto said no deal was better than a bad deal, and confirmed we would be leaving the customs union and the single market at the same time. The Labour manifesto set out a detailed and interesting new trade policy for the UK that would be incompatible with staying in the customs union and EU market arrangements. The leave-voting public is in despair about this parliament’s failure to agree a common line to leave. Some blame the government for negotiating badly. Others blame the opposition for undermining the UK negotiation by implying no deal is not an option and for having separate lines of communication with very different messages to the EU. All feel democracy is letting them down. It is not just the lack of enthusiasm to implement the referendum vote, but also the way many MPs have torn up their pro-Brexit election statements.
MAR14	Here’s our plan for an orderly no-deal Brexit, and delivered on time	From the moment that Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, published his advice that, despite the prime minister’s efforts to secure an amendment to the backstop, “the legal risk remains unchanged”, the fate of the withdrawal agreement was sealed. To some, that may be taken as a signal of a deeply divided Conservative party. Yet in its commitment to honour its manifesto promise to deliver Brexit by leaving the single market, the customs union and the remit of the European court of justice, the party is anything but. My own local association voted unanimously last month that Brexit, as defined in the manifesto, must be delivered on time and in full. The National Conservative Convention – the senior body in the voluntary party – passed a similar motion by a ratio of 5 to 1, and also stated that: “Another referendum, a delay beyond the European elections, taking no deal off the table or not leaving at all would betray the 2016 people’s vote and damage democracy and our party for a generation.”
MAR14	These gaffes expose British politics’ real issue with race	Among the unremarkable racial experiences in my life, I have been chased off a train as a teenager by men twice my age and size shouting “nigger”; pursued down a main street in Edinburgh by two men with baseball bats shouting the same word; had racist graffiti scrawled on my house; and had countless people shout at me in the street. Unremarkable not because they weren’t terrifying or upsetting at the time but because such stories are relatively common among black people of my age who grew up in Britain. So when I hear that someone has failed at racial etiquette, I generally roll my eyes, whether or not they are a politician. I have seen, heard and felt worse. The pattern is now painfully familiar. In an unscripted moment a public figure uses a term that is either outdated (“coloured”), offensive (“nigger ”) or just plain odd (“funny tinge”). Indignation, caffeinated by social media, erupts. The person then doubles down or apologises – or, as often as not, doubles down and then apologises. I get a phone call from a radio or television outlet asking if I want to come on and talk about it. I don’t.
MAR15	With Brexit now on hold, there’s only one option left: compromise	The Brexit chasm has seemed unbridgeable. No path has appeared through the impasse. Tonight a glimmer of a route came into view. Parliament decided to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day and extend the negotiating phase, probably for three months. It did so, shamelessly, because it could not agree on what on earth to do next. The EU, reasonably, asks why. If the UK could not decide on Brexit in two and a half years, what difference will three months make? The answer is that Theresa May is refusing to give up on her red lines and her frantic efforts to appease the rightwing of her party. Yet her deal has not so far pleased them, and it has now gone down to defeat twice, by huge margins. Astonishingly, she wants to try one more time next Tuesday.
MAR15	Theresa May has finally got the Brexiters where she wants them	MPs had the chance to take back control of Brexit – wresting this tortured process from a weak, flailing and moribund government – and they ducked it. Sure, it was by the narrowest of margins, losing by just two votes, 312 to 314, but MPs passed up the opportunity to take charge and say, at long last, what kind of Brexit they want. They preferred instead to grant Theresa May yet another lifeline for her own deal – which, incredibly, will come back for a third meaningful vote on Tuesday. The lever that was offered to MPs, by which they might have finally got a grip on the Brexit crisis, was a proposal from Hilary Benn that would have seen a series of votes allowing MPs to indicate their preferred Brexit plan – whether that be Norway plus or a second referendum or every shade in between. No longer would May retain the initiative, with the power to confine MPs to a single, binary choice: my way or the highway.
MAR15	The problem is not so much Theresa May – it’s that Britain is now ungovernable	Dramas need characters, politics requires politicians and a storm must have an eye. Which is why at the dead centre of Brexit – the biggest and most multifaceted crisis to face this country in more than 60 years – there is just one person. She stands at a Commons dispatch box in an elegant outfit day after day, knowing that the evening will cover her in yet another dung-heap of humiliation that will be daubed all over the next morning’s front pages. All along her frontbench are colleagues just waiting for her to go, so they can take her job and move into her Downing Street home. On her backbenches are MPs who shamelessly boast to journalists their fantasies about putting her in a “noose” and “knifing her in the front”. She is derided, she is hated, she is the target for some of the most outrageous abuse ever to be heaped on a 62-year-old woman from Eastbourne. In a democracy intent on beating itself up, Theresa May has become the nation’s punchbag. On radio phone-ins, the callers pour bile upon her. On TV sofas, pundits speculate about how many days she has left at No 10. When she isn’t attracting derision, she attracts something arguably worse for a politician: pity. Her voice has gone and, the theory goes, soon she will follow.
MAR15	If children don’t join the climate strike, their schools are underachieving	There will be another large-scale school climate strike tomorrow, following a controversial walkout by pupils last month. I say controversial; the reaction in much of the grownup media was perhaps better described as a reluctant obligation to be adult about the whole thing, while secretly cheering them on. Even prominent Conservatives struggled to feign disapproval of this wanton act of civic engagement by the next generation. Energy minister Claire Perry wistfully told the BBC she would have joined the walkouts in her younger years. She may take a different line if the kids keep it up – it is, after all, her department they are protesting against.
MAR15	I know the panic of ‘maths anxiety’. But hope may be the best solution	I’m bad at maths. I want you to know that this is not a boast, though to say that you are bad at maths has somehow become a badge of honour, in a way that publicly saying “I’m barely literate” never can be (even Donald Trump doesn’t admit that). A few years ago, the charity National Numeracy even criticised celebrities who boast about their poor maths skills as contributing to the national “scourge” of poor numeracy. Why do people do it? Is it to make themselves appear quirky and creative, or do we just not consider it a vital life skill? Either way, it isn’t helping, and now new research from the University of Cambridge has found that studying maths is causing some primary school pupils to feel rage and despair as a result of “maths anxiety” – with some reduced to tears and others struggling to breathe.
MAR15	A general election is now possible. To win it, Labour must back Europe	The good, the mad, the dishonest and the cowardly – that’s roughly how the House of Commons split last night and probably will again tonight. The honours go to those Tory MPs and ministers – especially the four cabinet ministers – who sought to ensure that whatever else happens they will not lead the country to destruction. They can hardly be sacked since they were promised a free vote until only minutes before the division, when the prime minister tried to swerve her troops into the wrong lobby. The no-deal horses of the apocalypse were well described by the chancellor: the introduction of appalling tariffs that would slaughter industry swamped with cheap goods while killing exporters whose goods get too expensive, as smuggled EU loot undercuts everyone via the Irish border. He couldn’t have said it plainer – but then what? He jumped on to one of those horses and galloped into the lobby to vote to allow that to happen. List him among the dishonourable.
MAR15	Marketing medication as his and hers? This is ‘anxiety economy’ at its worst	If you have ever spent more than five minutes on Instagram, you’ll probably be familiar with the sleek pink packages that indicate someone has bought something from Glossier. The company, an American cosmetics brand founded in 2010, has become famous not only for its products, but also for its aesthetic: cutesy, minimalist pastel packaging expertly targeted at the perfect millennial customer. As with many brands, what you are actually getting doesn’t always seem to matter: photographing it, being seen to have it, is what you are paying for. Legions of brands have followed Glossier’s example: at first, other cosmetic companies, then homeware, lifestyle and more. Now, it seems, the Glossierification of everyday life is finally complete, as the telemedicine brands Hims and Hers neatly show.
MAR15	A flawed second referendum could break our democracy	We’ve been locked in a tug-of-war for years that has effectively shut down government, and produced drift, anxiety and anger. Today a group of MPs will push for a second referendum to break the deadlock. In Westminster, their voices have dominated the Brexit debate and at times made a second vote seem inevitable. But when I go home to Wigan, for the most part it seems absurd. I’ve never been a fan of binary choices. I dislike the divisive nature of our first-past-the-post electoral system and argued against a simple remain-leave referendum on the EU, which forced people to take sides on an issue that for most inspires mixed feelings. I am even less convinced by the case for a second referendum in the terms proposed.
MAR15	Austerity created this mental-health crisis. Brexit has sent it into overdrive	There was something about the events in Westminster this week that made me think of the news that sales of self-help books in Britain are at a record high. As we encounter an ever more stressful and unsteady climate, we are turning to those who offer answers (an issue not least for those who can’t afford the price of a book). Some of this anxiety must come down to more global patterns – climate change, say, or the fragility of democratic norms – but much can come down to the more prosaic matters of life: ability to pay the bills, job prospects, or simply the sense that we have a grasp on the future. Just look at Brexit. More than four in 10 people say that Brexit has impacted on their mental health in the past two years; hardly surprising considering 44% of respondents to the YouGov survey believed EU withdrawal will worsen their lives. Some EU nationals living in the UK have even reported feeling suicidal as uncertainty about their future steps up.
MAR15	Wake up, Philip Hammond. The climate crisis needs action, not lip service	For once, Philip Hammond’s spring statement acknowledged the climate crisis and the collapse of wildlife and insect populations around the world. But has the chancellor been swept up by the rising tide of climate activism? Has he been inspired by the courage and passion of the young people joining school strikes to defend their futures? Sadly not.
MAR16	After Christchurch, Muslims need more than just your thoughts and prayers	There is a certain profundity about waking up one morning, when your only plans for the day are to go to Friday prayers with your family, to discover that on the other side of the world people just like you, doing exactly the same thing with their Friday as you intend to do with yours, have been slaughtered. My first response upon reading of the massacre in Christchurch was, I admit, stunned blankness. I could read the words, and I understood them, but for a few moments there was no obvious emotional reaction. Not because I didn’t care about what had happened, but because the enormity of it meant it was simply too difficult to immediately process.
MAR16	Brexit – the niche production that truly brought the house down	We focus so much on what divides parliament’s warring Brexit factions, when almost all of them are united by the guiding principle of brinkmanship: “Eventually someone will stop acting like a shit, but it certainly won’t be me.” The past few days have been like watching the Cuban missile crisis re-enacted by the Teletubbies. A recap, then. Hopes that Tinky Winky would grow into the role of Bobby Kennedy were dashed this week in a series of votes in the House of Commons. We are 14 days out from the date the UK will leave the European Union without a deal unless something else is agreed upon. With the threat of that something being a long extension, if granted by the EU, Theresa May is hoping MPs will look again at her withdrawal agreement next week in Meaningful Vote 3. Sure, they saw it lurching around the bar earlier and thought there was no way in a million years they were going home with it. But this close to tipping-out time, are they drunk enough to panic-buy? If the answer turns out to be yes, the prime minister’s various earlier losses this week will be hailed momentarily as tactically astute. Think of it as a sort of Crap Negotiations World Cup. Theresa May doesn’t want to finish top of the group or her Brexit will face the Treaty of Versailles in the semis.
MAR16	The climate strikers should inspire us all to act at the next UN summit	Tens of thousands of young people took to the streets on Friday with a clear message to world leaders: act now to save our planet and our future from the climate emergency. These schoolchildren have grasped something that seems to elude many of their elders: we are in a race for our lives, and we are losing. The window of opportunity is closing – we no longer have the luxury of time, and climate delay is almost as dangerous as climate denial.
MAR16	Four ways you can support the YouthStrike4Climate movement	Since we made headlines in February with the UK’s first school strike, we’ve seen an outpouring of support from our peers, parents, carers, politicians and other people from all walks of life. It seems that most people know we’re in a mess, but they just didn’t know what we can to do to get out of it. This is where the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN) stepped in, not necessarily out of choice, but necessity. There’s no time left for the “adults in the room” to solve the climate crisis. The politicians and powerful actors have failed us. Youth is rising up all around the world and here in the UK we’re emerging as one of the most powerful forces, demanding urgent and radical change.
MAR16	Do UK politicians support the climate strike? Party leaders respond	By taking to the streets today to make their voices heard, young people are educating us about how important tackling climate change is to their generation. They are right to be worried about what kind of planet they will inherit and right to demand far-reaching action. Governments cannot sit back, leaving major decisions to market forces. It hasn’t worked and it never will. Polluting corporations will never do anything serious to solve the crisis. Climate change presents terrible risks. But because it demands such massive change and government action, it’s also an opportunity to transform our economy, making it cleaner, healthier and fairer. Labour already has among the most ambitions carbon reduction targets in Europe and radical plans to create a zero-carbon emission economy by 2050. We plan to achieve that by ushering in a “green industrial revolution”.
MAR16	Bloody Sunday was a very British atrocity – the top brass got away with it	There may be only one thing that the Bloody Sunday families and the defenders of the Parachute Regiment are agreed on following the announcement that a former lance corporal is to be charged with two murders and four attempted murders: that it is perverse and unfair that one low-ranking soldier should be made to carry the can for what happened in Derry 47 years ago. Once again, Kipling’s “poor bloody infantry” are to take the blame.
MAR16	The UK says it’s a climate leader. But it’s complicit in climate atrocities	It wasn’t long ago that Theresa May stated boldly that she wanted “the Britain of the future to be a truly global Britain, which is a force for good in the world. Steadfast in upholding our values – not least our fierce commitment to protecting the natural environment”. Not everyone was fooled – least of all the thousands of young people striking from school today to call on world leaders to finally take the climate crisis seriously.
MAR16	Think we should be at school? Today’s climate strike is the biggest lesson of all	It started in front of the Swedish parliament, on 20 August – a regular school day. Greta Thunberg sat with her painted sign and some homemade flyers. This was the first school climate strike. Fridays wouldn’t be regular schooldays any longer. The rest of us, and many more alongside us, picked it up in Australia, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, New Zealand, Uganda. Today the climate strike will take place all around the world. This movement had to happen, we didn’t have a choice. We knew there was a climate crisis. Not just because forests in Sweden or in the US had been on fire; because of alternating floods and drought in Germany and Australia; because of the collapse of alpine faces due to melting permafrost and other climate changes. We knew, because everything we read and watched screamed out to us that something was very wrong.
MAR16	Young climate activists around the world: why I’m striking today	We strike for the Earth, to protect and save it from what the human race has done. As indigenous youths we have a close connection to the Earth. We know that without it we have nothing, we are nothing. Our community is directly affected by the Cold Lake oil sands, which is a large deposit of tar sands. Some of the tar sands can be extracted through drilling, which is incredibly dangerous to land, animals and people, and affects the water and air quality in negative ways. We must think of the future generations: what we do today, tomorrow and the next day will impact the next seven generations. We must change our ways from burning natural resources, from releasing so much carbon, from poisoning what we need to live. We cannot survive by drinking oil. I am from the Central Taiwan Plains Indigenous People. As the indigenous people of Taiwan, we have a particular vulnerability to climate change. Our traditional culture is deeply rooted in the harmony we have with the spirit of nature. We face heartbreaking loss due to increasingly extreme weather events. We urge the Taiwanese government to implement mitigation measures and face up to the vulnerability of indigenous people, halt construction projects in the indigenous traditional realm, and recognise the legal status of Plains Indigenous People, in order to implement environmental protection as a bottom-up approach.
MAR16	The decision to prosecute only one soldier over Bloody Sunday is unbelievable	The dignity and determination with which the Bloody Sunday families have conducted their struggle for truth and justice over the past 47 years has been a source of inspiration. And there is no doubt that their hopes were high of another major breakthrough on Thursday morning as we walked through the same Bogside streets where the massacre happened all those years ago. For the vast majority of the families those hopes were to be dashed shortly after they arrived in the City hotel to be told by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) that only one former soldier would face murder charges over the deaths of James Wray and William McKinney, and attempted murder charges relating to Joseph Friel, Michael Quinn, Joe Mahon and Patrick O’Donnell.
MAR17	To ignore Nigel Farage and the populist right is complacent	Conventional wisdom has a remarkable capacity to recover from the many batterings it receives and carry on as if nothing has happened. Like Doctor Who, it doesn’t die but regenerates. Last week, it was anticipating the defeat of the populist right – that combination of opportunism, utopianism, victimhood, wilful ignorance, conspiracism and racism, for which we do not yet have a satisfactory label. Even though Theresa May’s government is collapsing as if it has been hit by a wrecking ball, even though her withdrawal agreement has been defeated by the two of the largest majorities ever, conventional wisdom assures us that the Brexit ultras must support it on her third attempt.
MAR17	Americans really pay a bribe for a good education? In Britain, we’ve got far subtler ways	“Dude, dude, what do you think, I’m a moron?” Thus, one of the parents accused of involvement in the US college bribery racket. He’d been warned – by a wiretapped conspirator – not to reveal that he paid $50,000 for his daughter’s fraudulent test results, part of a system the fixer calls “the side door”. Appropriately soothed – “I’m not saying you’re a moron” – the accused father is recorded, by the FBI, assuring the scam’s organiser that he’ll deliver, if required, the agreed fiction. “I’m going to say that I’ve been inspired how you’re helping underprivileged kids get into college. Totally got it.”
MAR17	Hungry, unwashed children fill our schools – how has it come to this?	According to a survey from the headteachers’ union, the Association of School and College Leaders, schools have become “an unofficial fourth emergency service” for the families worst affected by austerity across England and Wales. A majority of the 400 school leaders surveyed said schools were increasingly forced to help pupils, despite less help from councils, and have had to cut budgets. Schools are helping with food parcels, equipment, shoes and hygiene – nine out of 10 give out clothes, while nearly half do laundry for them. Some are running impromptu food banks or sourcing beds.
MAR17	Luke and Sophie Perry: where’s the shame in grieving your own way?	Of all the difficulties to navigate when caught up in the sickening grip of grief, to be told you are not grieving correctly by strangers must be the one of the most bizarre. The actor Luke Perry’s 18-year-old daughter, Sophie, was driven to write an Instagram post, in which she defended herself against criticism she had faced since her father died suddenly, of a stroke, aged 52. She wrote that she had received a lot of attention online since he died. She said she had not asked for this focus to be upon her and that, among the kind messages, she had also been “shamed” for her “grieving process”, which, it seems, has been seen by some as not being sad enough. “I’m not going to sit in my room and cry day in and day out until the internet has deemed it appropriate for me to do otherwise,” she said, with more dignity than anyone who caused her to write that really deserved.
MAR17	Excluded children can still have hope: here’s the proof	This summer, when she leaves school, Leah wants to become an art therapist. Her classmate Holly wants to do something with psychology, and for Sam it’s an apprenticeship with the police. None of this would be unusual except that Sam (not his real name), a chatty and engaging 16-year-old, used to spend his days at school in isolation and his evenings “getting into trouble” around town with his mates. He thought he had irrevocably screwed up his life, and was resigned to having blown it. Fortunately for Sam, he found somewhere prepared to give him not just a second chance but a third and a fourth and a fifth. Whatever happened yesterday, tomorrow is always a new day. All three teenagers attend Restormel academy, in the Cornish town of St Austell. It’s one of a group of alternative provision schools belonging to the Wave multi-academy trust, catering for children permanently excluded from mainstream secondary schools plus others who haven’t been expelled but may be on the verge, who come in for specialist interventions. The young people I meet are friendly, articulate and sick of a national debate raging over their heads that draws sometimes crude connections between exclusion, knife crime and feral behaviour.
MAR17	My father was killed on Bloody Sunday. Britain must confront its colonial legacy	The decision by the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland to bring murder and attempted murder charges only against Soldier F for his alleged actions on Bloody Sunday astonished families as they gathered to hear the news. It has also drawn more poison from the military establishment, adding to its growing belief that its loyal foot-soldiers have in recent times become the scapegoats of colonial history. The facts around the Bloody Sunday deaths, and around stories affecting many hundreds of families who lost loved ones – including my father who was killed that day – due to the actions of state forces in the years following 1969, are that very few were actually investigated as crimes. Evidence was not collected. Inquests were rushed and often held without family involvement or legal awareness of rights, limited as they were. Only four criminal trials were held for members of the security forces during almost 30 years of conflict. No investigating policeman ever darkened the door of our house in the Brandywell area of Derry to find out about Paddy Doherty (deceased). In the 1980s I served an IRA-related prison sentence for a much lesser offence.
MAR17	After Christchurch, Muslims need more than just your thoughts and prayers	There is a certain profundity about waking up one morning, when your only plans for the day are to go to Friday prayers with your family, to discover that on the other side of the world people just like you, doing exactly the same thing with their Friday as you intend to do with yours, have been slaughtered. My first response upon reading of the massacre in Christchurch was, I admit, stunned blankness. I could read the words, and I understood them, but for a few moments there was no obvious emotional reaction. Not because I didn’t care about what had happened, but because the enormity of it meant it was simply too difficult to immediately process.
MAR17	Brexit – the niche production that truly brought the house down	We focus so much on what divides parliament’s warring Brexit factions, when almost all of them are united by the guiding principle of brinkmanship: “Eventually someone will stop acting like a shit, but it certainly won’t be me.” The past few days have been like watching the Cuban missile crisis re-enacted by the Teletubbies. A recap, then. Hopes that Tinky Winky would grow into the role of Bobby Kennedy were dashed this week in a series of votes in the House of Commons. We are 14 days out from the date the UK will leave the European Union without a deal unless something else is agreed upon. With the threat of that something being a long extension, if granted by the EU, Theresa May is hoping MPs will look again at her withdrawal agreement next week in Meaningful Vote 3. Sure, they saw it lurching around the bar earlier and thought there was no way in a million years they were going home with it. But this close to tipping-out time, are they drunk enough to panic-buy? If the answer turns out to be yes, the prime minister’s various earlier losses this week will be hailed momentarily as tactically astute. Think of it as a sort of Crap Negotiations World Cup. Theresa May doesn’t want to finish top of the group or her Brexit will face the Treaty of Versailles in the semis.
MAR17	The climate strikers should inspire us all to act at the next UN summit	Tens of thousands of young people took to the streets on Friday with a clear message to world leaders: act now to save our planet and our future from the climate emergency. These schoolchildren have grasped something that seems to elude many of their elders: we are in a race for our lives, and we are losing. The window of opportunity is closing – we no longer have the luxury of time, and climate delay is almost as dangerous as climate denial.
MAR17	Four ways you can support the YouthStrike4Climate movement	Since we made headlines in February with the UK’s first school strike, we’ve seen an outpouring of support from our peers, parents, carers, politicians and other people from all walks of life. It seems that most people know we’re in a mess, but they just didn’t know what we can to do to get out of it. This is where the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN) stepped in, not necessarily out of choice, but necessity. There’s no time left for the “adults in the room” to solve the climate crisis. The politicians and powerful actors have failed us. Youth is rising up all around the world and here in the UK we’re emerging as one of the most powerful forces, demanding urgent and radical change.
MAR18	A long delay is now the only way out of this Brexit quagmire	“We are getting close to resolving this now.” So Philip Hammond told the BBC’s Andrew Marr today, delivering this fabulously silly Brexit forecast without a flicker of visible irony. Who says the chancellor doesn’t have a sense of humour? As it happens, he went on to break character pretty quickly by admitting that there may not even be a third meaningful vote on Theresa May’s deal this week. If the government’s managers do not think they have a chance of winning – or at least of significantly reducing the margin of defeat – they will not subject the prime minister to yet another humiliation on Tuesday. The case for trying is the remarkable speed with which a number of previously hardline Brexiteers are discovering the merits of pragmatism and reconciliation. It is amazing how quickly non-negotiable objections can melt away as the clock ticks, reality bites and careerism trumps principle.
MAR18	Only our compromise can break the Brexit impasse	When we go back to our constituencies, it’s sometimes hard to explain to people what happens in Westminster because, in all honesty, it doesn’t always make sense. Try telling someone how Steven Barclay, the Brexit secretary, could speak in favour of a motion on Thursday night only to vote against it a few minutes later. Or how MPs like us can vote to stop a no-deal Brexit last week only to be told at the end of it that such a prospect was more likely than ever. Or how a prime minister can suffer two of the biggest defeats in the history of parliament on the most important issue facing the country but then, with a completely straight face, say that she plans to bring it back a third (or maybe even fourth) time.
MAR18	Whatever Nancy Pelosi says, youthful zest is moving US politics to the left	A generational battle is taking place in US politics that could have profound consequences not just for the global left but also for the future of the planet. Ever since the freshman class of Democrats entered Congress in January, many of them young women of colour and supported by a young activist base, they have met resistance from more established members of the party. When the newly elected representative Rashida Tlaib, from Detroit, called Donald Trump a “motherfucker”, hours after being sworn in, she was the subject of finger-wagging from politicians and pundits. “I don’t really like that kind of language,” house judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler said. CNN’s Chris Cillizza wrote that Tlaib’s choice of words was a gift to the president. When 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez surprised everyone by seeing off an established Democratic rival and going on to win a seat in Congress, her triumph – after a shock primary victory in New York over the longstanding incumbent, Joe Crowley, who was the third most powerful House Democrat – was played down by the House of Representatives Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who chose to emphasise that voters had merely “made a choice in one district”. Since then, Ocasio-Cortez, who has become an internationally recognised figure, has faced a backlash from an array of party insiders – some of whom seem to resent her public profile and Twitter-star status – for her refusal to play by the normal rules of Washington politics.
MAR18	Technology is terrorism’s most effective ally. It delivers a global audience	Terrorism is effective because it always seems near. It always seems new. And it always seems personal. Ever since the first wave of terrorist violence broke across the newly industrialised cities of the west in the late 19th century this has been true. It feels personal because, although statistics may show we are many times more likely to die in a banal domestic accident, we instinctively conclude from an attack on the other side of the street, the city or, in the case of New Zealand, the other side of the world, we might be next.
MAR18	My kids are genuises. Honestly. Who do I pay the bribe to?	I lie to my kids all the time, without thinking, in large ways and in small. Yes, I tell them, I will organise a play date with Sammy (I won’t). No, your sister didn’t mean that (she did). Yes, everyone dies, but children don’t die before mummies, and mummies only die when they’re really, really old, so there’s no point in worrying about it now. And yes – of course, a million times yes – that picture of a beetle is the best beetle drawn since a cave-child first drew a beetle. That last lie is only a half lie to the extent that, even when I am checking myself for overweening parental pride, it is hard for me to judge my children’s output realistically. My daughter’s ability to hold on to the term “solar system” and observe that “the mouth and nose are connected” is evidence of Einstein-like acuity. That wobbly name, written with the front four letters taking up half of the page and the back four crammed into a tiny space that also careens downwards, is penmanship unparalleled.
MAR18	Islamophobia is not confined to online groups. It leaks across public life	On Friday morning, as the news from Christchurch was still rolling across radio bulletins, Sir Mark Rowley, the former head of counter-terrorism at the Met, was commenting on the horror on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Fifty Muslims had been brutally murdered, and 48 seriously injured. For 17 horrifying minutes, a white supremacist terrorist unloaded round after round of bullets into men, women and children. Islamophobia was undoubtedly real and on the rise and being propagated online, said Rowley. But, he went on to quibble, Islamophobia wasn’t racism. To conflate the two was, he claimed, “clumsy thinking”.
MAR18	Iran’s threats to BBC Persian staff must be confronted	Tyrannical regimes seek to control what their populations read, see and hear, lest the people obtain information that might encourage them to question the power that subjugates them. Some go to extraordinary lengths, reaching far outside their borders, to prevent that happening. One obvious example was the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Turkey last October. A single, bloody act, it made headlines around the world. As it should have.
MAR18	Well done, Brexit ultras – the EU has never had more power over Britain	The rich history of these islands includes a Blessed Parliament, a Good Parliament and a Loyal Parliament. Also a Merciless Parliament, a Rump Parliament and a Barebone’s Parliament. The current one could go down as the Addled Parliament or the Useless Parliament if those nicknames had not already been awarded in earlier times. So let us call this the Broken Parliament. It has been bust by Brexit. During the referendum three long and painful years ago, it was the Leavers’ boast that they would restore parliamentary sovereignty to all the powers and glories they claimed had been lost to Brussels. What they have instead done is to turn Britain’s legislature into a theatre of anarchy that daily demonstrates that it cannot agree on anything. A country once widely admired for the functioning of its democracy and the robustness of its institutions has been turned into a global joke.
MAR18	We scoffed at Grayling’s ‘ferries’ but his way is now a public service norm	Oh, how we laughed. Failing Grayling, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, the Mr Bean of contemporary politics, had awarded a cross-Channel ferry contract to Seaborne, a company that had no ferries and had never run a ferry service. Six weeks later, the contract was torn up. The trouble is, the laugh’s on us too. For it’s not just Grayling who’s failing. The Seaborne style of awarding contracts – never mind the competence, just get the signature – has long been the public sector norm for outsourced work. The result has been scandalous services and collapsing companies.
MAR18	Where now for Mark Zuckerberg after his – and our – loss of innocence?	The Cambridge Analytica revelations, the most damning of which were published by the Observer and the New York Times a year ago, quickly morphed from a scandal about a British political consultancy into one about Facebook, the social media behemoth. It was not the first or last of Facebook’s many crises, but has been the most consequential for the company and for the future of data privacy. The exposé, which revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal information of around 87 million Facebook users and used it for political purposes, triggered congressional and parliamentary hearings, multiple regulatory investigations and a fundamental rethink of Facebook’s future.
MAR19	John Bercow’s ruling has breathed new life into the people’s vote	Brexit fatigue and Brexit bullying are Theresa May’s instruments of torture to grind recalcitrant MPs into passing her destructive deal. No more, says the Speaker: this war of attrition must stop. Her deal must change and if she brings one back, it must be “fundamentally different”. How different? He can’t say until he sees what plan, if any, she will present. Rightly John Bercow complains of time wasted, of running down the clock as she tries to crush MPs against the concrete wall she herself constructed. No 10 was not forewarned of the Speaker’s ruling. Oddly, the Brexiteers were sounding pleased, presuming her deal as it stands can’t pass. They hope that no-deal beckons – still the legal certainty unless parliament passes something else. But the champion of the house will guarantee that MPs get the chance to stop no-deal dead.
MAR19	The Speaker has seized his Brexit moment – and now all bets are off	It has been clear for some time now that John Bercow sees himself as a leading protagonist in our political drama, not some bystander. Even before Theresa May’s deal was bogged down in parliamentary trench warfare, the Commons Speaker had styled himself as a warrior on behalf of the legislature, defending it against arrogant incursions by government. But kicking May’s withdrawal agreement out of the chamber altogether yesterday was a ferocious escalation. The premise is procedural and venerable. Erskine May, the vast tome in which are accumulated the various rules and conventions governing parliamentary business, decrees that the same motion cannot be debated twice in one parliamentary session. And since May’s Brexit deal was rejected last week, Bercow believes that the prime minister cannot simply come back – as had been planned – and ask MPs to reconsider. What was billed as a third “meaningful vote” would need some substantial revision of content to qualify as truly meaningful in the Speaker’s eyes.
MAR19	Farage's Brexit march: the theatre of the absurd meets storm-hit Minion	How was your weekend? I am hoping that you had a good one. But if you didn’t, console yourself that it cannot have been as grim as the leave voters who were walking from Sunderland in the driving rain, the churning wind and the sea spitting in their cliffside faces. To wit: That is the official photograph sent to me in a press release. That is the best representation the campaign could muster.
MAR19	Why was I asked to condemn Islamist violence days after Christchurch?	Less than two days after the horror of the massacre of 50 Muslims in two mosques in New Zealand, I was asked in an interview on the BBC news channel whether or not I think Muslim communities in the UK do enough to condemn Islamist extremism. “There’s a straightforward problem here, isn’t there – one of the reasons that some of this language has become common is bluntly because of the Islamist violence and the Islamist extremism that has happened – one of the criticisms we hear in this country has been that there isn’t enough criticism of those people by the mainstream Islamic community – what do you say to that?”
MAR19	For Northern Irish farmers, no-deal Brexit would be a calamity	As president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union (UFU), my last three years have been dominated by Brexit and what it means for farming families. More than 33 months on from the referendum all we have are unanswered questions and uncertainty. The threat of a no deal is still there. Parliament’s vote to reject a no-deal Brexit, and to seek an extension to article 50, are positive steps but the legislation is clear. If the UK does not agree an exit deal with the EU, we leave with no deal. This is a terrifying prospect for Northern Ireland farming families and their businesses.
MAR19	Ending climate change requires the end of capitalism. Have we got the stomach for it?	Climate change activism is increasingly the domain of the young, such as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, the unlikely face of the school strike for climate movement, which has seen many thousands of children walk out of school to demand that their parents’ generation takes responsibility for leaving them a planet to live on. In comparison, the existing political establishment looks more and more like an impediment to change. The consequences of global warming have moved from the merely theoretical and predicted to observable reality over the past few years, but this has not been matched by an uptick in urgency. The need to keep the wheels of capitalism well-oiled takes precedence even against a backdrop of fires, floods and hurricanes. Today’s children, as they become more politically aware, will be much more radical than their parents, simply because there will be no other choice for them. This emergent radicalism is already taking people by surprise. The Green New Deal (GND), a term presently most associated with 29-year-old US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has provoked a wildly unhinged backlash from the “pro free market” wing, who argue that it’s a Trojan horse, nothing more than an attempt to piggyback Marxism onto the back of climate legislation.
MAR19	For all our sakes: Theresa May’s Brexit deal must be voted down	Theresa May must fail. Her first two attempts to get her Brexit deal through the Commons deserved support. They forestalled “crashing out” of the EU with no deal next month – and they took the referendum process forward. She failed twice to persuade the Commons of this. As a result, last week her “least worst Brexit” strategy lost legitimacy. When the Commons voted to debate other options, she voted it down. She insisted she put her deal to a third vote.
MAR19	Until Christchurch I thought it was worth debating with Islamophobes. Not any more	If you have been paying attention, you will know that there is now a genre of response protocol that is followed after attacks on Muslims. It blows dog-whistles even as carnage is unfolding. A ghoulish routine has become established. It usually goes like this. Condemn the attack in the strongest terms, and then water down that condemnation. We mustn’t get carried away, you see, and forget about the context. Attacks against Muslims must not stop us from continuing to criticise Islam and Muslims when it is warranted. The unvoiced subtext is that maybe these particular Muslim victims didn’t have it coming, but such atrocities don’t come out of nowhere. But, you know, thoughts and prayers at this difficult time. Following the Christchurch massacre, there is an article I could write today to explain the danger of this forked-tongue response. An article that exposes the fallacy of thinking that extremist hate crimes can be separated and quarantined from the fact that western societies have become radicalised against Muslims. An article that tries again to show the link between mainstream, fashionable Muslim-bashing and its violent manifestations on the right. An article that fillets the semantic tricks played to stop Muslims ever being complete victims: the line that Islam is not a race; the use of women’s and LBGT rights as a rhetorical stick to beat Muslims with; the cant about freedom of speech, political correctness and the danger of identity politics; the whataboutery and the strawmanning.
MAR19	Jacinda Ardern is showing the world what real leadership is: sympathy, love and integrity	Out of the horror inflicted by those who cannot accept the world as it is, comes a vision of a better world. It comes from above and it comes from below. It comes from ordinary people. Supermarkets in Wellington suburbs have sold out of flowers, tough old football coaches are talking about love and, most powerful of all, there are the stories of the Christchurch shooting survivors themselves. Those who risked – and lost – their lives to save their fellow worshippers or – astonishingly – found it in their hearts to forgive the gunman. Then there is this 38-year-old woman: the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern. We have watched as she shows the world what real leadership is. Jacinda–mania had died down since 2017, when she became the country’s youngest prime minister. She gave birth in office, taking her baby to the United Nations general assembly meeting. She became something of a celebrity, appearing on US chatshows. But was there any substance to her? That question is asked of all women leaders. What is underneath? Where is the steel?
MAR19	The taboos around disability and sex put limits on everyone, disabled or not	There remains a heavy taboo around sex and disability in our culture. Research by the charity Scope found that only 7% of non-disabled people have dated a disabled person, while disabled young people are let down when it comes to sex education, often receiving none at all, or nothing appropriate to their needs. The writer and activist Penny Pepper, who writes extensively about disability and sex, including in her erotica collection Desires Reborn, told me: “If disabled people aren’t having sex, they would like to. And the reasons they’re not are overwhelmingly to do with the barriers in society. I’ve known quite a few disabled people who [because of this] have resigned themselves to never having sex.”
MAR20	Next, the Speaker should force MPs to vote this weekend	Ever since David Cameron took it on himself to prise open Pandora’s box and call the EU referendum, the only thing that’s been predictable has been the utter unpredictability of what has followed. The prospect of Theresa May now taking on Erskine May, whose work lays down the procedural rules of the House of Commons, is but the latest twist in this epic Whitehall farce. His book was first published in 1844, and there is a simple reason that it’s still the principal point of reference when it comes to our constitution: it has passed the toughest test of all – time. I had hoped it would be the start of a collegiate approach, but the whole process has been executed back to front
MAR20	We’re edging away from Brexit – but both sides are set to lose	If shambolic government turned leavers into remainers, Britain would have decided long ago not to bother with Brexit. But that isn’t how it works. The sight of Theresa May failing to organise a departure from the EU proves that she is unequal to the task, not necessarily that the task should be abandoned. For many Eurosceptics, it has the opposite effect. They see the fact that Brexit has broken a stolid prime minister as confirmation that gung-ho leadership is the missing ingredient. The same applies with deadlock and procedural mayhem in parliament. Pro-Europeans cheer when a majority of MPs vote that the country should not be yanked out of the EU without a deal. They salute the Speaker of the House John Bercow when he uses ancient protocol as a bat, thwacking May’s twice-rejected withdrawal agreement out of the Commons chamber without another vote. In the eyes of a remainer, this is the legislature defying of bad government; democracy in action. The leaver sees rogue lawmakers obstructing the popular will; democracy betrayed. Few minds are being changed.
MAR20	Rod Liddle vilifies disabled people. I’m tired of the hate. We all should be	You would be forgiven if, weighed down by the row over the Islamophobia embedded in the British press, you had missed Rod Liddle’s piece in the Sunday Times about disabled people, specifically those with myalgic encephalomyelitis or ME. The headline – “Always fatigued, yet they never tire of claiming their malady really is a virus” – gives a fair hint at the level of bile the piece contains, but to summarise: Liddle uses the resignation of a researcher into ME, Michael Sharpe, to peddle the well-worn trope that the condition is “all in the mind” – or as he puts it, “that their complaints about a virus have no basis in fact”. It has understandably distressed many people with ME, with the piece going viral on social media.
MAR20	Wake up, Italians – our country is in a state of democratic emergency	This month marks a year since the last general election in Italy. Three months afterwards Matteo Salvini’s League and Luigi di Maio’s Five Star Movement (M5S) took power. It’s time to take stock – even though, to tell the truth, we can’t stop stock-taking – such is the desperate situation the country finds itself in. First and foremost, we are in a democratic emergency. Some feel there’s no need for alarm; after all nobody seized power by force, and the government enjoys a high level of popular support (an approval rating of approximately 60%, according to polls). But clearly, just because a government enjoys support we should not stop being clear-eyed about what it is doing. A liberal democracy does not become authoritarian within a few months, but there are signs, however slight and seemingly unconnected, that seem to chart this depressing journey. A few weeks ago the Italian media greeted with alarm a report the secret services had submitted to parliament. The picture it painted was hugely serious, especially in two areas: the growth of racist incidents as we approach the European elections in May, and the inability – given the propaganda and focus on closing ports to migrants from Libya – to curb secret landings using small, fast boats, which could be bringing passengers linked to terrorist groups.
MAR20	Ardern is right not to name the Christchurch suspect. What about everyone else?	DON’T say his name. Don’t share the livestreamed video of the killings, don’t read that rambling adolescent nonsense of a manifesto, don’t fill newspaper front pages with stories about his childhood. Ever since news broke of the terror attack on two Christchurch mosques, there have been calls to deny the suspect attention in favour of focusing on victims and survivors – and now New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has put her moral authority behind them.
MAR20	The death of my mate Mike Thalassitis shows that reality TV is costing lives	Those of us who are grieving the loss of our mate Mike Thalassitis, who died on Saturday, remain shocked at his death. However, even now, you won’t need to look very far on social media to identify attacks and trolling that are the norm for people who have been on reality TV shows. One thing’s for sure, when the producers of Love Island sold us “the dream”, they never warned us about the reality we could face. “They know what they’re getting into”, people say. If only that were true, how differently things might have turned out. I’m trying to get to grips with what’s just happened. A 26-year-old guy. My friend. He couldn’t go on. This isn’t a show. This is the real thing.
MAR20	Social media addiction is not natural or normal – but is it really a disease?	Is social media addictive? The issue is complex, and probably generational. It’s obvious that what social media does to us, especially those of us who are heavy users, is not natural, or normal. It’s not normal to submit opinions for approval every day to an online crowd, nor is it normal to consume the opinions of strangers in bulk. It’s not normal to live under the surveillance of software companies, which tailor their advertising with such eerie precision that it seems impossible that they are not listening in on our conversations. It’s definitely not normal to wake in the night to use social media, or to spend roughly 24 hours a week on it, returning again and again even though it can make us feel depressed and alone. None of these behaviours were normal a few decades ago, nor are they especially useful to us today, but they’re practised by billions of people across the world.
MAR20	Universal basic income only goes so far – free public services are essential too	Almost 37 years ago to the day, during the fiery aftermath of an early Margaret Thatcher budget, the prime minister was allegedly challenged to name just two economists who endorsed her agenda of cutting public spending in the midst of recession – a prescription that was otherwise sending waves through orthodox academic thinking. “Alan Walters, and Professor Patrick Minford,” she is said to have replied – before later remarking, “thank goodness they didn’t ask for three.” The importance of those 1980s budgets feels a far cry from the subdued status of last week’s spring statement. But make no mistake, just as it was in the early 1980s, significant and structural economic reform is once again discernible on the UK’s political breeze – albeit currently blowing harder outside government than within.
MAR20	US Republicans must follow Ardern’s lead and stand up to the gun lobby	Hours after 50 worshippers were killed at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was already promising to tighten up the country’s gun laws. It’s a stark contrast to Donald Trump’s reaction to mass shootings, a written-by-numbers offer of “thoughts and prayers”, then a twiddle of his thumbs until the next atrocity. New Zealand’s response seems to have more in common with Scotland where the massacre at Dunblane primary school in 1996 led to a ban on all handguns. There are some pronounced differences between the two countries. New Zealand’s gun laws are lax; the UK’s gun laws had already been tightened and semi-automatic centrefire rifles banned in the wake of the Hungerford massacre in 1987. But what Scotland and New Zealand share is little previous experience of spree shootings, a visceral shock at the scale of their country’s loss and a determination to prevent it happening again.
MAR20	Smear testing on a shoestring budget: so much for Theresa May’s empathy	Yes, it feels almost impossible, but Theresa May was actually praised for her behaviour and leadership in the House of Commons a few months ago. In January, prompted by Conservative MP Rachel Maclean during prime minister’s questions, May encouraged women to attend cervical smear screening, stating that Public Health England was to launch a campaign to boost uptake: “I know what it’s like … it is not comfortable, sometimes it will be embarrassing, sometimes it’s painful but those few minutes can save lives.” The incoming samples have increased fivefold, yet the number of labs testing the results is shrinking from 50 to nine
MAR21	Britain is in a hole – Europe, we need you to dig us out	When European leaders discuss Brexit on Thursday, they should have in mind a fundamental question: is the EU just a union of governments, or is it also a Europe of citizens, peoples, democracy and destiny? If it’s just the former, they should continue the current mainstream Brussels line of trying to help Theresa May to get her deal over the line, and the UK out of the European Union as soon as possible. If Europe is also the latter, as French president Emmanuel Macron has eloquently argued, then they must recognise that May’s government is the problem, not the solution, and give time for the citizens, peoples and democracy of Britain to work their way to a better place. More than 16 million British citizens voted for Britain to remain in the EU in 2016. Were European citizenship personal and direct, rather than contingent upon being a citizen of a member state, the EU would have a clear responsibility towards us, the British Europeans. If we were a country, we would be the ninth largest in the EU, after the Netherlands and before Belgium. We are joined by some 3 million citizens of other EU countries who live in Britain. That makes 19 million.
MAR21	UK politicians ignore mass public protests at their peril	It is still just about possible, with a sustained deployment of the imagination, to conceive of a set of circumstances in which Theresa May might still be able to regard her Brexit policy as a success. If, for instance, she agrees in Brussels on Thursday on the conditional short extension offered by Donald Tusk on Wednesday ; if she gets her third “meaningful vote” motion past the Speaker next week; if her MPs take Tusk’s offer seriously; if she proves better at persuading enough of them to back her deal than in the past, then – just possibly – it may all seem to have been worthwhile. Or at least it may do so for about 48 hours, until the leadership challenge begins and the policy conflicts of the next – and longer – phase of Brexit negotiations with the EU start to split her party yet again. That imagined moment, though, has now become such a vanishingly small possibility that the final verdict on May’s Brexit policy must now be of its conclusive and overwhelming failure. Her Brexit policy was always to get Britain out by 29 March with a deal that postponed all the major policy implications, on the basis of Tory support, buttressed only by the Democratic Unionist party and Labour’s handful of anti-Europeans. It was always going to be a close-run thing. But it is not going to happen now.
MAR21	May’s latest screeching U-turn makes her utterly unfit to lead	No matter how bad you think Theresa May is, she always manages to get worse. Her record of insisting on one thing, only to U-turn weeks, days or even hours later is almost impressive in its scope. There would be no snap election, she vowed – and then there was one. Her Brexit deal would be subject to a meaningful vote in December – and then the vote was pulled, punted into the new year. Brexit would happen on 29 March – and now it won’t. This latest example is the Russian doll of reversals, with several other reversals contained within it. For just last week, May’s de facto deputy, David Lidington, was adamant that any delay to Brexit would have to be lengthy, since a short, one-off extension would be both pointless – leaving too little time to do anything – and “downright reckless”, as well as being “completely at odds with the position” MPs had taken the previous evening. May had told the Commons that, if MPs voted down her agreement with the EU – which they did – she would be seeking a long extension. She delivered the same message to the cabinet only yesterday.
MAR21	Lives are ruined by shame and stigma. LGBT lessons in schools are vital	One of the most dangerous and destructive things in the world is shame. Shame can burrow into you so deep that it shrinks the brain and constricts the heart. Right now, a “row” – although it is not a row, which makes it sound harmless – is continuing between the teachers and parents of certain primary schools in parts of Birmingham and Manchester. The issue is that sex and relationship education is now part of the curriculum, with primary school children taught about healthy adult relationships and sex education compulsory in secondary schools, including LGBT relationships. Some parents, mainly from Muslim backgrounds, have objected to this. WhatsApp groups have been set up. Loudspeakers have been bought.
MAR21	Why MPs will ultimately have to back Theresa May’s deal	Britain faces a constitutional crisis, according to many, including at least one cabinet minister. But is it a crisis simply because the rules regulating parliament make life difficult for the government? A conflict between government and parliament is almost inevitable when, as with Brexit, the government cannot command a majority of votes in the Commons. But there is a deeper crisis within parliament itself. MPs have put the European Union (Withdrawal) Act on the statute book, which entails us leaving the EU on 29 March, in just eight days’ time.
MAR21	HS2 gives the game away: the plan for northern towns is managed decline	Yesterday, on the day a report from the New Economics Foundation comprehensively exposed the HS2 project as a London-boosting white elephant, I found myself writing this sitting in a station Wetherspoons because my train from Liverpool to Huddersfield had been cancelled. Last Saturday, I missed a talk for which I had tickets because my train to Manchester, again from Liverpool, was cancelled. On Monday, I was an hour late dropping my daughter at her grandma’s because our train – a Northern Pacer due for the knacker’s yard – broke down at the terminus. NEF’s report, which can be read as much as an utter indictment of a directionless, actively neglectful government as a cool-headed analysis of a single bad idea, exposes the fact that high-speed rail is unnecessary for everyone except London-based frequent travellers who dislike leaving the capital unless they can be there and back in half a day. The report demands a better service for northern commuters, the electrification of rail lines stuck in the mid-20th century, and the reopening of old branch lines to places lost to the car.
MAR21	May’s way, the highway or … a Brexit delay? The view from Europe	One thousand days since the referendum and nine to the UK’s formal departure date and the EU does not yet know how, when or even if the UK will leave the union. The mood in Brussels and national capitals remains focused, but there is growing impatience with Theresa May and her government. Even those member states that are traditionally friendly towards the UK have toughened their stance. The overwhelming view is that the ball remains firmly in London’s court and that it has to find a way through the turmoil. Today the union will be asked for an extension of article 50 by London. Seen against the backdrop of political and constitutional chaos in the UK, the request poses enormous dilemmas for Brussels. There is widespread concern that the Brexit virus will spread to infect the normal day-to-day business of the union – something that has been avoided up to now.
MAR21	The Paris of the rich is ablaze – and that image will define Macron	It’s become a kind of ritual: every Saturday evening, there are new images of thousands of gilets jaunes (yellow vests) in the streets of Paris and other French cities. Every week, protesters are injured by the police. Every week, commentators claim the movement is fading. And yet, the following weekend, the yellow wave washes over France again. The attendance numbers may fluctuate, but the anger remains. The 16 March protest was the most violent in weeks. Around 10,000 protesters marched in Paris. Shops on the Champs Elysées were looted, their windows broken. ATMs were smashed. Several newspaper kiosks were set ablaze, destroying the livelihood of their owners, an act as shocking as it is cruel – and stupid, especially for a movement that stands for better living and working conditions.
MAR21	Come on, UK weather forecasters – tell it like it is on climate change	They have a national reach that most climate campaigners would die for. They are familiar and respected experts on the science of meteorology. And they have prime-time slots at the end of almost every TV news bulletin, morning, noon and night. But the weather forecasters who guide everything from our clothing choices to our weekend plans seldom – if ever – mention the issue that is increasingly shaping our beloved British weather: climate change. This week, former BBC weatherman Bill Giles broke cover, and called for the BBC and other major broadcasters to overhaul their approach to forecasts, and add in information about the crucial context of climate change to their predictions about the daily weather.
MAR21	Online hate threatens us all. Platforms can and must do more to eradicate it	Like so many, I was shocked to the core by the recent killing of 50 Muslim worshippers in New Zealand. As I absorbed the news, my thoughts – for reasons I will shortly explain – turned to the technology that is so closely linked to the atrocity. And let me say this clearly: major platforms such as YouTube and Facebook are a primary and active component in the radicalisation of, mostly, young men. These organisations counter that they aim to take down content that violates their rules swiftly, and are increasing resources for efforts to identify and remove dangerous material before it causes harm. But clearly this isn’t enough. And by not doing enough to police their platforms, they risk being complicit in innocent lives being violently cut short. It is within their power to remove extremist content and users from their platforms, and they’re failing to do so in any meaningful way. Crucially, this is not caused by insurmountable technical problems.
MAR22	Brexit is not the cause of Britain’s political breakdown. It’s a symptom	The French EU minister, Nathalie Loiseau, has called her new cat Brexit. “He wakes me up every morning meowing to death because he wants to go out,” she says. “And then when I open the door he stays put, undecided, and then glares at me when I put him out.” The Dutch prime minister has compared Theresa May to the knight in Monty Python who has all his limbs lopped off and insists “It’s just a flesh wound” and calls it a draw. “She’s incredible,” says Mark Rutte. “She goes on and on. At the same time, I do not blame her but British politics.” Italian friends tell me Brexit now comes on at the end of the news, in that wacky slot just before the sport and weather. Everybody is laughing at us. Why wouldn’t they? We look ridiculous. If we weren’t so busy feeling betrayed, bored, enraged or bewildered, we’d be laughing at ourselves. Brexit, according to many of its advocates, would give us the chance to stand tall and independent again: to fulfil the potential, as May put it two years ago, to become “a great, global trading nation that is respected around the world and strong, confident and united at home”. Instead we look like a cross between a beggar and basket case. Yesterday, May pleaded for more time, and the EU said: only if you can get parliament to agree to your deal. May, displaying all the skills of brinkmanship and diplomacy that has got us to this point, then went and insulted parliamentarians, making them more hostile and fearful for themselves than ever.
MAR22	Apocalypse it is, then. Not now, but probably next week	Forced to summarise Theresa May’s Downing Street address to the nation last night, I’d go with: Prime Minister Kurtz … she mad. “They told me you had gone totally insane,” Martin Sheen says to Marlon Brando’s rogue colonel in Apocalypse Now, “that your methods were unsound.” “Are my methods unsound?” pants Colonel Kurtz. A pause. “I don’t see any method at all, sir.” Or as one minister put it of May: “No fucking plan, nothing.” “One day there will be a public inquiry,” another member of the government observed, “and she will be judged to have been unfit for office.” Meanwhile, in the most ambitious crossover event since Avengers: Infinity War, the CBI and the TUC have put out a joint plea to Theresa May to return to at least the same postcode as her senses.
MAR22	Cyclone Idai shows the deadly reality of climate change in Africa	As Africa climate week unfurls in Ghana, the countries of Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe count the costs of Cyclone Idai, which ripped through villages and towns, taking hundreds of lives and leaving a trail of destruction. For a continent already racked by the effects of the climate crisis, Idai is another chilling reminder of the destructive power of the kind of storms that will become more common as the world warms up.
MAR22	Being a gay Christian can be hurtful and gruelling. But I refuse to lose faith	I was at a comedy show in Soho recently, when my slightly too loud cackle attracted attention from the comedian. One thing led to another, and I ended up being teased affably about my love life as the audience laughed on. Once my excitement about having spoken to one of my favourite comedians – Mae Martin, if you’re curious – had died down, I realised something pretty significant had happened. I had said, “I have a girlfriend” in front of a room full of people without even thinking about it.
MAR22	Labour’s been mocked for calling for an election. Now it’s the only way out	We are being trolled by a prime minister who is prepared to drive a nation into the abyss to preserve the cohesion of the Conservative party. Like a partner who perennially hints at a romantic three-course meal and a possible popping of the question only to give you beans on toast, Theresa May served up another anticlimax with her national address. She provided no exit routes out of a building she has set alight, merely attacking a parliament she forced the electorate to vote for less than two years previously. It is the most basic statement of political reality to say that Britain’s national crisis has been manufactured by the Conservatives, but it’s one that needs repeating in a media environment rigged in favour of the right. A generation-long Tory power struggle and the disastrous attempts to navigate it by David Cameron and his successor have brought Britain to its knees. The narrative over the coming days will be that the onus is on Labour to accept May’s deal – a deal both remainers and leavers are united in judging to be terrible – or condemn Britain to no deal.
MAR22	Islamophobic attacks in the UK leave Muslims feeling increasingly anxious	Friday marks one week since the terrorist atrocity in New Zealand in which a 28-year-old Australian man published an online white supremacist “manifesto”, and then went into two mosques in Christchurch with multiple firearms, opening fire and killing 50 Muslims as they prayed. Nobody was spared from his Islamophobic massacre, not even children. One of the youngest casualties was three-year-old Mucad Ibrahim who was at the mosque with his family. One week on, the implications of those terrorist crimes in New Zealand are having a profound and deep impact on Muslim communities across the world, including here in the UK. Many of us are traumatised. Many of us feel horrified. We are devastated. We are broken and we are terrified.
MAR22	Too many rape and abuse victims are being let down by the police	The domestic abuse bill currently going through parliament is set to add new powers to deal with perpetrators of domestic abuse, but there are already a wide range of powers available to police that are simply not being used. In fact, the level of protection has declined dramatically over the past two years, since changes to the pre-charge bail regime in April 2017. These introduced onerous requirements on the police when bail is granted and it seems that officers are avoiding these by releasing suspects without bail and using voluntary interviews instead of arrest.
MAR22	We’re working like it’s 1975, but the UK jobs boom isn’t all it seems. Here’s why	Britain’s recent jobs record has been remarkable. The economy is chugging along but the last time the unemployment rate was as low as it is today was in the winter of 1974-75. Harold Wilson was prime minister, Derby County were on course to win the old first division, David Bowie was about to release Young Americans. Back then things were about to take a turn for the worse. Prices were rising fast, and later in 1975 inflation would hit a postwar peak of more than 25%. Unemployment also rose, leading to the coining of a new term – stagflation. In 1976, there was the mother and father of a sterling crisis that ended with spending cuts being imposed by the International Monetary Fund.
MAR22	The depressing truth about female creativity and the pram in the hallway	There are times in every parent’s life when, however much they try to avoid it, the professional and the domestic messily collide. It happened to me a few years ago when, during a teachers’ training day, I took my seven-year-old with me to interview Joan Collins over lunch. Collins was delighted at her presence and ordered her a giant bowl of ice-cream. However, halfway through the conversation, she suddenly looked startled, fumbled under the table for a bit, and then pulled out a sticky, pink-spattered Chanel shoe. “I do believe dear Lily has dropped ice-cream in my shoe,” she announced, looking a little pained. For the singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, this clash of the personal and professional has become a regular ritual as she fields questions about the practicalities of child rearing and how she makes it work. It was with palpable exasperation that she tweeted this week: “I love making music. I love promoting a new record. I do not love talking over and over about how I sort my childcare. I am a singer. I am a mum. I will sort the childcare.”
MAR22	Nine days from ‘Brexit day’, does anyone have a clue what’s happening?	Ask any country “what are you doing in nine days’ time?” and it would go something like this: Sweden? “Same old, same old.”
MAR23	Think no-deal Brexit has been taken off the table? Think again	The cliff-edge has moved a tiny bit further away, but it’s still there. Britain will not crash out of the European Union next Friday, thanks to a last act of clemency by the 27 nations we’re about to leave behind. But crashing out remains a possibility, even a likelihood. It might not be a deliberate choice made by the people of these islands, but rather an accident – the product of a series of decisions that were taken and, more often, not taken. Just as the imperial powers stumbled into a war no one wanted in 1914, so the risk remains that we will not jump off the cliff that looms ahead of us, but stumble over it. Of course, it’s still possible that Theresa May will bring back her deal, perhaps as soon as Monday; that MPs will vote for it and the UK will leave in a stable and orderly fashion on 22 May. But it hardly seems likely. There was a time, in the middle of this week, when you could imagine that happening. MPs were clearly spooked by the imminence of a no-deal crash-out in a matter of days, a prospect so terrifying that the leaders of the TUC and the CBI broke from all precedent to issue a joint warning of a “national emergency”, predicting that if there was no deal, “the shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come”. Previously hostile MPs talked of swallowing their objections and voting for May’s withdrawal agreement. But two things happened to halt that shift just as it was beginning.
MAR23	For Theresa May, ‘I’m a tin-eared lunatic’ seems to be the hardest word	Arriving at the EU summit this week, Theresa May had that purposeful air of a school superintendent walking up the drive to the Addams family mansion, determined that Wednesday and Pugsley should be enrolled in a conventional educational establishment without delay. Some long hours later, May staggered back down the drive much as that school superintendent might, short of having no shoes and an actual bat in her electrocuted hair. And so to the latest scenes in the Brexit farce. The formula for successful farce-writing, as laid down in the 19th century, is to get your character up a tree in the first act, throw stones at them in the second, then get them down in the third. As far as Brexit goes, the UK went up the tree voluntarily, and has now been throwing human waste at itself for two and a half years. Does anyone want to come and get us down? Sorry, it’s quite … disgusting up here now.
MAR23	How the media let malicious idiots take over	If our politics is becoming less rational, crueller and more divisive, this rule of public life is partly to blame: the more disgracefully you behave, the bigger the platform the media will give you. If you are caught lying, cheating, boasting or behaving like an idiot, you’ll be flooded with invitations to appear on current affairs programmes. If you play straight, don’t expect the phone to ring. In an age of 24-hour news, declining ratings and intense competition, the commodity in greatest demand is noise. Never mind the content, never mind the facts: all that now counts is impact. A loudmouthed buffoon, already the object of public outrage, is a far more bankable asset than someone who knows what they’re talking about. So the biggest platforms are populated by blusterers and braggarts. The media is the mirror in which we see ourselves. With every glance, our self-image subtly changes.
MAR23	It’s time for my Conservative party to root out Islamophobia for good	For better or worse, it’s in our nature to avoid difficult conversations. And no wonder: a tough conversation poorly held can hurt more than it heals. But avoidance only takes you so far. From my time as a youth worker I know that difficult conversations don’t become easier the longer you put them off. That’s why I know it’s time for Conservatives to have a proper conversation about Islamophobia. There is simply too much hate floating around online these days and too much of it is appearing (intentionally or not) under our banner. We must root it out, now.
MAR23	Parents are exploiting their children on YouTube for fame and easy money	When my twins were babies, I caught a short episode of them on video in which one leaned over and snatched the pacifier from the other one’s mouth and, for a second, I dreamed of putting it on YouTube and scoring one of those baby-does-hilarious-thing hits, in which the ad revenue rolls in while you sleep and you are rewarded simply for being alive. I didn’t upload the video in the end, for the same reason I didn’t do anything much in that period beyond running round my apartment in concentric circles, picking things up and then putting them down again. But the memory of that temptation – the gold-rush sense that there was easy money to be made if one could only capture a moment of “spontaneous” fun involving one’s children – remained, and like most gold rushes, its pull is a vortex.
MAR23	Mary Warnock embodied the best of Britain’s ruling class before Thatcher	In many ways Mary Warnock, whose death was announced on Thursday, represented the best of Britain’s ruling class as it was between the war and the rise of Margaret Thatcher. The kind of tough-minded, realistic and self-confident liberalism that she embodied was once a quality that foreigners admired in Britain. It was elitist and not particularly democratic: she and her husband rose to the very top of the Oxbridge system, he as vice-chancellor of Oxford University, she as the head of colleges in both universities. When I went to see her in her semi-retirement, in a village on the edge of Savernake Forest, Wiltshire, she was unashamed about collecting her attendance allowance from the House of Lords. She needed the money, she said, and she earned it – she did the work.
MAR23	It’s not too late to stop Brexit. Saturday’s march will force politicians to hear us	Last weekend Tim Shipman, the political editor of the Sunday Times, tweeted: “The urge to march for things and against things is one I have never understood. Why not write a letter instead?” He may have been referring to the start of the March to Leave, Nigel Farage’s much-derided venture that saw a handful of bedraggled Brexit supporters trudging through the rainswept and muddy countryside. But Shipman may also have been thinking about this Saturday’s Put it to the People March, which promises to be somewhat larger, as hundreds of thousands take to the streets of London to demand the final say on any Brexit deal.
MAR23	As someone with cystic fibrosis I’m not sure I want to see Five Feet Apart – but you should	The film Five Feet Apart was released in the UK today, but even as it reaches audiences it is dividing the cystic fibrosis community. The film is based on the fictional story of two teenagers with the illness. Because of the huge dangers of cross infection between cystic fibrosis patients, they are supposed to follow medical advice and stay six feet apart at all times. However, love gets in the way and they decide to take back control of their lives, their relationship and “just one foot”.
MAR23	Teaching assistants are invaluable to learning – so why are we being axed?	Next month I could lose my job. My 11 years as a teaching assistant could be coming to an end due to government cuts in education. Across the London borough of Hackney, where I work, 66 schools have had government cuts to per-pupil funding since 2015. Headteachers have been left with the unenviable task of cutting back on subjects and staff to balance the books. Often, teaching assistants are the first to go. Our role is to support pupils in the classroom through assisting teachers in the delivery of the national curriculum to all children. For some of us, this could involve working as a full classroom assistant, while for many it is the one-to-one or small group interventions that are considered of greatest need.
MAR23	Are we not all Lorraine Kelly, playing versions of ourselves?	These are testing times in the theatre of the self. A war is being fought over our identities. The most powerful technology in the world is modelling and predicting our behaviours so that they might more effectively be monetised. Some elemental human questions are suddenly in play again: am I what I say I am, or am I what others say I am? Is there such a thing as free will? Are “friends” electric? But we contemplate them in arenas designed for profit; we scream our frustration in emojis (a language designed by committee)! But cometh the hour, cometh the daytime TV presenter. Her name is Lorraine Kelly. Her name is also “Lorraine Kelly”. In Wednesday’s tribunal judgment, “Lorraine Kelly” set a worrying precedent for the future of celebrity taxation, but quite an interesting precedent in the meta-narrative of the human self. She has reserved the right to what John Updike termed Maskenfreiheit (mask-freedom). You see, the Lorraine Kelly you see on ITV isn’t Lorraine Kelly, but “Lorraine Kelly”, a fictional character who may resemble Lorraine Kelly in manner, appearance and infectious Glaswegian chuckle, but who isn’t the real Lorraine Kelly. Owing to a few peculiarities of tax law, that distinction might just have saved her £1.2m.
MAR24	One thing now unites Britons – a sense of national humiliation	The hundreds of thousands marching were patriots. Not patriots of the flag-waving, chest-beating type, but patriots determined to stop their fellow citizens suffering and a humiliated Britain being torn apart. “Traitors”, “saboteurs”, “citizens of nowhere”, “Remoaners”... The right has deployed the language of civil war for three years. The insults carried with them the threat that dissenters would be treated as enemies within, but also the promise and the hope that, left to its own devices, Brexit would restore Britain’s greatness.
MAR24	How will British museums survive if they subject every donor to an ethical audit?	Consumers of culture will have been aware of the name “Sackler” above the frame of rooms and galleries in artistic institutions around the world. I remember once briefly wondering, when ducking under such an arch, how they had made the money that permitted such extensive philanthropy. Now everyone knows. The photographer Nan Goldin has advertised demonstrations outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York and threatened to withdraw a planned exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London, in protest at the institutions receiving donations from the Sacklers.
MAR24	Ricky Gervais offers proof, if needed, that there is life after The Office	I kept walking in on my partner last week quietly crying over the laptop. Not, as might be reasonable to expect, because she is stuck in an infinite current affairs loop, never knowing when she might be freed from the horrors, but because she has been watching Ricky Gervais’s new sitcom, After Life, on Netflix. “You’re not allowed to watch it with me,” she said, pointedly closing the lid. “I’m enjoying it and you’ll ruin it. Go somewhere else.” Rude, I thought, and then said something about how the reviews hadn’t been very good anyway, which only proved her point. The reviews I read have not been particularly kind, it’s true, but already After Life seems to have reached Bohemian Rhapsody levels of division between what critics have made of it and what real-life viewers think. On a recent episode of Gogglebox, the families who do not usually agree on what they’re watching all collapsed into paroxysms of laughter at a gag about Gervais’s character, Tony, being called a “paedo”.
MAR24	Let’s stop pretending exercise is fun. Like work, you’ve just got to do it	Here’s a harsh truth about fitness that you don’t often hear – exercise sucks. For some of us anyway. I envy those people I see posting online about their completed half-marathons, with messianic zeal (“I feel so alive!”). For people like myself, there’s no redemptive “endorphin rush”. Exercising is just a repetitive bore to be dreaded and endured. If a Slendertone-thingy machine actually did the same job with electronic pads, as I sprawled on the sofa watching Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club, I’d sell my children’s kidneys to buy it. Worst of all, tedious though it is, for most, exercise is beyond beneficial, it’s vital – health, wellbeing, weight, the lot – so we slackers just have to park our bad attitudes and crack on. There’s a giant con at the heart of exercise – that is, a lot of effort goes into hard-selling it as “FUN!”, when, for many people, it frankly isn’t. Right now, there’s a backlash against enterTRAINment (see what they did there), where people are enticed into “boutique gyms” to do classes that are new, trendy, fusion-themed – high-intensity hula-hooping or whatever. One argument is that, in this climate, anything that gets people into gyms is great, but others think that people would be better off with low-key targeted workouts. All very interesting, but maybe it’s fundamentally counterproductive to keep pushing this idea that exercise per se is supposed to be fun. Why not just tell people the truth: it’s a relentless boring nightmare and you’re going to have to do it anyway.
MAR24	Does Britain really want an isolated future, buffeted by forces beyond our control?	Leave our shores and Brexit appears even more hopelessly strange – and the people perpetrating it even more peculiar – than they do when you are at home. In Asia, where I have spent the past week, figures such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg are seen as curiosities with views that are openly risible. Of course it’s stupid to leave the world’s biggest trading bloc and make your now lonely future dependent upon the kindness of unforgiving strangers. Can’t they see that? No country has ever done what Britain is attempting because it is so obviously crazed. Trade agreements are a carefully balanced mutual opening of partners’ markets with a hard-to-work-through calculus of gains and losses that takes years – even decades – to negotiate. Brexiters promised that Britain would be different and that unravelling a 45-year-old web of deep relationships would be quick and effortless, with Britain “holding all the cards”. All palpably false.
MAR24	Silencing Islamophobes is as futile a response as banning the Qur’an	What drove Brenton Tarrant, the Christchurch gunman, to commit his heinous acts? It’s a question that has, understandably, occupied much media space . A key debate has been over the role of anti-Muslim hatred and its entrenchment in mainstream society. In an open letter, Britain’s counter-terror chief, Neil Basu, called out the mainstream media for the “messaging” that fuels far-right terrorists. It’s a theme echoed by many on the left.
MAR24	Theresa May has failed to offer sound leadership in this toxic Brexit phase	How has it come to this? Theresa May and her husband, Philip, have long been friends of mine and I have in the past admired her sense of duty and commitment to her party and her country. So it grieves me that her stubborn choices have left both in peril. At a time when our politics needs statesmanship, not brinkmanship, when our divided people need time to heal and come back together, and when our country needs honest leadership rooted in reality not ideology, Mrs May has embraced division. Rather than providing the calm, compassionate and unifying leadership we so desperately needed after a divisive EU referendum campaign, she rushed to own Brexit. She has clung to power in the process, but she is letting us all down.
MAR24	To look on the bright side of life, Britain should copy Finland	How can we be more Finnish? Last week, the World Happiness Report found that the Finns are officially the world’s happiest people for the second year running. Meanwhile, the UK has – improbably perhaps – risen five places, from 19th to 15th, while the US has dropped one place down to 19th. Those in South Sudan, unsurprisingly after years of intense civil war, are the unhappiest of all. The report ranks countries on six variables that support wellbeing: income and GDP per capita; freedom to make life choices; trust in government and perceptions of corruption; healthy life expectancy; social support and generosity. The top 10 countries, which this year also included Denmark, Norway, Iceland and the Netherlands, rank high in all six.
MAR24	‘For the few, not the many’ still drives Scotland’s schools system	In Scotland, the new middle-class rites of spring are upon us. They may not yet carry the resonance of Glyndebourne, Henley or Royal Ascot but the social and economic implications for thousands of families are quite profound. This is when Scotland’s state school league tables are published and when families begin to inspect university prospectuses and neighbourhood maths tutors start browsing the BMW and Mercedes catalogues. Actually, to describe the state school performance data as “league tables” isn’t quite accurate. Holyrood deliberately avoids arranging this data in a league table format because to do so would be simplistic, entirely subjective and fail to offer a wider picture of a school’s performance beyond bald academic numbers. It’s left to newspapers to arrange them in league table format based on the numbers of pupils from each school gaining A-passes. Thus, we get to see some depressingly familiar patterns emerge: schools in affluent neighbourhoods figure heavily in the top 20 while those in our disadvantaged communities are gathered near the foot.
MAR24	May I have a word about... the many multiple sins against English	For some people, it’s the little things that truly offend; sins against the English language that cause them to believe that the whole glorious edifice is crumbling. One of my colleagues is roused to volcanic harrumphing by the use of the word “multiple”. He might like to avert his gaze now. “Exercise program provides multiple benefits to nursing home residents”; “multiple churches burglarized in Back of the Yards: police”; “Sussex TK Maxx thefts – man charged with offences at multiple stores”; “Multiple animals killed in South Jersey barn fire”.
MAR25	Brexit: what’s the least worst outcome of this week? Our panel discusses	Stalemate, impasse, roadblock was the ineluctable result of a crude in/out referendum dangling a dozen Brexit rainbows. No one true Brexit was ever put to voters. The closest to a healing compromise now is the well-constructed Kyle-Wilson amendment: let parliament agree a Brexit, but only if voters confirm their support. Put it to the people, as pressed by the million marchers, not a “second referendum” but a new proposition on an actual Brexit seen in the cold light of day: is this what you meant? This week a series of indicative votes may find a parliamentary majority for something else – customs union, Norway or indeed the prime minister’s miserable offering. Polls show that people have changed their mind quite radically: an 8-10 percentage point lead for remain. Perversely, Theresa May insists scores of MPs should make a U-turn – but refuses voters any right to a change of heart.
MAR25	No collusion, plenty of corruption: Trump is not in the clear	Suspend your disbelief for a second. Assume that the Trump administration – which lies so easily and so often on matters big and small – can tell the truth about the Mueller investigation. Forget the cover-up about separating families at the border and jailing children. Pretend it has fully embraced the death toll of more than 3,000 Americans in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Imagine Trump’s inauguration crowds really were exceptionally large.
MAR25	The global battle for the internet is just starting	If only for a moment, set aside the comparatively parochial drama of Brexit, think about the giant swath of humanity that now uses the internet, and consider one of the most basic facets of how 4 billion of us live our lives. This is a 21st-century story, but it will ring bells with people old enough to remember the cold war: how people understand their own experience and events in the wider world is increasingly decided by the version of the internet they use. On one side sits the system used in China, which produces vast amounts of personal data and blurs into a huge apparatus of state surveillance and censorship. This model is centred on two online behemoths, whose dominance partly comes down to the fact that Chinese consumerism is all about paying via your smartphone, rather than an old-fashioned plastic card. There’s the e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba, and Tencent, which owns WeChat, the platform used by more than 1 billion people every day. It does so many things – payments, social networking, messaging, travel booking, gaming – that participating in society without it seems all but impossible.
MAR25	May’s time is up. She must make way for a caretaker prime minister	There is an unforgettable moment in Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip that comes unexpectedly to mind in these strange and desperate times for our country. In it, the comedian recalls an encounter with his close friend, the legendary NFL running back Jim Brown. Pryor is in a wretched mess, confined to his room, freebasing cocaine with a pipe that he imagines is whispering to him. Brown is unimpressed. He simply asks: “What you gonna do?” Again. And again. And again. In March 2019, the UK is Pryor – strung out, in this case, on Brexit – and the rest of the world is Jim Brown. Everyone can see that this is a country on the edge of nervous collapse.
MAR25	Can we all chill out about cannabis? Not quite yet	Occasionally during my love affair with marijuana I would experience perceptual disruptions profound enough to freak me out. One time I was driving along a crowded road when my car seemed a little wobbly and then listed towards the centre, an alarming thud-thud emanating from the back end. In the middle of a densely populated spot without a hard shoulder, I crept slowly across a few lanes of traffic and pulled to a stop. Concentrating very hard, I got out of the car to assess and hopefully change the flat tyre. I rarely got paranoid from smoking weed; neither did it typically make me sleepy. Instead, I was among the lucky ones, as the drug made everyday activities such as gardening, waiting on tables and talking to my family bearable if not interesting. So I was shocked and embarrassed to find, after a few minutes of close inspection amid the honking horns, that there was nothing wrong with the car. At the time I took hallucinations as evidence of a good score. Now, as an ex-smoker and neuroscientist whose focus is addictive drugs, I know that my resilient response to this stressful experience was contingent on having a neurotypical brain. Neural pathways are forged by finely orchestrated signals for synapse growth and pruning; disruptions can result in atypical neural connections that increase the risk of psychosis. The liability may be unmasked by environmental conditions that can essentially be reduced to an ambiguous but well-recognised bogeyman: stress.
MAR25	One thing now unites Britons – a sense of national humiliation	The hundreds of thousands marching were patriots. Not patriots of the flag-waving, chest-beating type, but patriots determined to stop their fellow citizens suffering and a humiliated Britain being torn apart. “Traitors”, “saboteurs”, “citizens of nowhere”, “Remoaners”... The right has deployed the language of civil war for three years. The insults carried with them the threat that dissenters would be treated as enemies within, but also the promise and the hope that, left to its own devices, Brexit would restore Britain’s greatness.
MAR25	How to report terrorism: name, but don’t amplify	In one of several impressive acts of leadership, New Zealand’s parliament opened last Tuesday with the Speaker inviting an imam to lead prayers, first in Arabic then English. In Hansard the last of these “verses of patience” reads: “Oh Lord, we ask you to protect New Zealand and the whole world from such calamities. Amen.” Would we be better protected if journalists followed the urging of New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern and did not name the perpetrators of acts of terrorism? We can acknowledge her skilful and empathetic response to the shooting of scores of people at two Christchurch mosques on 15 March. We can recognise that Ardern’s purpose as prime minister was rightly to turn the focus on those lost and mourned. But is she correct in implying that acts of terror will be deterred if no one speaks the names of perpetrators? Can, should, notoriety – as distinct from glorification or anti-hero status – be denied?
MAR25	MPs must seize control of the Brexit calamity. Mrs May has already lost it	A symbolic casualty of Britain’s rolling, roiling Brexit debacle is the “commemorative” 50p coin bearing the date 29 March 2019, which the government had planned to release. It was one of their more idiotic ideas to put such an item in the nation’s pockets and purses when the country is so divided and its destiny is swirled with such a dense fog of uncertainty. The coin is now as redundant as the prime minister who signed off on it. Britain won’t be leaving the EU to the deadline that Theresa May has held so sacred that she swore she would not be deflected from it on more than 100 occasions. Her inability to meet her own date is one illustration of the failure of her broken Brexit strategy. Another is the heel-stamping manner in which she responded to this latest episode in her thick volume of humiliations. Shortly before she went to Brussels to seek a postponement to Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the prime minister had a temper tantrum that was no prettier for being dressed up as a televised address to the nation. The inflammatory speech from Number 10, in which she sought to rouse voters against parliament by displacing the blame on to MPs, was thought “appalling” by her own chief whip. Other cabinet colleagues condemned it in much riper language.
MAR25	Christchurch attacks: the media's rush to be first causes its own kind of harm	Rookie journalists struggling with their copy are often told by news editors: “Just tell the story”. An esteemed colleague once told me his first editor told him to imagine shouting the intro to an aged relative moving away at speed on a bus. Boiling an event down to who, what, why, where and when is the basis of all news coverage for a reason – it tells the story. But what happens when being fast and crafting a simple narrative becomes misleading or causes its own kind of harm?
MAR25	Public intellectuals have never been more vital. Let Mary Warnock be a guide	A couple of years ago, the death of a public intellectual, such as the philosopher Mary Warnock, who died on Thursday, would be marked by reflections on whether we have seen the death of the public intellectual as a phenomenon. In 2019, when an academic psychologist can do sell-out lecture tours off the back of YouTube success, there’s less reason to believe that the public is repulsed by big ideas, unfussily presented. Unfortunately, that psychologist is Jordan Peterson and his “big ideas” are a mush of homily and conservatism, making it tempting to wish that public intellectuals really weren’t a thing any more.
MAR26	The Tories are no longer a party, and Theresa May must know that	Just another day in Brexit deadlock, as the prime minister rose to address the parliament she had so brutishly insulted with her demagogic “I am on your side” attempt to speak to “the people” over MPs’ heads. No apology, but she came to admit that her deal was in the quicksands, sinking fast, and she dared not bring it back for another trouncing. She is where she put herself, disgracefully in hock to the bigots and bullies of the Democratic Unionist party, who act against the will of remain-majority Northern Irish voters. Jeremy Corbyn was polite to call this “a national embarrassment”: this is far, far worse than a few blushes. For parliament to seize control would, May wrongly claimed, set a dangerous precedent
MAR26	With millions on the streets or signed up, remainers cannot be ignored	The anti-Brexit rally on Saturday was probably the first central London demonstration in living memory that Jeremy Corbyn hasn’t attended – except for the last People’s Vote march, of course. Instead he was on a campaign visit to Morecambe. There was deliberation to all this; in a childishly provocative tweet, the Labour party chirpily asked last Friday: “Big weekend plans? Find an event near you.” In bitter spirits, I put in my postcode (Vauxhall, central London), and was invited to #rebuildbritain by attending a meeting in Swanley (15 miles away in Kent), on the day of the largest demonstration since Iraq. Corbyn’s motivation, in this steadfast abstinence from a swell of protest at which he should naturally be at the crest, is always put down to his Euroscepticism, which has morphed among commentators from “he’s not too keen on Europe” to “he hates Europe”. This is overstatement and a diversion; what’s really happened is that a strategy devised for 2017 has failed to update.
MAR26	Theresa May is effectively gone. She is a leader in name only	Brexit is the biggest peacetime crisis we have faced and a no-deal Brexit could provoke a national emergency. The depth and scale of the divisions and the narrowness of the majority in favour of leaving the EU mean that the most sensible step would be to put the issue on hold, complete the negotiations and then hold a referendum. Sadly, that option is not available. But it is in the next phase of negotiations that the details of the UK’s future relationship with the EU will be fleshed out. Depending on what happens in those negotiations, either we will see virtually no change to our current status – in which case, what is the point of leaving? Or, as is much more likely, the Brexiteers will demand significant changes to reflect their own views – views that will appal and frighten much of the electorate when they realise the enormity of what is being done. In essence, Brexiteers want to dismantle much of what we regard as the underpinning of civilised life in the modern world.
MAR26	Thank EU for the music – not the grasping tech giants	Shakespeare writes about a man, who “sold his goodly manor for a song”. The way I read it, the Bard implies that “a song” would be worth very little, if not to himself, at least to the people in his audience. A song is such a weightless, elusive phenomenon. How can anyone put a value on that? Ever since Shakespeare’s day, “for a song” has been an idiom that represents something you get very cheaply. The YouTubes of this world know this, and they’d like to keep it that way. They say thank you for the music and make millions off songs we all love and cherish while the writer gets a pittance.
MAR26	Women’s lib freed us from domestic drudgery – so what’s with today’s competitive cleaning?	The world is a mess. Pollution and all that eco-jazz. Your body is also a mess, full of toxins that need cleansing. Your skin is ungodly and needs a good hot-cloth treatment and expensive cream. And your house? Well, it’s an absolute tip. Foxes have eaten my recycling, so rubbish is strewn all over the road. A card was popped through my door offering to steam my carpets, a treatment that seemed more expensive than buying some new carpets. The last man who cleaned my windows disappeared after a complicated divorce and, quite frankly, I can’t be bothered any more.
MAR26	Jacob, Boris and the so-called coup – what really happened at Chequers?	On Sunday, in a sit-down meal probably a shade more horrific but less cerebral than that scene in Hannibal when a corrupt official is served a slice of his own brain to eat, Theresa May invited some of her cabinet to Chequers for Sunday lunch. The guest list, I’m sorry, was just a roll call of those now familiar basic white-boy names: David Davis, David Lidington, Damian Green, Dominic Raab, Steve Baker, Steve Barclay. Michael Gove, Alistair Burt and Boris Johnson were also invited, as were those excess-syllabic numpties Jacob Rees-Mogg and Iain Duncan Smith: so awful they named them both three times. I am not sure if there was a specific dress code, but you were not allowed to come if you were not an older white man (collectively known as a blizzard).
MAR26	Brexit: what’s the least worst outcome of this week? Our panel responds	Stalemate, impasse, roadblock was the ineluctable result of a crude in/out referendum dangling a dozen Brexit rainbows. No one true Brexit was ever put to voters.

MAR27	Get set for Brexit: Indicative Day – the one where the Grand Wizards turn on each other	Draw near, true believers, for these are dark days for the ERG Brexit ultras. The Fellowship of the Ringpieces finds itself divided on their next move, and may yet be bitterly sundered as they ponder the big question: could they honestly have played it worse? Before we help them answer it, a quick update on which bit of Blunderland we’ve tumbled into now. Late on Monday night, the House of Commons voted to take control of the parliamentary agenda and attempt to break the Brexit deadlock via a series of indicative votes masterminded by former Tory minister Oliver Letwin. A clue, a clue! Our kingdom for a clue! Like all initiatives handled by Oliver Letwin since the 1980s, it promises to go spectacularly wrong in ways we haven’t even thought of yet, but let’s pretend otherwise before the shitstorm gets properly under way on Wednesday.
MAR27	Playgrounds only for the rich kids? What grotesque social apartheid	One playground for the children of the rich, another for the poor. It’s hard to think of an idea more crassly offensive than a supposedly mixed housing development where even toddlers are deliberately segregated by their parents’ salaries; where small children have to be told they can’t play with their friends on the swings their flats actually overlook, because that’s not for the likes of them. But that is what appears to have happened at the Baylis Old School development in south London, where an impenetrable hedge separates the owner-occupiers’ children’s playground from the social and affordable rented housing in the same block.
MAR27	Jamie Dimon, spare us your crocodile tears about inequality	If I may be so bold as to try to lure your attention away from Trump and Mueller for a moment, consider Jamie Dimon’s lament, delivered a few days before Mueller delivered his report. Dimon is the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, and wrongdoing by him and the CEOs of other big corporations is more responsible for Trump’s election than anything Russia dreamed of, as I’ll explain.
MAR27	Don’t knock the humble vox pop. It’s a vital tool of journalism	A lot of people, it seems, are sick of vox pops. With British politics becoming ever more bitterly dysfunctional, debate becoming more polarised and the media less trusted, the humble vox pop has become a symbol of what has gone wrong with the way we talk politics. The comedian David Baddiel complains that those chosen to give their views are always from “a leave constituency. Because that’s where people will be crossest”. His fellow comedian and broadcaster Danny Baker agrees, suggesting that the media crews always go to “cliched haunts” where they think they can find “real” people. The political scientist Rob Ford says the people and places are “picked according to the stereotypes”, and “usually just confirm the biases of said narratives”.
MAR27	You can give all your money away, but it won’t solve poverty	Globally, income inequality is rising. Poverty remains a very real and very visible, ill in most of the world. It is humbling, then, to hear of Peter Tabichi, a science teacher from rural Kenya, who has won the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher prize for donating 80% of his annual salary to charitable causes, primarily in supporting the poorest pupils at his school to buy necessities such as uniforms and books. It’s undoubtedly a generous act, and almost certainly one born of noble ideals. Whether you’re religious or not, Tabichi is a good example of the ideology espoused by Franciscan orders. There is a strong tradition in Franciscan thought of social entrepreneurship, and of taking steps to alleviate poverty collectively. It’s a rare thing to see in practice, though, and there are many religious people, of all faiths, who don’t feel such an imperative to support philanthropic causes.
MAR27	Don't say Trump is exonerated. It's too soon for that	To listen to the Trump administration right now, you would think that Robert Mueller has exonerated the president, found Hillary Clinton and the liberal media guilty of treason, and definitively proven once and for all that Donald Trump’s inauguration crowd really was the largest in world history. Indeed, the initial rollout of Mueller’s conclusions has been a public relations triumph for the president, mainly because it was in the hands of Trump’s hand-picked attorney general, William Barr. In the four-page letter which Barr delivered to Congress, less than 100 words are quoted directly from Mueller’s report. But while these words certainly tell us something, they hide much more than they reveal. And Barr’s decision to exonerate Trump on the charge of obstruction of justice – something Mueller himself declined to do – likewise raises a suite of questions about his reasoning and motives.
MAR27	Michael Jackson’s life showed us the journey from abused to abuser	Jimmy Savile. Harvey Weinstein. R Kelly. Kevin Spacey. We are not exactly short these days of celebrities accused of exploiting their fame to mask predatory behaviour. Yet the Michael Jackson case is different. And that’s not just because he is, still, so passionately defended by some – including, most recently, Barbra Streisand and Diana Ross – while he also, simultaneously, did so little to mask his predatoriness. In his lifetime, he talked happily about sharing his bed with little boys, and was rarely photographed more than six feet away from one, even after he was publicly accused – four times – of child sexual abuse (by Jordy Chandler, Gavin Arvizo and two boys who accused him of molestation during the Arvizo trial, both of whom received financial payouts). But with every other high-profile story of child abuse, the adult predator is presented solely as just that: an adult predator, a fully formed, inexplicable monster.
MAR27	Is it too soon, too unsettling, for pro-IRA chants to be trivialised?	When does “Up the RA” not mean “Up the RA”? When the England footballer, Declan Rice, who played for the Republic of Ireland before switching allegiance, apologised for using the pro-IRA slogan on a recently unearthed social media post he made as a 16-year-old it added to a strange momentum the aesthetics of Irish republicanism are gaining as they are repurposed by a new generation. The website Vice recently published an article headlined, “How militant Irish republican slogans went viral”, and they are on to something. The appropriating of slogans and imagery that were once dangerous is happening, and it is happening among a generation that lacks a memory of the peak of the Troubles, simply because they hadn’t been born. In 2019, “Up the RA” is layered and esoteric. For some, it’s mindlessly chanted without any context, bar a sense of misplaced patriotism and ignorance. For others, it’s subversive and transgressive; playing with a taboo with the safe benefit of distance. For yet others it is the trivialising of the slogan to the point of undermining the perceived power of the IRA itself – its authority is so depleted that it’s now a joke, and only the slogan remains as punctuation. Or, it’s just a dumb meme.
MAR27	After Mueller, the need for oversight of Trump is as urgent as ever	The Mueller report is finished and Donald Trump was found not to have colluded with Russians during the presidential election in 2016. And Trump, based on his attorney general’s four-page summary, was quick to declare victory. “Complete and total EXONERATION,” he boasted. Once again, Trump misled America.
MAR27	Wales is right to ban smacking. But it’s not the whole solution	When you’ve been awake since dawn, you haven’t spoken to another adult for six hours, you’re having your first period in two years and your baby is refusing to go to sleep despite having been awake since 4.22am, there is a very fine line between playfully flicking bits of sheepskin out of your child’s hand before they eat it, and just hitting your child. I know, because a few months ago I found myself alone, in a park, bathed in golden springtime sunshine, genuinely worried that I was about to hit my son. This was not some theoretical musing about the nature of “reasonable force” but the frayed-nerve feeling of a parent reaching the very end of their ability to cope. Had I grown up in an environment where smacking had been part of my family’s emotional language, if I’d been smacked as a child and lived to tell the tale, if slapping, smacking, pinching or hitting children had been considered normal during my childhood, then I might very well have smacked my own child that day. Luckily, very luckily, I was able to walk into a nearby children’s centre, plonk him by a miniature sandpit full of plastic dinosaurs, watch him wave cheerfully to the play worker laying out a rainbow of jumbo felt tip pens, walk into the corner, out of sight, and let out all the fury and fatigue that had been welling up inside me all day in one huge sigh.
MAR28	People’s vote is still alive after a day of Brexit drama falls flat	This was supposed to be the day the House of Commons dramatically wrested control from the government. In the end, it turned out to be a bit of a damp squib. None of the eight options MPs were voting on managed to garner a majority. The real fireworks of the evening happened away from the chamber, at a meeting of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, where the deputy chair, Steve Baker, reportedly said of parliament: “I could tear this place down and bulldoze it into the river.”
MAR28	May’s exit won’t halt Britain’s slow drift into a kind of Brexit civil war	Be clear which of the current crises in British politics matters more in the long term. This isn’t easy right now, when the prospect of a Conservative leadership contest inevitably triggers a Tory party and media frenzy. Nevertheless, Brexit is the root of the matter. That fact didn’t change after Theresa May addressed the 1922 Committee tonight, and it isn’t going to go away. The Tory succession battle is ephemeral by comparison. It has long been obvious that May would not see the year out in Downing Street. Her announcement merely restated this more plainly, and without giving a date for her departure. The leadership battle later this summer is a direct consequence of the unresolved Brexit crisis that May has created over the past three years – but it is not in any way the solution to it.
MAR28	Farewell to the worst prime minister bar none – until the next one	Theresa May will leave office in an “orderly handover” whenever an EU withdrawal deal is done. No one is weeping. The oddity is: we may yet come to miss her, though she has been the worst prime minister of our political lifetimes – bar none. Yet there was one great good purpose in her premiership: by occupying the space, however vacuously, she kept out the barbarian hordes of Brexiteers barging one another out of the way to seize her throne. Now she has surrendered that one useful role, leaving the country to the untender mercies of those competing in Europhobia for the votes of some 120,000 dwindling Tory party members. To use her deathless phrase, nothing will be changed by her departure. Parliament will be as gridlocked as ever, the combat deadlier with an avowed Brextremist at the helm.
MAR28	To kiss or not to kiss the pope’s ring? He needs to make it clear	There are some very odd videos of the Pope online (see this one, in which he responds with anger when some overexcited Mexican pilgrims pull him into the crowd. But his latest weird, gone-viral video shows Francis pulling his hand away as a long line of Italian worshippers try to kiss his ring after a religious service earlier this week in the town of Loreto. Apparently, he doesn’t want to lord it over his flock in a way reminiscent of emperors and absolute monarchs of yore: but in that case, why hasn’t he simply made an announcement to the effect that ring-kissers aren’t welcome, and that he doesn’t want that kind of no-holds-barred adulation, which seems to belong to another century (and, like so much of what’s outdated at the Vatican, not even the last one). He has, after all, been pope for six years now: long enough, one might have thought, to lay down some guidelines about how he expects to be treated.
MAR28	How Britain got it so wrong on Brexit	Years of negotiations with the EU lie ahead for Britain whichever of the options we choose. Only revoking article 50, an option dismissed by the prime minister, despite more than 5 million signatures on the petition to the government, would spare us. If the UK goes over the cliff edge on 12 April, British officials will be back in Brussels within days pleading for talks to limit the damage. Even surprise approval of the withdrawal agreement would raise the curtain on lengthy negotiations on future relations with the EU. The divorce settlement is a beginning not an end. Canada required nine years to negotiate and implement a straightforward free trade agreement with the EU. Switzerland, proudly independent, outside the EU and the European Economic Area, had to negotiate more than 100 bilateral agreements with the EU to ensure frictionless trade and other essential interactions.
MAR28	Stop and search in schools would be a terrible indictment of society	Conservative MP Robert Halfon’s suggestion that stop and search procedures are used in schools raises questions not only about the statutory responsibilities of schools and colleges (and their limits) but also about the role of education in a much broader context. The chair of the education select committee’s remarks follows hot on the heels of a recent Ofsted report researching knife crime in education. It has been widely acknowledged that the roots of youth violence are complex and varied, and the solutions must be equally far-reaching and multilayered. Education does have a role to play in addressing some causal factors that lead young people into harmful behaviours and in preventing those already at risk from further harm, either to themselves or others. One element of this is, indeed, to build relationships with the police and to work collaboratively to ensure that when stop and search procedures are necessary in public spaces, they are conducted in ways that are safe and non-confrontational.
MAR28	I worked for Waterstones for 11 years – low pay has long been an issue	When I saw the staff petition for Waterstones to become a living wage employer earlier this week – along with the open letter supporting it, signed by numerous authors of note – my first thought was, why hasn’t anyone done this before? I worked for Waterstones for more than a decade, and the issue of low pay for shopfloor staff is by no means a new one within the company. Managing director James Daunt’s dismissive response in the Guardian on Tuesday is one that will be familiar to every Waterstones bookseller, both current and former; full of distant promises and regretful rationalisations. I started with Waterstones as a bookseller in 2006, and over the next 11 years worked in seven different branches, taking on a range of positions. I was a supervisor, trainer, healthy and safety auditor, and, by the time I left in 2017, I was running goods in operations at one of the company’s largest stores. In his response to the living wage petition, Daunt made mention of rewarding employees with a “stimulating job”, and while I can certainly say that the variety of roles kept my work interesting, there was always one constant: low pay. When I finally left the company in 2017 after a lengthy period of service, I was doing a job that left me utterly exhausted at the end of every work day, and earning roughly 60p an hour more than the minimum wage.
MAR28	Amoral and venal: Britain’s governing class has lost all sense of duty	Even as doodlebugs smashed into the surrounding streets, George Orwell consoled himself with this thought: “One thing that has always shown that the English ruling class are morally fairly sound, is that in time of war they are ready enough to get themselves killed.” Present those who governed us with an existential crisis, he argued in his essay England Your England, and they would do what they believed to be right for the country. Almost eight decades later, the UK stands on the verge of a calamity as great as any since the war. Whatever the protestations in parliament, we could within days crash-land into a world of medicine shortages and food riots. And where are our political classes? According to the lobby correspondents, Monday’s cabinet meeting was spent war-gaming general election strategies and thinking how to timetable voting so as to “scare” Labour. Wherever the national interest actually featured, it was buried under a thick dollop of party interest. 
MAR28	Hats off to Nan Goldin for calling out UK arts institutions on the Sacklers	Opioid addicts die in horrific pain. Their breathing slows, their lungs fill with fluid. They die vomiting. You won’t see that on a plaque in the V&A. What you will see is the Sackler Centre. It is a name visible in rooms, courtyards and even escalators at our most esteemed art institutions. But last week, the National Portrait Gallery bowed to pressure and said that it will not accept a £1m grant from the Sackler family, a billionaire branch of which owns the pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma, the producers of OxyContin, a painkiller that has been implicated in the opioid crisis. The Tate Group followed suit several days later. Then, on Monday, the Sackler Trust announced that it would be halting all new donations as the controversy was proving a “distraction” for institutions (they say they vigorously deny allegations of having helped fuel the crisis).
MAR28	The answer to climate breakdown and austerity? A green new deal	Faced with unprecedented challenges, politicians appear more divided than ever – that’s why Labour’s Clive Lewis and I are doing something bold. We are jointly tabling a bill in parliament designed to address two of the greatest threats we face – climate breakdown and spiralling inequality. Our bill would introduce a “green new deal” – an unprecedented mobilisation of resources invested to prevent climate breakdown, reverse inequality, and heal our communities. It demands major structural changes in our approach to the ecosystem, coupled with a radical transformation of the finance sector and the economy, to deliver both social justice and a livable planet. It’s an idea congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has recently reinvigorated in the US. And it could scarcely be more urgent. The UN’s top scientists have warned we have just 11 years to halve global emissions and avoid climate catastrophe. Global wildlife populations have collapsed by nearly 60% in our lifetimes. This has led 1.4 million young people to join the inspiring global school strikes movement to demand change. The response from ministers? To continue to force fracking on local communities, and to hand millions in tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry. Last week, unbelievably, a new coal mine was given a green-light on their watch.
MAR29	We’re led by a party not fit for power in a system not fit for purpose	A few days before the 2015 general election, the prime minister, David Cameron, tweeted: “Britain faces an inescapable choice – strong and stable government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” Cameron won (the first general election the Tories have won outright since 1992), followed through on his pledge to hold a referendum on staying in the European Union, promised not to resign if he lost, lost and then resigned as chaos ensued. Theresa May took over after all other challengers either fell on their swords, stabbed each other in the back, or put their foot in their mouths. It is as good a time as any to recall that, of all the jokers and hucksters standing for the Conservative party leadership, she was probably the best candidate. It really could have been worse. It could have been Andrea Leadsom.
MAR29	What the withdrawal agreement ‘separation’ actually means for Brexit	So we now know that the third attempt at the meaningful vote will not take place this week. In its place, the government will instead hold a vote on the divorce deal only – the withdrawal agreement – setting aside the future partnership for now. This is a desperate attempt to meet the European council’s conditions for offering an extension to 22 May. If the withdrawal agreement does not pass this week, the UK will almost certainly be required to participate in European parliament elections as a condition of an extension beyond 12 April. Passing the withdrawal agreement without the political declaration would meet the conditions of the European council for the extension, but would not satisfy the domestic ratification requirements which would require a further act of parliament.
MAR29	Spartans don’t hug it out. Except for Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker	Since it’s rather difficult to know where to start on what happened on Wednesday, let’s begin in the future. I want to assure you that when the apocalypse has come, and you’re living in the bombed-out remnants of civilisation, clad in rags and distilling drinking water from your own urine, the one crackling radio in your resistance bunker will still be bringing news of Conservative party leadership contests. Even as your crew crawl over ghost cities, scavenging electronic equipment that some androgynous teenage savant is going to solder together to see if you can discover if there are Others Like You, you’ll be doing it to a soundtrack of the last radio announcer going: “Aaannnnd … Liam Fox has indicated he will not put his name forward for the next round of balloting. He will instead transfer his votes, so that whichever self-interested timebomb wins will make him minister of food spores.” Still, back to the present day, where it’s arguably not all good news. On Wednesday evening, Theresa May offered Tory MPs her pending resignation if her deal was passed, but the DUP trophy brides she spent a billion quid on have still declined to back it. Thus the prime minister crosses into the realm of philosophical paradox: she is too weak to resign. May has now surpassed C Montgomery Burns as Earth’s puniest big-hitter. Meanwhile, the Tories launch another competition to see who will be the next one of them to have their prime ministerial career curtailed by the issue of Europe.
MAR29	Why do councils encourage profiteering from homelessness?	Early last year, I was working for the homelessness department of a London council when a woman approached me for assistance. The excited chatter of her two young children was at odds with the confusion and worry etched across her face. She told me how her landlord had issued her an eviction notice but, bewilderingly, he didn’t actually want to evict her. Instead he’d told her to, “go to the council, get them to pay me the incentive and you can stay”. Landlord incentives are essentially a bribe councils pay private landlords to persuade them to house homeless families or individuals. They are used to either keep tenants at risk of being homeless in their current property, or help ease the process of finding a new place to live. This practice is widely known of within the housing sector, yet is almost unheard of elsewhere. So I sent freedom of information requests to every local council in London to find out how prevalent the practice was. The results, as reported in the Guardian, are staggering. Between them, London councils spent more than £14m of public money on landlord incentives in 2018, paying incentives on more than 5,700 separate occasions. I would regularly hear of stories of one council offering a landlord a £2,000 incentive, only for them to solicit a better offer from another borough, playing the two authorities off against each other until they pocketed a £4,000 incentive to rent out a damp, mouldy studio flat in Harrow.
MAR29	Have the Boeing crashes shaken our faith in flying?	Transport bosses need little prodding in public to utter the words “safety is our number one priority” – a mantra so widespread that, as with an English person inquiring “How do you do?” the inherent insincerity is barely noted. Clearly, the main objective of rail companies, airlines or carmakers is moving people or things, for profit, with all the risk that entails. What those industries have excelled at is vastly reducing that risk. In Britain, more than 11 years have elapsed since a passenger was killed in a train crash. Fatality rates in car accidents are declining, particularly for drivers; yesterday the European commission announced that extra safety features, including automatic speed limiters, would soon be mandatory.
MAR29	Brexit has ganged up with Alzheimer’s against my mother	It’s tempting to think that the sudden deterioration of my mother’s mental health could be linked to Brexit and our country’s collective nervous breakdown. I know it’s just a coincidence. But I believe that she and many others with Alzheimer’s disease are Brexit victims because the government’s focus on leaving the EU has created a policy vacuum that has cut adrift the most vulnerable people. A few months after my mother went into a care home with dementia, my brother and I are once again navigating the care system on our own, after she was told that the home could no longer cope with her “challenging behaviour”. Mum, a retired cookery and needlework teacher, now aged 90, seemed to have settled until about three weeks ago, when she became paranoid and delusional. The staff told us of aggressive behaviour requiring more specialised dementia care, which they cannot provide.
MAR29	France is addressing black people’s invisibility in art. When will the UK?	An exhibition taking place at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris is breaking new ground on race and representation in the arts. Black Models: From Géricault to Matisse displays masterpieces by some of France’s most important artists but renamed in honour of the black subjects who are in the pictures, yet absent from their narratives. The exhibition is a welcome reminder that black people have been indispensable to nations such as France for centuries, even if we have been overlooked. One of the most toxic myths so central in shaping society is that Europe was once white and pure, until the invasion of the dangerous and dark foreigners who have polluted the ideal society. By renaming the pictures, the curators are rightly staking a claim to a society that predates mass migration from the colonies to the “mother country”.
MAR29	If we want our diplomats to charm the world, they need stylish residences	Diplomacy is about communication. Diplomats, particularly senior ones, often have to deal with the rich and powerful. They cannot of course match the lifestyle of kings, presidents, feudal lords, business tycoons, press barons and so on. But all governments, except the most impoverished (and some of them as well), find it wise to have them deal with such people on something like equal terms. That requires a base with a bit of style, which can be expensive. A “£12m penthouse fit for a UK civil servant” is never going to be popular. But the role such homes, provided at the taxpayers’ expense, is perhaps misunderstood. As well as allowing diplomats to do their jobs they also have provide a decent, normal, family home. That may not always be achieved (I’m thinking of my own time in South Arabia, now Yemen), but it is vital. The Ferrero Rocher image of diplomacy is by no means the whole story, but if Mr Big keeps inviting you to his mansion and all you can do in return is take him out to a restaurant he will soon mark you down as a cheapskate, and that is not a good beginning. Diplomats are not unique in this; you don’t see many big business representatives living in shoeboxes.
MAR29	Why we need to talk about the media’s role in far-right radicalisation	When it comes to the threat of Islamist terrorism, no one doubts the role of radicalisation. The internet, hate preachers such as Anjem Choudary and Abu Hamza, and the western-armed, extremism-exporting state of Saudi Arabia: all play their part in radicalising the impressionable. When it comes to the far right, however, this consensus is absent. The reason for this is as obvious as it is chilling: the hate preachers, recruiting sergeants and useful idiots of rightwing extremism are located in the heart of the British, European and American establishments. They are members of the political and media elite. Less than two weeks ago, dozens of Muslims were murdered in Christchurch. Before the lethal rampage, the shooter is said to have inscribed “For Rotherham” on one of his gun magazines – in reference to the English town’s grooming scandal. In Britain, far-right terrorist attackers have ranged from David Copeland, who detonated a nail-bomb in a Soho gay pub in 1999 after decades of media hatemongering against LGBT people, to the murderer of Jo Cox, whose despicable act was cheered  by 25,000 people online, to Darren Osborne, who ploughed his van into worshippers outside a mosque. As one radicalisation expert, Abdul-Azim Ahmed, of the Centre for the Study of Islam in the UK at Cardiff University told ITV news, Osborne’s extremism “also came from the mainstream media. It came from mainstream politicians both here and abroad.”
MAR29	The destruction of the Earth is a crime. It should be prosecuted	Why do we wait until someone has passed away before we honour them? I believe we should overcome our embarrassment, and say it while they are with us. In this spirit, I want to tell you about the world-changing work of Polly Higgins. She is a barrister who has devoted her life to creating an international crime of ecocide. This means serious damage to, or destruction of, the natural world and the Earth’s systems. It would make the people who commission it – such as chief executives and government ministers – criminally liable for the harm they do to others, while creating a legal duty of care for life on Earth.
MAR30	The UK needs a year-long extension on Brexit – to really take back control	After a week that ended in an atmosphere of chaos, confusion, acrimony, hostility and mistrust, MPs are once again trying to construct a Brexit majority for something – or anything. Having lived for years now away from the Westminster bubble, I am clear that even if parliament struggles to an 11th-hour compromise on Monday, there will be little buy-in from the public. And even if for a moment there are sighs of relief, the country will still be as divided as ever. Opinion poll after opinion poll has rejected not just Theresa May’s deal and the no-deal option, but the Canada, Norway, Switzerland and Efta options, the last three of which would leave Britain as a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker. And while MPs deserve credit for trying, there is unlikely to be a majority in the country for a deal cobbled together over a weekend on the basis of MPs’ third or fourth choices that could decide the next 100 years of our history.
MAR30	Amid the overalls and the flat caps, I found my voice in Cambuslang	At a certain point in the last few miles of the train journey from London to Glasgow, I sometimes catch a glimpse of the building that was my workplace for most of 1966. The sight of it comes and goes in a moment: single-storey and backing on to the railway cutting, no building could be plainer or less conspicuous. The touching thing is that it survives when far grander sights in the district have disappeared. Clydebridge ironworks gone, the Hoover factory gone, Ravenscraig rolling mills gone, Stewarts and Lloyds steel tubes gone: smoke is no longer general all over Lanarkshire. But there, still standing in Tabernacle Lane, Cambuslang, is the former office of the Cambuslang Advertiser and the East Kilbride News.
MAR30	Brexit has nearly broken British politics. Here’s how to fix it	For those who live in the shadow of one of the most remarkable states to emerge in world history, the image of the UK now floundering in prolonged indecision over Brexit is shocking. Decisive rejection of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons for a third time, following hot on the heels of the House’s rejection of eight alternative approaches, raises uncomfortable questions about the quality of the UK’s decision-making process.
MAR30	Barclays funds climate breakdown. We are determined to make it stop	From Cyclone Idai, which has killed hundreds in south-east Africa, to flooding in Bangladesh – where my family is from – for decades climate change has been devastating communities in the global south. More recently these effects have begun to be felt by people in the UK too: just last month, wildfires raged on Saddleworth Moor, while where I live in Brixton, the air is so polluted I suffer from breathing problems. We all know that the impact of climate change is felt unequally, depending on where you live, how wealthy you are and how easily you can shield yourself from its effects. Less widely known, however, is that responsibility for the crisis is unequal too. In recent years we have been sold a lie: that ordinary people are to blame for the climate crisis. It’s our spending and our consumption habits that have created the mess we’re in, we are told, not the bankers, oil companies and a rich elite.
MAR30	Beware the great betrayal myth. This debacle is the work of hard Brexiters	There is no deader horse in the kingdom than the deal brokered by Theresa May. Flogged and flogged again, it expired for a third time at 2.42pm today on the floor of the House of Commons. Something else lay dead alongside it: the illusion that the objection of MPs was not to the precise terms of Britain’s proposed exit from the European Union – contained in the withdrawal agreement – but rather to the sketched vision of our future relationship with the EU, the so-called political declaration. That fond thought was also bludgeoned to death, for MPs had the chance to vote on the withdrawal agreement alone – and they rejected it by 344 votes to 286. Now we face a new cliff-edge, with 11pm on 12 April the new day of destiny. At that hour, Britain will crash out of the EU with no deal, in a scenario those charged with stewarding our economy, our industry and our safety warn will be catastrophic. The only way to avoid that fate is for MPs to agree on something else, fast, and, once they have, to impose their will on a reluctant prime minister. That is harder than it sounds.
MAR30	The Tory leadership contest: your handy idiots guide	There’s a photo from Pompeii that’s been doing the internet rounds a while, showing the plaster cast of a naked man. He appears to have died masturbating, even as he must have known the Vesuvian ash-cloud was approaching. Did he? Science says it’s a bit more complicated than that – but science isn’t important right now, because in every psychological aspect, that guy is the Conservative party. No matter what holy terror was raining down upon our land, no matter what the peril, the Conservative party would always decide to crack out a leadership contest. And so, inevitably, to the situation in which we find ourselves at this moment of national crisis, with Theresa May having agreed to depart. The mad bastards of the Tory party are at it again, in a competition you should think of as Mastershit: The Professionals. I collect the full range of Franklin Mint commemorative crockery for every Tory leadership battle. So if you need a vignette to remind you how the last one unfolded, there was one day when Andrea Leadsom went so fully Handmaid’s Tale on May in an interview for the Times that the paper was only able to give a side column to fellow contender Stephen Crabb being a sex case.
MAR30	So that was Brexit day. And all we got was a lousy royal yacht	I had a pretty good notion that we would not be leaving the EU on the 29 March: I actually bet Harry Cole, a rightwing columnist of toxic renown, £100 on live television that this would never happen. Call that a declaration of interest. But here are some things that I never predicted, and I challenge anyone to say that they did. Nobody could have seen Theresa May’s learning strategies unfold in the way that they have. Some people learn by putting their hand in the fire. Some people learn by putting their hand in the fire twice. Nobody anywhere has learned by putting their hand in the fire three times, then daring the fire to not burn them by threatening to do it a fourth.
MAR30	Pinch of Nom suddenly makes Delia and Heston look a little stale	Pinch of Nom isn’t a phenomenon. A phenomenon has a beginning and an end, but this thing – at first a Facebook group, then a food website, now a record-breaking cookbook – is as vast, as unstoppable, as the universe expanding. Authored by duo Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson, Pinch of Nom was published in the UK on Thursday last week, and in just three days it sold more than 210,000 copies. To put this into perspective, in 2015 Ella Mills became the fastest-selling debut cookbook author of all time, selling 32,144 copies in one week. There’s no doubt that Pinch of Nom has benefitted from the path forged by food blogger-cum-author stars such as Mills or Joe Wicks (who wrote Lean in 15). But the success of Featherstone and Allinson, who in 10 years have gone from running a Wirral restaurant together to topping the book charts, outstrips anything we’ve seen before. How did a simple diet book come to break the world of cookbooks as we know it?
MAR30	This defeat is the end of the Brexit PM. Bring on the general election	Force-feed them back their words. Theresa May’s deal was “even worse” than staying in the EU, declared Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary who resigned to oppose a deal he helped negotiate. This is a man who once publicly confessed he didn’t understand Britain’s reliance on the Dover-Calais crossing. The deal would turn Britain into a “vassal state”, declared Boris Johnson, a man who had penned a column backing remain days before endorsing leave; it was “about as bad as it could possibly be”.
MAR30	Toxins in the air, toxins in the soil – still ministers won’t act on Grenfell	It is news that no one wants to hear. Independent research from Prof Anna Stec at the University of Central Lancashire, released on Thursday, shows heightened levels of cancer-causing chemicals in the area around Grenfell Tower. Phosphorous flame retardants, toxic to the nervous system, were found in soil samples 50 metres from the tower. Dust and oily deposits were wiped from the blinds of homes close to the tower 17 months later. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found at 160 times the level of reference samples 140m from Grenfell, along with chemicals that can cause asthma with a single exposure. These are not at naturally occurring levels in most urban environments. This is truly shocking. From the beginning, residents have asked the local authority and Public Health England about contamination. The problem was obvious. For days after the fire black smoke hung in the air, and contaminated homes, clothing and furniture. For months, charred black ash rained down on people’s balconies, gardens, clothes lines and bins.
MAR31	It’s far easier to be hoodwinked if you really think they’re out to get you	Do they think I’m a fool? Do they take me for a total bloody idiot? They fix the game. They take the piss. They laugh at me behind my back, despise me, ignore me and then try to order me around. Who’s telling me that? Everyone is telling me that. Jeremy Corbyn says: “The people who run Britain have been taking our country for a ride. They’ve stitched up our political system to protect the powerful… they’ve rigged the rules to suit themselves.” And they expect me to do what, obey them? Accept their rigged, fixed, stitched-up system and be grateful?
MAR31	Labour’s plan for a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal can heal the country	Like someone who works with heavy machinery or lives next to a railway line, it’s possible to get so accustomed to the ugly noise that blasts out of our political system that you don’t always hear it. But whenever I step back, I can tell the sound of our politics has become shriller and angrier, particularly since the referendum of 2016 that split our country in half.
MAR31	Me and the woman in the pink coat (by the woman in the yellow coat)	I hoped that if anything I ever did went viral, it would be because I’d uttered some profound insight too good not to share. Last week put paid to that dream. A BBC Breakfast video clip of myself and Sherelle Jacobs, assistant comment editor at the Telegraph, from Thursday had garnered more than 4m online views by Saturday afternoon. As much as I’d like to think it was due to my incisive Brexit analysis, I have to concede it was as a result of me being well and truly upstaged. After a call from a BBC producer on Wednesday night, off I trundled bleary-eyed at 6.30 next morning to the green outside parliament, where all the television channels have gazebos set up. I argued that Wednesday’s indicative votes showed there was still hope of a referendum on any Brexit deal. Sherelle, as eloquent as ever, said she thought we’d see a Theresa May resignation before too long.
MAR31	What Apple could teach mom Gwyneth Paltrow about technology	Gwyneth Paltrow is many things – an A-list actress, an entrepreneur, a woman who has built a business empire on charging eye-watering amounts for self-care products that sound as if they were invented during a free-association session at the local poetry night – but she is not known for being relatable. Yet on Instagram, as she was told off by her teenage daughter, Apple, with a statement one door-slam away from: “You’re sooooo embarrassing”, something human began to manifest. Paltrow had posted a picture of herself with Apple, wearing ski goggles. “Mom, we have discussed this. You may not post anything without my consent,” the 14-year-old wrote underneath it, as crisp as the snow behind them. Paltrow’s audience of 5.3m was torn, the comments turning into a battleground of pro-privacy advocates (surely ironic, to argue that via Instagram, where one click on a single pair of leggings means never being able to escape from leggings ads for the rest of your mortal days) and people who think Paltrow is perfectly entitled to post pictures of her progeny.
MAR31	Sure, he might say he’s on the pill, but would you really trust him?	Once again, there are reports of the male contraceptive pill being tantalisingly imminent. And, once again, a mental image occurs of a man and woman looking at each other, arms folded, as if to say: “Sorry, I don’t trust you a bit.” A University of Washington study, involving 40 men, showed that sperm production could be disrupted with minimal side-effects and everything returning to normal once men stop taking the pill. Which all sounds intriguing, though it wouldn’t resolve the other major issue – the intrinsic lack of contraceptive trust between the sexes, which seems impossible to resolve, leastways to the point where the chemical baton could pass from women to men.

At that hour, Britain will crash out of the EU with no deal, in a scenario those charged with stewarding our economy, our industry and our safety warn will be catastrophic. The only way to avoid that fate is for MPs to agree on something else, fast, and, once they have, to impose their will on a reluctant prime minister. That is harder than it sounds.
APR1	Don’t rely on Mueller and Russia: there is no magic wand to rid us of Trump – or Brexit	Almost a year ago, the US public radio network, NPR, interviewed Robert Mueller’s biographer, Garrett Graff. The book was a classic American hagiography. The “wealthy” Mueller went to Princeton University, where he played lacrosse, then followed his teammate David Hackett to Vietnam after Hackett had been killed trying to rescue an ambushed platoon. His biographer was keen to mention early on that Mueller had in fact not been eligible to serve in the military. An injured knee had ruled him out, but he took a year off, then doggedly re-enlisted. In Vietnam he covered himself in glory and earned a Bronze Star with valour for rescuing two wounded marines.
APR1	Give the people a final say: the case for a referendum is far stronger than in 2016	It is astonishing to reflect that the prime minister’s announcement on Wednesday of her resignation plans was by no means the most important political story of the week. Far from it, in fact. In normal circumstances – of which you may have a dim recollection – Theresa May’s declaration that she “won’t stand in the way” of “a new leadership” once her Brexit deal was approved would have driven all other news to the margins, rocked the markets, gripped the world. But, in these extraordinary times, such a story is just another day at the office. And rightly so. As significant as the identity of the next Conservative leader undoubtedly is – not least because that person will probably be the next prime minister – it is small potatoes compared with the redefinition of Britain’s relationship with the European Union and the scandalously amateurish process by which that matter is being decided.
APR1	If you can’t embrace regional dialect, you can kiss my chuddies	In a rare piece of happy news to distract us momentarily from all the chaos, those lovely linguists at the Oxford English Dictionary have announced an abundance of new words all taken from regional dialects. The new entries include the Indian-English phrase “kiss my chuddies”; the delicious word “jibbons”, which is what spring onions are called in Wales; and the Scottish words “sitooterie”, which is (obviously) a place to sit out, and “bidie-in” (“a person who lives with his or her partner in a non-marital relationship”), which surely should have been in the dictionary ages ago, since the author Val McDermid, a fine connoisseur of the English language, uses it in her Twitter bio.
APR1	I’m trans and I love swimming. Why must going to the pool be an ordeal?	Swimming was one of my favourite things to do when I was younger. I grew up in rural north Iceland, but once a year my parents travelled to the capital, Reykjavik, to attend the annual agricultural senate of Iceland. Above all, this meant to me that we would be able to visit all of the local swimming pools. I have warm memories of racing up the cold and icy stairs to the outside slide before throwing myself down the slide again and again with contentment until my parents had to physically drag me out of the pool. In Iceland there is a pool for every 1,700 inhabitants. Swimming is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes. It’s so ingrained into our culture that we have what we call pottamenning — which describes a cultural phenomenon of having public discussions about politics in the hot tub. Journalists go to public pools and interview local swimmers to get their take on recent events.
APR1	While newsrooms have shrunk, investigative journalism is thriving	One of the enduring myths espoused by veteran reporters is that investigative journalism is dead. I think I heard it first in 1987 when I joined the Sunday Times, the newspaper generally considered to have pioneered agenda-setting investigations. Several of my new colleagues were convinced, despite ample evidence to the contrary, that the paper was no longer committed to providing the necessary resources for lengthy probes into institutional bad behaviour. They held fast to the myth even as the paper went on publishing investigations. Later, I discovered that the same mistaken belief existed across the industry and has persisted over the course of 30 years. It gained ground once the digital revolution took hold, and I admit to sharing concerns about the negative effects of the resulting cuts to editorial staffs. But digital tools have turned out to be a wonderful addition to the reporting armoury and it is possible to argue that investigative journalism today is in a healthier state than ever before. Computer terminals have proven more effective in discovering secrets than shoe leather.
APR1	Archaic, authoritarian, unequal to the challenge – parliament is broken	After every shattering bungle, some PR creep says: “Lessons have been learned and appropriate changes put in place.” Well, and British Brexit? What lessons, and what hope for changes? There’s one obvious lesson which Westminster, despite centuries of dire experience, still fails to learn. Do not kick Irish cans down the road. Some contain Semtex. All have a way of rolling back and tripping you up. There’s an English habit of not thinking about Ireland lest it spoil a nice afternoon. If David Cameron had thought of the British border in Ireland, he would have called his referendum off. But he kicked Arlene Foster and two Irish taoiseachs down the road. Now British politics lies sprawling on that same hard tarmac.
APR1	I’ll never see Mum again. But I’ve learned to live with Mother’s Day	I can’t remember the last Mother’s Day I spent with my mum. It would have been in 2013, since in August of that year she died, but the day itself is lost in the memories of all those that came before it. Those past Mother’s Days were a mad rush to buy a card and a bunch of flowers – lilies, always – the haphazard breakfasts in bed made with my brother when I was a child, and one year even writing a poem; the flowers must have all sold out. In the six years since my mum has died, though, each Mother’s Day is now a looming presence, one that cannot be passed over and forgotten. Rather than fret over the day as a commercial inconvenience, as I did when she was alive, now it is something I grit my teeth through – a different kind of endurance test.
APR1	Theresa May was dealt the worst of hands and has played it spectacularly badly	It nearly always ends in tears, whether they are shed publicly or just inside, but few premierships have drawn to a close with such wretchedness as that visited on Theresa May. She’s not quite out of the door yet and other Tories are already describing her as the worst prime minister in a hundred years. That is a savage verdict when the competition for this dismal accolade includes Neville Chamberlain, Ramsay MacDonald, Anthony Eden and David Cameron. I think we can safely say she will not be remembered as one of the more strong and stable occupants of Number 10. Hilarious as it may seem today, she seized the keys in the summer of 2016 because colleagues thought her “a safe pair of hands”. She commended herself to Tory MPs – and was pretty popular with a lot of voters – as she seemed to promise a premiership of common sense and calm after the anarchic orgy of backstabbing unleashed by the Cameronian, Johnsonian and Goveite cliques. In that largely forgotten period when she appeared to be monarch of all she surveyed, and the cabinet was terrified of her, she was variously compared to Boudicca and Elizabeth I. To some of us, the early cult of Theresa was ridiculous even at the time. It is now so risible that thinking about it for too long risks permanent injury to your abdomen.
APR1	Drug trips, not broken hips: let later life be the age of irresponsibility	Contemplating getting old and thinking about what it would be like living out your last years institutionalised in a care home is enough to make anyone feel depressed. Sure, there are some excellent care homes out there, but there are also plenty that are steeped in loneliness and misery. And the prospect of losing your physical – or, even worse, your mental – faculties is deeply scary. That gut reaction – an inherent fear of decline – is a very strong one, difficult to overcome. It infuses our attitudes towards ageing and helps bake ageism into society. Ageing is culturally all about managing decline rather than living the good life until the very end. That, in turn, affects how older people are looked after by their families and the care system.
APR1	Dividing rich and poor is inevitable when developers run open spaces	There’s no good way of looking at this. Sometimes, when waves of outrage break, a contrarian voice might ask if it’s as bad as all that, if there isn’t another side to the story. In the case of the Baylis Old School development in south London, where children from affordable housing have been excluded from a playground used by the children of private owner-occupiers, there is no excuse. This segregated playground is plain mean-spirited. It goes against a strength of London and other British cities, which is that people of different backgrounds both live close together and share spaces. It contradicts the 2012 planning application made by the project’s developers, which says that “play areas will be designed to maximise their inclusivity” and that open spaces will “emphasise the sense of community within the scheme stressing that the common areas are there for the use of all the residents”.
APR2	After this failure by MPs, Britain could now stumble into a pointless general election	Until just after 10pm on April Fools’ Day, when John Bercow began to announce the results, it was still just about possible to persuade oneself that there might be an modestly uplifting ending to parliament’s long battle of Brexit. After a debate from which most Tory Brexiter MPs ostentatiously stayed away, it felt as if an all-party revolt of pro-European MPs might be about to drag Theresa May’s government unwillingly into a different kind of Brexit. But it was not to be. In the event, that effort has failed by just three votes. It probably might as well be three hundred. The might-have-beens are agonising. If just two MPs had voted differently, the outcome would have been reversed. If the Scottish nationalists, the Liberal Democrats, the Independent Group of MPs, or even the DUP – all of whom might in some circumstances plausibly have found their own reasons to support Kenneth Clarke’s customs union motion – had voted differently, then the Brexit landscape would have changed.
APR2	The Newport West byelection could vindicate Labour’s Brexit policy	Until the referendum on European Union membership three years ago, I hadn’t realised quite how many English journalists had never visited Wales, Scotland or Ireland. Italy, France, Germany, endlessly but a short train journey or flight to the closest countries had somehow eluded them. My phone has buzzed with cautious questions from more of them in the past few weeks – despatched to the Newport West byelection, which takes place on Thursday, but never having crossed the Severn Bridge before – asking for tips knowing I spent a considerable chunk of my life there. Yes, it’s another country, but yes, they still speak English there. If Labour does lose the seat, media reports will likely attempt to pin the blame on Corbyn. That would be an error
APR2	This is no time for a compromise with Brexiters: there is no middle way	“Believe in Britain”, say leavers’ posters outside parliament. What sort of belief, as things fall apart? While Brexit voting consumed Westminster last Friday, another austerity tragedy slipped by unnoticed. In Hastings the doors shut for the last time on a day centre that was life support, comfort and company for 60 old people. I met Rose, Mary and Sal, who had sat together for years, and were now to be separated. Some of those ejected from the Isabel Blackman Centre will stay home alone. Some will soon go to expensive residential care, in the absence of the centre’s daily respite for their partners. Expect many to be in A&E more often, along with others of the 1.8 million older people denied care. Some 54,000 older people died waiting for a care package last year, according to Age UK. In East Sussex seven local care centres have shut. The council is near bankrupt, due to cuts. As the Isabel Blackman Centre shut, the new minister for loneliness, Tracey Crouch, was not there to say goodbye to Rose, Mary and Sal. I left to catch the train back for the next episode of the Westminster psycho-drama, to see the MPs consumed by the furies, ambitions and panics of another Brexit vote. These things are linked. “Believe in Britain”? The real patriotic cause is to save us all from Brexit, from the damage any variety of Brexit will do, as the grip of austerity inevitably tightens following departure. Closing day centres wasn’t on the side of that notorious leave bus, of course.
APR2	Jeremy Corbyn needs to get behind the people’s vote to fight the far right	For many in the Labour movement, the socialist, diverse left bloc of last week’s Put it to the People march may have felt more of a political home than, say, the main, continuity remain element – and that also highlights the big Jeremy Corbyn-shaped hole both at the event and in the wider campaign. For it actually to be more Corbyn left, the campaign would need the leadership’s buy-in (and the grassroots organising that would flow from that). Instead, it was down to the left bloc of Love Socialism Hate Brexit MPs and campaigners to present the radical left, anti-racist arguments for a second referendum. They did a great job, even though their message did not necessarily chime with everyone: one organiser told me they overhead someone at the main demo ask why the left bloc kept going on about socialism at an anti-Brexit march. This statement encapsulates the problem with a people’s vote campaign led by the centrist status quo that much of the leave vote was a protest against. Meanwhile, the anti-racist component of arguments over Brexit is too often ignored as we pore over the parliamentary politics of who might vote for which Brexit option and what happens next. Here we are with only bad choices, mounting chaos, reckless rhetoric, a terrible democratic failure and a febrile political climate, all of which is firing up a hate- and anger-filled far right already emboldened by Brexit. Whatever happens next, none of that is going away quickly.
APR2	Remainers, take note: much of Europe just wants to excise the British cancer	The mood in Brussels is pessimistic. Most of those closely involved in the Brexit talks think the likeliest outcome is for the UK to leave without a deal. There is also tremendous frustration with what EU officials see as the incompetence, ignorance and irresponsibility of swaths of the British political class. Over the past three years much of the goodwill that people held towards the UK has evaporated. The EU expects no deal because it does not trust British politicians not to screw up. There is not much faith that “indicative votes” among MPs will produce a coherent way forward. “We don’t see the transmission mechanism that forces the executive to bend to parliament’s will,” said one EU official. “We cannot negotiate with a parliament.”
APR2	Tory MPs’ no-deal fetish is making a cross-party Brexit solution impossible	The number of Conservative MPs who are prepared to take Britain out of the EU with no deal is now greater than the total number of Conservatives elected to parliament in 1997. That is not the only way that British politics has changed since then. Parties have a lot of different positions over 22 years, but the capture of the Tories by no-dealism has happened within 22 months. When Tony Blair’s landslide victory reduced the Tory MPs to a rump of 165, Euroscepticism meant something different. It was all about obstructing Britain’s entry into the single currency, resisting new treaties and grumbling about old ones. Only on the outermost political fringe would anyone advocate shredding the treaties, kicking away the legal and diplomatic foundations of Britain’s partnership with the continent and seeing what happened. Even three years ago, no one in the official leave campaign thought that was a good idea. Now 170 Tory MPs – more than half of the party’s parliamentary cohort – are signed up. That number, which includes many cabinet ministers, is reported to have endorsed a letter urging the prime minister to deliver the UK out of the EU promptly and regardless of the terms.
APR2	Turns out posh boys are better bullshitters. That explains a lot	If you’ve ever wondered why the most overconfident embarrassments in the headlines and in your life are so frequently young, posh and male, wonder no more. It’s a thing. Bullshit can be packaged in so many ways, but it frequently comes in a certain form. According to a new study from University College London, young men who come from advantaged backgrounds are more likely to be bullshitters. That is, they believe they’re smarter, stronger and all-round better than they actually are. He could sniff out insecurity like a truffle-hunting pig, and play with it until hard-working colleagues cried
APR2	A customs union would not solve the Brexit conundrum	Parliament has a little over one week to prove that it can do what Theresa May should have allowed it to do after her failure in the 2017 election, and come up with a plan that saves us from the Brexit cliff edge. The question is whether it can, without the constraints of Mrs May’s self-imposed red lines, agree a deal based on the creation of a permanent customs union, and perhaps also continuing membership of the single market. Only a minority of the Conservative party, which now looks increasingly like the leave campaign, would buy into this, as most now want to leave the EU with as “clean” a break as possible, however painful. But we may find in the coming days that there is a cross-party majority of MPs – including possibly the DUP – who are willing to back a softer form of Brexit. Negotiations to see whether a compromise is possible are the only alternative to what the former Brexit minister, Lord Bridges, has described as the British public being asked to walk a gangplank into thin air.
APR2	Government can’t regulate Facebook – it’s up to all of us	I didn’t see this coming but … I agree with Mark Zuckerberg. The Facebook chief executive has called for more government regulation of the internet. And what he has said is pretty sensible, if a little light on detail. The four areas Zuckerberg wants governments to regulate more are harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability. I know what you’re thinking: isn’t Zuck just passing the buck? Hasn’t his company very publicly failed to tackle all of the issues he’s saying it’s up to governments to fix? You’re not wrong. The four areas he’s concerned about do happen to overlap with recent Facebook scandals. But that doesn’t mean his announcement isn’t good news. Big companies hardly ever call for more regulation. It sometimes feels as if people in Silicon Valley view laws and, indeed, nation states, as some quaint 20th-century tech that will disappear in a few years, like CDs or fax machines. Businesses such as Uber and Facebook pride themselves on being “disruptors”, arguing the existing rules are too outdated to apply to them at all. And until now they haven’t been keen on any new rules to replace the old ones. The change of heart should be welcomed.
APR2	Dear Robert Smith – spare a thought for us poor interviewers	My how we laughed at Robert Smith’s reaction when the Cure were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Deadpan, he responds to giddy, over-eager interviewer Carrie Keagan, who, bubbling with gleeful enthusiasm, asks him: “Are you are as excited as I am?” Glumly, he replies: “By the sounds of it, no.” When I wrote about music, my life was frequently complicated by interviewees who could or would not cooperate. The interview process is seldom sparkling, but we do what we can with occasionally fatigued, overwhelmed, intoxicated, arrogant, tedious musicians (some are lovely, admittedly). A friend attempted to liven up his days on the interview circuit treadmill by posing questions cut from random magazines (including gardening publications) to the initial bewilderment, then eventual amusement, of his subjects. I still have fond memories of interviewing Edsel Auctioneer for the NME, a Leeds band with the nous to tell benign lies in order to enliven the process (who offered a welcome, slightly ribald fib about song lyrics and a Jacuzzi).
APR3	May’s desperate pitch for cross-party unity is a leap into the dark	One way to identify Britain’s next Brexit panic is to look for a problem that was foreseen in Brussels ages ago. For example, the European commission, seeing that Theresa May’s deal was failing, decided in January that Britain would need to have European parliamentary elections if Brexit ended up being delayed into the summer. Three months later, it is the prospect of holding that ballot that has provoked May into a desperate pitch for collaboration with Labour in pursuit of some version of Brexit that stands a chance of Commons ratification. This has been the pattern from the start. The EU anticipates problems, makes choices and waits for British politics to catch up. Even before the referendum there were warnings about the impossibility of frictionless borders outside the single market. The specific challenge that posed for Northern Ireland was identified and baked into the commission’s negotiating mandate in May 2017. But in February 2019 Dominic Raab, a man who briefly led Brexit negotiations, and fancies himself as a potential prime minister, admitted he had not read the Good Friday agreement. It is only 35 pages long.
APR3	May’s bombshell means the Little English nationalist revolution is over	The carefully crafted illusions the May administration were founded on have crumbled into dust. After three years of civil service expertise wasted, billions of pounds of growth lost and two years’ worth of legislative time squandered, Theresa May stopped trying to get Brexit through with Tory votes and turned to Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn will be asked to co-author a new version of the political declaration acceptable to Labour or, failing that, to help engineer a majority in the Commons, either for a Norway-style deal or a customs union.
APR3	May’s can-kicking changes nothing – MPs must stop a no-deal Brexit	Theresa May has proved herself once again to be an expert at kicking the can down the road. Her pitiful appeal for still more time to fix Brexit changes nothing. The Irish border will remain an intractable problem and the DUP – for all the money it has pocketed – will continue to withhold its support.
APR3	The macho drama queens of Brexit are about to be knocked out by reality	The closer the Brexit doomsday clock ticks to midnight, the more of a certain type of machismo we get. I find it extremely encouraging. It suggests that if and when all else fails, the Brexit ultras can either fight or fuck their way out of this. Happily, not one of them feels miscast in this hypersexualised action hero role. “How are you feeling tonight?” Sky News inquired of Steve Baker, who last week was wishing he could tear down parliament and bulldoze it into the Thames. “Well, everyone knows I’m Brexit hardman Steve Baker,” came the reply from the man everyone knows needed a cuddle off Jacob Rees-Mogg after the aforementioned ’dozer speech.
APR3	A comedian could be Ukraine’s next president. How did that happen?	A politically inexperienced comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is in the lead after the first round of presidential elections in Ukraine – and by a huge margin. He is almost 15 percentage points ahead of the incumbent president, Petro Poroshenko. Zelenskiy’s unconventional campaign, relying primarily on Instagram and a TV show in which he plays a fictional Ukrainian president, proved to be far more successful than Poroshenko’s attempt to impose a choice of “me or Putin”. Poroshenko’s main messages of “army, language and faith”, as well as his recent nationalist initiatives, would easily see him branded as far right in any other European country. Yulia Tymoshenko, a veteran of Ukrainian politics who led the polls until January, failed to present a clear alternative to Poroshenko’s aggressive nationalism and ended up in third place in Sunday’s first-round vote. The candidates appealing to Russian-speaking voters in Ukraine’s south-eastern regions failed to unite. The most popular among them, Yuriy Boiko, came fourth.
APR3	May’s failure to tackle Tory Islamophobia sends a dangerous message	Theresa May and the Conservative party are refusing to take the action needed to tackle the growing problem of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment among Tory members and politicians, and in our wider society. At a time when hate crime against all minority communities is rising, and when far-right extremism is a growing problem, they simply must not be allowed to get away with it. Just over two weeks ago, people around the world were left heartbroken and scared when 50 innocent people were murdered in a terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, for no reason other than their faith.
APR3	Jacinda Ardern’s grief should not eclipse that of Muslims	Since the Christchurch terror attack, much of the focus has been not on the mourning of New Zealand’s Muslim community, but on white people. This has been repeated across the west, and in parts of the Middle East. Jacinda Ardern’s face was projected on to the outside of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai days after the attack. The prime minister’s response to the shooting has indeed been exemplary but the reaction to it has left little space for the victims, or the wider Muslim community in New Zealand or around the world. While many of us are still coming to terms with the events that happened in Christchurch, I have seen more pictures of Ardern’s grief and mourning than of the Muslim community in New Zealand, the victims or those who acted bravely on the day to save lives and fight against the terrorist.
APR3	Rees-Mogg and the AfD’s Alice Weidel have a lot in common – all of it nasty	My first reaction on hearing that Jacob Rees-Mogg had retweeted a video by the populist German Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) was: “Well, that figures.” And not just because the AfD is the nasty party in German politics and because Rees-Mogg represents the faction that wants the Conservatives to remain the nasty party in Britain. One of the driving forces behind the AfD is a very German inferiority complex regarding the second world war. Rees-Mogg, with his foppish retro look and accent, embodies the Britain that German nationalists think they lost the war to. A Britain they despise, envy and admire in almost equal measure. What binds Alice Weidel to a party of older white males is her almost pathological hatred of foreigners
APR3	Government can’t regulate Facebook – it’s up to all of us	I didn’t see this coming but … I agree with Mark Zuckerberg. The Facebook chief executive has called for more government regulation of the internet. And what he has said is pretty sensible, if a little light on detail. The four areas Zuckerberg wants governments to regulate more are harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability. I know what you’re thinking: isn’t Zuck just passing the buck? Hasn’t his company very publicly failed to tackle all of the issues he’s saying it’s up to governments to fix? You’re not wrong.

And until now they haven’t been keen on any new rules to replace the old ones. The change of heart should be welcomed.
APR3	How Gary Lineker and Luciana Berger helped me take the fight to the trolls	I remember the day I joined Twitter. On the set of The Infidel in May 2009, I’d been telling Omid Djalili and the Davids – Baddiel and Schneider – that I didn’t have a Facebook account and all social media was a pointless waste of time. On the spot they signed me up to this newish site, saying: “You’ll love this, it’s fun.” And to be fair it was. With just 140 characters, you had to be pithy and bright. Here was a site that had all the enjoyment of being invited to the best party in town, full of the funniest, most well-informed people on the planet, from all walks of life. All this without having to leave the house. It was addictive. I barely received a single negative tweet. If anything unsavoury did come my way – abuse or dick pics – I just pressed the block button.
APR4	Muslims and Jews face a common threat from white supremacists. We must fight it together	The two of us have been having the exact same conversation for the past decade. About antisemitism and Islamophobia. One of us a Muslim, the other a Jew, we have conducted it in public and in private, on Twitter and on TV. We’ve agreed; we’ve argued; we’ve even wandered off topic to trade tips on how to get through a fast. Now we’ve come together because of the urgent and common threat that we face. Both of our communities are under violent attack from far-right white supremacists. In Christchurch, New Zealand, last month a white supremacist gunned down 50 Muslims at prayer. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, last October a white supremacist gunned down 11 Jews at prayer. Both killers were clear in their loathing of both Jews and Muslims. Both subscribed to the “great replacement theory”, which casts Muslims and other minorities as “invaders” of western societies and a threat to white, Christian majorities. In this narrative, the supposed invasion is a wicked plot orchestrated by the same hidden hand behind all malign events through world history: the Jews. The point was put concisely in an online remark reposted by the Pittsburgh murderer: “It’s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!!”
APR4	Britain needs a Brexit compromise. Forging one could be the making of Corbyn’s Labour	The national tragedy of Brexit sweeps on. In the end, Theresa May’s opening to Jeremy Corbyn to help solve it may prove to have been just another brief episode in its awful unfolding. But even the greatest tragedies occasionally have space for epic moments of boldness and inspiration, when a moment can be seized and an outcome reshaped. This could – perhaps – be one of them. The appeal to Labour may soon prove to be little more than another of the tactical feints that May sometimes attempts in search of a Brexit solution. Through thick and thin, the prime minister has doggedly tried to get her deal through with Conservative and DUP votes. Occasionally, though, she has tacked a little towards the centre. When she does, her main motive seems to be to frighten her rebel rightwingers back into her hard-Brexit pen, rather than to reveal any lurking centrist convictions or because she accepts she has no alternative.
APR4	Could Macron knock Britain out of the EU next week?	Brexit has been blocked by the most head-banging of Brexiteers. Leavers are now hoping for a sweet paradox of their own. They are looking to President Emmanuel Macron, a remainer super-hero, to boot Britain out of the European Union next week. Recent remarks made by the French president suggested that he might summon the spirit of Charles de Gaulle (vintage 1963 and 1967) and veto – come what May – extended British membership of the EU at the Brussels summit on 10 April.
APR4	So Brits have a lot of sex on drugs – why?	The news that Brits are the greatest practitioners of sex on drugs in the western world may have come as a surprise to you – but only if you’ve never paid attention to the amorous preamble which takes place in our pubs, clubs and private dinner parties on a Friday night. In an extensive Guardian survey five years ago, 9% of those surveyed admitted to taking drugs to improve their sex life. Now, 22,000 people have voluntarily informed the Global Drug Survey of their occasional to habitual predilections for combining alcohol, cocaine, MDMA and a raft of other substances with sexual activity.
APR4	Joe Biden's policies are as troubling as his inappropriate touching	As the Democratic primary heats up, Joe Biden, who hasn’t even formally declared yet, is the latest candidate in the hot seat. At issue: his handsiness, which is generally notorious and specifically detailed by Nevada politician Lucy Flores; his moderate policies, which seem painfully out of touch in today’s Democratic party and the promise that his supporters make, which is that he’s the only candidate who can defeat Donald Trump. One thing is clear. Joe Biden is the wrong candidate for 2020.
APR4	If only bums on glass was the oddest thing to happen in parliament this week	People pressed their semi-naked bums on the gallery glass in the House of Commons and had to be peeled off by police, and it still wasn’t the stupidest thing that happened in parliament this week. On Monday, the night that parliament was supposed to “take back control”, protest group Extinction Rebellion got into the gallery, took their kit off and tried to stick a variety of body parts to the glass, turning the House of Commons into some kind of X-rated human zoo.
APR4	James Corden is right: chubby bodies like mine should not be confined to radio	James Corden has reminded us this week that chubby actors rarely get cast as romantic leads. I can confirm that this has most definitely been the case with me; the offers have been very thin on the ground indeed. I have only had one film role, playing myself as the host of a sex party in the (in my view) unfairly maligned film Sex Lives of the Potato Men. The sight of me clad only in an ungenerous towel was enough to convince this viewer, for one, that naked chubby men have no place in any form of mainstream entertainment. So, since I couldn’t bear the sight of myself, how can I agree with James? But I do; it’s just mad. The Channel 4 programme Naked Attraction has been widely excoriated as brainless smut. But it does have the merit of being just about the only place on film or television you can see ordinary human forms in a state of undress.
APR4	I helped stop a far-right terror plot. Are UK police ready for the next one?	Robbie Mullen joined the neo-Nazi group National Action in 2015. He’d been impressed by what he had seen of it in the media. He was angry at the world. And he was in search of friends. But he contacted the organisation I work for, Hope not Hate, in April 2017 when he realised that National Action was turning to terrorism. He came to us because, unlike the authorities, we’d never stopped going after the group after it was banned by the home secretary in December 2016. Robbie’s story – of how he came to be a member of National Action, how he foiled Jack Renshaw’s plot to murder an MP, and how he has been treated by the authorities – can tell us so much about the threat posed by the far right today.
APR4	Don’t celebrate more domestic flights, Chris Grayling. Think of the planet	It’s not hard to see why Chris Grayling jumped at the opportunity to visit Heathrow airport early on Tuesday to welcome passengers landing on a dreary morning at Terminal 2. He was marking the launch of an air service from Flybe – which will now be operating four return flights from Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall to London seven days a week. This is a transport secretary made famous for his inability to actually transport things, whether that be people by train or goods over water (he’s even managed to stop cyclists making it safely from A to B) – and so for Grayling, a plane on a new flightpath taking off and landing on time is a much needed chance to claim an easy win and arrange a photo-op.
APR4	Look past the May-Corbyn Brexit talks. There’s another solution	The objections to Theresa May’s 11th-hour offer to work with Labour on Brexit are obvious. It goes without saying that this is not how the process should have ended but how it should have begun, the day after the referendum or, at the very least, the day after the June 2017 election wiped out May’s Commons majority. Instead, Brexit has been like one of those high-end artworks where the narrative runs backwards. Think of it as Brexit in the style of Harold Pinter’s Betrayal, to pick a play whose title the hard Brexiters might find bleakly resonant, in which first comes the triggering of article 50 and two years of negotiations with Brussels, followed by cross-party talks to find a parliamentary consensus – when it clearly should have been the other way around. Equally obvious is that if Brexiters are looking for someone to blame for this development, they need to look in the mirror. May is only compelled to seek Labour’s help in taking Britain out of the European Union because the Tory votes in the Commons were not there. Brexit was on offer, but the Brexiters repeatedly refused to vote for it (because it wasn’t Brexity enough for their tastes). They’re now crying betrayal, accusing May of making Jeremy Corbyn the de facto prime minister, but this situation is entirely on them. It’s their fault.
APR5	How Labour can resolve the Brexit crisis – and tear down the Tories too	Consider this scenario. The Brexit national crisis is resolved on terms that protect the economy and hard-won workers’ rights. The national conversation moves on to the NHS (remember that?), child poverty and housing. Another referendum, more poisonous and bitter than the last, and one that could easily be won by leave all over again, – polling currently shows more people would prefer to leave without a deal than to stay in the EU outside of London and Scotland – is avoided. A transformative government comes to power which rips up a four-decade-old market fundamentalist experiment that has been an endless generator of insecurity and social turmoil. The Conservative party – which, for entirely partisan ends, has brought chaos and humiliation to Britain – is torn asunder, ejected from office for a generation. This could be the prize if Labour agreed a deal with the Tories that forced Theresa May to reject her party’s red lines. There are the obvious pitfalls to be navigated: May using the talks to run down the clock, or to displace responsibility for a national calamity of the Conservatives’ own making to Labour, or to provide a pretext for a long extension that torments the Brexiteers. Every promise would have to be written in legislation and passed by the House of Commons, or be simply tossed on a bonfire by May’s hard-right successor. Labour agreeing to any deal with May will cause a paroxysm of fury from those remainers who – understandably anguished by this wretched mess – will be satisfied by no less than another referendum.
APR5	Joe Biden’s inappropriate touching is the embodiment of male privilege	We tell our children to let us know if a grownup touches them in a way that they don’t like or makes them feel uncomfortable, don’t we? Although we also then plonk them on the laps of strange men in fake beards and suggest they tell them their secrets. The whole Santa Claus thing has always been extremely weird, and you often see little ones far from enchanted, and actually scared, by this “tradition”. But do we afford grown women the same privilege of being able to express unease at the way some men touch us and make us feel uncomfortable? Not really. We don’t want to make a fuss. “Nothing that bad happened – thank you for not sexually assaulting us,” is so much the internalised female default that many women tolerate a range of creepiness from men who plead ignorance about what they are doing.
APR5	Europe is a dysfunctional family, but divorce is not the answer	For 37 years, Axel Scheffler, the German-born illustrator of The Gruffalo, has made his home and his career in Britain. His contribution to the lives of millions of our children has been simply immense. If we leave Europe, his hitherto guaranteed right to call the UK his home is under threat. Can we imagine how this affects his life, how it makes him feel? And how do we feel that such a circumstance might yet come to pass in our country? This man is a treasured friend to us and to our children. We have to think again, and think hard. The European Union, as we know it now, was created after the second world war by France and Germany to ensure peace and prosperity. There was a determination that war should be no more. They had good enough reason. In the preceding 300 years there had been many wars between these two countries, the last two catastrophic, not just to them, but to us in the UK, and to people all over the world. There has been peace in Europe since, mostly. And democracy, mostly. And for many people, though not enough, there has also been great prosperity. Peace and prosperity and democracy – these are fine aims for us and our children.
APR5	It’s gender pay gap reporting day. Treat claims of progress with a pinch of salt	Wouldn’t it be neat if we could put a number on gender inequality? If we could quantitatively measure the challenge women face every day to be treated on a par with their male counterparts – financially, socially and culturally. Then we could track precise progress numerically and hold ourselves accountable undeniably, because statistics are great like that. They don’t lie and they don’t tell half truths. Except, unfortunately, when they do.
APR5	Ddu-du you know? English is losing its grip as the language of pop	A band has attained a certain stature when its “world tour” consists of an imperial sweep through four continents, with just half a dozen concerts in each. The South Korea-based girl group Blackpink are currently midway through just such a jaunt – next month, they arrive in Europe to play six dates (London and Manchester included). Remarkably, this high-visibility procession is the first time the K-pop quartet have toured outside Korea or Japan; more remarkable still, they’ve released just one album and a scant handful of tracks – and while they’ve made English-language videos, most of their material is in Korean or Japanese. Nonetheless, they’re adored by a worldwide fanbase, for whom language is no barrier. Recent industry figures underline the strength of the global music market, with some suggesting the place of the English language at the forefront of pop is diminishing.
APR5	Chernobyl’s disastrous cover-up is a warning for the next nuclear age	In 1986, the Soviet minister of hydrometeorology, Yuri Izrael, had a regrettable decision to make. It was his job to track radioactivity blowing from the smoking Chernobyl reactor in the hours after the 26 April explosion and deal with it. Forty-eight hours after the accident, an assistant handed him a roughly drawn map. On it, an arrow shot north-east from the nuclear power plant, and broadened to become a river of air 10 miles wide that was surging across Belarus toward Russia. If the slow-moving mass of radioactive clouds reached Moscow, where a spring storm front was piling up, millions could be harmed. Izrael’s decision was easy. Make it rain. So that day, in a Moscow airport, technicians loaded artillery shells with silver iodide. Soviet air force pilots climbed into the cockpits of TU-16 bombers and made the easy one-hour flight to Chernobyl, where the reactor burned. The pilots circled, following the weather. They flew 30, 70, 100, 200km – chasing the inky black billows of radioactive waste. When they caught up with a cloud, they shot jets of silver iodide into it to emancipate the rain.
APR5	How should Britain commemorate a world war? Include the uncomfortable parts too	Vera Brittain, in her moving autobiography Testament of Youth, recalled that when the sounds of victory burst over London on 11 November 1918, men and women alike did not proclaim victory but simply said, with relief: “The war is over.” And yet, in so many ways, and for so many people, it would never be over. For the bereaved, like Brittain herself, pain would continue for the rest of their lives – while for the survivors of the battlefields there would be constant reminders, physically and mentally, of their terrible experiences. Nor did conflict and war end for everyone in November 1918. This was, after all, not a war to end all war, as was so easily proclaimed in 1918. Nor did the peace settlement solve very much in the longer run. The collapse of empires in central and eastern Europe paved the way for a much more unstable political world with the advent of national and independence struggles and revolution, while the isolationism of the United States undermined the broader ambitions for a new international world order.
APR5	This US supreme court ruling on how a man must die is a study in cruelty	When does the execution of a prisoner cross a line and become “cruel and unusual”? In the strange world of the US death penalty, that is an all-important legal question. The US constitution prohibits “cruel and unusual” punishments, but condemned prisoners seeking relief have to prove their executions meet this definition, as opposed to just being “painful”. This week the US supreme court handed down a ruling that sought to clarify what manner of execution would meet constitutional standards of cruelty and unusualness. The court’s answer? Disembowelling.
APR5	Muslims and Jews face a common threat from white supremacists. We must fight it together	The two of us have been having the exact same conversation for the past decade. About antisemitism and Islamophobia. One of us a Muslim, the other a Jew, we have conducted it in public and in private, on Twitter and on TV. We’ve agreed; we’ve argued; we’ve even wandered off topic to trade tips on how to get through a fast. Now we’ve come together because of the urgent and common threat that we face. Both of our communities are under violent attack from far-right white supremacists. In Christchurch, New Zealand, last month a white supremacist gunned down 50 Muslims at prayer. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, last October a white supremacist gunned down 11 Jews at prayer. Both killers were clear in their loathing of both Jews and Muslims. Both subscribed to the “great replacement theory”, which casts Muslims and other minorities as “invaders” of western societies and a threat to white, Christian majorities. In this narrative, the supposed invasion is a wicked plot orchestrated by the same hidden hand behind all malign events through world history: the Jews. The point was put concisely in an online remark reposted by the Pittsburgh murderer: “It’s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!!”
APR30	My sexual assault case was dropped when I refused to give police my phone	A few years ago I was violently sexually assaulted by a “friend” on a night out. It was a sustained and sadistic attack that in no way began with consent. I made the incredibly difficult decision to report it to the police because I needed to take power back. I wanted to look him in the eyes in court and watch him feel a fraction of the helplessness and humiliation that I felt that night. I wanted to tell him I had the power now, with the full weight of the law behind me. Unfortunately it didn’t work out as I expected. Even though some time had elapsed between the assault and my reporting of it, there was evidence that the police acknowledged as compelling. Despite this, my case was dropped not because of an unlikely prospect of conviction, but because I refused to hand over my mobile phone to be downloaded in its entirety.
APR30	Labour members know what we need: a referendum and a campaign for remain	Jeremy Corbyn’s 2015 leadership campaign motivated thousands. Enthused by an unequivocal, principled call to build a fairer Britain and a more peaceful world, I was one of hundreds who joined volunteer phone-banking sessions. In Labour’s 2017 general election team, I played a small part in the by then huge movement which inspired millions to vote for the party and which has since inspired socialist parties across Europe and beyond. Making a decisive break with lowest common denominator politics, calling out austerity as a political choice and not a necessity, our reinvigorated party has forced cracks into the consensus supporting neoliberal economics worldwide. It has helped to restore the fight for social justice to the heart of left politics.
APR30	Fear of the far right and the collapse of Podemos gave Spain’s socialists victory	Pedro Sánchez is the clear winner of Sunday’s snap elections in Spain. With the highest turnout since 1996, the prime minister’s Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) won nearly double the number of seats of its closest competitor, the conservative Popular Party (PP). But in the country’s highly fragmented political system, it is unlikely to govern alone. Instead, Sánchez must look for support from other parties. Like many progressive parties in Europe, he will have to choose between a technocratic party looking to centralise power and a radical-left party that favours decentralisation. Sánchez’s victory is the result of two main trends. First and foremost is the rise of Vox, a new, openly misogynistic and xenophobic party that toys with nostalgia for Franco’s dictatorship. Backed by the likes of Steve Bannon, Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini, and indirectly financed (via the Madrid-based CitizenGo organisation) by a US super PAC with ties to Donald Trump, Russian oligarch Aleksei Komov and the Italian MP Luca Volontè, who is accused of bribery, Vox rode a wave of anti-Catalan sentiment into the government of Andalucía in December. Sunday’s massive turnout (75.8%) was most likely driven by widespread fear of a rightwing coalition government that would include it.
APR30	Some sort of Scottish independence is inevitable. May needs to face up to it	Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, yesterday reiterated her promise to give her country another referendum on independence within the next two years. After all, if there’s an argument for Britons having another Brexit referendum just three years after the last, Scotland can surely have another on independence after five years. Besides, Sturgeon must be thinking, was there ever a better moment for divorce from a marriage so dysfunctional as the United Kingdom? Some might wonder what new horror history could unleash on poor Britain. After Brexit comes Scexit. But Sturgeon is in the ascendant. The weekend’s polls put her SNP’s lead over all other parties at between 23 and 26 points, astonishing for a governing party that has been in office for 12 years, with Sturgeon as its leader for five. In that time, the popularity of Scottish independence has risen to an unprecedented 49% support. With an electorate that strongly rejected leaving the EU, Sturgeon reasonably calculates that this is the moment to strike. The difficulties of the Northern Ireland backstop will pale into insignificance beside an Edinburgh one.
APR30	Why aren’t remain-backing parties doing more to attract young people?	Are we entering a new era of political campaigning? As Westminster grinds to a halt and the traditional party system teeters at the edge of collapse, those seeking progress need only look across the road to Parliament Square, where the grass is worn from a year of new protests and new faces. Young people have been a driving force in almost all of these. From school climate strikes, Extinction Rebellion occupations and multiple Brexit demonstrations, my generation has led a new, peaceful era of political campaigning.
APR30	Nigel Farage is fuelled by the betrayal myth. And Brexit is only the start	It is a grim reflection that no contemporary British politician better understands the networks, dynamics and ever-changing rules of modern politics than Nigel Farage. He is as effective as he is awful. His fledgling Brexit party is not fielding candidates in Thursday’s local elections – though its baleful spirit will surely loom over the battle for control of 248 English councils, in which the Tories are expected to suffer serious losses.
MAY1	With the delay to Brexit, Westminster has retreated into fantasy again	The eye of a hurricane can be strangely quiet – an ominous calm that presages collision with another wall of storm. There is something of that eeriness about the current lull in Brexit-related political frenzy. The wind dropped before Easter. The departure date was delayed to 31 October and parliament went into recess. MPs are now back in Westminster, and the crisis is not settled, yet there is still barely a breeze of urgency. When the cabinet met on Tuesday, Brexit was not even on the agenda. There is no significant government business scheduled for the Commons chamber all week. It is hard to legislate for life beyond Brexit without having legislated for Brexit first. But Theresa May still doesn’t have a majority for her deal, and Jeremy Corbyn has no interest in bailing her out with opposition votes.
MAY1	Judging by the Home Office, it’s now Tory policy to ruin Britain	It is now exactly a year since Amber Rudd resigned as home secretary, and it feels as if the Home Office is as broken as ever, if not more so. There is something of the bleakness of the Arab spring about it all. An unimaginable revolt happened, a despot was overthrown, and for a brief moment it seemed that the time of dystopian oppression was over, before the deep state regrouped and imposed a tyranny redux. Since Windrush, all we have seen is pathetic attempts at compensating victims, and more scandals. Presiding over it all is the new benevolent dictator Sajid Javid, who speaks in the language of a man who knows how to pay lip service to the forces that removed his predecessor, while doubling down on policies that have not changed, but are merely fronted by a new, more media-friendly face. One that does not hesitate to point out – as often as possible – that it is a brown one.
MAY1	Cambridge is right: you can’t take pride in the past and ignore the horror of slavery	There is almost nothing Oxbridge people enjoy more than a really intense, no holds barred argument about themselves. So it’s perhaps not surprising that the University of Cambridge’s decision to launch an inquiry into its links to the slave trade has prompted some soul searching. On the one hand is a student body increasingly vocal about the legacy of colonialism and academics arguing – as Prof Martin Millett, the archaeologist chairing a panel overseeing the work, does – that Cambridge must confront its own role in a shameful episode of history. On the other is a handful of academics grumbling about rewriting history and, no doubt, some unspoken fears about what all this is going to cost both financially and in curricular terms. After investigation invariably comes reparation.
MAY1	Labour needn’t worry: in its northern heartlands, Brexiters are not the only voices	“I voted out. Out means out and I’d do it again,” said the old man, as he harrumphed off up Kirkgate on his mobility scooter. Wakefield voted 66% to 34% in favour of leave, so here was the perfect vox pop. Bank it, let it stand for northern working-class leavedom and head back south? But what of the other voices I heard in the windswept West Yorkshire market precinct outside the cathedral? Fed-upness with all politics, indignation at Westminster chaos, resentment at three wasted years of empty argy-bargy. A few people said they wouldn’t vote again in another referendum, they were just too disillusioned. “Bring back Guy Fawkes!” one man joked. Plenty of well-justified grudge; but there were plenty of switchers too. Resentful, not ode-to-joy converts, but weary givers-in to the realities, trade-offs and hard choices that were never revealed during the referendum.
MAY1	Clinton-era politics refuses to die. Joe Biden is its zombie that staggers on	You cannot understand politics in America until you understand that in the Democratic party, which ostensibly represents the left side of our nation’s political spectrum, there are a significant number of people who genuinely believe that Joe Biden is the best possible presidential nominee. Their belief is not cynical, or at least not wholly cynical. His constituency is real. It is not illuminating to think of them just as centrists, arguing for the gentlest sprinkling of sugar over the top of America’s poison. It’s better to think of them as zombies: the product of three decades of self-serving, triangulating brainwashing. They are the Democrats who had their eyelids propped open and were forced to watch the Clinton era, year after year after year. It is not so much that they do not, deep down, harbor a vague wish for a better world; it is that, like stray dogs dining exclusively on garbage, life has taught them that this is the best that they will ever get.
MAY1	Tommy Robinson wants to be an MEP. But we in the north-west can stop him	Tommy Robinson, or Stephen Yaxley-Lennon if we want to refer to him by his real name, announced last week that he’s standing for the north-west of England in the European elections. The former British National party (BNP) member wants to take the same seat that his then leader Nick Griffin held from 2009 to 2014. Tommy Robinson is a far-right thug who went from being a member of the BNP to co-founding the English Defence League (EDL). He talks about standing up for ordinary working-class people but he is not interested in real solutions to the problems faced by the working classes in the north-west. His answer to the despair people feel after more than a decade of austerity and Tory attacks on the welfare state is to scapegoat Muslims and migrants. Robinson’s EDL was an inspiration for far-right terrorist Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway on 2011.
MAY1	Gwyneth Paltrow and Pete Buttigieg: a match made in intellectual hell	There are so many people running for president in the US, it is hard to keep track of who’s who. So let’s begin with a reminder that 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, known as Mayor Pete by those who like him and Mayo Pete by those who don’t, is the “Smart Candidate”. He speaks eight languages; he taught himself Norwegian so he could read an author’s untranslated work; he plays piano; he loves Ulysses. “Imagining yourself in a book club with Pete Buttigieg [is] this election’s having a beer with George W Bush,” the New York Times recently opined. It is not clear whether Gwyneth Paltrow has been imagining herself in a book club with Buttigieg, but the actor certainly fancies the well-read wunderkind for president. She will be co-hosting a fundraiser for the candidate on 9 May; tickets start at $250; $2,800 gets you a picture with the man himself. Knowing Paltrow, you might even get a Buttigieg-branded vagina egg to go home with.
MAY1	Of course the Victorians walked faster. They didn’t have Instagram and map apps	It turns out that for the past 127 years anyone following standard walking directions has unintentionally been playing a game of “Are you fitter than a Victorian mountaineer?” As a result, Ordnance Survey has finally decided that it is going to shake things up and provide 21st-century directions for 21st-century walkers, with an update to the way it works out how long a given walk should take. Something obvious you want to know before you lace up your walking boots and set off into the wilderness is when you might expect to reach your destination, and the standard rule of thumb for working out whether you’re about to set out on a brief stroll or a back-breaking endurance test was formulated by William Naismith, the founder of the Scottish Mountaineering Club, in 1892.
MAY1	Looking for comment on the royal baby? Don’t ask me	Here are some of the things that people are saying about mixed-race babies at the moment: websites have run stories about the “viral” mixed-race children of Instagram, who are trending because of their “gorgeous blonde hair, light eyes, and golden skin that looks like sand”. White teenagers – in conversations that I have both overheard and been privy to – say, “I really want to have kids with a black guy because mixed-race babies are so cute! I just love their curly hair, and oh my God, the ones with freckles.” The Kardashians, who have been accused by some people of turning that particular fantasy into reality, are a never-ending source of related commentary. Kylie Jenner is currently causing people to “fall all over themselves with praise” because she learned how to do her mixed-race daughter’s hair.
MAY2	The hounding of Greta Thunberg is proof that the right has run out of ideas	Over the past few days, something extraordinary has happened in our politics. A bunch of grown men have begun bullying a schoolgirl. Perhaps you already know who I mean: Greta Thunberg, she of the pigtails and school strikes, who came to Westminster last week and slammed adoring MPs for posturing rather than taking action on climate breakdown, then hoofed it over to St Pancras for the 36-hour train ride back to Stockholm. Which left the eco-denialists back here with a stonking great headache: how to bash this 16-year-old celeb? Not by dismantling her arguments, not when the scientists and Sir David of Blue Planet back her up. Nor by sniffing around her record, since by definition a teenager hasn’t much of a past to rake over. The standard methods of political warfare off-limits to them, they are trying something new and unusual. They are sinking their teeth into her.
MAY2	Jeremy Corbyn is either blind to antisemitism – or he just doesn’t care	I’m trying to imagine the left’s reaction if it emerged that a leading politician had once lavished praise on a century-old book that not only trotted out racist stereotypes about, say, black people and their supposed characteristics, but whose central thesis rested on an ancient, hostile assumption about that group. Would good, progressive folk be rushing to defend that politician by saying the author of the book in question had also written lots of important, non-offensive things, and that other people had quoted that author too, so this was a fuss about nothing – or would they be appalled and even sickened that a contemporary politician could praise such a text without so much as mentioning the racism within it? It turns out that the answer is: it depends which side the politician is on, and also perhaps which ethnic minority is involved. If the politician is the current leader of the Labour party and the minority involved are Jews, well, then it seems the usual progressive reflexes don’t always kick in.
MAY2	Poverty is holding Britain’s young people back. They deserve so much better	As A-level exams draw nearer, I have returned to teaching Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. A cautionary tale on being wedded to an ideal that is unattainable, it has left my students ultimately frustrated with the central character, Willy. Why can’t he think outside the box he hems himself into, they wonder. He could have been bolder with his ambitions in the way we, their teachers, encourage them to be. Making young people aspirational is the bread and butter of teachers everywhere. It forms the background noise of our daily dealings with our students. Each lesson of each day, we bargain with them: if you stop fidgeting and concentrate, if you apply yourself with maximum effort, you will, eventually, be rewarded. For students from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds, it’s a carrot forever dangled before them. Hard work begets success, a future of fulfilment and financial ease they are told. Will Smith said so in his umpteenth motivational video, so it must be true. What is left unspoken, but no less definitively delivered, is that failure can only be considered a predictable result of indolence.
MAY2	High streets can be saved. Here’s how to reinvent them for the 21st century	The statistics on high-street decline are bewildering. The average high street in England and Wales has lost 40 shops in the past five years. More than 160,000 retail jobs are expected to be lost this year. After a certain point, the numbers stop meaning anything. We lose sight of the real picture. So when Debenhams last week named the 22 stores it plans to close in 2020, many will have tuned out. Haven’t we heard this before? But in reality, that announcement will have hit people hard – and not just because of the 1,200 jobs at risk. In Ashford and Kirkcaldy, the Debenhams closures come soon after the shuttering of the local Marks & Spencer. Wolverhampton’s Debenhams only opened in 2017 amid much fanfare that this was the start of a new wave of regeneration. Make no mistake, these announcements matter.
MAY4	Could Penny Mordaunt become Theresa May’s emotionally intelligent successor?	When Penny Mordaunt moved into her ministerial office in the Department for International Development, she was offered a choice of items from the government art collection to adorn the walls. It’s a perilous process for any politician – choose something classic and appear uncool, go for something contemporary and risk looking try-hard – or worse, if you’re a Tory politician, have the artist declare that they despise the government. As communities secretary, Eric Pickles tried to show he had an open mind with both a portrait of Benjamin Disraeli and William Gladstone, while George Osborne caused a stir by picking Grayson Perry’s Print for a Politician. Mordaunt in the end opted for neither option. She shunned the convention – and the collection – instead bringing in her own picture from home: of Admiral Lord Nelson. Expect the same picture to hang in her new office in the Ministry of Defence following Mordaunt’s promotion this week to one of the great offices of state, in the wake of Gavin Williamson’s sacking for allegedly leaking details of a National Security Council meeting to the press.
MAY4	It’s hard for us on the Israeli left – liberal antisemitism makes it worse	The New York Times apologised this week for a cartoon published recently in its international edition. The drawing was of a blind Donald Trump, wearing a skullcap, led by the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was depicted as a dog wearing a star of David collar. The cartoon evoked caricatures of evil Jews misleading blind nations, of a kind popular in the German media during the Nazi era. The reaction in both the US and Israel was first shock, then a furore. The cartoon couldn’t have come at a worse time – the San Diego synagogue shooting last weekend proved that antisemitism is still deeply rooted in the US. And it came just as Israel prepared to remember 6 million Jews on the national Holocaust Remembrance Day. For New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, the cartoon “checked so many antisemitic boxes that the only thing missing was a dollar sign”. The Jew in the form of a dog; the small cunning Jew leading a naive American; hated Trump depicted as blind and Judaised, a puppet of the Jewish state (as if Trump needs Netanyahu to make him act the way he does).
MAY4	Kids hugging: that’s no big deal. Or so I used to think	I don’t remember being ordered to hug people when I was a child, but I remember being made to hold hands. Sweaty, papery, vice-like, limp – God, all the hands one has to hold as a child. It’s not a big deal. And of course it’s unavoidable, for safety, but I remember disliking it: the sense of obligation, and the fact you never knew what hand you would get. Long after the fact, there came a moment when I realised, merciful heaven, I didn’t have to hold any more hands. Hugs were different, a social necessity rather a safety measure, and in the 1970s and 80s (and probably 90s) they were also something from which you couldn’t opt out. Again, it didn’t seem like a big deal at the time. There were circumstances in which it was polite to offer a hug and polite to accept one. Weathering a bad hug meant standing still while someone crushed you vaguely to their midsection before wandering off to do something else. If you didn’t enjoy this, too bad.
MAY4	Men, don’t fear the snip – it’s the best way to share the burden of birth control	My husband doesn’t want a vasectomy. I don’t blame him: it might be a 15-minute procedure carried out under local anaesthetic, but it’s not exactly a spa treatment. When I suggested it might be the answer to our family planning, he winced and joked that he had “seen what the snip did to the dog”. He’s not alone in his reticence; there was a 64% decline in the number of men getting the procedure in the 10 years to 2015. But the thing is, he and I have finished having babies and I feel like my turn should be over. A vasectomy would feel like a feminist action on his part, an acknowledgment of everything I have been through that has got us to this point in our lives.
MAY4	William Barr is acting like Trump's henchman	William Barr has shown himself to be a loyal foot soldier for the president who appointed him. From his 24 March summary of the “principal conclusions” of the Mueller report to his press conference on the day he released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress, to his testimony on Wednesday before the Senate judiciary committee, Barr’s recent performances have demonstrated the extreme loyalty Donald Trump found wanting in his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions. And what is good for the president is bad for America.
MAY5	A girls’ night out with the PM and her posse for £135,000? Bargain	As if Conservative donors were not resentful enough – where they haven’t already complied with Boris Johnson’s injunction to fuck off – it is now clear, thanks to the Treasury secretary, Liz Truss, by what a prodigious margin some of them must have overpaid for a basic minister experience. It’s ages since a party chairman quoted £250,000 as the starting price to get near David Cameron. A photograph posted on Truss’s Instagram account last week showed six female cabinet members and the prime minister assembled beside a wealthy woman of Russian origin. Lubov Chernukhin had gifted herself their presence (in an auction at the latest Black and White Tory fundraiser) for £135,000: ie, less than £20,000 apiece for hours of proximity to Karen Bradley (Northern Ireland secretary), Baroness Evans (leader of the Lords), Caroline Nokes (immigration), Amber Rudd, Andrea Leadsom, Truss and – smiling alongside Mrs C – Theresa May.
MAY5	Is Line of Duty Britain’s first gender-neutral police drama?	At the time of writing, there was no way of knowing how Line of Duty will unfold. Will Superintendent Ted Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, be revealed as criminal overlord H? Will the antidote finally be found to stop characters saying “OCG” every 20 seconds? Over on Sky Arts, a South Bank Show, featuring writer Jed Mercurio interviewed by Melvyn Bragg, looks interesting. I’ve long been impressed by Mercurio’s penchant for stuffing his dramas full of working-class talent.
MAY5	Jamie Bell and why it’s time to talk turkey about accents	By This Morning’s standards, its interview with Jamie Bell, who stars as Bernie Taupin in the new Elton John biopic, Rocketman, was pretty by the book. The mid-morning show has, after all, featured women who have had sexual encounters with ghosts (more than once), Phillip Schofield testing a nipple clamp, celebrity foot readings and a woman with a phobia of Simon Cowell, so a promotional chat for a film was unlikely to be “weirdest daytime TV moments ever” listicle fodder. Bell came across well, was enthusiastic about Rocketman and happy to talk about his career. But, as one tabloid pointed out, “viewers [were] left confused by [his] American twang”. Bell, who is from Teesside but has lived in the US for the past 15 or so years, has picked up a bit of an accent by not living in the place he’s from for pretty much half of his life and noticing when people have picked up a bit of an accent is something of a national sport.
MAY5	Thursday's results mean there's only one way forward: ask the people	Local elections are inevitably – and rightly – about local issues but there’s no getting away from the reality that Brexit played a big part in the shocking results that began rolling in on Thursday night. Those votes make clear that a general election would not deliver a decisive victory to either side. A new parliament would be just as split – both on Brexit and on all the other issues that face our country – as the existing one. The Tories had a catastrophic night losing more than 1,300 seats, but Labour’s support is draining away as well. John McDonnell said on the evening of polling day that he expected more than 400 gains. And, 48 hours later, it looks like Labour has lost almost 100 councillors since these seats were last up for election in 2015, when we had one of the worst results in the history of our party.
MAY5	Labour’s bid for leave voters is failing. It must now look to remainers	The voters blow a big raspberry to the two main parties and both react the same way: “OK, OK, we hear you. You just want us to get on with Brexit.” That was the line following Thursday’s council elections across much of England from both the prime minister and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell – although the latter was quick to clarify that when he tweeted “‘Brexit – sort it.’ Message received” that didn’t, strictly speaking, mean he wanted Brexit to happen, just that the issue needed to be sorted out “whichever way”. So that clears that up. Reading losses for both the governing and main opposition parties as a rejection of their handling of the issue that has consumed them both has an obvious logic. It’s a logic likely to gain extra force in less than three weeks, when Nigel Farage’s Brexit party could well top the poll at the European elections. Why else would voters call down a plague on both the Tory and Labour houses unless they were furious at their failure to implement what the public voted for in 2016?
MAY5	Is fair play in running more important than fairness to Caster Semenya as a human?	When she was a girl, growing up in rural South Africa, the runner Caster Semenya would sometimes face a humiliating ritual before a race. She grew accustomed, her coaches once said, to having to retreat to the bathroom with a member of a suspicious rival athletics team and physically show them that she was not a boy. From her childhood, people had gossiped about her body; by the time she had begun competing internationally she must have been used to the whispers, the open stares in changing rooms. All her life she has been portrayed as a freak, an anomaly of nature undeserving of her gold medals. And as if having her femaleness constantly questioned wasn’t enough, as a black South African athlete and a lesbian she attracts more than her share of kneejerk prejudice. To argue that this Olympic athlete has somehow had it easy because of her biology feels grotesque, in the circumstances. But nothing about this case is simple.
MAY5	Goodbye, intrepid soldier Gavin Williamson – here are your best bits!	Straight off the bat, I’ll remind you that Gavin Williamson’s Instagram avatar is a picture of him standing in a risk-free environment in a flak jacket, and we’ll go from there. Everyone’s favourite purchaser of Action Man toys has been sacked from the cabinet after being fingered for a leak from the National Security Council (NSC). The defence secretary leaking from a national security meeting is not the best look, but is anybody really surprised? If Williamson worked for MI5, he would be sure to mention it at every single party he wasn’t invited to.
MAY5	Countryside versus town? Please don’t turn this into a culture war	Selina Scott is rewilding her 200-acre farm on the edge of the North York Moors. She says she reluctantly decided to control crows to protect endangered ground-nesting birds, including lapwing and curlew, that nest on her new wetlands. But the Yorkshire-born broadcaster- turned-farmer complains she cannot save her threatened birds because her brother, Robin (a former editor of Sporting Gun magazine), is now banned from shooting the crows that prey on helpless chicks. Town and country need each other. From one flows ideas and people. The other provides peace and quiet, space and food
MAY5	It’s hard for us on the Israeli left – liberal antisemitism makes it worse	The New York Times apologised this week for a cartoon published recently in its international edition. The drawing was of a blind Donald Trump, wearing a skullcap, led by the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was depicted as a dog wearing a star of David collar. The cartoon evoked caricatures of evil Jews misleading blind nations, of a kind popular in the German media during the Nazi era. The reaction in both the US and Israel was first shock, then a furore. The cartoon couldn’t have come at a worse time – the San Diego synagogue shooting last weekend proved that antisemitism is still deeply rooted in the US. And it came just as Israel prepared to remember 6 million Jews on the national Holocaust Remembrance Day. For New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, the cartoon “checked so many antisemitic boxes that the only thing missing was a dollar sign”. The Jew in the form of a dog; the small cunning Jew leading a naive American; hated Trump depicted as blind and Judaised, a puppet of the Jewish state (as if Trump needs Netanyahu to make him act the way he does).
MAY5	The silence on Christian persecution is because of trade, not political correctness	The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has been denouncing the persecution of Christians around the world in advance of a report he has commissioned from the Bishop of Truro. It’s true, and important, that Christians are being persecuted in large numbers, especially in the Middle East, and that this has been largely ignored by the British media for decades. But there is something very jarring in Hunt’s discovery of their cause. In remarks to the press in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, one of the oldest Christian countries in the world, he blamed “political correctness” as well as post-colonial guilt for the British indifference to the suffering of Christians in Asia and Africa. There is certainly some truth to these accusations. The view that all religious believers were weird at best, and that anyone enlightened must be an atheist, were quite fashionable in the early years of this century. It was usually expressed as hostility to Muslims as much as in indifference to the sufferings of Christians – but it certainly wasn’t sympathy.
MAY6	Saudi Arabia’s sudden interest in Sudan is not about friendship. It is about fear	In the days following the Yom Kippur war, after the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, agreed to a ceasefire and subsequent peace treaty with Israel, he faced questions at home about his climbdown. When confronted on his capitulation, he is reported to have said that he was prepared for battle with Israel but not with America. On the third day of the war, President Nixon had authorised Operation Nickel Grass, an airlift from the United States with the purpose of replenishing Israel’s military losses up to that point. In November of 1973, the New York Times reported that “Western ambassadors in Cairo confirm Egyptian accusations that American Galaxies were landing war equipment in the Sinai.” There was something of Sadat’s realpolitik in the realisation over the past few weeks that Saudi Arabia has no intention of letting Sudan’s revolution achieve its objective of removing the military once and for all and installing a civilian government. In the period preceding the revolution, Saudi Arabia had grown relatively lethargic and jaded about Sudan, a country it saw as good only for providing bodies as battle fodder for its war in Yemen. When Sudan’s then president, Omar al-Bashir, fearful of his demise, took his begging bowl to his allies in the region, Saudi Arabia demurred. But this lack of interest evaporated the moment it became clear that there was real power in Sudan’s streets, and Bashir was deposed.
MAY6	Don’t look to national politics for hope: you’ll find it thriving in local councils	Last Friday morning, my head spun. Having voted in two local elections – for our town and district councils – and then spent the first few hours of the next day following the results, my partner and I got our polling cards for yet another contest. This caused a brief fit of amusement about Brexit Britain’s weird addiction to sending us to polling stations, before we realised we had effectively received our tickets for an awful reality TV show. Thanks chiefly to Nigel Farage’s Brexit party and the pithily named Change UK – the Independent Group – many of the contestants in the looming European elections form a rum old crowd. From a former BBC newsreader, through superannuated Tories and newspaper columnists, on to the former editor of the lads’ magazine Loaded, with the independent candidate who calls himself Tommy Robinson as the rubbish punchline. God knows what the poor souls who have diligently served as MEPs must feel about this sudden gatecrashing of their world: here is yet another woeful instalment of the Brexit drama, now replayed by celebrity leave and remain campaigners as a pantomime of futile gestures.
MAY6	For our dedicated food readers, the dinner is in the detail	It is delicious to think that the Guardian’s weekly food magazine, Feast, now comes, along with the other Saturday supplements, in a compostable bag made partly from potatoes. Selection, preparation, presentation and consumption of food is universal. Readers care about the topic and have a lot of knowledge to contribute. Constructive contact is regular among readers, my office and the editorial team involved in this heartily appreciated section of the Guardian (and Observer). Inevitably, my office may be involved when things go wrong, but overwhelmingly things go right. I may use corrections here to illustrate points, but I write in praise of what is a skilful and sophisticated journalistic operation. Thought goes into what ingredients are seasonal and sustainable. Footnotes give specific fish sustainability policy for each of the UK, US and Australia. Expertise and practicality are prized and shared.
MAY6	Why are so many afraid to confront Britain’s historical links with the slave trade?	Seldom have so many people taken to print and the airwaves to make the case for academic incuriosity. Rarely has the search for new knowledge, undertaken by a university of world renown, been so vocally condemned. That is what happened when Cambridge University announced a new academic research project to determine the extent to which the university (although not its wealthy colleges) “contributed to, benefited from or challenged” slavery and the slave trade. Cambridge and its colleges are rich. Staggeringly rich. And – spoiler alert – some of the gifts and bequests buried deep within that mountain of wealth will have come from benefactors who were slave traders and slave owners. This is true of other universities, here and abroad. Yet the same commentators who endlessly accuse students of being closed to new ideas and unwilling to face uncomfortable facts have rushed to condemn the university’s investigation into its own past. Their argument, in essence, is that we’re better off not knowing.
MAY6	A cynical Westminster fix won’t end the Brexit nightmares of May and Corbyn	British politics was designed to be idiot-proof. It had some simple rules that anyone could follow. One of the most basic of those rules was the law of the seesaw. When one of the major parties plunged, the other soared. A terrible day for the Tories would be a triumphant day for Labour and vice versa. This previously reliable rule is one of the many that has been unravelled by Brexit. It is now possible for both the major parties and their leaders to be in crisis at the same time. It is also possible for neither party to be able to agree how to extract themselves from their respective emergencies. The latest evidence of this is provided by the local elections and the conflicting responses of both Tories and Labour people to results that were harrowing for each.
MAY6	Caster Semenya is a victim of rules that are confusing and unfair	Should women with naturally elevated levels of testosterone be able to compete in women’s events? That’s the question with which athletics has been grappling over the past decade. Last week, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), international sport’s highest court, ruled that such athletes could be banned unless they took medication to reduce their testosterone levels. The Cas case had been brought by Caster Semenya, the South African Olympic champion, who, after winning her stunning 30th consecutive 800m victory in Doha on Friday, insisted that she would carry on racing in middle distance events, but would not take testosterone-reducing medication. From the moment she burst on to the international stage a decade ago, questions were raised about her sex. Semenya is hyperandrogenic – she has a much higher level of testosterone than most women.
MAY6	A girls’ night out with the PM and her posse for £135,000? Bargain	As if Conservative donors were not resentful enough – where they haven’t already complied with Boris Johnson’s injunction to fuck off – it is now clear, thanks to the Treasury secretary, Liz Truss, by what a prodigious margin some of them must have overpaid for a basic minister experience. It’s ages since a party chairman quoted £250,000 as the starting price to get near David Cameron. A photograph posted on Truss’s Instagram account last week showed six female cabinet members and the prime minister assembled beside a wealthy woman of Russian origin. Lubov Chernukhin had gifted herself their presence (in an auction at the latest Black and White Tory fundraiser) for £135,000: ie, less than £20,000 apiece for hours of proximity to Karen Bradley (Northern Ireland secretary), Baroness Evans (leader of the Lords), Caroline Nokes (immigration), Amber Rudd, Andrea Leadsom, Truss and – smiling alongside Mrs C – Theresa May.
MAY6	Remember Orwell’s chilling warning to boot-licking propagandists...	The Labour left presumptuously claims to represent the British tradition of dissent, but never tolerates dissent against its command and control politics. At the meeting of Labour’s national executive committee last Tuesday, to take the most recent example, Diane Abbott preferred abandoning a lifetime of support for the EU to accepting a challenge to the party line.
MAY6	The infected blood inquiry reminds us we need a less painful way to deal with health failings	No one watching the heartfelt testimony of witnesses – patients, family members, and carers – at the opening sessions of the infected blood inquiry could fail to be moved. The inquiry will examine how and why thousands of people were given blood infected with hepatitis and HIV in the 1980s, the harm this caused, and how government then dealt with this avoidable tragedy and its consequences. However, you have to ask: why do we need public inquiries like this one, and what do they achieve? Just as importantly, why do we have so many of them? In healthcare alone, alongside the infected blood scandal, there’s an inquiry into disgraced breast surgeon Ian Paterson; the recent Gosport Memorial Hospital panel report; and a trail of past cases too long to list in full (Bristol, Shipman, Mid-Staffs). The bald truth is that most public inquiries represent a double failure. First, the organisations and systems that should keep people safe and deal immediately and effectively with any problems with the quality of care have failed, often over many years. Second, the authorities that investigate complaints and problems – which in health include the General Medical Council, the Department of Health (DoH) and, in some cases, the police – also failed.
MAY6	It was all going well until the nail polish incident...	One way to look at parenthood is as perpetual failure. Taking full responsibility for the upbringing and socialisation of another human from birth through to adulthood means that, at some point, you are going to find you’ve messed things up. Don’t console yourself that cheap calories and modern medicine mean your children are vastly less likely to die than they would have been in previous generations. This simply opens new realms for you to screw up and feel terrible about.
MAY7	Loss of biodiversity is just as catastrophic as climate change	A colleague recently described how fish would swim into her clothing when she was a child bathing in the ocean off the coast of Vietnam, but today the fish are gone and her children find the story far-fetched. Another recalled his experiences just last year in Cape Town – one of the world’s most attractive tourism and leisure destinations – when more than 2 million people faced the nightmare prospect of all taps, in every home and business, running dry.
MAY7	Sorry, Emma Thompson, but you’ll never be perfect enough to save the planet	Hold the front page: Emma Thompson, protester against climate change, scourge of the fossil fuel industry, herself takes aeroplanes. There she was, bold as brass, in a seat, about to burn through rainforests of unknown dimensions with her cross-Atlantic travel, on the cover of the Mail on Sunday. On some level we must have known this all along, since mostly she is in the UK, sometimes she is in the United States, and we know (although sometimes I wonder) she isn’t magic. But still, doesn’t that put the old tin lid on it? What’s the point of it all, when even people who care about the future and believe in science aren’t perfect?
MAY7	Looking for comment on the royal baby? Don’t ask me	Here are some of the things that people are saying about mixed-race babies at the moment: websites have run stories about the “viral” mixed-race children of Instagram, who are trending because of their “gorgeous blonde hair, light eyes, and golden skin that looks like sand”. White teenagers – in conversations that I have both overheard and been privy to – say, “I really want to have kids with a black guy because mixed-race babies are so cute! I just love their curly hair, and oh my God, the ones with freckles.” The Kardashians, who have been accused by some people of turning that particular fantasy into reality, are a never-ending source of related commentary. Kylie Jenner is currently causing people to “fall all over themselves with praise” because she learned how to do her mixed-race daughter’s hair.
MAY7	If Labour really wants to move on, it has to back a second referendum	Since the local elections, protagonists on either side of the Brexit divide have sought to marshal the poor result for Labour to advance their cause. Predictably, many MPs from leave-supporting areas have argued that it means Labour has to deliver on the referendum result; their remain-supporting counterparts argue that the strong performance of the Liberal Democrats and Greens means Labour should come out unambiguously as the “party of remain”. Here’s an alternative strategy. Politics is not about two competing answers to the same question; it is about which question is being asked in the first place. So the core strategic insight of the Labour leadership is correct: that so long as the question is Brexit, the party will suffer at the polls. That means Labour’s primary political objective should be to change the question away from Brexit and towards domestic concerns. Put simply, to move on.
MAY7	I’m a Labour MP, and a second referendum was a difficult sell on the doorstep	On Thursday evening in the local elections, Labour had disappointing results in some parts of the country. But it was a mixed bag. Amid the raging “what does it mean for Brexit?” discussions, we made gains in key marginal constituencies, which, on the basis of the vote share, mean Labour would win bellwether seats that we need to form the next government. By contrast, the Tories had one of the worst kickings from the electorate in recent memory – to misquote the Liberal Democrats, they were losing everywhere. Their disintegration in Westminster was mirrored by their woeful performance on the ground, and it’s only the fear that grips the Tories and their wealthy backers of a radical, redistributive Labour government that is slowing its inevitable collapse.
MAY7	Convinced this stitch-up can end the Brexit ordeal? Think again	Those who argue for a people’s vote on Brexit are frequently warned that a fresh referendum would infuriate millions of voters who thought they had made their position perfectly clear in 2016. It would be idle to deny that many might indeed be affronted – especially if the campaign to stay in the European Union were foolish enough to frame the argument as a rematch rather than as a completely new judgment upon the shambles of the past three years. But the anger that such a vote could conceivably trigger is as nothing compared with the democratic recoil there will be from the Labour-Conservative stitch-up that many at the apex of both parties now favour.
MAY7	Women dressed ‘provocatively’ are being arrested in Nigeria. The law’s still failing us	Nigerian media has been awash with news of a recent police raid in the capital, Abuja, in which dozens of women were arrested in and around nightclubs on charges of prostitution. A city official said one way police assessed the potential guilt of the women was if they were dressed “provocatively”. No men were arrested in the raid. There was also an ominously conspicuous absence of any evidence of soliciting, which is a crime under Nigerian law. Most alarming of all, there are witness reports of rape, sexual assault and financial extortion of the women by the policemen who arrested them. Some of the women were taken to a mobile court and allegedly pressured to plead guilty to charges of prostitution on the spot. Such arrests don't just disregard due process but send a clear message as to who's in charge: men
MAY7	It is not up to the UK government to decide whether I’m Irish or not	The Good Friday agreement is widely revered as a model of peace and celebrated worldwide. Yet the Home Office has openly disregarded the agreement, and is actively seeking to undermine its very foundation. I should know: I have spent the past four years in legal proceedings battling the Home Office. The people of Northern Ireland are unique within the UK in that we have the birthright to identify and be accepted as Irish or British or both. However, contrary to the statutory duty on the Home Office to accept the birthright provisions of the Good Friday agreement, it is arguing through the British courts that the people of Northern Ireland are “automatically British” as we were “clearly born in the United Kingdom”. The department regularly and repeatedly forces British citizenship on Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland – citizens who are Irish by birth and by choice – a choice the people of this island voted for overwhelmingly in the Good Friday agreement referendum. With Brexit on the horizon, and EU citizens’ rights in the balance, the situation has become urgent.
MAY7	From Spain to Turkey, the rise of the far right is a clash of cultures not civilisations	I spent part of my childhood in Ankara and part of it in Madrid. Commuting between Spain and Turkey in the early 1980s was a strange experience. Spain had recently returned to democracy after years of dictatorship, and Turkey had experienced yet another military coup. Both countries were at the fringes of Europe, neither part of the EU. It was said that “Europe finishes at the start of the Pyrenees”, but if the mountain range between France and Spain was regarded as a border, another frontier was the waters of the Bosphorus. It often felt as though I was travelling from one end of Europe to the other. The Spain that I experienced was vibrant, welcoming and warm-hearted. Despite the occasional pro-Franco mutterings of an older generation, Spain embraced democracy. How I wanted my motherland to follow suit. But one day, on my way to school, I saw something that made me stop in my tracks. All the walls down the street were plastered with posters of dead babies thrown into bins. I froze. The disturbing and distorted images had been distributed by an ultraconservative Catholic group that claimed family values were being attacked, women had gone too far in the name of emancipation. A patriarchal backlash still lurked under the surface. The culture wars were under way.
MAY7	Universal basic income doesn’t work. Let’s boost the public realm instead	A study published this week sheds doubt on ambitious claims made for universal basic income (UBI), the scheme that would give everyone regular, unconditional cash payments that are enough to live on. Its advocates claim it would help to reduce poverty, narrow inequalities and tackle the effects of automation on jobs and income. Research conducted for Public Services International, a global trade union federation, reviewed for the first time 16 practical projects that have tested different ways of distributing regular cash payments to individuals across a range of poor, middle-income and rich countries, as well as copious literature on the topic. It could find no evidence to suggest that such a scheme could be sustained for all individuals in any country in the short, medium or longer term – or that this approach could achieve lasting improvements in wellbeing or equality. The research confirms the importance of generous, non-stigmatising income support, but everything turns on how much money is paid, under what conditions and with what consequences for the welfare system as a whole.
MAY8	Britain needs to recognise Palestine as an independent state	Over the Bank Holiday weekend, coinciding with the start of the Ramadan fast for Muslims and the run-up to Israel’s Independence Day, it was touch and go whether the latest outbreak of violence – fatalities on the border, rockets fired into Israel, airstrikes against the Gaza Strip – would escalate into all-out war. Twenty-five Palestinians and four Israelis was a modest death toll compared with summer 2014, when 2,250 Palestinians and 67 Israelis were killed in Operation Protective Edge. The ceasefire negotiated by Egypt and the UN should ease the punishing blockade imposed by Israel since the Islamists of Hamas took over Gaza in 2007. Millions of dollars donated by the Gulf state of Qatar will continue to pay official salaries and help needy families. Palestinian fishermen will be able to operate farther out to sea. Electricity and fuel supplies should be boosted.
MAY8	So Harry and Meghan want to do things differently? Fat chance of that	What a curious nation we are, that thinks itself modern because a man who is sixth in line to the throne marries a woman of mixed heritage – but is then expected to provide a level of gynaecological detail about her pregnancy and labour that is frankly weird. Prince Harry’s goofy happiness at becoming a father is, of course, lovely to behold. No one begrudges the man who walked behind his mother’s coffin a rush of joy at the birth of his first child. He is just like every other sleep-deprived new dad. So “relatable”, so human and ordinary.
MAY8	No wonder transport in the north is pitiful. Money is on a one-way path to London	To live outside London and not drive a car is an exercise in resilience and stoicism. In the north-west of England, where I live, public transport exists mainly to drive people bonkers. If you’ve lived in London or the south-east, as I did for many years, the effects of extreme regional inequality are plain to see as soon as you step on to a bus or train. Distances that took half an hour to cover in London can take three times as long and cost twice as much. I’m lucky: I can afford £2.40 for a single bus fare (as opposed to £1.50 in London). Yet everyday journeys on public transport are blighted by car-oriented planning, deregulation and a lack of investment, none of which apply in the capital. If that doesn’t illustrate how underinvestment reduces productivity and destroys quality of life, I don’t know what can.
MAY8	It’s not just Cambridge University – all of Britain benefited from slavery	Cambridge University has announced that it will finally – just two centuries after the abolition of slavery and about 80 years after the end of the British empire – conduct an “in-depth academic study into ways in which it contributed to, benefited from or challenged the Atlantic slave trade and other forms of coerced labour during the colonial era”. I’m not sure “in-depth” is how I would describe an inquiry which omits all 31 of its colleges, which hold most of the wealth in Cambridge, and some of which already have verified slavery connections. And it is worth pointing out that, while Cambridge has framed this inquiry as part of its “race equality initiatives”, this conversation was forced on it by students, activists and brave academics.
MAY8	The only Brexit is a hard-right one. Labour must back another vote	As the Labour party resumes negotiations with what can only be described as Theresa May’s faction of government, Labour members and voters across the country are increasingly concerned as to what any deal might look like – especially as the local election results are used to justify each and every option. But there is something that all of us in the Labour movement need to keep at the forefront of our minds – something substantive we have learned since the Brexit referendum. While Brexit voters come from all classes and all political stripes and voted Brexit for many different reasons, the people driving Brexit in the Tory party have a very specific economic agenda – one that is now at the heart of these negotiations. Labour is the party of social solidarity and the Tories want Brexit because they want to destroy social solidarity in Britain. To all intents and purposes, they want to eliminate the Labour movement.
MAY8	Something is going very wrong for vulnerable kids – but is the school to blame?	Whose fault is it that more children are being excluded from schools? Teachers, parents, politicians and seemingly everyone else with a passing interest in children’s long-term happiness have been arguing over this one for years but now a long-awaited review of exclusions from the former schools minister Edward Timpson is shedding some carefully filtered light on the question.
MAY8	Young people could turn the Brexit tide – if they register to vote today	To vote in May’s election you must be registered to vote, be 18 or over on 23 May, be a British, Irish, or qualifying Commonwealth citizen, or a citizen of an EU country other than Malta and Cyprus. You have to be either resident at an address in the UK, and not be legally excluded from voting – or be a British citizen living abroad, in which case you can vote in European elections for up to 15 years after you have left the country. If you are not already on the electoral roll, you can register to vote online. You may need your national insurance or passport number.
MAY8	Looking for comment on the royal baby? Don’t ask me	Here are some of the things that people are saying about mixed-race babies at the moment: websites have run stories about the “viral” mixed-race children of Instagram, who are trending because of their “gorgeous blonde hair, light eyes, and golden skin that looks like sand”. White teenagers – in conversations that I have both overheard and been privy to – say, “I really want to have kids with a black guy because mixed-race babies are so cute! I just love their curly hair, and oh my God, the ones with freckles.” The Kardashians, who have been accused by some people of turning that particular fantasy into reality, are a never-ending source of related commentary. Kylie Jenner is currently causing people to “fall all over themselves with praise” because she learned how to do her mixed-race daughter’s hair.
MAY8	Racism in political parties reflects pervasive prejudice in Brexit Britain	It’s hard to avoid noticing that most of our political parties seem to be embroiled in rows over racism and prejudices. Two Conservative local election candidates were suspended over racist social media posts last week – and that’s after a steady drip of revelations over Islamophobic comments made by members and candidates alike. Labour suspended several local election candidates over antisemitic comments and is still accused of failing to tackle hundreds of complaints of antisemitism within the party. Now, new political parties are apparently keen to catch on. Few will have had the highest expectations of Nigel Farage’s latest vehicle, the Brexit party – or, indeed, of his old one, Ukip. But, for some, hopes were set higher with Change UK – where one candidate for the European election resigned after sexist and racist tweets he wrote were uncovered, while another did so just a day earlier, having made disparaging comments about Romanian people in 2017. Another of its candidates is accused of Islamophobia (though she has refuted this). This is the party that was accused of racism within hours of launching, in February, when one of its members referred to people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds (BAME) as being of a “funny tinge”, although she apologised. Predictably, all of this has fuelled the never-ending political game of “your party is more racist than my party”. This depressingly superficial approach feeds into a standard response pattern. Assuming parties get beyond kneejerk denialism (granted, a big assumption - since this has been at points the response from both main parties), candidates or members making prejudiced comments are ejected or deselected, and this process is itself held up as proof of taking racism seriously. Such a response, if done transparently and speedily, is welcome and promotes trust in a complaints process. But this approach does not get to why it keeps happening – and across our political parties – in the first place.
MAY8	I love swimming, but I’m sick of the sexist behaviour in British pools	A friend told me recently that of all animals, I most resemble a Shetland pony. In other words, my physique doesn’t exactly scream “athlete”. And so, when I go swimming, it comes as something of a surprise to others that I am actually quite good at it. The more I swim, the more I notice that a not-insignificant number of men seem to take against my swimming abilities, and respond with an array of irritating behaviours. They push in front of me, they take up the whole lane, or – my personal favourite – they expend all of their energy on overtaking me, just to prove that they can, and then spend the rest of the lap swimming desperately slowly in front of me.
MAY9	Brexit has robbed Labour of its insurgency. It’s time to claw it back	The supposed iron law of British politics – back when an economy dominated by Big Finance seemed to be a never-ending fountain of growth and tax revenues – used to go like this: you had to present yourself as a steady pair of hands, pro-business, competent, exuding stability, not someone to rock the hull of HMS Britain. Tony Blair, speaking of Margaret Thatcher, once described his political formula: “I always thought my job was to build on some of the things she had done rather than reverse them.” But whether you’re a politician of left, right or so-called “centre”, insurgency has become the iron law of our time. Labour has been robbed of that sense of insurgency by Brexit: its political fortunes depend on reclaiming it.
MAY9	Welcome to team Archie, royal baby. Here are some tips from an old hand	Well, I’m sure we all know why I’m here, don’t we? So let’s get on with it. Here is my advice for my adorable little namesake – although, quite honestly, all he has done so far is cause me unending quantities of grief. So if you ever come across this when you can read, Arch, in the long run an OBE would seem about right. Anyway, welcome to team Archie, and: Be grateful it’s not Archibald 
MAY9	‘Global Britain’ is doing its foreign policy on autopilot	The European elections Theresa May never intended Britain to participate in are now only two weeks away. They are inevitably being fought as a proxy contest for Brexit by all the political parties. The results will be interpreted as a verdict on Brexit too, just as last week’s English local elections have been, and probably in much the same careless way. Yet it would be a stretch to pretend that, for once in our recent history, the UK’s European elections are actually focusing on Britain’s and Europe’s place in the 21st-century world. The truth is far less flattering. These elections can better be understood as another episode in the national – and, in particular, Conservative – trauma over the historic decline of British power, of which the referendum was an interim climax. The elections are therefore unlikely to be cathartic or cleansing. On the contrary, they are dragging us deeper into the ongoing psychodrama that was intensified by the vote in 2016.
MAY9	Young Brits say they are having less sex. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing	Too much porn. Too much screen time. Too much anxiety. Too little alcohol. There are myriad theories about why the British are having less sex – but none of them seems to offer relief. Importantly, it’s not because we feel we’re already having enough. And that’s according to the 34,000 Brits who took part in research between 2001 and 2012. During that period, the percentage of men and women reporting that they had not had sex in the last month (defined as vaginal, oral or anal sex with opposite or same-sex partners) rose to 29% overall, from 26% of men and 23% of women in 2001. More than half of men and women – 64.3% and 50.6% respectively – were unhappy with the amount of sex they were having in 2012 (up substantially from 2001 – the unhappiness, that is, not the sex).
MAY9	Trump’s antics over Iran have endangered us all. The stakes are now lethally high	Such is the carnival of the Trump presidency, it can be tempting – especially for those outside the US – to view it as spectacle, a long-running reality TV show that veers between The Apprentice and House of Cards. But every now and then comes a reminder that, for all the cartoonish absurdity of the central character, the Trump administration is all too real, that its actions matter and that the stakes are lethally high. A fresh and urgent reminder of that has come today with Iran’s declaration that it will no longer fully comply with the nuclear deal it reached with the US and Europe in 2015, by which Tehran agreed to a 15-year pause on its nuclear programme in return for the easing of economic sanctions. In a televised address this morning – exactly one year after Trump withdrew the United States from the deal – Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, announced a series of moves that would inch the country closer to acquiring the ability to produce nuclear weapons, moves that would only be averted if Europe defied Trump and allowed Iran once again to sell its oil and have access to the international banking system. For the most severe of these steps, Rouhani gave the Europeans 60 days to make up their minds: either resume trade or watch Tehran resume its nuclear efforts.
MAY9	As a doctor, I say it’s time to nationalise GP surgeries	General practices support patients through every stage of their life. They are the heart of their communities and the gateway to our NHS. Every day, around a million GP consultations take place in English practices. We should rightly be very proud of our system of primary care. But it isn’t perfect. As data published this week shows, patient demand for general practice services is increasing while the number of GPs is actually falling – according to the survey, one in 10 GPs are in contact with 60 or more patients a day, which is double the safe limit. At a time when people are living longer, and health problems are becoming more complex, the government has spectacularly failed to deliver its promise of an extra 5,000 GPs. Not enough medics want to be GPs, and too many doctors leave general practice too early.
MAY9	Welcome to parenthood, Meghan and Harry – you’ll never get a good night’s sleep again	The Duke of Cambridge welcomed his brother to “the sleep-deprivation society that is parenting” this week. That is sweet, obviously. Most parents have been members of that society. But do we believe that he or his brother, or indeed the mothers of their children, will have struggled with this like the rest of us? I ask the question because I really don’t know the answer, and neither do I know what honest answer I’d want to hear. Are we supposed to imagine that the three members of the Sussex family will now be rugged up in the same room, with the parents leaping out of bed at every snuffle from their bairn?
MAY9	Why doesn’t Britain have a Huawei of its own? The answer speaks volumes	Chances are that you have learned rather a lot about Huawei. That the Chinese giant is one of the world’s most controversial companies. That security experts, those people we pay to be paranoid on our behalf, warn its telecoms kit could be used by Beijing to spy on us. That Theresa May was begged by cabinet colleagues to keep the firm well away from our 5G network – yet ignored them. And that one or more senior ministers were so eager to prove their concern for national security that they leaked details of their meeting, thus breaching national security. So you can already guess what will happen when Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, meets May and her foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Wednesday. Once the pleasantries about Harry and Meghan’s baby are over, top of America’s agenda will be to warn No 10 of the threat Huawei poses to British privacy – and to restate that Washington may retaliate by freezing London out of its intelligence network. 
MAY9	Mark Zuckerberg has to go. Here are 25 reasons why	Everyone wants there to be a silver bullet. A single policy solution that will “fix” Facebook, restore our privacy, and clean up the tech industry. There isn’t one. Hefty fines, civil rights audits, antitrust, data privacy legislation, shareholder activism and employee organizing can all play a role. But we don’t just need regulation, we need a revolution – a massive cultural shift in how we think about our personal information and the companies that profit by collecting it.
MAY9	AOC’s boyfriend is a reminder of the importance of a supportive partner	Behind every successful congresswoman is a strong, “bin raccoon” boyfriend, apparently. Over the past few days the internet seems to have become obsessed with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s boyfriend, a web developer called Riley Roberts. Ocasio-Cortez is pretty quiet about her private life but Roberts makes an appearance in Knock Down the House, the new Netflix documentary about four women who ran in the 2018 midterm elections. And, though brief, his appearance generated rather heated discussion.
MAY10	We’ve seen Carl Benjamin’s rank misogyny before – remember Gamergate?	For luckier people than me, this week will have been the first time they’ve ever heard of Carl Benjamin (or Sargon of Akkad, as he is better known online). The fact that a Ukip candidate has been discovered to have said something hideous felt like such routine news, it would hardly have registered with me if I hadn’t immediately recognised the candidate in question. Benjamin (or Sargon of Akkad, as he is better known online) tweeted in 2016 that he “wouldn’t even rape” the Labour MP Jess Phillips. He revisited the topic in a recent video on his million-subscriber YouTube channel and is now being investigated by the police. It’s a sorry story from a candidate in the European elections, but Phillips is far from the only woman Benjamin has harassed online. He has built his entire platform on it.
MAY10	Baby Archie’s first race row may be a taste of things to come	A chimpanzee in a suit. It’s a racist caricature associated with times gone by – ones we’d like to imagine we had left behind in the 20th century, a period characterised by segregation, dehumanisation and, well, comparing black people to animals. So understandably, all hell broke loose on Wednesday when the BBC Radio 5 Live presenter Danny Baker tweeted a picture of a couple with an ape descending a flight of steps, captioned: “Royal baby leaves hospital.” Baker was sacked faster than you can say “racism”, but nonetheless claimed the tweet was misinterpreted. “Never occurred to me because, well, mind not diseased,” was his initial response. He later clarified that he intended it to be a gag comparing the royal family to circus animals “in posh clothes”. This defence seems like a reach to me. But even if we give Baker the benefit of the doubt, the incident shows that a subset of the population seems to be on a different planet when it comes to conversations around race.
MAY10	Trump’s foolish Iran policy only makes war more likely	It is unclear what, if anything, Iran can do to induce the United States and its regional allies to halt their escalating war of attrition before it provokes all-out conflict. When Donald Trump reneged on the UN-ratified nuclear agreement with Tehran last year, he said he wanted a better deal. Iran must change its behaviour, he said, and act like a “normal country”. This was always disingenuous. Iran’s authoritarian and abusive rulers certainly need to mend their ways. But what Trump and his imperious advisers really meant was that they must do what America says, in conformity with American interests. What they want is an end to 40 years of post-revolution defiance. What they want is regime change in Iran.
MAY10	The navy shamed me over my sexuality. Now I’m suing it to get my medal back	I joined the Royal Navy in June 1976, a scorcher of a summer. I was 26 years old. A Liverpool boy, I’d had an unsettled early life and it was only when I found myself living in a house-share with some navy lads that I found my calling. Seeing the lives they led and the pay they were getting made my life as a gas fitter seem dull by comparison. So I joined up, trained hard, and quickly worked my way up to the rank of lead radio operator. Over nearly 18 years I served my country during the Falklands war, in Northern Ireland, Syria, Hong Kong, Egypt and beyond. I had an impeccable service record and numerous medals and badges to show for it, both for conflict and good conduct. I was a trusted and respected naval operator, had wonderful colleagues and friends, and felt blessed to be leading a life I loved.
MAY10	The Lib Dems’ ‘Bollocks to Brexit’ is crass, but it might just work	“When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer,” wrote George Orwell in his famous essay, Politics and the English Language, just after the second world war. Things are bad, and our language is getting worse. The Liberal Democrats have adopted the slogan “Bollocks to Brexit” in their campaign for the on again, never really off European elections on 23 May. This has certainly won them some attention. Critics were quick to denounce what they saw as a sorry decline in standards of taste and decency. James Forsyth, political editor of the Spectator – and a columnist for the Sun – tweeted that the slogan “does nothing for civility and makes the public square a less pleasant place”. He acknowledged there was a chance he might sound a bit prim in offering this view.
MAY10	Stop eating fish. It’s the only way to save the life in our seas	It is the most important news humanity has ever received: the general collapse of life on Earth. The vast international assessment of the state of nature, as revealed on Monday, tells us that the living planet is in a death spiral. Yet it’s hardly surprising that it appeared on few front pages of British newspapers. Of all the varieties of media bias, the deepest is the bias against relevance. The more important the issue, the less it is discussed. There’s a reason for this. Were we to become fully aware of our predicament, we would demand systemic change. Systemic change is highly threatening to those who own the media. So they distract us with such baubles as a royal baby and a vicious dispute between neighbours about a patio. I am often told we get the media we deserve. We do not. We get the media its billionaire owners demand.
MAY10	Becoming PM would be the easy part for a British populist such as Boris Johnson	Britain may be in the mood for a nationalist prime minister who is prepared to see minorities lose out, according to an alarming poll on populism in Prospect magazine. The poll mines a worrying seam of anti-democratic, anti-civil rights instincts on the right, with Conservatism moving rapidly rightwards. By 61% to a meagre 18%, voters agree with the sentiment that “a prime minister should always put the British majority first even if it means minorities lose out”. That might embolden Boris Johnson to make more controversial “jokes” about Muslim women, suggests Prospect’s editor, Tom Clark. Johnson last summer suggested that Brexit might “get somewhere” if it were being run by Donald Trump, of whom he was “increasingly admiring”. But he may be feeling out-Trumped as he watches rowdy Nigel Farage rallies where audiences shout, “Lock her up!” about Theresa May.
MAY10	A pub with no booze will never generate the warm, jovial chaos that alcohol brings	There is a certain irresistible symbolism in a man from Burton upon Trent, historic centre of British brewing, opening the first alcohol-free pub in Dublin, one of Europe’s great booze capitals. We are drinking less in the UK and Ireland, young people in particular, and Vaughan Yates’ much-reported Virgin Mary seems a sober sign of the times – one that heralds a dire future for pubs generally. Read the pub trade press and you will find a steady drip-drip of advice about how bars can woo abstinent Gen Z-ers. Only this week, Nescafé dropped a report that recommended “outdated” pubs must make themselves “more inviting” to non-drinkers (spoiler: they should serve better coffee). But in this struggling sector, where 18 boozers a week are closing, is looking at ways to draw in non-drinkers an urgent priority? Could more pubs follow the Virgin Mary’s lead and ban alcohol?
MAY10	Want to stop Nigel Farage storming the European elections? Then vote tactically	With two weeks until the European parliamentary elections on 23 May, pollsters are predicting that no fewer than 30 of the 73 candidates for Nigel Farage’s Brexit party will be elected and so could be taking their seats when the new parliamentary session begins on 2 July. That’s more than is predicted for all the remain-supporting parties put together (excluding Labour, which still says it wants to get a Brexit deal) – which is quite a feat for a man who hasn’t presented a manifesto, disclosed his funders or come up with any details of how a post-Brexit Britain would function. There is a very simple reason for Farage’s rosy prospects: he is facing no resistance, even though opinion poll after opinion poll shows the remain majority growing by the day. At last week’s local elections, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would have had you believe that people deserted them and voted in record numbers for remain-supporting parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Greens because they want to leave the EU as soon as possible, no matter how dire the consequences. That verges on open contempt for the electorate, and Trump-like spin. The EU elections provide an opportunity for the people of the United Kingdom to knock some sense into the heads of their political leaders.
MAY10	Pakistan: where the daily slaughter of women barely makes the news	You can find the news about Pakistan’s war on women buried deep inside the metro pages of Urdu newspapers. I stumbled upon it a few years ago. I noticed that I could pick up my newspaper and almost every day find news about a murdered woman. I thought maybe it’s a coincidence, maybe Karachi is a huge city, these things happen. But it went on and on. It became so routine that I could pick up the paper, open the exact same pages, just like you can bet that you’ll find a crossword or letters to the editor, and it was always there. Names changed, localities changed, the relationship between the murdered and her murderer changed and of course there were minor variations on how she was killed and where the body was found, but it was always there: single column, one and a half inches. Often the woman wasn’t even named: she was someone’s sister or mother of four, or the girl who ran away with her lover or the girl who refused to marry a suitor. Sometimes the news made it to the front page of the metro section but for that the murder had to be particularly gruesome, or the killer had killed himself after killing the woman, or the victim was very young, or the murderer killed the children along with the mother. That last one usually ends up on the front page if it’s a slow news day.
MAY11	The missing ingredient in today’s debates? Generosity	In the early 1960s a white student who had seen Malcolm X speak at her college went to the Nation of Islam restaurant in New York to challenge him on his philosophy. “Don’t you believe there are any good white people,” he recalled her asking, in his autobiography. “I didn’t want to hurt her feelings,” he wrote. “I told her, ‘People’s deeds I believe in, Miss – not their words.’” “What can I do?” she exclaimed. “Nothing,” Malcolm X said, and “she burst out crying, and ran out and up Lenox Avenue and caught a taxi”. He would later say of that encounter: “I regret that I told her she could do ‘nothing’. I wish now that I knew her name, or where I could telephone her …”
MAY11	You don’t have to be great to hear the Tory call to greatness	You may have become aware of a worsening background hum to British public life. Think of it as “the clamour”. This is the very specific sound heard by Tory MPs reluctantly deciding that it falls to them to answer the call for a leadership bid. The clamour. So many separate clamours. The Tory leadership field is now the size of the Grand National, though unfortunately many of the runners would find themselves intellectually outclassed by a steeplechaser. In time, the race will be attended by the usual ethical dilemmas. Are the jumps simply too high, or should Andrea Leadsom be able to clear basic questions about gay rights without the screens having to be erected? For now, we must simply welcome newly declared entrants into the paddock, who this week include Andrea and dishonesty’s Esther McVey.
MAY11	The secret to stopping Brexit: keep it simple	Here’s how we can halt Brexit in its tracks. Uefa, the governing body of European football, should announce that from now on participation in the Champions League and the Europa League will be limited to members of the European Union. If Britain leaves the EU, the Premier League’s finest will be barred from taking part. The response would be immediate: support for Brexit would plummet, with the plunge most visible in Liverpool, Chelsea and concentrated parts of north London. All right, maybe Uefa would be wary of appearing to punish the country that had just taken, without precedent and in thrilling fashion, all four spots in the finals of those two competitions. So here’s a more modest proposal. Why doesn’t Uefa announce that, if the UK leaves the single market and thereby abandons free movement of people, English clubs will be allowed to employ only a limited number of European players. Say two. Or one. Suddenly, a whole lot of onetime Brexiters would find themselves passionately making the case for a borderless Europe, arguing that the young and hungry should be free to move wherever their dreams and their talent might take them.
MAY11	Sorry, Danny Baker – sometimes comedy is just off limits	When the doctor sat Danny Baker down to break the news of his cancer, the broadcaster’s first instinct was to defuse things with a joke. Realising how much the doctor was dreading it, he writes in his autobiography that he deliberately “derailed the moment”. It may not have been that funny, but it was kindly meant. There is much black humour on cancer wards, as there is anywhere people deal routinely with things nobody wants to think too hard about. There should be room for jokes that are inappropriate, jokes that come from places so dark they make you gasp – although, as with all high-wire acts, that doesn’t excuse comedians from the consequences of a mistake. But the licence to offend still matters in comedy, at least so long as you’re punching up, not down.
MAY11	Sunk by my age and weight, now I’m at the bottom of the swimming pool food chain	Round. Short. Female. And the wrong side of middle aged, to boot. Try being all of those things and see what happens when you go swimming. A lively debate erupted this week after Ellie Mae O’Hagan wrote about being sick of sexist behaviour by men in British swimming pools. But I find that I am liable to be judged by everyone in the pool – regardless of their gender. As I get older and rounder, it seems I have sunk to the bottom of the swimming food chain, not only prey to “sexist” men who splash and duck, but also young, svelte women with no cellulite who see me as fair game. “Move over, Granny, I’m coming in!”
MAY11	Paddy Jackson’s revived rugby career is a backward step for feminism	The rugby team London Irish announced this week that Paddy Jackson will join their squad ahead of a return to the English premiership next season. Jackson, 27, who has previously played for Ulster and represented Ireland, was once famous solely for his talents as a fly-half on the pitch – but now is infamous for his role in a gruelling, much-publicised rape trial last year. The 42-week trial in Belfast of Jackson and his three compadres was followed in acute detail. Evidence presented included the complainant’s bloody knickers, medical opinions on vaginal tears and WhatsApp exchanges between the defendants. Jackson was found not guilty of rape and not guilty of assault – his then teammate Stuart Olding was found not guilty of rape. Their friend, Blane McIlroy was found not guilty of exposure and another friend, Rory Harrison, was found not guilty of concealing evidence and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
MAY11	Would Margaret Thatcher have taken the US side against Huawei? Not necessarily	Lady Thatcher may be an icon to her most devoted fans but, as far as I know, none of them has ever worn a “What would Maggie do?” wristband. That’s not to say that they don’t find themselves asking (or being asked) the question now and then. After all, Thatcher, together with her eponymous –ism, have become lodestone and touchstone to rightwingers the world over. However imperfectly remembered or understood, Thatcher and Thatcherism simultaneously exert a magnetic attraction and provide a litmus test. They also conjure up the Conservative party’s glory days – a state of ideological grace, global respect and seemingly endless electoral success, all of which it could enjoy again if only it were to return to the path of free-economy/strong-state righteousness. Nowhere, perhaps, was her pragmatism more on display than when it came to China
MAY11	Britain loves booze. But we need to talk honestly about the harm it causes	Let’s grab a pint. Let’s put in for another bottle of red. Let’s try that new craft beer. Much of British life is revolves around booze. It can be challenging to maintain a social life without it, and even at home, it’s common to uncork a bottle of wine after a tough day at work. Yet, despite our country’s ongoing love affair with alcohol, nobody likes to talk about the harm that dependency on the bottle can bring. So on the rare occasion the issue is addressed, we should take note. A new survey has found that one in five people in England have been harmed by others drinking alcohol over the past year. The survey, which spoke to 5,000 over-16s, reported a range of less serious complaints, from being kept awake to feeling anxious about a person’s behaviour at a social occasion. But nearly one in 20 people reported experiencing aggression – being physically threatened or hurt – or being pressured into something sexual.
MAY11	It’s time for Labour to experiment with new drug policies	Well done, Denver: voting to decriminalise magic mushrooms is an act of common sense (even if this brave step was somewhat sullied by simultaneously voting down a pro-homeless initiative). It doesn’t mean the local Walmart is going to start flogging shrooms on two-for-one offers: it just means that the police must “deprioritise, to the greatest extent possible” any criminal penalties for Denver residents possessing or using the hippie drug of choice. It could be a life-changing move for some – growing research suggests it can help treat mental distress, such as depression and anxiety. Denver’s move is just the latest outbreak of common sense on drugs – how depressing, then, that Britain remains so backward on the issue. That is mostly the fault, I’m sorry to say, of the Labour party. You’d expect the Tories to take a punitive, snub-the-evidence approach (even though, before assuming the Tory leadership, David Cameron accepted that drugs policy was a failure). But where is the leadership from Labour? The so-called war on drugs is a catastrophic failure, and it hurts many vulnerable people Labour was founded to represent. Drugs should be treated as a public health issue, not a part of the criminal system.
MAY11	I’m fasting in protest outside Royal Windsor Horse Show to save my father in Bahrain	This week, the British royal family is rolling out the red carpet to greet hundreds of guests from around the world at the annual Royal Windsor Horse Show, which began on Wednesday and continues until Sunday. It is a major part of the royal calendar, with the Queen in attendance. Among the most enthusiastic of the show’s regular guests is King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa of Bahrain, who is invited every year to enjoy the opulent equestrian festivities, and his sons. Hamad enjoys friendly relations with the Queen. In 2013, he gifted her two prized Arabian horses from his royal stables. In 2017, the Queen returned the gesture, presenting him with a horse from her own stables. Hamad even has an event at the show – Saturday’s King’s Cup – named after him.
MAY12	Ecstasy, despair and how the great game reminded us of the ties that bind	Eleven minutes into the second half, as Gini Wijnaldum’s header fizzed into the top corner and Liverpool took a 3-0 lead in their Champions League semi-final last week, I just stood there, motionless, staring at my mate Mick Potter with bulging eyes. He looked back, shaking his head. His dumbfounded expression said: “We’ve seen a lot, you and me – but nothing like this.” I’ve known Mick since 1982. We have seen a lot together – Heysel, Hillsborough, dark, dark days as well as glorious times following our team. As with all friendships – your work, your family – your fate can draw you away, but there’s always that sinew that connects you. Our team; our history. The things we’ve done together, as supporters.
MAY12	We ignore poverty and visit ruin on the planet. But I have a plan…	Perhaps there’s a reason why still too few of us pay heed to warnings about how we are killing the planet by cruel and unusual methods. How can you persuade people to stop endangering other species and start protecting the environment when they don’t seem concerned about torturing themselves? According to Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, almost one in four (230,000) of Scotland’s children are officially recognised as living in poverty, one of the highest rates in Europe. And unless there is a significant policy shift north and south of the border, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is forecasting that more than a third of UK children will be in poverty by 2022. The charity’s definition of child poverty is a reasonable one: “It means growing up in families without the resources to obtain the type of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are the norm in 21st-century Scotland.”
MAY12	The zeitgeist has shifted. Now the the left is fizzing with ideas for a smarter economy	Our landscape is changing and this spring the pace is accelerating. It’s there in the mounting public recognition that the challenges society confronts are common to us all – from climate change to the growth of food banks – and so must require a common response marshalling common resources. It feels as if we’re at an inflection point, whether in the degree of support for Extinction Rebellion, the cross-party concern to promote social mobility or the growing acceptance that gender should be non-binary.
MAY12	I learned in class, but playtime taught me a lot more	Will nobody think of the swots? The news that schools, in the tortuous attempts to fill children’s heads with enough learning to cope with a barrage of tests, have been steadily helping themselves to precious minutes of playtime, has been greeted with dismay. Little ones, apparently, have 45 minutes less running about time a week than they did 20-odd years ago; at secondary school, it’s more than an hour. What iron-faced, killjoy madness is this? “Let the children lose it/ Let the children use it/ Let all the children boogie”, as a great man once wrote.
MAY12	Welcome to Planet Rumpole, where rank misogyny still holds sway	Following in the footsteps of Bertrand Russell, Grayson Perry and Stephen Hawking, this year’s BBC Reith lecturer will be Jonathan Sumption QC, retired supreme court judge, historian, chateau dweller and author, with the eminent Thatcherite Keith Joseph, of Equality (a 1979 polemic against egalitarianism). To date, the choice seems to have been entirely uncontroversial. “Who better,” asks the controller of BBC’s Radio 4, “than Jonathan Sumption to take a clear, hard look at the law and how it serves modern society?”
MAY12	The Observer view on English clubs’ unprecedented success in Europe	Jürgen Klopp grinning with all those mesmerising teeth. Mauricio Pochettino in bits and tie askew, like the father of the bride waving off his daughter on her wedding night. Glenn Hoddle dancing a jig in the studio while the nation feared for his ticker. Has there ever been a week like this one for England’s football clubs? For people who had paid those very-hard-to-justify subscriptions to Sky and BT, or who found the right excuses for four consecutive nights in the pub, there has been a sustained injection of head-shaking, armchair-roaring miracle. How might you objectively measure such a week against all the weeks that have gone before? Careful linguistic analysis of punditry shows the word “unbelievable” was uttered more frequently, and in a greater variety of accents, than on any previous occasion. (Jordan Henderson, the lion-hearted Liverpool captain, managed a dozen utterances single-handedly to the TV interviewer, while his teammates sang “You’ll Never Walk Alone” back to the Kop.)
MAY12	The Observer view on the European elections and Nigel Farage’s malign message	Across Europe, rightwing nationalist populism is on the march. Britain is no exception. Polls are putting Nigel Farage’s Brexit party in the lead. If it does as well as expected in the European elections, it will be the second time Farage has pulled it off: in 2014, Ukip topped the poll with 27% of the vote. Farage’s relative success is partly the product of his intuitive understanding of how to deploy the populist playbook: whip up public disenchantment with the establishment, accuse the elites of thwarting the will of the people and offer misleadingly simple solutions to complex problems. With voters so disillusioned with the two main parties, it’s a seductive formula. But his success is at least as much explained by the eagerness of mainstream politicians to yield to his brand of politics, rather than to challenge it. On Europe, Farage has only ever stoked anti-EU sentiment without ever offering constructive fixes. He has consistently got away with telling untruths: that the EU is on the cusp of creating a pan-European army; that EU membership costs the UK £55m a day; that three-quarters of British law is made in Brussels. He has repeatedly praised Norway as a model for the UK’s relationship with the EU in the past, but last week denied it.
MAY12	Farage, Rees-Mogg, Claire Fox... Britain is seduced by politicians who are ‘characters’	If you want to deceive the French public, you pose as an intellectual. In England, you pose as a character. Like a criminal on a witness protection programme, the ham actor who plays upper-class roles avoids the accountability that prevents democratic life degenerating into the feast of fools we see around us. Brexit has as much been a failure of British journalism as British politics. The basic questions have not been asked. You promised the electorate a trade deal with the EU should be the easiest in history. You said the German car industry would force Merkel to capitulate. Are you a fool or a liar or both?
MAY12	Lena Waithe: standard bearer for Met Gala’s camp celebration	New York’s annual Met Gala (2019 theme: Camp: Notes on Fashion) gave the good sport of celebrity-watching the earnest air of a third-year dissertation last week, as people dusted off their critical theory textbooks – for decorative purposes, right there on the shelf, pristine, next to a well-thumbed 50 Shades – and wondered how many paragraphs of Susan Sontag’s Notes on Camp Spider-Man star Zendaya had managed to commit to memory. I love the spectacle of the Metropolitan Museum of Art fundraiser at the best of times, if only because giving a massive party for famous people a theme also provides spectators who are less versed in fashion’s regulations a kind of rulebook by which to judge it. This one was even more fun than 2013’s Punk: Chaos to Couture, which revealed that punk’s lasting legacy had in fact been a handful of studs and a heavier eyeliner than usual. If there’s one topic I enjoy more than toast, dogs or pretentious TV dramas that will never get close to an audience size that would justify the budget, it’s camp, so the fallout has been a feast of riches.
MAY12	The missing ingredient in today’s debates? Generosity	In the early 1960s a white student who had seen Malcolm X speak at her college went to the Nation of Islam restaurant in New York to challenge him on his philosophy. “Don’t you believe there are any good white people,” he recalled her asking, in his autobiography. “I didn’t want to hurt her feelings,” he wrote. “I told her, ‘People’s deeds I believe in, Miss – not their words.’” “What can I do?” she exclaimed. “Nothing,” Malcolm X said, and “she burst out crying, and ran out and up Lenox Avenue and caught a taxi”. He would later say of that encounter: “I regret that I told her she could do ‘nothing’. I wish now that I knew her name, or where I could telephone her …”
MAY13	Brexiteers want us to glory in isolation. Their vision is introverted and selfish	International development aid is the latest casualty in the Brexit war of words. Rightwing zealots are now arguing not just for our £14bn aid budget to be redirected to spending at home but also for the abolition of the Department for International Development and the redefining of aid “as we see fit”, with what’s left no longer there primarily to help the world’s poor but to project their own view of British nationalism on to the world stage. As if comparing overseas aid to the work of a modern Mrs Jellyby, whose eyes, according to Charles Dickens in Bleak House, were fixed on “nothing nearer than Africa” while she neglected her own children at home, the right now caricatures aid not only as inefficient, wasteful and a way of the poor in rich countries subsidising the rich in poor countries, but also as money diverted to dubious causes abroad from good causes at home – the insinuation being that sending British money abroad to people who are not British is in some way unpatriotic.
MAY13	Seeing Ben Shapiro flounder might be fun, but far-right celebrities are no joke	There are broadly three ways to react to the shifting of the Overton window – the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse. The first and most common is to move along with it, accepting new parameters and adapting to them. The second is to stay put but look through the window, acknowledging that things have changed while attempting to grapple with that. The third is to resist the movement altogether, to refuse to engage with any previously beyond-the pale-ideas, and reject any arguments to do so. I tend to fall into the third camp, an Overton window refusenik. This is not fashionable and it’s not easy – by the very nature of the problem, people who agree with you become more desensitised with each passing day. There comes a point when seeing Nigel Farage on TV becomes no longer appalling but almost comforting. It’s old Nigel again with his familiar voice and manner, and bluster and cackle – an offence of white noise.
MAY13	Both Labour and the Tories have gone awol on Brexit	In her book Wilful Blindness, Margaret Heffernan writes that we “mostly admit the information that makes us feel great about ourselves, while conveniently filtering whatever unsettles our fragile egos and most vital beliefs”. In everyday life, this is often an impediment to sound decision-making. At the apex of politics, it is a psychological phenomenon that can inflict serious damage upon a nation. And in the case of the Brexit crisis, both main parties are now firmly in its toxic grip.
MAY13	If Labour is so committed on climate, it should recognise how the EU can help	The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has pledged to use “every lever of government possible” to tackle climate change. And his latest idea is to go after the big players on the London Stock Exchange, warning that UK companies failing to act to reduce carbon emissions will be delisted. As a green economist, radical steps to address the economic drivers of our various environmental crises have been my bread and butter for years. So I welcome Labour’s newfound commitment to get serious on climate change, though its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 can hardly be seen as treating the problem as an emergency. Greens believe we must reach net zero carbon by 2030 and that such a target is achievable.
MAY13	Am I clutching at straws for wanting to have fun?	Did you see the pictures from the Met Gala in New York? I mean, bloody hell. They were enough to discredit the whole concept of fun. The theme this year was “Camp: Notes of Fashion”, which most of the photographed celebrities seem to have interpreted as meaning “Daft”. To be fair, I have no idea what my own sartorial take on “Camp” would have been. I’d probably have put on a cravat, but worried it was a bit much. It wouldn’t have been a bit much. People turned up in the craziest togs imaginable. I think what many of the celebrities were doing was trying to show they have a sense of humour, which in general I welcome. But the lengths they went to to show it betrayed such seriousness in the endeavour, such focused and directed effort, that the joke collapsed under its own weight even if the intricately engineered dresses just about managed not to.
MAY13	Ecstasy, despair and how the great game reminded us of the ties that bind	Eleven minutes into the second half, as Gini Wijnaldum’s header fizzed into the top corner and Liverpool took a 3-0 lead in their Champions League semi-final last week, I just stood there, motionless, staring at my mate Mick Potter with bulging eyes. He looked back, shaking his head. His dumbfounded expression said: “We’ve seen a lot, you and me – but nothing like this.” I’ve known Mick since 1982. We have seen a lot together – Heysel, Hillsborough, dark, dark days as well as glorious times following our team. As with all friendships – your work, your family – your fate can draw you away, but there’s always that sinew that connects you. Our team; our history. The things we’ve done together, as supporters.
MAY13	Lib Dems and Change UK must stop bickering and unite for the Euro vote	Love Nigel Farage or loathe him – I rather doubt there are many Observer readers who fall into the first category – the man knows how to run a campaign. Only a few months into its existence, his Brexit party is heading for first place and the largest vote share at the Euro elections. The substantial “just get on with it” chunk of the electorate is massing behind him. One thing this demonstrates is the potency of the simple political tune when it is played by a brassy demagogue. It is a pointless expenditure of oxygen to mock the Brexit party for its lack of a manifesto. To harvest a large haul of votes, its frontman really need do nothing else than repeatedly cry the word “betrayal” from here until polling day. This presents a formidable challenge to his competitors and it is a challenge that both the Tories and Labour will fail. A riven Conservative party cannot deal with resurgent Farageism because a cabal of its MPs, a lot of its voters and a majority of its members are in sympathy with him. It may not be entirely a joke to suggest that there will even be Tory candidates at these elections who will, in the secrecy of the ballot booth, put their mark against the Brexit party.
MAY13	We ignore poverty and visit ruin on the planet. But I have a plan…	Perhaps there’s a reason why still too few of us pay heed to warnings about how we are killing the planet by cruel and unusual methods. How can you persuade people to stop endangering other species and start protecting the environment when they don’t seem concerned about torturing themselves? According to Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, almost one in four (230,000) of Scotland’s children are officially recognised as living in poverty, one of the highest rates in Europe. And unless there is a significant policy shift north and south of the border, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is forecasting that more than a third of UK children will be in poverty by 2022. The charity’s definition of child poverty is a reasonable one: “It means growing up in families without the resources to obtain the type of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are the norm in 21st-century Scotland.”
MAY13	We thrive on provocation. But are we too quick to punish those who stray?	There was something shocking and absurd about Danny Baker’s tweet of a photograph of a posh couple with a costumed monkey in response to the arrival of the royal baby. You didn’t have to be an expert in the history of racist images to recognise its implications. Just last year, the US comedian Roseanne Barr was sacked, and her newly-resurrected show pulled, for a tweet in which she likened a former black adviser to Barack Obama to a child of the “Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes”. There was something equally absurd about Baker’s defence of his tweet. “Never occurred to me” that it was racist, he tweeted, “because, well, mind not diseased”. “I can’t see racism in front of my eyes because I’m not a racist,” is not exactly a coherent answer. Nor is the implication that only a “diseased mind” would have recognised the racism particularly clever.
MAY13	The zeitgeist has shifted. Now the left is fizzing with ideas for a smarter economy	Our landscape is changing and this spring the pace is accelerating. It’s there in the mounting public recognition that the challenges society confronts are common to us all – from climate change to the growth of food banks – and so must require a common response marshalling common resources. It feels as if we’re at an inflection point, whether in the degree of support for Extinction Rebellion, the cross-party concern to promote social mobility or the growing acceptance that gender should be non-binary.
MAY14	Jeremy Corbyn has to get off the fence for Labour to see off the Faragists	Labour remainers are in a dilemma. Wherever I go I find lifelong Labour voters – indeed (whisper it) even some elected Labour councillors and probably an occasional MP – agonising over their European election vote in 10 days’ time. In the privacy of the polling booth no one will ever know, with both Momentum-leaners and non-Momentumites united in the same quandary. This election is all about Europe and our place in the world, nothing else, not a dry run for a general election. Results will have only one meaning: how many voted remain and how many voted leave? This will tell if all the opinion polls are right. Not one has shown a leave lead for more than two years, with remain solidly ahead. Will that be replicated on 23 May? The number of seats won by any party will barely matter, compared with the crucial total of in/out votes. This is our second referendum by proxy.
MAY14	Game of Thrones' 'sicansíos': not the first word to be lost in translation	Game of Thrones is known for its linguistic inventiveness. The TV adaptation of George RR Martin’s fantasy cycle has gone way further than the original novels ever did, with linguist David J Peterson fleshing out the languages of Essos and Westeros, Dothraki and Valyrian, from one or two phrases into grammatically coherent “conlangs” or constructed languages. The latest piece of vocabulary to come out of the show has nothing to do with him, however. In fact, it wasn’t purposely designed by anyone. I’m tempted, because of the genre we’re dealing with, to call it an epic fail. But it’s probably not as bad as leaving a Starbucks cup in shot. And it’s actually pretty fascinating.
MAY14	Why is Nigel Farage all over the airwaves while my party barely gets a look-in?	This morning I woke up wondering if lightning ever struck twice – and hoping that it did. In April 2016, as my Icelandair flight made its final descent into Heathrow, a fireball engulfed the plane. By the time I reached arrivals, news organisations were on the phone asking for eyewitness testimonies. I had little to say about my split-second inside a giant firework, but the platform gave me an opportunity to speak about something else. “What did you think when the lightning hit?” asked one interviewer after another. My responses were the same: “I thought, ‘I can’t die – I have to vote for the Women’s Equality party (WE) next week.’” The party I had co-founded months earlier was in the closing stages of its first election campaigns. Our biggest task, as a new party, was to let people know we existed. WE went on to pick up more than 350,000 votes. Now I am fighting another campaign, this time as WE’s lead candidate in London for the European elections. If you weren’t aware of my candidacy, or that we’ve just published the most bold and radical manifesto of this electoral contest, or that we’ve just won our first seat in the local elections, in Congleton, don’t be surprised. Ofcom guidelines, intended to ensure fair elections by allocating TV and radio airtime to parties according to measures such as their past performance, are often misinterpreted as instructions to silence newer parties. It takes a stroke of luck, good or bad, to get us public attention.
MAY14	It's time we stopped persecuting Britain's real strugglers: the privately educated	The plight of the privately educated in Britain is now, apparently, akin to the plight of Jews under Adolf Hitler’s genocidal regime. Stare in bafflement all you like, but this was the claim, splashed on the front page of the Times on Saturday, of the head of Stowe School, a mediocre Buckinghamshire private school, who argued that questioning the disproportionate numbers of privately educated people in positions of power was akin to “the conspiratorial language of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion”, and the language of “Hitler and his henchmen”. Do you have concerns about the privileged buying their children places at the top table? That those from less privileged backgrounds are drastically underrepresented in key British institutions? And think widening educational access is fundamentally a good thing? I’m sorry to report that you are a Nazi. It is a story that future historians may regard as a fascinating insight into Britain’s crumbling social order. When those with wealth and power fear that their privilege is even mildly challenged, they invariably clothe themselves in the garbs of victimhood. The crux of the Times’ splash was the fear that Oxbridge was discriminating against the privately educated in favour of state school pupils, constituting “social engineering”. Let’s leave aside the fact that private education is the most striking example of social engineering in our society. The line of argument here is one I’m long familiar with – when I was at Oxford, I vividly recall a private school student claiming that state school alumni such as myself only got accepted because of preferential quotas.
MAY14	Sexual abuse charities need money – but not from Tommy Robinson	On Friday 43 women’s organisations published an open letter voicing our disgust at Tommy Robinson’s pledge to donate his MEP salary to victims of sexual abuse if he is elected in the north-west of England. We are calling on voters throughout the region to reject him. We thought long and hard about potentially giving Robinson – whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon – further publicity and initiating a fight that he and his thuggish friends probably want to have. But we can no longer stay silent as he makes lies about the sexual abuse of girls his main campaigning and recruitment message.
MAY14	Is India the frontline in big tech’s assault on democracy?	In 10 days’ time, two political dramas will reach their denouement, thanks to the votes of a combined total of about 1.3 billion people. At the heart of both will be a mess of questions about democracy in the online age, and how – or even if – we can act to preserve it. Elections to the European parliament will begin on 23 May, and offer an illuminating test of the rightwing populism that has swept across the continent. In the UK, they will mark the decisive arrival of Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, whose packed rallies are serving notice of a politics brimming with bile and rage, masterminded by people with plenty of campaigning nous. The same day will see the result of the Indian election, a watershed moment for the ruling Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata party, or BJP. Whatever the outcomes, both contests will highlight something inescapable: that the politics of polarisation, anger and what political cliche calls “fake news” is going to be around for a long time to come.
MAY14	Brexiteers want us to glory in isolation. Their vision is introverted and selfish	International development aid is the latest casualty in the Brexit war of words. Rightwing zealots are now arguing not just for our £14bn aid budget to be redirected to spending at home but also for the abolition of the Department for International Development and the redefining of aid “as we see fit”, with what’s left no longer there primarily to help the world’s poor but to project their own view of British nationalism on to the world stage.

There comes a point when seeing Nigel Farage on TV becomes no longer appalling but almost comforting. It’s old Nigel again with his familiar voice and manner, and bluster and cackle – an offence of white noise.
MAY14	From Years and Years to Bird Box: why we turn to dystopian dramas in a crisis	In Years and Years, the six-part BBC drama series from the writer Russell T Davies that starts this week, Daniel (Russell Tovey) cradles his newborn nephew and says: “I don’t think I could have a kid in a world like this … Because if it’s this bad now, what’s it going to be like [for him] in 30 years’ time, 10 years, five years?” It would be tempting to write Daniel off as a catastrophist except that, as the series shifts forward in time, he and his family are forced to navigate an increasingly divided country in which technology is wreaking havoc, the economy is collapsing and war in Europe is bringing record numbers of refugees to British shores. If you think we’ve got problems now, Davies seems to warn us, you ain’t seen nothing yet.
MAY14	If Labour is so committed on climate, it should recognise how the EU can help	The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has pledged to use “every lever of government possible” to tackle climate change. And his latest idea is to go after the big players on the London Stock Exchange, warning that UK companies failing to act to reduce carbon emissions will be delisted. As a green economist, radical steps to address the economic drivers of our various environmental crises have been my bread and butter for years. So I welcome Labour’s newfound commitment to get serious on climate change, though its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 can hardly be seen as treating the problem as an emergency. Greens believe we must reach net zero carbon by 2030 and that such a target is achievable.
MAY15	Has the politics of climate change finally reached a tipping point?	Last week a small campaign group in the staunchly conservative town of Shrewsbury called a public meeting about climate change. The organisers were delighted when 150 people turned up. Even they were surprised, though, when people unanimously said they were prepared to give up flying, change their boilers and cars, eat less meat and even overthrow capitalism to get a grip on climate change. But this was just a straw in the political wind whipping through middle England. Shrewsbury joins more than 100 other councils across the country in declaring a climate emergency, and has pledged that it will be carbon-neutral within 11 years, with more following every week.
MAY15	Delivering Brexit won’t quell the forces of nationalism, as Eurosceptics might hope	Good ideas tend to be copied, and by that measure Brexit is a dud. The UK experience has not inspired copycat secessions from the European Union. It is not studied as the blueprint for what Michael Gove anticipated in 2016 as a “democratic liberation of the whole continent”. There are plenty of Eurosceptics elsewhere in Europe, but they have swerved away from the British example. That is partly an accommodation to pro-European public opinion in the other 27 member states. After all, the first rule of populism is to be popular. France’s National Front (now rebranded National Rally) has jettisoned talk of “Frexit”. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right deputy prime minister, no longer agitates for a return to the lira.
MAY15	Coming soon: the great universal credit deception	How to sell the unsellable? How to pretend utter chaos is a plan coming together? How to persuade the public, who just refuse to buy it, to at least keep on paying for it? I believe I have found the answer. It comes in the form of an internal memo from the Department for Work and Pensions that somehow floated past my desk. Published on the staff intranet just a few days ago, on 2 May, it is signed by three of the department’s most senior officials, including the DWP’s director of communications and Neil Couling, its head of universal credit. And it is that toxically controversial benefit which is its subject.
MAY15	Tackling inequality means addressing divisions that go way beyond income	Why are people so convinced inequality is rising in Britain, even though the figures say it isn’t? This is one of the great political paradoxes of our times, the point where what most people would describe as common sense parts company rather confusingly with statistics. The divide between haves and the have-nots certainly feels as if it’s got wider through the austerity years, as rising numbers queue for food banks while at the other end of the spectrum FTSE chief executive pay has risen to 145 times that of its average employee. The Brexit referendum exposed deep divisions between people still relatively content with their lot and those who, for whatever reason, felt left behind. Who really feels, deep down, as if society has got fairer over the last decade?
MAY15	Doris Day’s public image was the one role she could never shake off	Hollywood has always prided itself on being the place where illusion is sold as reality. But no film director was ever as skilled at mining the gap between fantasy and fact as the studios’ PR chiefs in Hollywood’s golden era (1910-1960), imposing images on their stars that had about as much to do with the truth as pornography does with genuine sexuality. Marilyn Monroe was sold as an all-knowing sexual vamp, when in truth she was a deeply damaged woman who was sexually abused and exploited throughout her life. Kirk Douglas was styled as an all-American alpha male when his name is actually Issur Danielovitch and he grew up speaking Yiddish, in unimaginable poverty. Doris Day, who died this week, was in many ways the most interesting example of this dissonance between the public persona and often not entirely private reality. Her image of the perky girl next door was both the making and eventual undoing of her career, and it has proved extraordinarily tenacious in the minds of the public and critics. Movie fans long ago grasped that, say, Judy Garland’s image as the innocent sweet songbird didn’t really match up with the miserable, pill-addled figure she already was by her mid-20s. But it was the rare obituary of Day this week that didn’t describe her somewhere as the “girl next door”.
MAY15	Teaming up with Nigel Farage would trash the Conservative brand	Remember Cleggmania? When the Liberal Democrats look back on the election campaign of 2010, when their poll ratings hit the 30% mark, it must seem like a heady dream. Their final vote share wasn’t as high as some had hoped, but it was enough to bring Nick Clegg’s party into a coalition government and into power for the first time. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair. We all know what happened next, and why. The Lib Dems experienced electoral wipeout in 2015 as a result of allying themselves with a political party that their core voters found toxic.
MAY15	I don’t watch Game of Thrones – which makes me a lot more interesting than you	Hell is other people talking about Game of Thrones. And hell, I have discovered to my mounting horror, is impossible to escape. Thrones-fever has gripped the world and people won’t stop going on about the bloody show, and how they can’t believe that their favourite elf just got beheaded after an incestuous tryst with a one-armed witch, or how some dragon queen or other has suddenly shown her nasty side. The fanaticism is bewildering. Admittedly, this may have something to do with the fact that I have never watched the show. People are constantly telling me to give it a go (there are only 962 hours of densely plotted goblin porn to catch up on!) but I just can’t bring myself to do so. The fact that I’ve never seen Game of Thrones, which is now on its eighth season, has become an integral part of my personality. Whenever I meet new people, I make sure they know this very important detail about me. I announce it to strangers on the internet. I have it proudly listed on my LinkedIn. And I drop the fact that I don’t watch the overrated dragon show into conversation at every conceivable opportunity. You see, Game of Thrones is not just a television programme, it is an Extremely Popular Thing, and there is no better way to prove that you are a very interesting, very intelligent, person than by expressing your disdain for Extremely Popular Things. Whenever too many people like something, it’s obvious there’s something wrong with it.
MAY15	The Swedish dream was always too good to be true. And now the far right is back	Trying to define a nation’s self-image is always an interesting exercise, especially if one tries to boil it down to a single word. What would that be for Britain? Independence, perhaps. For Sweden, there can only be one word: goodness. We aren’t looking quite as good as we would like to right now, though. Neo-Nazis march through the streets, not many but highly visible, trying to influence the political scene through threats and violence. We Swedes like to believe that our politics are good for the rest of the world
MAY15	I thought I knew about my mental illness. But the truth shocked me	It’s been nearly two years since I tweeted that when I was in my early 20s, I had a breakdown and was sectioned. I didn’t know it at the time, but that early morning post would have a profound effect on me, and challenge me to re-evaluate just about every area and aspect of my life. I expanded on the tweet in  a piece I wrote for the Guardian about my experiences, and was actually pleased that I’d finally told the story publicly, as I’d wanted to do for a long time. Psychosis affects roughly one in 100 people every year, and each case is different
MAY15	Jeremy Corbyn has to get off the fence for Labour to see off the Faragists	Labour remainers are in a dilemma. Wherever I go I find lifelong Labour voters – indeed (whisper it) even some elected Labour councillors and probably an occasional MP – agonising over their European election vote in 10 days’ time. In the privacy of the polling booth no one will ever know, with both Momentum-leaners and non-Momentumites united in the same quandary. This election is all about Europe and our place in the world, nothing else, not a dry run for a general election. Results will have only one meaning: how many voted remain and how many voted leave? This will tell if all the opinion polls are right. Not one has shown a leave lead for more than two years, with remain solidly ahead. Will that be replicated on 23 May? The number of seats won by any party will barely matter, compared with the crucial total of in/out votes. This is our second referendum by proxy.
MAY16	Inequality is the scourge of modern Britain. Is it finally about to be addressed?	Reports by the great and the good are ten a penny. All too often they are an excuse for kicking a tricky political issue deep into the long grass. Only rarely do they count for much. Maybe, just perhaps, the review into inequality launched by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and headed by the Nobel prize-winning economist Sir Angus Deaton will be one that makes a difference. It has the potential to be a very big deal indeed, as important in shaping the Britain of the 21st century as the Beveridge report was in the mid-20th century. Why? Because Deaton is asking the same fundamental questions that William Beveridge posed almost eight decades ago in his November 1942 report. Is inequality killing capitalism – and if so, what can be done about it?
MAY16	The political landscapes of Brexit Britain and Weimar Germany are scarily similar	Enter the disturbing special exhibition that has recently opened in Berlin’s German Historical Museum and you are immediately confronted with a series of bleak statements: “Liberal democracy cannot be taken for granted any longer … Authoritarian parties are even gaining strength in countries with a long democratic tradition … The public’s trust in liberal democracy seems to be waning in Germany as well.” The task of this outstanding museum is to tell the story of the nation’s past. But its new exhibition about the post-first world war Weimar republic – which runs until September – is explicitly about both the past and the present. And its scope is deliberately not confined to Germany, but extended to countries such as Britain.
MAY16	I’ve worked on shows like Jeremy Kyle – the real cruelty happens off screen	I ended up working on Trisha by accident. The talkshow’s producers contacted my university looking for graduates, and I was offered an interview. It was an amazing opportunity to break into television – I couldn’t believe my luck. My wide-eyed enthusiasm clouded my vision from the awful reality of what was to come. (I worked on the show after it switched from ITV to Channel 5, from 2005 to 2006). Alarm bells should have rung during “training week”, when I was paired up with a colleague for some role play. I had to imagine she was 23st, and persuade her to wear a bikini on the show. A few months later, I put this training to practical use when I succeeded in convincing a real-life plus-sized woman to do this. She walked on stage to ridicule. I was told I was great at my job.
MAY16	Nigel Farage is filling a truth-shaped hole. Honesty is the only way to drive him out	Before I say anything at all, let me say that Nigel Farage is a very bad man who tells lies and that there are big questions about where his funding comes from. I have no qualms in joining the daily stream of hate justifiably directed towards him. But we have to accept it has not made him vanish into thin air. Why is this? Quite simply, because the one central thing he says is true. People voted three years ago for something they have not got. There is little need for you to tell me the thing they voted for was impossible or undeliverable; we have spent three years having that explained to us by remainers, running on facts and reason, outrage and a generalised despair at the huge leave vote. One side has reason and tolerance, and the other only incoherent feelings: they were using Brexit as a vehicle for racism, culture wars, yada yada yada. They can’t be trusted to know what’s good for them.
MAY16	With Bolton whispering in Trump’s ear, war with Iran is no longer unthinkable	It was a deception that would lead to millions of civilian deaths, and the deaths of nearly 60,000 US soldiers. In August 1964 President Lyndon B Johnson solemnly declared that, after two apparent North Vietnamese attacks on US navy destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin, military action would take place. Four years later, Senator Albert Gore – father of Bill Clinton’s future vice-president – warned in a closed Foreign Relations Committee session that, “If this country has been misled … the consequences are very great.” His suspicions were correct. The second Gulf of Tonkin attack might never have happened – and perhaps neither did. Communications to make it look like the attack occurred had been falsified. But US policy was already set on a dramatic escalation of the Vietnam war: and here was the perfect pretext.
MAY16	How do you retaliate against a WhatsApp attack?	We don’t yet know for sure who used Israeli company NSO’s software to hack WhatsApp users – the messaging service’s parent company Facebook has said only that the culprit is an “advanced cyber actor” – but all signs point to it being a government. According to one analysis, NSO has 45 governments as clients including, amazingly, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, even though officially these states don’t recognise Israel. Whoever the culprit, the WhatsApp attack will surely be added to a long list of state-backed attacks that includes Russia’s 2015 takedown of Ukraine’s power grid, China’s persistent intellectual property thefts and North Korea’s attack on Sony Pictures over the film The Interview. And yes, the west does it too – the United States used a cyber-weapon to take down Iran’s nuclear programme in 2010 – the so-called Stuxnet attack.
MAY16	Yes, Islamophobia is a type of racism. Here’s why	On 15 March, a gunman walked into the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand and opened fire. During the course of his killing spree there, and at the Linwood Islamic Centre, 51 people were slaughtered in their place of worship for no other reason than their killer had decided that their faith meant that they deserved to die. Hatred against Muslims does not begin with the sound of gunfire breaking through the peaceful calm of a place of prayer. It begins with simple prejudice in our schools, our workplaces and our communities. More than 20 years since the Runnymede Trust published its seminal report, Islamophobia: a challenge for us all, it is on the rise.
MAY16	Mordaunt’s muddled amnesty won’t work – and sends a dangerous message	There will be plenty of British military veterans relieved by word that the new defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, plans to introduce an amnesty on so-called historical prosecutions for actions committed more than 10 years ago – which should cover offences committed during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. At first glance it looks like a welcome response to the pain described by many ex-service personnel, as they face multiple investigations into past events, often triggering a recurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder as they are forced to relive horrific experiences from long ago. Others will be pleased by what Mordaunt’s move means for the soldiers of the future. In this view, the armed forces can’t possibly do their job if, in the heat of battle, they are half-thinking of a future day in court. The argument is simple: that it’s wrong to ask those in uniform to risk everything for their country, only to throw the book at them for it afterwards.
MAY16	If London needs a separate Trans Pride, what does that say about LGBT solidarity?	Pride in London is the one day of the year that the city feels like it belongs to LGBTQ+ people – which was why I was so confused, embarrassed and alarmed when a small group of lesbians disrupted last year’s event with a protest against the inclusion of trans people. Their banners read “transactivism erases lesbians”. Pride in London quickly condemned the protests, but as a lesbian and a feminist, I worried that people would think these protesters represented me. More than that, I worried about how it all left trans people feeling. Perhaps, a year later, we have a clear answer. Plans for the first London Trans Pride have been announced. Due to take place on 14 September, the event will celebrate and centre trans and gender nonconforming people. There will be daytime family-friendly events such as panel discussions and zine making, as well as stalls from trans charities and businesses, followed later by an afterparty with trans musicians, performers and DJs. The idea was sparked by last year’s anti-trans protests, say its organisers, performer and promoter Finn Love and artist and activist Lucia Blake.
MAY16	The inequality review’s panel experts are all white. How equal is that?	Some years back, when I was working at the New Economics Foundation as a researcher, a trustee of the organisation called me. I had met him briefly the day before, but was still surprised to hear his voice on the line. He told me he organised art events and eventually got to the point of his call by saying that a panel he had organised was a bit too stale and having met me he thought I could bring some “edge” to the conversation. I laughed, saying I didn’t know anything about art, and in any case wasn’t available. I put the phone down, bemused. I am assuming by “edge” he meant that he needed me – a brown woman from a working-class background – to counter his panel, which was presumably all white, and no doubt too male and too posh. I suppose I should have been happy to be invited; and, while this was textbook tokenism, if I’d known something about the topic I might have accepted. After all, at the very least I was asked.
MAY17	At last, Tories can begin to talk about Theresa May in the past tense	There is a small but significant distinction in politics between what is known and what is declared. In recent weeks it has become ever harder to imagine how Theresa May might continue in her job if another attempt to steer Brexit through parliament fails. But imagination is no longer required. Resignation terms have been negotiated with the backbench 1922 Committee, and made public. After a second reading of the EU withdrawal bill, scheduled for the first week of June, May and Sir Graham Brady will draw up a timetable for the election of a new Tory leader.
MAY17	Why is Labour just letting the Brexit party win the European elections?	The European elections are of historic importance. Dangerous rightwing parties are likely to gain support, led by the Brexit party. We need to defeat the far right, and confront the spread of racism and the threat of authoritarianism and violence. We also need a serious commitment to tackling climate change and inequality. The Party of European Socialists has released a radical manifesto, much influenced by Labour’s 2017 general election manifesto. It is calling for an end to austerity, for a green transition, for a feminist Europe and a “Europe for the many”. If Labour were to take these elections seriously, this could help shift the political balance in the European parliament – with a transformative effect on the EU and Britain.
MAY17	Aras Amiri is Iran’s latest state-sponsored hostage. Britain must act	This week Aras Amiri from north London was convicted and sentenced in Iran to 10 years in prison for organising Iranian cultural events in the UK for the British Council. It brought back memories of the sentencing of my wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe on similar charges in 2016 – and the tearful weeks failing to make sense of it all. Aras’s case has many similarities to Nazanin’s: both arrested when on holiday visiting family, both targeted for their links to the UK, both had their jobs in London turned into cynical espionage claims.
MAY17	At last, the Labour party is being led from the bottom up	Right from the beginning, the promise of Corbynism was that it would empower the grassroots. In his acceptance speech on becoming Labour leader in September 2015, the MP for Islington North spoke of enabling members to better influence party policy, of his desire to hear passionate debate, and to “make our party more inclusive, more democratic and the membership better listened to in the future”. Let the tail wag the dog. On that basis, we shouldn’t be surprised by today’s announcement that Momentum, the youthful, 40,000-strong membership organisation established as an outrider for Corbyn’s leadership, will be campaigning for a “radical and transformational” new policy agenda. It is nonetheless a desperately needed and inspirational injection of energy. Over the summer, the group will seek to organise Labour’s mass membership to get motions passed in local constituency party meetings backing a green new deal (including achieving zero carbon emissions by 2030), the introduction of a four-day week, and the abolition of all migrant detention centres.
MAY17	Alabama’s abortion ban is about keeping poor women down	A lot of good points were made about the inconsistencies and hypocrisies of Alabama’s 25 white male lawmakers who passed the anti-abortion bill in the state senate this week. It was pointed out that Republicans in favour of banning abortion are by and large against banning guns because, by their own logic, “banning things doesn’t work”. It was observed that the “life” of a six-week-old bunch of cells is precious to these men, but the life of a child born to a mother of no means, in a state that voted to repeal Obamacare – that notional kid, not so much. And while the point was made that no one who has watched a woman struggle through labour could, in good conscience, criminalise her disinclination to do so, these arguments seemed to me bizarre, premised on the notion that the men in Alabama were acting in good faith; that they had the health of anyone but themselves in mind.
MAY17	Trump’s twinship with Orbán shows ‘illiberal democracy’ has a home in the US	How suited President Donald Trump and his Hungarian counterpart, Viktor Orbán, seemed as they sat together in the White House this week, their heavy bodies and craggy faces projecting a brutalist power. Their expensive dark suits and the elegant surroundings did nothing to hide their streetfighter natures and their air of self-satisfaction at their accomplishments. No wonder Trump told Orbán, in parting, “it’s like we’re twins”, bringing out the emotional politicking that’s served him so well to build a fanatically loyal base of supporters in America.
MAY17	UK prisons are a disgrace. No wonder a Dutch court has refused to extradite	The prisons are “inhumane and degrading”, in the words of a court in Amsterdam, as it refused an extradition request. The judges were referring not to a Russian penal colony, but to HMP Liverpool halting the extradition of a fugitive wanted in the UK on drug-smuggling charges. The cause of this damning judgment is the appalling conditions in prisons such as Walton (Liverpool), Bedford and Birmingham. The Daily Mail may have been outraged by the judgment, but it didn’t surprise me. I have been arguing similar extradition cases regarding prison conditions in other countries – and often winning – in the UK courts for years. It was only a matter of time before European countries looked at our Dickensian prison system and asked the same difficult questions.
MAY17	The political landscapes of Brexit Britain and Weimar Germany are scarily similar	Enter the disturbing special exhibition that has recently opened in Berlin’s German Historical Museum and you are immediately confronted with a series of bleak statements: “Liberal democracy cannot be taken for granted any longer … Authoritarian parties are even gaining strength in countries with a long democratic tradition … The public’s trust in liberal democracy seems to be waning in Germany as well.” The task of this outstanding museum is to tell the story of the nation’s past. But its new exhibition about the post-first world war Weimar republic – which runs until September – is explicitly about both the past and the present. And its scope is deliberately not confined to Germany, but extended to countries such as Britain.
MAY17	Yes, Jeremy Kyle was exploitative. But it made working-class people visible	When news broke that The Jeremy Kyle show had been indefinitely suspended following the death of a guest, I would have loved to have felt righteous joy. Indeed, the overwhelming response I saw went along the lines of “good, it was only ever a means for normal people to laugh at poor people”. While the announcement of the cancellation of ITV’s daytime staple no doubt marks the end of an unsavoury 14-year chapter in British television history, I feel somewhat conflicted. I understand why the show was bad. That’s difficult to dispute. But it was one of the few times I saw people like those I grew up with, people whom you never see on television, speaking with their own voices. It didn’t confirm my prejudices; because I didn’t have those prejudices to begin with. I saw real human sadness, need, pain and people who had really got their lives in a mess.
MAY17	Tories should bear the shame that child poverty in Britain is the new normal	Child poverty is the “new normal” in parts of Britain. That’s according to findings released today by the End Child Poverty coalition, a group of more than 70 leading charities and organisations, who have tracked the huge rise in child poverty since 2010. More than half of children are now living in poverty in some constituencies in the country, with the fastest rises hitting the poorest areas. The London borough of Tower Hamlets, for example, even has the majority of its infants in hardship (56.7%). This is as shameful as it gets. Children scavenging in bins to eat discarded apple cores for breakfast. Headteachers finding their primary school pupils sleeping rough on a mattress with their parents after being evicted. Forget a few extreme cases, in many areas growing up in poverty is not the exception – it’s the rule.
MAY18	The selfish case for saving bees: it’s how to save ourselves	When I see a bee buzzing around my garden or in the park in early spring, I get a real thrill from being able to identify her. If she is black and darting among small, white tubular flowers with her long tongue protruding and her legs tucked under her furry, round body, I know she is a hairy-footed flower bee. A few years ago I wouldn’t have noticed her because, like most people, I thought all bees were striped. I also assumed they made honey, stung, and lived in a hive with a queen bee and her workers. But only honeybees fit this description, and they account for just a handful or so of the astonishing 25,000 bee species worldwide. Bumblebees – the plump, stripy garden visitors that have been voted the UK’s favourite insect – make up about 1%. The vast majority, like the hairy-footed flower bee, come in many different colours, don’t make honey, and live alone. These solitary bees are often named according to how they construct their nests: from plasterer bees, which line their nest with a waterproof substance, to mining bees, which excavate elaborate underground burrows, and leafcutter bees, which plug the entrance with small discs of leaves cut from rose bushes.
MAY18	It shouldn’t be left to women to fight alone for abortion rights	No woman can be free who does not control her own body. That’s been the pro-choice mantra down the ages, no less true now than it ever was, and from it flows the equally fierce conviction that men should keep their noses out of reproductive rights. If it isn’t your womb, your life, on the line here, then what right do you have to interfere in a grown adult’s decision? No wonder that powerful image of the 25 male politicians who collectively approved Alabama’s cruel new ban on terminations beyond six weeks, struck such a chord. The sight of old men desperately clawing back their lost power over women’s lives still triggers a deep, visceral fear. Six weeks! That’s barely a missed period, a time when many women won’t even have realised they’re pregnant. True, America’s pro-life movement has plenty of prominent women in it, and in the UK it’s a female leader of the pro-life Democratic Unionist party who (thanks to her sensitive role propping up the British government’s parliamentary majority) represents one of the biggest stumbling blocks to rolling out abortion rights in Northern Ireland. But such nuances get forgotten in the face of men doggedly arguing on Twitter that forcing victims of incest to continue their pregnancies would at least preserve the criminal evidence, or refusing to let their cluelessness about female biology get in the way of a terrible opinion.
MAY18	I’ve seen how lawyers’ sexism corrupts justice. This is how to change the industry	Surprise, surprise: bullying and sexual harassment is rife in the legal profession. Yet another report, this time from the International Bar Association, shows that 62% of female lawyers have been bullied in the UK, which is higher than the international average, and 38% of women have suffered sexual harassment. The findings accord with the Bar Standards Board (BSB) report in 2016, which found that two in five respondents suffered sexual harassment and discrimination and only one in five reported it.
MAY18	Is there a single blue-rinse Tory who doesn’t fancy a knee-trembler with Boris Johnson?	I wouldn’t kiss you if you were the last man on Earth!” It’s one of the great cliches of romance novels that any woman saying this will, in due course, be doing just that. Maybe it’ll be a hate-kiss in the hayloft above the stables; maybe it’ll be a momentary lapse just after he’s rescued her from a predatory ranch hand. But you can absolutely bet on it: she’s going to be “sharing herself” with this man within 100 pages. The Tory parliamentary party’s relationship with Boris Johnson is the hardcore porn version of this. For so long, you couldn’t move for Conservative MPs saying they’d leave the party if Johnson ever became leader, that they wouldn’t vote for him in a million years, that he didn’t have a chance of getting anywhere near their special place. One hundred pages deeper into the shitshow, where are we on these holdouts?
MAY18	As rightwing populism spreads, bigotry against the LGBT community is growing	I spent last week in Cuba, a time which overlapped with what should have been the country’s 12th annual Conga Against Homophobia and Transphobia. The march, however, organised by the government and the brainchild of Mariela Castro – daughter of Raul – was cancelled, owing to “new tensions in the international and regional context”. This essentially translates into a fear that people taking to the streets at a time of heightened tension in the region might turn into general unrest. But there is also the unmentioned fact that religious communities in Cuba are increasingly pushing back against the otherwise repressive state’s attempts to improve LGBT+ rights. Earlier in the year proposed changes to the constitution to allow same-sex marriages were scrapped after pressure from evangelical churches and sections of the population. A spontaneous civilian-organised march to replace the cancelled conga resulted in multiple arrests.
MAY18	Remain voters are left with no choice but to ignore Labour next week	Shall we take a nostalgic trip back to the distant past of two weeks ago? You’ll remember there were local elections in England, in which the pro-Brexit parties took a pasting, while the anti-Brexit parties surged. You might also recall how the main parties interpreted those results: they hailed them as a heartfelt plea from the voters to get on with Brexit. Here, then, is a warning to remain-minded voters ahead of Thursday’s European elections. If you want to send a message about Brexit, you’ll need to send it as clearly and as unambiguously as possible. Up against a spin machine capable of hearing a repudiation as an endorsement, voters will need to be louder and clearer this time, closing down the scope for wilful misinterpretation.
MAY18	Trump's 'deal of the century' hasn't a hope of bringing peace	Here in Jerusalem, we await publication of Donald Trump’s “deal of the century”, which is expected to be released in the coming weeks. The US president has promised it will bring an end to a century-long conflict between Israelis and our Palestinian neighbours. But the Trump administration’s vision for peace looks doomed only to further entrench the occupation, as a recent remark from Jason Greenblatt, Trump’s Middle East peace envoy, demonstrated.
MAY18	Talks between Labour and the Tories on Brexit have broken down. So what next?	The news that the Brexit talks between the government and opposition have broken up without agreement comes as little surprise. In the age of Brexit, politics appears to have found a new form: arriving at an obvious conclusion as slowly as possible, thereby extending the misery for everyone. Labour memorably described the process as akin to negotiating with a company going into administration, given the prime minister’s stated intention to leave office before the future relationship with the EU is agreed. With Theresa May’s departure confirmed for June, the talks were plainly pointless. Taking the blame for a disastrous result in the European elections is the only thing holding May in place as prime minister
MAY18	In Northern Ireland, our hearts break for Alabama: we know about abortion bans	It feels like a lifetime ago since 25 May 2018. In many ways it was, because that day – when the Republic of Ireland voted to repeal the eighth amendment of its constitution, which outlawed abortion in virtually every circumstance – was a unique step forward for abortion rights in a world where they are rapidly being dismantled. While the legislation brought in after the Irish referendum is imperfect, the overall success of the repeal movement against so many obstacles gave campaigners across the world an incredible sense of hope. But one year on, global abortion rights are under increasing threat, and that moment in May 2018 feels like an exception, instead of a promise of what was to come.
MAY18	Change UK was always doomed to failure, and Joan Ryan just showed why	Fawlty Towers, Alan Partridge, The Office: finally the great British tradition of it’s-so-awkward-you-want-to-look-away-but-you-can’t comedy has a new addition, and it’s called Change UK. The critics may argue that this iteration lays the cringe factor on a little too thick, however. When Change UK’s Joan Ryan asked her audience in Bath to “look at your hands, please”, followed by “that’s it, it’s there, that’s the answer to this, it’s in your hands” – in what can only be described as panicked primary school teacher meets David Brent’s infamous motivational speech – the horror was compounded by the fact she’d clearly done this before, and that the audience clapped. Is this a political party, or is it performance art? The tragicomedy of Change UK is principally one of hubris. You can see, to be fair, why they thought success might beckon. There is a rich seam of sympathy for their brand of politics within the British media, and there’s no doubt that many remain voters feel disillusioned, angry even, about Labour’s Brexit triangulation. But the principal flaw in their plan was this: former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie believe that being a Blairite means automatically inheriting a political elixir from 1990s Tony Blair, of electoral success, and generally being very good at politics.
MAY19	When the far right crack rape jokes, it’s part of a systemic bid to demean	When a clever woman threatens a man who demands submissiveness, he can suggest that she’s only interested in screwing him. If that doesn’t work, he can silence her by threatening to rape her or by sneering that she’s not worth raping, anyway. And, when the woman protests, he can smirk and say, “Can’t you take a joke, love?” I’m only trying to “normalise comedy”, explained Ukip’s Carl Benjamin after he told Labour’s Jess Phillips, “I wouldn’t even rape you” and added: “I suppose with enough pressure I might cave, but let’s be honest nobody’s got that much beer.” The famous British sense of humour, which intrigues so many foreigners, will doubtless have left tears of mirth streaming down your cheeks.
MAY19	From Alabama to Armagh, women are on the front line waging the ‘war on abortion’	Intensifying campaigns to criminalise all abortion in the US have been summarised, accurately, as a war on women, one that calls on women to, as the presidential contender Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has put it, “fight like hell”. In terms of knowing the enemy, much of it, in the US, will certainly resemble the Alabama misogynists – the 25 white, male, no longer young Republicans who have just stripped half their state’s population of reproductive rights. Photographs have been generously distributed. But, as the men would probably be the first to admit, they couldn’t have ushered in a generation or more of unwanted children without assistance from at least two women combatants, Terri Collins and the state governor, Kay Ivey.
MAY19	Is the idea of ‘real women’ just another way of selling stuff?	‘Mirror, mirror on the wall, I don’t see anyone like me at all…” is the message on the cover of the current edition of Stylist, the women’s free weekly magazine, much garlanded with awards. Editor-in-chief Lisa Smosarski is a feminist who smartly uses the magazine to find imaginative ways to proselytise that, while readers may face private and individual challenges, many more of their difficulties are rooted in the public and systemic – low pay, discrimination and, last week, what she calls “the mental health crisis”, triggered by a ubiquitous and fetishised very white, very thin, very doctored vision of female beauty.
MAY19	Barry Manilow: glad to be gay, without trying to sell something	It can feel like a glitch in the fabric of the universe to be reminded that Barry Manilow only publicly came out as gay in 2017. Manilow was 73 when he did the big reveal with People magazine – “My untold story” – and had been with his long-term partner, and recent husband, for 40 years. Coming out is different for every single person who has to do it, and every person finds their own path; when Manilow came out, it was greeted, largely, as a bit funny that anyone might have not known that already.
MAY19	The selfish case for saving bees: it’s how to save ourselves	When I see a bee buzzing around my garden or in the park in early spring, I get a real thrill from being able to identify her.

MAY20	If I were Jeremy Corbyn I’d be praying for a Boris Johnson victory	“This isn’t a TV reality contest!” So declared defence minister Tobias Ellwood, when asked by Sky News’ Sophy Ridge about the forthcoming Conservative leadership race. To which there is only one honest response: that’s precisely what it is. Even as the new Brexit deadline draws closer, the Labour-Tory talks collapse, the Commons prepares to reject Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement for the fourth time, and the Conservatives face disaster in Thursday’s European elections, senior contenders for the top job merrily parade themselves, their spouses, and their kitchens in a grotesque bid for support in a contest that has not yet officially begun. They can’t run the country, pass the legislation it needs, or arrange its departure from the European Union. But they’ll do a mean photoshoot for you at the drop of a hat. To govern is indeed to choose.
MAY20	It’s not difficult to define Islamophobia. So why does Britain struggle with it so much?	Last week it became clear that, according to senior police, the Tories and some non-Muslim public figures with some Muslim friends, the term “Islamophobia” is undefinable in any meaningful, actionable way. The working definition, put forward by the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims, is not legally binding; yet Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said it was “too broad as currently drafted, could cause confusion for officers enforcing it and could be used to challenge legitimate free speech on the historical or theological actions of Islamic states”. This is either ignorant or consciously misleading. There is no legal implication in the definition whatsoever. Last week the government also rejected the definition, which in full reads: “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.” The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, said that accepting the definition had “potential consequences for freedom of speech” and that the combination of race and religion would cause “legal and practical issues”. Already adopted by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the definition was turned down because it needed “further consideration”. So just how much more information will it take for ministers to consider such a short single sentence? 
MAY20	Why the senators’ race matters in reporting the Alabama abortion ban	Why, demanded several readers, does this headline refer to race: “These 25 Republicans – all white men – just voted to ban abortion in Alabama.” It was part of the Guardian’s coverage of the southern US state’s new measure. The sole exception to the ban is serious risk to the health of the woman; pregnancies resulting from incest or rape are not excepted. Of the 27 Republican men in Alabama’s 35-seat senate, 25 voted for the law. Distilled, the readers’ view was that although it was understandable that the headline would emphasise male dominance, it was wrong to highlight race, too. Wrote one: “It detracts and distracts from the real outrage, which is that they’re all male, and they’re all Republican, rather than their skin colour.” Another reader thought that the reference to race implied that the votes were motivated by racism. Another wanted the emphasis to stay on the personal moral beliefs of the legislators, whichever way they voted.
MAY20	There should be nothing wrong in waving Palestinian flags at Eurovision	There were loud boos in the Tel Aviv Expo Centre on Saturday night, and not just when it was announced that voters in Greece and Cyprus had once again awarded each other the full 12 Eurovision song contest points in their annual display of allegiance. When Hatari – the Icelandic entrants – waved Palestinian scarves solemnly to the cameras as their results rolled in, my fellow audience members in the Israeli city made their dissatisfaction clear. It was the first time those assembled in the room were confronted with the controversy that had surrounded Israel hosting the event, and many just didn’t like it. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the contest, sent out the statement: “This directly contradicts the rules … the consequences of this action will be discussed.”
MAY20	Why is Brussels so white? The EU’s race problem that no one talks about	With days to go until the polls open for the European parliament elections, most political parties are finding it a struggle to convey the relevance of the EU to voters (in 2014, voter turnout was just 42%). Eurosceptics from Nigel Farage to Matteo Salvini, Marine Le Pen to Alternative für Deutschland’s Alexander Gauland, have been united in their criticism of the Brussels “elite”. They focus on the “unelected bureaucrats” running the EU institutions. Yet there’s an elite they don’t notice – and of which they are members. The EU’s institutions, and its parliamentary seats, are all but closed to people who aren’t white.
MAY20	When working-class lives can be so rich, why does reality TV choose to belittle them?	The trouble with having very little is the perception that you can be easily bought. Many participants on The Jeremy Kyle Show, on being asked why they went on, said that they had never stayed in a hotel before. The seductive triad of an all-expenses-paid trip, free booze and 15 minutes of fame is a far cry from an everyday life that is scarcely examined. Over the past week, my inbox has been packed with horror stories about the machinations of The Jeremy Kyle Show, with claims that members of the production team infiltrated 12-step programmes, transgender support groups and other havens for various fragments of vulnerability. The emerging pattern from these stories is this: one member joins the group to identify potential guests and gains their trust. Time passes, usually a few weeks, and they offer a “solution” to their conflicts, internal or external. The show was rarely mentioned until a few days before filming the accounts suggest. If true, in any other level of society, we would see this for what it is: grooming and manipulation. All in the name of the 9.25am entertainment slot.
MAY20	The middle ground no longer exists over Brexit. It’s all or nothing now	The collapse of the Tory-Labour Brexit talks surprised Westminster as much as did the news that bears conduct their ablutions in forested areas and Boris Johnson is interested in becoming prime minister. A question worth investigating, because it illuminates where we are now, how we got here and where we are heading, is whether that failure was inevitable. Was this bizarre and ultimately fruitless chapter of the Brexit saga never anything but a protracted charade? Was the inability to broker a compromise always written in the stars? Or could different actors have found a way to release Britain from its long national nightmare? Many believe that these talks, the last resort of an enfeebled prime minister, were fated to fail. One senior figure involved in the six weeks of negotiations speaks as if describing a doomed relationship: “It was always going to end this way.”
MAY20	What is Nigel Farage’s secret? That would be telling	“It was one of those things they keep in a jar in the tent of a sideshow on the outskirts of a little, drowsy town. One of those pale things, drifting in alcohol plasma, forever dreaming and circling, with its peeled dead eyes staring out at you and never seeing you” – Ray Bradbury, The Jar, Weird Tales, November 1944. Last Friday morning, in a packed working men’s club in the 97% Leave voting North Yorkshire moorland town of Blackleg Wang, I heard the chants of “Ni-gel! Ni-gel! Ni-gel!” die away, as Nigel Farage took the stage at his latest Brexit party rally. I was shocked. It was a long time since I had seen a politician who was actually popular with anyone.
MAY20	China wants us to forget the horrors of Tiananmen as it rewrites its history	Remembering the deaths of 4 June 1989 is no neutral task. It is a civic duty, a burden and an act of resistance in countering a state-level lie that risks spreading far beyond China’s borders. On that day the Communist party sent tanks to clear protesters from Tiananmen Square in the centre of Beijing, killing hundreds of people, maybe more than a thousand. In the intervening years, China has systematically erased the evidence and memory of this violent suppression using its increasingly hi-tech apparatus of censorship and control.
MAY20	The Brexit party reflects our hollowed-out, tired politics	Will British politics be upended in the European elections on Thursday? Certainly, the traditional faultlines may be recast, at least for this election. The Brexit party will no doubt emerge triumphant, the Tories crushed, Labour humiliated and the Greens and the Lib Dems will make sufficient gains to claim a modicum of success. Whatever the results, they will leave untouched the fundamental problems that have created the chasm between large sections of the electorate and mainstream parties.
MAY21	Boris Johnson in No 10 will be a fitting finale to this dark decade	Armageddon awaits. Boris Johnson is heading for No 10 and there is nothing dishonest, disreputable or even scandalous enough that he can do to stop his party choosing him now. They know of his lies, laziness and narcissism, but they don’t care. After a crushing humiliation at the polls in Thursday’s EU election, where the Tory vote may fall to single figures, this drowning party will clutch for the straw-headed showman to save them from triumphant Faragists. Well, Prime Minister Johnson would provide a fitting finale to this ever-darkening decade. A measure of the demented state of the Conservatives is the number of hats in the ring for this most poisonously impossible job. Who would want to lead a paralysed government with no majority and a party that is a nest of vipers? Anyone applying should be disqualified on grounds of diminished responsibility.
MAY21	Why I’m sitting in a box blocking the entrance to BP’s headquarters	The container I’m currently inhabiting has everything I need to keep going for quite a while, so I don’t want to sound too self-pitying, but it is, nevertheless, a box. It’s got a chemical toilet, an internet connection and heavy bolts to fasten it to the pavement, and it’s blocking the entrance to BP’s London headquarters. As a consequence, BP’s HQ is empty. As I sit here, some of BP’s executives are at home enjoying an unexpected break. Some are at BP’s AGM, which has been moved to Aberdeen this year, in the hope that it would make a climate protest more difficult.
MAY21	Trump Baby is back – and this time it’s more than just a balloon	“The greatest insult to a sitting US president ever.” It’s not often that I turn to the words of Nigel Farage to seek confirmation I might be involved in doing something right, but last July was different. It was a few days before Donald Trump was due to touch down for his first visit to British shores since his election to office. And things weren’t quite going to plan. Britain was in thrall to the story of whether a 20ft-high bright orange helium balloon would be given permission to soar above Parliament Square in central London: Trump Baby had arrived.
MAY21	Google’s Huawei ban is good news: tech giants shouldn’t always get their way	The post-digital revolution starts here. Thank you, Donald Trump. The US president’s decision to blacklist Huawei, which has led to Google ending collaborating with the company, may have the worst of motives. It could have the best of consequences. So far, global government has proved impotent in forcing the grand monopolies of the digital age to adhere to any regulation. They have gone where they like, gobbled up competitors as they choose and paid taxes (or none) as the whim takes them. The only rivalry has been in physical products such as smartphones, but they are just shells for conveying monopoly power round the world.
MAY21	Safer air for the kids? Grow more houseplants	When was it, maybe two weeks ago? I was just about clinging on to sanity’s rigging amid the daily tempest of trauma that has become my family’s morning routine. My 11-year-old was fuming loudly because I hadn’t bought her any croissants (what have we become?!), the dog was expressing his fear-anxiety about the postman, my husband was losing his shit at the toast he had just burned, my 10-year-old was punting a rugby ball through the kitchen air (the tinny hi-hats of the latest indistinguishable mumble-rap track playing on his portable speakers) and John Humphrys had the hump about something. On this occasion, it was the air quality in inner-city classrooms, which, to be fair, is a legitimate thing to grump on about, even if it was with that tone of pantomime incredulity he employs. (NB: what follows is a very vague estimation of a memory that is most likely wrong in the first place.) “Surely there’s something we can do to improve the air our children are breathing,” harrumphs Humph. “Plants?” I suggest to the radio. “Well, yes, there are things we can do,” says the air-quality expert. “Plants,” I say again (I’m certain she’s going to say “plants”). “We can fit classrooms with air purifiers that mechanically remove more than 99.97% of air contaminants.” And plants, surely? “Very interesting,” says Humph, content no further investigation is required. And that’s that.
MAY21	Brexit has torn Britain in half. Only Labour can bridge that divide	The European elections have polarised the Brexit debate into two camps: those who want to remain and discard the verdict of the 2016 referendum, and those who want a “clean” or “no-deal” Brexit. Labour is urged to pick a side in this ongoing tug-of-war. That is a dead end for the party and for a very divided country. The pollster Peter Kellner argues that Labour must come out unambiguously for remain. His reasoning is that two-thirds of 2017 Labour voters backed remain in 2016, that a greater proportion of Tory leave voters are now backing Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, and that there is a migration of Labour remain voters to the Liberal Democrats.
MAY21	London is still the UK’s golden goose – and that needs to change	London could be justified in feeling a little unappreciated right now. Britons outside the capital think of its residents as “arrogant” and “insular”, an investigation by the Centre for London has found; London itself is seen as expensive and crowded. Pride in the capital decreases with distance from it, and appears to be declining over time. And while over three-quarters of Brits agree that London contributes to the national economy, just 16% feel it contributes to the economy where they live. There is a long-held and persistent sense that London is too dominant in national life. Some also perceive its success as coming at the expense of the rest of the country – an idea that has re-emerged periodically throughout history, most famously in the 1820s when parliamentarian William Cobbett described the capital as a “Great Wen”, a gigantic cyst draining the life out of the rest of the nation.
MAY21	The Tories have forgotten their pro-EU voters. And they’ll pay for it	In a seemingly endless season of Tory nightmares, this week looks set to mark the most dreadful phase so far. The Conservatives are about to endure a set of elections that they never thought they would face. Only four years ago, the party won a general election; now, there is talk of them finishing fifth, or even sixth. With every Tory moan of pain, Nigel Farage’s nicotine grin grows ever larger. And out in the country, there is an overlooked Conservative crisis: one bound up not with the part of the population that voted for Brexit, but with the liberal, pro-remain swathe of the country without whom the future of Conservatism looks bleak indeed. I come from somewhere still understood as one of the most Tory places there is. Wilmslow, in Cheshire, has a population of 25,000 and is a dormitory town on the southern edge of the sprawl around Manchester. Part of the Tatton constituency, it was once represented by George Osborne, and these days is the adopted home of the zealous Brexiteer Esther McVey. Though slightly more mixed class-wise than its reputation might suggest, it remains a byword for suburban affluence, and McVey sits on a majority of 15,000. But in the referendum of 2016, Wilmslow was part of a wider Tory-supporting area that voted 54% for remain.
MAY21	If I were Jeremy Corbyn I’d be praying for a Boris Johnson victory	“This isn’t a TV reality contest!” So declared defence minister Tobias Ellwood, when asked by Sky News’ Sophy Ridge about the forthcoming Conservative leadership race. To which there is only one honest response: that’s precisely what it is. Even as the new Brexit deadline draws closer, the Labour-Tory talks collapse, the Commons prepares to reject Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement for the fourth time, and the Conservatives face disaster in Thursday’s European elections, senior contenders for the top job merrily parade themselves, their spouses, and their kitchens in a grotesque bid for support in a contest that has not yet officially begun. They can’t run the country, pass the legislation it needs, or arrange its departure from the European Union. But they’ll do a mean photoshoot for you at the drop of a hat. To govern is indeed to choose.
MAY21	Why the Led by Donkeys billboards won’t change anyone’s mind on Brexit	When Ann Widdecombe was unveiled as the Brexit party’s surprise European election candidate, the tactical aim was clear – show Conservative voters that switching their vote to Nigel Farage’s new outfit made so much sense that even former ministers were happy to do so. Widdecombe’s name recognition is still high even in semi-retirement, and the move is embarrassing for a Conservative party struggling to fight an election it never wanted. The anti-Brexit campaign group Led By Donkeys responded by posting billboards featuring Widdecombe’s face, the quote “homosexual acts are wrongful” in giant letters, and was headlined “Target gay people”. The aim was to warn voters of Widdecombe’s hardline beliefs, and by extension the views of the new party’s potential MEPs. And there was a small disclaimer at the bottom attempting to contextualise the comments.
MAY22	May's offer was neither 'new' nor bold. It will be her final failure	In a last-ditch attempt to get her deal through parliament, Theresa May has presented a supposedly fresh 10-point plan to break the deadlock. On closer examination, the changes are at best slight, and at worst set to lose her more support than they gain. May once attempted a similar manoeuvre over supposedly “legally binding changes to the backstop”. This afternoon was a last hurrah that is set to fail precisely because what she has offered is substantially no different to her three previous attempts to get a withdrawal bill passed. Nothing has changed. The most eye-catching announcement was that MPs would be offered a parliamentary vote on a second referendum if they supported the bill at its second reading. But most pro-referendum MPs have concluded that the best chance of getting a majority for a second national vote would be in October, in the face of a fresh Tory leader genuinely willing to crash out of the EU with no deal. They know that without brinkmanship, the numbers simply aren’t there. So May’s offer won’t wash.
MAY22	This Milkshake Spring isn’t political violence – it’s political theatre	What a lot of crying over a spilt milkshake. Since broadcaster and sometime politician Nigel Farage got covered in sticky banana and salted caramel in Newcastle on Monday, the air has been thick with condemnation. “Normal campaigning is becoming impossible,” tweeted the far-right leader, before pleading for “civilised democracy” – a new tune from a man who warned that unless he gets his precise flavour of Brexit he would “don khaki, pick up a rifle and head for the frontlines”. The dousing was “horrible and ridiculous”, said Tony Blair, famed for his excellent judgment on weapon threats. And so the professionally outraged have taken to social media and TV studio sofas, bemoaning the debasement of our politics and whatever else they can squeeze into their allotted two and a half minutes.
MAY22	Want to stop Johnson? More Tories should follow Heseltine and join the resistance	Michael Heseltine knows how to make a grand exit. The man who famously got himself suspended from parliament for swinging the mace, before going on to storm out of Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet over the Westland helicopter scandal, has now lost the Tory whip for threatening to vote Liberal Democrat in this week’s European parliament elections. The door has been left wide open for a return, but while he may not want to leave, Hezza evidently doesn’t intend to take his party’s descent into madness lying down. Which is more than can be said for some of his colleagues.
MAY22	‘Clean Brexit’ sounds so simple, doesn’t it? Trouble is, it doesn’t exist	No deal is back in vogue – to the extent that it ever fell out of fashion. As Theresa May nears the end, the chancellor Philip Hammond is warning of the risk of a “new prime minister abandoning the search for a deal, and shifting towards a damaging no-deal exit as a matter of policy”. Richard Tice, chairman of the Brexit party, was banging the no-deal drum on the Today programme earlier this week, arguing that a “clean Brexit” (sounds appealing, doesn’t it?) would work out just fine because of the provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO) treaty.
MAY22	Facial recognition tech is creeping into our lives – I’m going to court to stop it	A few days before Christmas 2017, I stepped out of my office on to Cardiff high street to grab some lunch. Among the crowd of flustered last-minute shoppers, I was captured. Without my consent or knowledge, the police had scanned my facial features, creating a “biometric” map of my face – as unique to me as my fingerprint or DNA.
MAY22	Wales is doing it. So why won’t Westminster support the UK steel industry?	British Steel, created by Greybull Capital only three years ago, is in serious financial difficulty. It may collapse if the government does not provide a £75m rescue package to support continued operations. Unfortunately, I wasn’t surprised by this development. The confusion and economic dislocation of Brexit, a global steel glut and the US-China trade war have combined to make the economic climate for UK steelmaking more challenging than ever before – not to mention energy prices that are 50% higher than in Germany, and 100% higher than in France, and business rates five to ten times higher than on the continent.
MAY22	Oxford University must become more diverse. But we’re already on the right path	Varaidzo Kativhu is a second-year Oxford University undergraduate with a personal YouTube following of about 26,000 subscribers. An early episode of her weekly bulletins describing her time at university dealt with the issue of whether Oxford is diverse. “No, no, flat out no,” she said as emphatically as she could. But she also told her viewers: “It is your job to make Oxford diverse.” In other words, “Do what I did: apply to study here and be part of the change.”
MAY22	Why is everyone suddenly using the C-word?	A journalist from Canada recently shared a video on Twitter in which she asked people in Manchester their opinion of Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon). Two young people – one male, one female – replied immediately with the word “cunt”. The journalist was taken aback, and the video quickly racked up retweets and comments. So what’s going on here? Is the status of this notorious word changing? Swearing is power language, a parallel vocabulary packed with emotion and social force. But its effects depend heavily on context: one person’s everyday expletive is another’s strict taboo. These differences also vary greatly across time and place. The strong religious swears in English in the Middle Ages are now mild in most places, though minced versions remain popular (jeepers, cripes, gosh).
MAY22	These elections could define Europe. It must urgently rediscover its founding spirit	Sometimes, when it comes to Europe, things are clearer from afar. Take Viktor Orbán’s encounter with Donald Trump last week: a love-fest perfectly timed to signal that this US president is out to disembowel the European Union, if not break it entirely. Ahead of the European elections, here was Hungary’s self-proclaimed “illiberal” prime minister – a man teaming up with Italy’s far-right strongman Matteo Salvini – receiving his long-awaited anointment from a white-nationalist US president who has called the EU a “foe”. Meanwhile, in Syria, barrel bombs and Russian military ordnance continued to rain down on Idlib’s hospitals and schools, as the noose tightened on 3 million civilians trapped in the last rebel-held area that the president, Bashar al-Assad, wants to reconquer. Historians will perhaps one day tell us whether Vladimir Putin timed that particular offensive to coincide with other items on his EU-destroying agenda, already well on display with disinformation campaigns aimed at helping extremist political forces across the continent.
MAY22	Five more years of Narendra Modi will take India to a dark place	Indian elections are a marvel to behold. The rules stipulate that no citizen should have to travel more than 2km to vote. So the state goes to the voters. Carrying oxygen tanks, election officials scaled the Himalayas to erect a voting booth in a village in Ladakh, 4,500 metres above sea level. In western India, a polling station was set up for the lone human inhabitant of a wildlife sanctuary. In eastern India, officials trekked for an entire day to reach the sole registered voter, an elderly woman, in a remote village. By the time voting closed on Sunday, some 600 million people had cast their ballots, 10 million of them for the first time. The refrain from Hindu voters has been identical: Modi has failed us, yes, but he's at least put Muslims in their place
MAY23	Brexit has become a subplot to the battle for the post-May Tory party	Until quite recently, it was still accurate to say that the central problem in British party politics was Brexit. This week, that has imperceptibly but now decisively changed. Now, and probably for much of the coming summer, the central problem in British party politics is no longer Brexit itself but the character of the post-Theresa May Tory party. May’s decline from the now hard-to-recall autumn of 2016, when she enjoyed the confidence of 87% of Tory voters and 54% of the whole electorate has been long and slow. The mishandling of the needless election of 2017 resulted in enormous self-inflicted damage. But even as the diminished May continued to battle on into the early part of this year to get her withdrawal agreement adopted, British politics was still essentially about Brexit rather than her.
MAY23	Andrea Leadsom's defection reflects how toxic May has become	A minister resigning from Theresa May’s government rarely makes the front pages these days – since the 2017 election, the prime minister had lost 41 government ministers. However, there was a sense of surprise in government circles that it was one of May’s more loyal cabinet colleagues, Andrea Leadsom, who became the 42nd – and it is unlikely she will be the last.
MAY23	How to vote in the European elections? Our panel’s verdicts	This may be as close as we ever get to a second referendum. You never know, obviously; even though there’s barely enough time to organise one before October and not enough support for it in parliament, miracles can happen. But if they don’t then this Thursday could be our last chance for a crystal clear verdict on three years of stumbling towards disaster. Do you want Brexit at any price, a no-deal Brexit if necessary now Theresa May’s deal is dying, or not? For however much Labour tries to pretend it’s really about renationalising things or kicking out the Tories, this isn’t a domestic election and there’s only one real question here. The lesson of the local elections – when Jeremy Corbyn seemingly interpreted a Liberal Democrat resurrection as a mandate to carry on regardless – is there’s no room for ambiguity. If you want to remain, revoke, vote again or do anything but be swept inexorably over the waterfall then go Liberal Democrats, Greens, Change UK in England, and SNP or Plaid Cymru in Scotland or Wales. If tactical voting advice seems baffling, then vote with your heart. Reward the Lib Dems’ courage in resisting Brexit when nobody else was, or the Greens for doing the same on the climate emergency, or Change UK for at least trying to shake their old parties out of it; whatever moves you.
MAY23	Why is Nigel Farage immune to scandals that would destroy his rivals?	Let’s say the pollsters have got it wrong. After all, their record is hardly perfect. So let’s say they’ve called it wrong and the Tories are not down to 7%, which would be the worst electoral performance in their history; that Labour are not on a meagre 13%, trailing six points behind the Lib Dems and a single point ahead of the Green party. Let’s say those numbers, from YouGov’s last poll for the Times ahead of tomorrow’s European elections, prove to be off once the votes are counted. Even if that happens, there’s one finding that is unlikely to be upended. If it were, the pollsters would have to be more wrong than they have ever been, and to an outlandishly large degree. That finding, shared by all the polling organisations, is the imminent victory of Nigel Farage and his Brexit party. YouGov has Farage ahead of his closest rivals, the Lib Dems, by a staggering 18 points. Even if that hugely overestimates his support, he’s still in front. Pollsters have a margin of error, but even if you tripled it, Farage is still the likely winner of this contest.
MAY23	The Brexit party's toxic rhetoric doesn't represent most leave voters	Throwing milkshakes at people you politically disagree with is something we just shouldn’t do. I’d love it if UK politics could be one great big food-fight, as we’d probably get a lot more done than parliament has since the referendum. But the problem is, it won’t stop there. It took less than a second for Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) to escalate to punching the person who threw milkshake on him. Jo Cox’s widower, Brendan Cox, responded to the Nigel Farage milkshake incident by condemning the act despite his strong political opposition to Farage, because it “normalises violence and intimidation”. If you want to hurt Nigel Farage, expose him for what he is. I was at the Brexit party rally in London last night, with a couple of upturned buckets for chairs and a folding table with a banner reading “A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK: Change my mind.” I was inviting people to speak to me, the most basic expression of liberal democracy.
MAY23	I tried to sexually harass Siri, but all she did was give me a polite brush-off	“Hey Siri, show me your tits,” is not something I ever thought I’d say, especially not while sitting in an empty kitchen while wearing fluffy slippers. I have many hobbies, but sexually harassing disembodied digital entities is not one of them, even in the interests of journalistic research. But having read that a UN report that claimed virtual assistants coded female by default (i.e. most of them) were reinforcing gender stereotypes that portray women as subservient – for example, by responding to sexual harassment in a tolerant, even coquettish, manner – I thought I had better conduct an experiment. “Hey Siri, wanna fuck?” I was trying to do my best frat boy impression, but ended up sounding sad and apologetic, a bit like how I wish men would in real life. “Hey Siri,” I said, lugubriously, “you’re a slut.”
MAY23	White teachers like me should not be policing black pupils’ hair	Last year, a 12-year-old student was forced to take legal action after he was threatened with suspension by his London school for wearing his hair in dreadlocks. More recently, a six-year-old was sent home from school for having a “skin fade”, a common black hairstyle, because his primary school claimed it would “detract from learning”. Now, new research released by De Montfort University Leiceister has revealed that one in six children with afro-textured hair in the UK are having a bad experience with school hair policies. Having recently taught in a school with a large African-Caribbean student population, this research confirms what I witnessed there. I saw boys with cornrows and afros being told by senior school leaders that they won’t be taken seriously if they didn’t adopt a more “professional” hairstyle. I consoled young black girls placed in internal exclusion rooms for wearing a black protective cloth over their recently styled braids. Black students being sent home for adding blond or red streaks to their hair, while white students who did the same went unreprimanded, shows how racialised school uniform policies can be.
MAY23	This Milkshake Spring isn’t political violence – it’s political theatre	What a lot of crying over a spilt milkshake. Since broadcaster and sometime politician Nigel Farage got covered in sticky banana and salted caramel in Newcastle on Monday, the air has been thick with condemnation. “Normal campaigning is becoming impossible,” tweeted the far-right leader, before pleading for “civilised democracy” – a new tune from a man who warned that unless he gets his precise flavour of Brexit he would “don khaki, pick up a rifle and head for the frontlines”.

And so the professionally outraged have taken to social media and TV studio sofas, bemoaning the debasement of our politics and whatever else they can squeeze into their allotted two and a half minutes.
MAY23	My art was used to sell cars – but I’m fighting back	In October 2017 I was astonished when Michael Thouber, the director of Copenhagen’s Kunsthal Charlottenborg, informed me that my artwork Soleil Levant had been used in an advertisement for the new Volkswagen Polo. Soleil Levant is an installation comprising 3,500 lifejackets worn by refugees undertaking perilous sea journeys to reach safety in Europe. Many refugees survived due to these lifejackets; some perished. Some lifejackets were fake, and those wearing them could have drowned. I travelled to 23 countries and visited dozens of refugee camps … It was an extremely intense, even painful experience
MAY23	The UN has condemned Tory welfare policies. Labour must end this shame	How did Britain in 2019 – one of the wealthiest societies that has ever existed – end up being damned by a United Nations report for condemning the poor to lives that are “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short”? These are the words of the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes; another British literary great conjured up by Prof Philip Alston – the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, and a bete noir of our crumbling government – is Charles Dickens and his vivid description of the 19th-century workhouse now being brought back in “a digital and sanitised version”. The government, he contended, was guilty of the “systematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population”, and that “much of the glue that has held British society together since the second world war has been deliberately removed and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos”.
MAY24	Shocked by the rise of the right? Then you weren’t paying attention	The morning after both Donald Trump’s victory and the Brexit referendum, when a mood of paralysing shock and grief overcame progressives and liberals on both sides of the Atlantic, the two most common refrains I heard were: “I don’t recognise my country any more,” and “I feel like I’ve woken up in a different country.” This period of collective disorientation was promptly joined by oppositional activity, if not activism. People who had never marched before took to the streets; those who had not donated before gave; people who had not been paying attention became engaged. Many continue. Almost three years later the Brexit party, led by Nigel Farage, is predicted to top the poll in European parliament elections in which the far right will make significant advances across the continent; Theresa May’s imminent downfall could hand the premiership to Boris Johnson; Trump’s re-election in 2020 is a distinct possibility, with Democratic strategists this week predicting only a narrow electoral college victory against him. “Democrats do not walk into the 2020 election with the same enthusiasm advantage they had in the 2018 election,” said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, the largest Democratic political action committee.
MAY24	How to vote in the European elections? Our panel’s verdicts	This may be as close as we ever get to a second referendum. You never know, obviously; even though there’s barely enough time to organise one before October and not enough support for it in parliament, miracles can happen. But if they don’t then this Thursday could be our last chance for a crystal clear verdict on three years of stumbling towards disaster. Do you want Brexit at any price, a no-deal Brexit if necessary now Theresa May’s deal is dying, or not?

If tactical voting advice seems baffling, then vote with your heart. Reward the Lib Dems’ courage in resisting Brexit when nobody else was, or the Greens for doing the same on the climate emergency, or Change UK for at least trying to shake their old parties out of it; whatever moves you.
MAY24	Without true friends or allies, Theresa May’s downfall was inevitable	All political careers end in failure. Not all end in a punishment beating. The apparently imminent departure of Theresa May as Tory leader has seen a brutality rare even for the British Conservative party. She was crowned with acclaim in 2016, and set the task of honouring the result of the Brexit referendum. In the 2017 election, she won almost as high a share of the popular vote as Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair ever did, a fact converted into failure by Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system.
MAY24	Young people have led the climate strikes. Now we need adults to join us too	Tomorrow, schoolchildren and students will be out on the streets again, in huge numbers, in 150 countries, at over 4,000 events, demanding that governments immediately provide a safe pathway to stay within 1.5C of global heating. We spent weeks and months preparing for this day. We spent uncountable hours organising and mobilising when we could have just hung out with our friends or studied for school. We don’t feel like we have a choice: it’s been years of talking, countless negotiations, empty deals on climate change and fossil fuel companies being given free rides to drill beneath our soils and burn away our futures for their profit. Politicians have known about climate change for decades. They have willingly handed over their responsibility for our future to profiteers whose search for quick cash threatens our very existence.
MAY24	Menopausal? Yes. But at 50 I’m hotter than I was in my 20s	I’m new to being 50 and I’m waiting for it to happen to me: the moment when I vanish without trace. My 51st year started with the B-list French celebrity Yann Moix making global headlines after saying that women over 50 were invisible. (Fun fact: he had to put out a request to stop fiftysomething women spamming him with pictures of their perky body parts in the aftermath. Poor him. ) It turns out that he prefers the “extraordinary” body of a 25-year-old. The thing is, at 50 I know I am objectively more attractive than I was in my 20s, when I was unhappy, insecure, overweight and all round not conventionally hot. I am more attractive than I was in my 30s (raising young kids and juggling a big day job with splitting up with their dad) or in my early- to mid-40s (perimenopause hitting hard and somewhat losing my shit, or at least my way, for a few years).
MAY24	It’s hard to imagine. But could this really be the end for the Tories?	Welcome to an extraordinarily bizarre election day. Pause on the way to the polling station to wonder at the astounding mayhem within our “ruling” party, soliciting votes even while wrenching its leader from Downing Street. We may be so used to the Tory party in meltdown that we forget to be amazed at what is unfolding before our eyes – on election day. Even allowing for all Andrea Leadsom’s fantastical ambitious absurdities, ponder how astonishing it is to see the leader of the house, no less, resigning on election eve just to steal a march on all her improbable leadership competitors. Jeremy Hunt is marching in to see the prime minister in publicly threatening mode – on election day. Forget any sense of decorum towards their party or their country, or the electoral process.
MAY24	The Victorians were no prudes, but women had to play by men’s rules	Much has been done to redress the popular vision of Queen Victoria as a dull censorious woman swathed in black: ITV’s Victoria drama series, new documentaries and books suggest a less buttoned-up life. But the image prevails, as does is the idea of Victorian society as prudish, covering table legs in case they offended, and refusing to countenance any reference to sex. However, a new exhibition of Victoria and her husband Albert’s gifts to each other – including art with plenty of nudity – offers a rejoinder. The display, marking the 200th anniversary of Victoria’s birth, is at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, which was the couple’s sanctuary, away from public gaze – and they adorned it with quite a few nudes. Florinda, by the German painter Franz Xaver Winterhalter, was hung in front of their writing desk – Victoria described it as a “group of beautiful women” about to bathe.
MAY24	Manga belongs in the British Museum as much as the Elgin marbles	What is manga doing in the British Museum? It’s a question the Guardian’s reviewer asked about the new summer exhibition that opens today devoted to the comics medium, which originated in Japan. 
MAY24	No wonder Jamie’s went bust: Brits have lost their appetite for samey chains	In September 2017, Jamie Oliver received the kind of phone call that causes the bottom to fall out of your world – if not, in a moment of vertiginous panic, the world to fall out of your bottom. While filming for Channel 4’s Friday Night Feast with the actor Liv Tyler, he was told that his debt-ridden Jamie’s Italian chain was about to collapse. “I had two hours to put money in and save it or the whole thing would go to shit. It was as dramatic as that,” Oliver told the Financial Times. This week, the worst finally happened. Despite a raft of closures and the loss of 600 staff, despite Oliver ploughing in £13m and a £37m loan from HSBC, almost all of Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group – which comprised 23 Jamie’s Italian venues and London’s Fifteen and Barbecoa – went into administration. In October, the group was reportedly paying off its final creditors as part of a voluntary arrangement meant to stave off this catastrophe. In its company filings, CEO Jon Knight was optimistic. “The quality of Jamie’s Italian offer, [its] food and healthy ethos sets it apart from the competition,” he reported.
MAY24	The suffering caused by austerity helped fuel Brexit – and will only get worse	Unless austerity ends, the UK’s poorest people face lives that are “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”. That was the finding on Wednesday from Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, who warned worse could be yet to come “for the most vulnerable, who face a major adverse impact” if Brexit proceeds. Days earlier, down the line at BBC 5 Live, the Brexit party candidate Lucy Harris declared that the average leave voter wants Brexit “at any cost”. Pressed further by presenter Nicky Campbell, Harris admitted this could mean volunteering for “30 years” of economic downturn.
MAY25	The energy behind Farage and his Brexit party leaves his rivals in the shadows	Last Sunday, I went to a Brexit party rally in Frimley, Surrey. The venue was the Lakeside Hotel and Country Club complex, well known as the setting for international darts contests. Inside, 1,200 or so people had gathered to hear Nigel Farage and most of the party’s other would-be MEPs for the south-east region. The atmosphere was roughly as I had expected: highly charged, defiant, often strangely celebratory. But what was most striking was the slickness of the presentation: brisk, elegantly structured speeches and warm-up videos, and the clear sense that everyone had been told to lay off subjects that usually buzz around Farage – immigration, chiefly. Instead, they doubled down on the twin themes of Brexit being denied and delayed, and what that says about the people and institutions in charge of the country. The first speaker was one Robert Rowland, a candidate with the face, haircut and stiff demeanour of a freshly bought Action Man. “If Brexit fails, we cease even to be a democracy,” he said. “The duplicitous professional political class will have prevailed. The last three years have seen Britain’s establishment – the civil servants, the majority of MPs from both parties, academia, the judiciary, and of course let’s not forget the BBC” – at this point, there were loud boos – “do their damnedest to delay, diffuse and dilute Brexit. Parliament has abolished the referendum and declared war on the British people … There might not be tanks on the streets, but make no mistake: this is a coup against democracy.”
MAY25	Judith Kerr’s life is something to celebrate in dark times	Are you sitting comfortably? Then let us begin. Or rather, let us press a button and leave the room. One in four parents have now delegated bedtime story-reading to a digital assistant like Alexa, according to a depressing little survey published this week, while two-thirds admit letting their children have screen time instead. For the genuinely burned-out parent, maybe it makes sense. But I do wonder what Judith Kerr – the much-loved author of The Tiger Who Came to Tea, the Mog series and other books no child should be without – would have made of it.
MAY25	Now it’s a fight to the finish between a no-deal Brexit and remain	It’s now all or nothing. Theresa May has gone, most likely taking with her the possibility of a negotiated exit from the European Union. It means that the choice that will soon face the country is starker than before: a no-deal Brexit – or no Brexit at all. In her parting address outside Downing Street, May made a better case for compromise between those two positions than she ever had before. “Life depends on compromise,” she said, quoting the Kindertransport rescuer and hero, Nicholas Winton. It sounded hollow coming from her, given that her brittle personal style, incapable of emollience, and her inept grasp of political tactics had together made her a byword for inflexibility (right until the moment, which came often, when she would cave entirely). Her epitaph will be the inadvertent slogan of her calamitous 2017 election campaign: “Nothing has changed.”
MAY25	Exit Theresa May. Stand by for a summer of Tory fratricide and country-shafting	Eyes down, ye players of apocalypse bingo, as we move beyond a European elections campaign where we learned that milkshakes are “political violence” and rape threats are “satire”. Theresa May’s premiership has literally ended in tears, following an audaciously self-parodic speech about compromise. The Tories have signed on for several weeks of leadership contest – a sort of summer camp for excluded adults, where activities include aggravated fratricide, country-shafting and horrifying unforced errors in truth or dare. Like her cricketing hero Geoff Boycott, and also Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, May has spent weeks refusing to be given out. Multiple final gambits included a speech this week in which she served up her same withdrawal agreement for consideration yet again. Unsurprisingly, even her supporters declined this shit sandwich, which they believe is distinguished by being the sort of shit sandwich where the bread is also made of shit.
MAY25	Theresa May saved her tears for herself. If only she’d shown this humanity before	She cried the wrong tears. So shredded is Theresa May’s credibility that as she started to crack, to show some actual feelings, during her resignation speech, many people immediately said they were the wrong feelings. If anything has changed during her time as prime minister it is the waning of empathy. The millisecond in which one might feel for another person, even if they are different from you, is now just political weakness. What a world. The land of tears is a secret place, as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry said, and May’s tears may only have been for herself; simple registers of the shattering of her delusion, but there they were. Make no mistake, she has been an absolutely dreadful prime minister, impervious to reality, deeply unsympathetic, utterly tone deaf. Missing any chance to actually compromise. Anyone who has met her will tell you that she doesn’t really do human. I remember a miserable lunch with her years back and being mystified ever since that anyone ever thought that she could negotiate any kind of deal. A walk-in freezer has more warmth. Interesting necklaces do not make a personality. More importantly she doesn’t do dialogue, she simply repeats her lines and her mantras until people are so bored they possibly agree with her. Or she pretended they did.
MAY25	Feel no pity for Theresa May. She has been the worst prime minister in modern times	Spare me the inevitable pity for Theresa May after her tearful farewell address this morning. “Oh, wasn’t she given such a terrible hand!”, people might cry, or “is it her fault that her backbenchers are such a bunch of Neanderthal extremists?”, and “it’s not her fault Brexit is such an undeliverable mess, is it?”. We must see through this. May is the worst prime minister – on their own terms – since Lord North’s reign in the late 18th century, when the US colonies declared their independence. May did indeed inherit a terrible hand. She then proceeded to douse it liberally with petrol and set it alight.
MAY25	Who should be the next Tory leader? Our panel responds	Choosing from this gallery of rogues, fanatics and non-entities is like playing the children’s game: would you rather be burned at the stake, hanged drawn and quartered or squashed by a steamroller? In the weird world of the Tory leadership stakes, Boris Johnson has almost certainly won the race already. The victor will be essentially illegitimate, our prime minister chosen by 100,000 eccentric, elderly and extreme Brexiteer Tory party members usurping the right of 46 million electors. The same rotten borough vote took Gordon Brown to No 10: failing to fight for it did him no good.
MAY25	Yes, these EU elections weren’t good enough. This is why	The European parliament election that was never going to happen is now behind us, and we await the results which will emerge from Sunday evening once polls have closed across all member states. It is an anomaly for our politics to have to wait that long for the results, but it is not the only thing that is unusual about this election. They are delivered on a different, regional structure only used in Great Britain for this purpose; the voting and counting system used reflects this; and there are different processes that have to be completed to ensure people are properly registered and able to vote. These are some of the reasons why we and the wider electoral community raised concerns with the government, with rising urgency in the first months of this year. While a general election follows a well-trodden path and can be delivered relatively comfortably – albeit not without considerable effort – within eight weeks, the same is not true of the European parliament elections. The ongoing delays to confirming the poll continued to escalate the risks.
MAY25	Could Theresa May’s replacement force through a no-deal Brexit?	So Theresa May has reached the end of the road as prime minister. A number of candidates who have thrown their hat in the ring have made it clear that they would rather leave the EU without a deal than the one negotiated by May. Brexit votes earlier this year have shown that there is a majority in the Commons opposed to a no-deal Brexit – but the procedural options open to them to avoid this outcome are severely limited (unless the Speaker, John Bercow, decides on a more flexible interpretation of parliamentary convention, which is possible).
MAY25	Moby's treatment of Natalie Portman is a masterclass in nice-guy misogyny	If someone had said the word “Moby” a week ago, chances are the first thing you’d have thought is “Dick.” That probably hasn’t changed – but now you’d likely be referring to the 90s musician rather than the 19th century whale. Over the past few days, Moby has been stress-testing the adage that “all publicity is good publicity” by repeatedly insisting that he and Natalie Portman used to be an item, even if she says they weren’t. In his new memoir, When It Fell Apart, Moby claims that he dated Portman when he was 33 and she was 20, after they met backstage at one of his concerts. A memoir is traditionally considered a work of non-fiction, however it would seem that the 53-year-old’s book strays into fantasy: Portman has denied the pair ever had a romantic relationship.
MAY26	The Tories have abandoned thought in favour of believing their own lies	‘The Dog returns to his Vomit,” wrote Rudyard Kipling in 1919 as he denounced the delusions of liberals and socialists. “And the Sow returns to her Mire, and the burnt Fool’s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire.” Only conservatives understood the eternal verities – The Gods of the Copybook Headings, as Kipling titled the most splenetic of Tory poems. Only conservatives knew that progressive talk of “the March of Mankind” hid the truth that fallible humanity always ended with its fingers in the flames.
MAY26	Mix private equity, Brexit mania, state incompetence and what do you get? Scunthorpe	Across the Midlands and north of England – and in pockets of the south – there are once proud single-industry towns laid low, with no determined effort to make good what once was. It could be Chatham and Rochester in Kent – or Birkenhead, Wigan or Mansfield further north. They survive as economies in which the main business is providing the foundational goods and services necessary to get by – supermarkets, petrol stations, hospitals, care homes. But there are few thriving private sector companies in 21st-century industries, a paucity of opportunity, and wages are below the national average. 
MAY26	Men don’t have abortions. That’s no reason not to fight for women’s rights	The decision by Alabama effectively to ban abortion has refocused attention in America on the issue of reproductive rights. The Alabama law is the most dramatic move in a long-running campaign by Republican states to curtail abortion rights and perhaps even overthrow Roe v Wade, the 1973 supreme court decision that legalised abortion in the US. Inevitably, the abortion debate has come to be seen through the lens of the gender divide. It’s women who get pregnant, women who need abortions, and women who suffer when abortion rights are restricted.
MAY26	You can keep your theme parks, I’m off to Ambridge	National mythology is hard for the British to package and sell. And we appear to like it that way. A perennial squeamishness about any effort to label our shared nature, or inherent characteristics, is almost a matter of pride in itself. From quaint Cath Kidston designs to the noisy Victorian jingoism of Last Night of the Proms, the reaction is often suspicious. It is a reflex partly born of a natural superiority complex, but which surely also stems from the truth that Britain is actually four nations with varied cultural traditions and a pretty unpleasant imperial past. Let the tourists buy the mugs and tea towels. We don’t want them.
MAY26	Judith Kerr was not scared to confront death in her stories. But she helped us savour the joy of life	If you’ve got a life that so many people don’t have,” said Judith Kerr, “then you don’t waste it.” She was talking about the fact that her parents managed to escape from Germany before the Nazis took over. That thought – what a stroke of luck it is to be alive – became her great theme. A few years ago – when she must have been in her late 80s – I watched her perform to a packed house in Edinburgh. On stage, in her pink dress, she giggled away like she couldn’t believe she was still alive as she fielded questions about the nature of that tiger.
MAY26	The $2m drug reveals medical research as a casino culture	How much is a life worth? $2.15m? That’s the staggering price of a drug produced by the pharmaceutical giant Novartis that has just come on the market. Zolgensma is a one-off gene therapy treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare degenerative disorder. Infants with the most severe form usually die within two years. For parents of babies born with SMA, any price is worth paying to save the child’s life. Novartis argues that spread across a lifetime, $2.15m is “cost-effective”. It points out, too, the expense of developing such innovative drugs. In this case, though, Novartis did not develop Zolgensma but bought up, for £8.7bn, AveXis Inc, the company that did. The Wall Street Journal described the acquisition as a “bet”. The price of Zolgensma is the return necessary for that gamble to be successful.
MAY26	Richard Ashcroft’s sweet victory as Stones bow out graciously	Richard Ashcroft received an outstanding contribution to British music accolade at the Ivor Novello awards last week, and took the opportunity to confirm that the rights to the Verve’s Bitter Sweet Symphony had been transferred back to him after a 22-year dispute with the Rolling Stones. Famously, the soaring strings that propel the song are a sample of an orchestral version of the Stones’ The Last Time, and the Verve had been granted permission to use part of it in return for 50% of the track. However, the Stones’ late manager Allen Klein eventually sued, claiming a larger portion than agreed had been used, and royalties and joint songwriting credits were passed to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.
MAY26	If we’re going to hurl food at our politicians, make sure it’s healthy	Has there ever been a more condign metaphor for what Britain has become than the milkshake protest? These shallow treats often masquerade as healthy owing to a barely discernible patina of fruit in their flavouring. In truth, they are a gooey assemblage of sugar and chemicals that form the perfect accompaniment to a smoochy big beefburger when you’re still howling from last night’s debauch. That a milkshake has become the icon of political protest sends all the wrong messages about the UK’s commitment to healthy lifestyle choices and our attitudes to climate change.
MAY26	May I have a word about… forest bathing with the Duchess of Cambridge	Even the most ardent republican would need a heart of stone not to find comedic value in the royal family. From It’s a Royal Knockout to “air miles ? Andy and his somewhat questionable friends, the institution is ripe for mirth. And last week, none more so than the Duchess of Cambridge, whose garden at the Chelsea Flower Show, Back to Nature, was, according to her co-designers, inspired by “forest bathing ?. What, skinny-dipping in Sherwood? Aquarobics in Arden? What glorious visions, but no. Apparently, it’s the Japanese practice of walking slowly and thoughtfully through a wood.
MAY27	The winner of this Tory leadership race will be the spirit of Thatcherism	Along with making tortured comparisons with Game of Thrones, the laziest thing to say about the Tory leadership contest is that it is going to be all about Brexit. That much is obvious, given Theresa May’s abject failure on Europe. The bewildering number of candidates will of course have to spend the next few weeks explaining how they’ll make a success of Brexit in her place.  A purity contest is well under way, as candidates try to demonstrate they are the most Brexity of them all. If you voted for May’s Brexit deal, or failed to resign after the Chequers agreement, then you’ve got a lot of explaining to do.
MAY27	Wanted: a modern Thomas Cromwell to mend Brexit Britain	”But his greatest ambition for England is this: the prince and his commonwealth should be in accord … a household where everybody knows what they have to do, and feels safe doing it.” The hopes of Thomas Cromwell, as imagined by novelist Hilary Mantel in Bring Up the Bodies, the second in her Tudor trilogy, were high even then; now, they seem laughably improbable. For who, in the present emergency, knows what they have to do? Not our elected leaders, nor us, it seems when it came to these European elections: rarely has a poll provoked as much bewildered debate about how best to ensure accurate representation of one’s political wishes. Where is the man or woman who can discreetly manoeuvre the politicians?
MAY27	For the sake of our health, we need to kick the indoor habit	As a species we need to get out more. Humans now spend so much time indoors that many of us are cultivating a variety of serious health complaints, and for some they could be fatal. It is not so much that outdoor time is inherently good; more that our bodies are built to anticipate it and the way we live now is confusing to our systems. Nearly two decades ago a study published in Nature magazine concluded that the average American spent 93% of their time indoors. And that was before tablets and smartphones. In trying to cope with the shaded, sedentary world we have made, our bodies wage war on what should be harmless antigens; they fail to make bones strong enough to support our weight; even our eyes struggle to focus without the help of lenses. This incremental creep across the threshold to the great indoors began tens of thousands of years ago when the first settled communities emerged. 
MAY27	Life on Mars? Sorry Brian Cox, that’s still science fiction	Who said this? “I’ve been having to say everywhere I go that there is no planet B, there is no escape hatch, there is no second Earth; this is the only planet we have.” If you’re a science fiction fan the answer might surprise you: it was the writer Kim Stanley Robinson, whose Mars trilogy is an ultimately utopian series of tales that describe the terraforming of Mars – planetary engineering to give it an Earth-like environment – over the course of several centuries after the Earth perishes from overpopulation and ecosystem collapse. Robinson’s pessimism about planetary settlement seems out of step with the spirit of the times. Unveiling his Blue Moon project two weeks ago – a robotic lunar lander to deliver the infrastructure for a crewed moon base – Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, portrayed it as the bold first step towards human colonisation of the solar system.
MAY27	Want to save the UK steel industry? Brexit isn’t the answer	The difficulties facing British Steel have quickly become part of the Brexit debate, with commentators variously pointing to our membership of the EU or our decision to leave as an underlying cause. Business is naturally cautious about entering into political debates, but it should not remain silent when it features so prominently in the public discourse. Industry has a responsibility to ensure its views are accurately represented and to establish the facts as they relate to our sector. There can be no doubt that the ongoing Brexit uncertainty has contributed significantly to British Steel’s problems. Unable to decipher what the UK/EU trading relationship will be in just five months’ time, planning has become fiendishly complicated for both UK exporters and their EU customers. The timing is particularly bad, with the EU having recently imposed “safeguard” measures to prevent a surge in steel imports resulting from protectionist action elsewhere. Post-Brexit, UK steel exports to Europe will be restricted by these measures, with a disorderly no-deal Brexit affecting them particularly badly.
MAY27	My aunt has died – and with her goes a treasure trove of family memories	The loss of an aunt isn’t one of the big deaths. I told myself that last week. My cousin had emailed with news that her mother, my aunt, had died unexpectedly in the week. She was my mother’s younger sister and lived far away in suburban Johannesburg. I hadn’t spoken to her since November, when I’d called on my birthday. Nothing structural in my life had changed. And yet it seemed like the most outrageous repositioning of the universe.
MAY27	The lack of coverage of the Ballymurphy inquest is a scandal	It is highly doubtful if many people living in England, Scotland and Wales know about the startling and disturbing testimony delivered at Belfast’s high court two weeks ago. For the inquest into the deaths of 10 people shot by British paratroopers in 1971, later known as the “Ballymurphy massacre”, has been under-reported by London-based mainstream media since it began more than five months ago.
MAY27	What makes the Tories think that anyone must be better than Mrs May?	I don’t know about you, but I am surprised that Chris Grayling has not yet announced that he is a candidate for the Tory leadership. You might object that his cabinet career has been distinguished by the opposite of success, but the lack of any demonstrable qualification to be prime minister isn’t holding back many others. Even his most adoring admirers wouldn’t claim that Boris Johnson added lustre to his own reputation or Britain’s global standing during his embarrassment-encrusted interlude as foreign secretary, but the contest begins with him as the pollsters’ and bookies’ favourite. More than a dozen other Tories think they have what it takes to lead the country during one of the most dangerous periods for Britain and their party since 1945. The quantity of the candidates is not an indication of the quality of the leadership pool. It is a symptom of rampant factionalism and unrestrained narcissism.
MAY27	US efforts to jail Assange for espionage are a grave threat to a free media	Do you remember the Collateral Murder video – the one that showed US air crew in Apache helicopters killing people as though playing computer games, laughing at the dead after slaughtering a dozen people, including two Iraqis working for the Reuters news agency? Do you remember how the US military had lied about what happened in that incident in July 2007 – first claiming that all the dead were insurgents, and then that the helicopters were responding to an active firefight? Neither claim was true. Do you recall that Reuters had spent three years unsuccessfully trying to obtain the video? Was it in the public interest that the world should have eventually seen the raw footage of what happened? You bet. Was it acutely embarrassing for the US military and government? Of course. Was the act of revelation espionage or journalism? You know the answer.
MAY27	How warmly can Charles greet Donald Trump, the man who leered at both Kate and Diana?	The latest on Donald Trump’s state visit, now reportedly reinvented as one of those new, 3G, multigenerational vacations, and featuring an all-inclusive “togethering” trip to the world’s oldest theme park, mentions presidential hopes for a meeting between his daughter, Ivanka, the former model, and William and Kate. As nightmarish as it sounds, Ivanka’s outreach could be the Trumpian idea of diplomacy, not least because Ivanka, recently returned from Africa, now has her own adventures in white saviourship to share. Any protracted Donald-Kate encounter has looked unlikely since 2012, when he commented on illicitly taken photographs of the duchess sunbathing, topless. The royal couple, who later won £92,000 in damages, said: “The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales.”
MAY28	A second referendum is a bad option for Labour. But it may be the only one left	To be a Brexit pragmatist has become an increasingly dispiriting and lonely experience. The middle ground on Brexit has been systematically torched from both ends. To desire a compromise was, in the aftermath of the referendum, a position shared by a large majority. During the horrorshow that was the referendum campaign, the likes of Nigel Farage hyped up Norway – which is a member of the single market – as a shining example of how Britain could thrive outside the EU. Two years ago, polling suggested that a very narrow majority of remain voters believed that “now the British people have voted to leave the government has a duty to carry out their wishes and leave”. There is a historical revisionism fashionable among some, which claims that Labour’s 2017 surge was down to remainers lending their votes, rather than the party’s radical prospectus; but as polling found after the election, just 8% of Labour voters named Brexit as the most important issue behind their vote. In large part because of the Tories’ calamitous handling of Brexit, both leavers and remainers have polarised. No deal – which was never offered as a serious proposition in the referendum campaign – is increasingly held to be the only true Brexit by leave voters. “Stop Brexit or bust” has become the default position among growing numbers of remain voters. A “soft Brexit” is no longer regarded as real Brexit by most leave voters, but is regarded as full-blown Brexit by most remain voters.
MAY28	Nigel Farage’s victory gives him the whip hand over British politics	By any yardstick, the European election results were remarkable for the Brexit party. Launched just six weeks ago, it secured 32% of the vote. Taking to the stage having just been re-elected at the South East England count, Nigel Farage proclaimed that if Britain did not leave on 31 October, then his new party would face down the Conservatives and Labour at the next general election. Those who point out that the parties committed to a no-deal Brexit only achieved around a third of the vote – and were outvoted by unambiguously pro-remain parties – are missing the point. Farage’s project has always been to reshape the right of politics. His has never been a majoritarian project, but it never had to be. Ten years after taking over as Ukip leader in 2006, Farage had successfully manoeuvred the European Union to the centre of British politics, leading to the vote to leave.
MAY28	How were the EU elections for Italy, France and Germany? Our panel responds	These elections reinforced Italy’s reputation as the big testing ground for nationalism and populism in Europe. The outright winner was Matteo Salvini’s League: less a political party than a vast coalition of different sections of the electorate, from businesspeople who want to cut taxes, to voters hostile to migrants, to fierce opponents of gay marriage. This coalition is held together by the identity politics of white Catholic ethnic nationalism. One sign of that was the crucifix Salvini clutched as his victory was declared. The 2018 elections, produced a League-Five Star governing coalition combining the anti-establishment politics of Beppe Grillo’s followers and the League’s hostility to migrants. After this election we know that nationalism is this coalition’s driving force. And now Salvini is set to pursue his party’s alliance with Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage in the European parliament to change Europe from the inside. The poll also demonstrated the sheer volatility of voters. The huge rise in votes for the League and the unexpected overtaking of the Five Star movement by the centre-left Democratic party all confirmed that in Italy, political affiliations are highly fluid.
MAY28	So begins the mad scramble to take control of the Brexit narrative	The European elections unfolded according to predictions: the Brexit party won big, Labour and the Conservatives both got a kicking, the Lib Dems and the Greens swept up. But predictability aside, these elections were bizarre – they were never meant to have happened, and as such, were conducted on the hoof. The most passionate voices on one side, at least, were fighting for seats that they intended to occupy for only the shortest possible amount of time. But the really distinctive thing was that no party said anything. The Conservative campaign launched to a near-empty room, with nothing to deliver but an abject apology. The Labour campaign, described in a withering email sent to supporters before the results by their MEP John Howarth, was “implausible rot” – defined by a single-minded determination to fight a European election without mentioning Europe. The party’s leadership took a ballot that was animated entirely by Brexit and preached a pious and incredible creed of forgetting our Brexit divisions and uniting in Labour-ishness. That much was predictable from the moment the elections became a certainty.
MAY28	The winner of this Tory leadership race will be the spirit of Thatcherism	Along with making tortured comparisons with Game of Thrones, the laziest thing to say about the Tory leadership contest is that it is going to be all about Brexit.

MAY28	I regret not learning my mum’s first language. Britain needs those ties	When I was a child, we had a ritual at the end of every meal. Tack för maten, we would each intone, as we licked our cutlery and placed it on our plates. Varsågod, my mother would say, as she slammed down the fruit bowl. My mother hated cooking, so she couldn’t actually claim that it had been a pleasure, or that we were very welcome, as the phrase implies. The important thing was that we had thanked her for the food, as instructed, and in the language instructed. Her children might be irritating, but at least they were reasonably polite. I thought of this after watching the usual doom unfold on the nightly news last Wednesday, when a clip popped up of toddlers – not politicians, actual toddlers – listening to nursery rhymes as they wriggled in their parents’ laps. As they listened, their parents were singing along in Yoruba. Children born to Nigerians in this country, and who had only ever spoken English, were happily singing in Yoruba. As I watched, I felt like joining in.
MAY28	For the sake of our health, we need to kick the indoor habit	As a species we need to get out more. Humans now spend so much time indoors that many of us are cultivating a variety of serious health complaints, and for some they could be fatal. It is not so much that outdoor time is inherently good; more that our bodies are built to anticipate it and the way we live now is confusing to our systems.

In trying to cope with the shaded, sedentary world we have made, our bodies wage war on what should be harmless antigens; they fail to make bones strong enough to support our weight; even our eyes struggle to focus without the help of lenses. This incremental creep across the threshold to the great indoors began tens of thousands of years ago when the first settled communities emerged. 
MAY28	Labour members should vote now on our support for a second Brexit referendum	Labour’s problem in the EU election was simple but fundamental. It had overwhelmingly remain members but a Brexit message. It was a remain party whose leader played both sides so unconvincingly that, as Lloyd George said of Sir John Simon, the architect of appeasement: “He has sat on the fence so long, the iron has entered his soul. ? For the sake of the country and the party, we now have to be clear about our opposition to Brexit. For me personally, the election was excruciating. Resistance to Brexit is the logic of everything Labour stands for. Yet instead of an unambiguous statement of support for a referendum with an option to stay in the EU, we fought on a formula akin to the design manual for a submarine – and one never intended to come to the surface. Labour party members, as well as supporters, were angry and bemused.
MAY28	Ken Loach has competition: meet the new heroes of socially conscious cinema	 This year’s Cannes film festival staged a clash that might have passed viewers by: namely, a fight between good old-fashioned social realism and a new, politically conscious cinema – one also concerned with probing sociopolitical injustice, but in a looser, more refracted way.
MAY29	Britain is in the grip of an existential crisis that reaches far beyond Brexit	The person who is best qualified to hold up a mirror to British politics today is neither a minister nor an academic. He is not even British. No: he is, of course, Michel Barnier, the French-born servant of Brussels. In his 1,036 days as the EU’s chief negotiator, he has sat for numbing hours opposite Theresa May, haggled with David Davis and Dominic Raab and their junior ministers and faced down countless Whitehall officials. He is the outsider who knows our system inside out. So when he popped up right at the end of the BBC’s fly on the wall Storyville documentaries on the Brexit negotiations, I leaned in to listen. Barnier doesn’t do florid, so his words leapt out … It wasn’t even Brexit at all. The UK is in a crisis as big as the country itself.
MAY29	Corbyn could come out fighting with a rebellious remain and reform agenda	Against the backdrop of the Tories’ historic European elections clusterflop, Labour’s results were merely bad. The natural party of government saw its vote share eroded by the Brexit party so badly that it was forced to endure its worst performance at a national election since 1832. Tory leadership hopefuls, looking to placate the infuriated Conservative grassroots, are already butching up talk of a no-deal Brexit, an outcome that parliament simply will not tolerate. The Tory party would split if it pursued a soft Brexit deal with Labour votes; it would split if a new leader ran on taking Britain out of the EU to trade on World Trade Organization rules. Brexit represents a fundamental crisis for the governing party. It’s important to make this distinction, not to excuse the poor showing of Jeremy Corbyn’s party, but to emphasise that Labour, unlike the Conservatives, has a way out of its Brexit bind.
MAY29	A tax on red meat? That won’t save the planet – or do much to improve our health	The devil is a shape-shifter, not least when he takes the form of demonic foods. In response, the armies of the righteous have already waged war on sugar, and now red meat is in their sights. This time their cause seems doubly just. Red meat, we are told, is not only bad for our health, but the belching and farting ruminants that we farm are ruinous for the planet. Emboldened by the apparent success of the sugary drinks tax, the weapon of choice to slay this monster is a similar levy on meat. Oxford University’s professor of population health, Mike Rayner, has even done the maths, and concludes that we need to tax red meat by 20% and processed meat by at least 100% to offset their costs to human health.
MAY29	Tory leadership contender Rory Stewart makes me cringe, but at least he listens	On bank holiday Monday, Conservative MP Rory Stewart left his constituency of Penrith and The Border and went walkabout. Calling on voters to approach him for a chat or a challenge, he then posted short videos and pictures with captions on social media. In one video he is chatting in rusty Dari to a Barking resident, originally from Kabul; in another photo he is sitting in Costa Coffee on his laptop inviting people to come find him, like a Tinder hopeful still in denial that their date has not turned up. It was a sight both novel and cringemaking as he seemed unable to find the right register or physical mien. Stewart is a Tory MP straight out of central casting: Eton, PPE at Oxford, the Foreign Office, OBE, FRSL, FRSGS, ETC
MAY29	Retirement should be a right. But it’s in danger of becoming a privilege for the rich	If, like many people, you dread your daily commute and the early mornings associated with work, why do it for more years than you have to? But for a lot of older people, that prospect is fast becoming reality – more than twice as many people over 70 are working now than a decade ago. Some people will naturally want to remain in the workplace on a full- or part-time basis, and enjoy their job, keeping active and spending time with colleagues. For many others, however, it is a necessity rather than a choice. Like all of us, older people have been hit by the rise in living costs, and some are forced to keep working beyond the retirement age to avoid falling into poverty. The decision to retire is, for many, an individual one, and an awareness that your financial situation remains precarious, and that working while you can is your only prospect of topping up your savings and pensions, is likely to weigh heavily on any decisions to stop work. Pensioner poverty has fallen from its peak in the mid-1990s but has begun to rise again in the years following the financial crash, with 16% of pensioners living in poverty, despite benefits for over-65s having been protected against cuts.
MAY29	As a newly elected Green MEP and a refugee, I’ve got a message for the far right	I am honoured to have been elected as a Green party MEP. I can’t wait to get to work on behalf of all those who put their faith in me and in our movement’s vision of hope. We are truly building a common world, rooted in the aspirations of the young and set to deliver lasting change for all. Millions of citizens from Sheffield to Stuttgart have grown weary of the same old politics of tribal allegiances
MAY29	Are ‘weed tampons’ the answer to period pain?	I have spent the past 15 minutes sprawled in an undignified position on the floor experimenting with cannabis suppositories. This isn’t a typical Monday night for me, I’ll have you know; I am doing it in the name of science. Specifically, I am doing it to see whether “weed tampons” can get rid of period pain. There is a distinct possibility that I just lost 90% of my male readers. The squeamishness surrounding menstruation is part of the reason that little effort has been made to find effective treatments for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and period pain. Want to hear some rage-inducing stats? There have been five times as many studies into erectile dysfunction as there have been into PMS. That is despite the fact that 90% of women have experienced PMS, while only 19% of men have been affected by ED. Period pain can be debilitating, but women are still expected to suffer through it with just ibuprofen or a hot water bottle.
MAY29	Labour voters want to come home, but the party must prove it will resist Brexit	Nothing has changed, to coin a phrase. Once again Labour has lost an election, and once again we’ve spent the weekend trapped in the same old Groundhog Day routine. Jeremy Corbyn trots out the same Brexit line, but with more emphasis on a second referendum and less on all the caveats to make it look as if something radical has changed; simultaneously, others talk down the idea that it has.
MAY29	Tommy Robinson was humiliated in the EU elections. Here’s how we helped do it	One of the highlights of Sunday night was a clearly stunned Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) fleeing the count in Manchester after realising that his hope of becoming an MEP was shattered. He polled just 2.2%, taking only 39,000 votes in the north-west and lost his deposit. When he first announced his candidacy, it seemed inconceivable that the man who had founded the English Defence League could become an MEP. Yet we also knew that he was the best-known far-right activist since the second world war, and better known than most of our politicians.
MAY30	There’s a new battle for Britain: resistance to Nigel Farage	All political parties were too self-absorbed to see it coming, but Nigel Farage’s 32% European election vote created a new dividing line in British politics – taking us well beyond the leave-remain split that has defined Britain since the referendum and threatens to dominate its politics for the foreseeable future. In the three years since 2016, when we should have been debating the bigger issue that the referendum raised – what kind of Britain we want to become – our rulers have been obsessed with one very narrow question: not even our future relationship with Europe, but merely the terms of our departure from it.
MAY30	Labour needs a reboot – and it could start with bringing back Ed Miliband	Labour needs a drastic reboot. The Tories may be in existential crisis, desperately flapping around in a rising tide of rightwing populism, but Labour’s hopes of securing the sizeable majority it needs to enact a transformative agenda are uncertain. The Brexit mire has robbed the Corbyn project of its core identity, a sense of insurgency; stripped away its optimistic, idealistic gloss; and suppressed the enthusiasm of Labour’s members and the voters most inspired by its 2017 manifesto. Its desperate, indeed honourable, desire for a Brexit compromise in a painfully fractured nation, to be the party that skilfully transcended the divisions bequeathed by a referendum result three years ago, was remorselessly kicked to death in polling stations last week. If the party’s position was intended to be a Rorschach inkblot in which remainers or leavers could see what they wanted to see, in the end all either saw was a splattered mess. It’s clear that Labour is now pivoting to a pro-referendum stance in backing a public vote on any deal parliament agrees. Corbyn privately knows it must be done. While there is some internal resistance within both his machine and the parliamentary party – and it’s easy to empathise with those who fear another referendum – the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is among those pushing for a decisive shift in political strategy. That will surely succeed – the game is up here – even if there remains no majority in parliament for a referendum, but a political reorientation must be spelt out in primary colours, or the party might as well not bother. The mixed messages from leading figures must cease. When Corbyn eventually makes his big speech committing Labour to a new stance, it should be done with gusto and it should be unequivocal. It should mourn the passing of the party’s heartfelt attempt to bridge a divide made impossible by the Tories’ calamitous mishandling of the process; it should be clear that, left with a choice of no deal or another referendum, no alternative remains; and it should directly appeal to those leavers who have suffered most from Britain’s broken social order with a bold, compelling economic vision.
MAY30	I know antidepressant withdrawal symptoms are real. Why didn’t doctors?	It’s something of a relief to see before you in black and white what you have known to be true for a long time: in this case, that antidepressant withdrawal symptoms aren’t, well, all in your head. In what has been described as a significant shift in position, the Royal College of Psychiatrists accepts that it has not paid enough attention to patients suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms when coming off antidepressants. Patients are to be warned by doctors when they are prescribed the drugs of how hard it can be to come off them. Patients who have been on the drugs for years (some of whom will have tried to get off and been so alarmed by withdrawal symptoms – mistaking them for a return of symptoms of their mental health condition – that they have felt unable to) will be advised to use a gradual tapering-off process.
MAY30	John Bercow staying on as Speaker makes a no-deal Brexit less likely	The Tories don’t agree on much these days. Some even want a general election now as a way to deliver what they view as a true Brexit. However, they can all get behind some good, old-fashioned John Bercow bashing. Ministers report that the only good cabinet meetings these days are those where they can go around slagging off the House of Commons Speaker over his latest – aggravating – decision on Brexit. So Bercow’s announcement that he has no plans to step down this summer – or in the foreseeable – will be generally ill received in the Tory party. When it comes to the challenges any Conservative leader faces delivering Brexit, the Speaker ranks in the top three – alongside a hung parliament and Brussels’ reluctance to renegotiate.
MAY30	Liverpool shows how councils can counter Westminster cuts and indifference	News that councils are running out of reserves will come as no surprise to anyone involved in local government. It confirms what I and many of my counterparts around the country have been saying for years: councils have been hardest hit by austerity.
MAY30	Forget Boris Johnson. The Tory leader could come from the centre	Something important and wholly without precedent is happening in plain sight in British politics – but not enough attention is being paid to it. The something is that never before has a new British prime minister been chosen by the grassroots members of the ruling political party. Such a thing might have happened in 2007, when Tony Blair resigned, but Gordon Brown was chosen unopposed. It nearly happened in 2016, after David Cameron stepped down, but in the end the other candidates stood aside in favour of Theresa May. Now it’s the third time it could happen, and this one is almost certain to be different. There are already 11 candidates in the field to succeed May. Five more are said to be weighing whether to join. Many will fall at the first and subsequent hurdles in June, when Tory MPs begin a series of elimination votes in Westminster. But it would be a surprise if this contest does not go all the way to a two-person runoff among the party members in July. If it does, that will be a historic first – a national leader chosen by a party membership, not by parliamentarians or the wider public.
MAY30	Women, being married needn’t make you unhappy – if you choose the right man	Tchuh, women. Never bloody happy, are they? Except, it turns out, they are, just not in the way they were told to be, and thought they should be. According to a new book by Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioural science at the London School of Economics, marriage and children do not – despite several millennia of literature claiming otherwise – give women the sought after happy ending. In fact, they put them at “higher risk of physical and mental conditions than their single counterparts”. (Dolan does not specify whether those mental conditions include insanity from watching the same Peppa Pig episode 1,174 times.) Now, I’m going to take some things for granted, the first of which is that Dolan is referring to heterosexual married couples, as is implied by how he has discussed his findings so far. The second is that the people Dolan interviewed are answering honestly, or at least do so eventually. By some measure, my favourite part of these findings is that while married people express greater happiness than other groups, they do so only when their spouse is in the room. “When the spouse is not present: fucking miserable,” Dolan said at the Hay festival last weekend. And yet, while married men reap some benefits from their misery – longer life, better earnings – married women can only look forward to dying sooner than their single, happier counterparts.
MAY30	Missouri may lose its last abortion clinic this week. That's dark news for us all	By the end of the week, women in Missouri may live in a state without a single abortion clinic. While restrictive laws in states like Alabama have made headlines, Missouri shows the other side of the anti-abortion strategy: steadily shave away at abortion rights. You don’t need to outlaw the procedure outright if you can make getting a safe, legal one nearly impossible. The reason there’s only one remaining clinic in Missouri in the first place is because the state has tried to regulate abortion out of existence. A series of unnecessary rules and regulations makes it harder both for women to access abortions and for medical professionals to provide them. Missouri’s misogynistic laws already don’t trust women to make their own decisions – they mandate that any woman seeking an abortion in the state has to come to a clinic, request the procedure, and then go home and think about it for three days before it can be legally proffered. They also require that young people under the age of 18 notify both parents and get the notarized consent of at least one parent before they can terminate a pregnancy – a serious hardship for girls who live with abuse, or who don’t have a good relationship with their parents, or who don’t want to be mothers but want to keep their medical decisions private.
MAY30	Uber's quiet ride option is a warning: we are falling victims to convenience	Uber has launched a quiet ride service in the US, which means that passengers can request that a driver refrain from talking to them during their trip. The quiet ride feature is available in Uber’s premium Black service. If you’re reading this thinking, “Great, now rich people have even less reason to talk to people outside their bubble of wealth,” then you’re not alone. Uber passengers will be exposed to even fewer diverse experiences, and will stop hearing stories that reach into their hearts and knock on the door of their empathy.
MAY30	How a radical new form of anti-racism can save Labour	An announcement by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) that it is launching a formal investigation into antisemitism in the Labour party is one more sign that the controversy cannot be addressed by internal procedures alone. Was it ever solvable through the party’s own efforts? There was a time when I thought it might be. Even before Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader of the Labour party in September 2015, there was deep disquiet in sections of the British Jewish community about what was perceived as his tolerance for Islamist terrorist groups. Following his election, repeated instances of antisemitic comments in the burgeoning Corbynite grassroots further stoked alarm. The attempted coup against Corbyn’s leadership in June 2016 deepened the problem, with non-Corbynite Jewish party members (and those within the Jewish Labour Movement in particular) becoming the focus of anger from some who supported Corbyn’s transformation of the party.
MAY31	This broken House of Lords doesn’t need reform. It needs scrapping	Imagine this for a gig. You get paid £50,000 for doing no discernible work, occasionally get to wear some funky-looking scarlet and ermine robes, prance around one of the world’s most iconic buildings, and even have subsidised meals thrown into the bargain. This is lifestyle that David Brookman, a Labour peer in the House of Lords, might recognise, according to a Guardian investigation. You, as a taxpayer, forked out the equivalent of two nurses’ salary last year in attendance and travel expenses for Baron Brookman of Ebbw Vale, who in a 12-month period didn’t participate in a single debate or submit any written questions. Still, who needs nurses? One in nine peers, in a full year between 2017 and 2018, did not participate in any House of Lords business (defined as speaking in a debate, holding a government post or participating in a committee), and 46 didn’t even vote: yet one of these still claimed a cool £25,000. (Lord Brookman did at least vote regularly.)
MAY31	Our glorious past is what we remember. The brutality behind it we’ve forgotten	Immediately after the second world war, German people were required to watch documentaries about the horrors of the concentration camps before they could get their ration cards. But the fact that they went, Tony Judt points out in his book Postwar, didn’t mean they actually watched. “In the half-light of the projector, I could see that most people turned their faces away after the beginning of the film, and stayed that way until the film was over,” wrote the German author Stephan Hermlin many years later. “Today I think that turned-away face was indeed the attitude of many millions.” As a German government official, surveying the 20% rise in antisemitic hate crimes in his country, advises Jews not to assume they can wear the kippah “everywhere, all the time, in Germany”, and an Italian far-right party tops the poll for the European parliament, we would do well to reflect on the corrosive impact of such determined “forgetting”. These memories need to be recovered not only to honour those who have perished or suffered only to find their experiences discounted and discarded: it is crucial for the moral potential and political vitality of the perpetrators too. It is simply not possible to deliberately “forget” the terrible things you have done and then expect to proceed as though they did not happen, and nobody noticed, just because you have chosen not to remember.
MAY31	After an encounter in an alley, I learned why women always need survival instincts	I was in Massachusetts, in a leafy college town that seemed entirely made up of bakeries and gift shops selling dresses from the 1980s. The Amtrak railway station was in the middle of the town and, because it was under renovation, it wasn’t clear where the entrance was. I ducked down a side alley and, as a guy, unkempt with a backpack, walked towards me, I went automatically through the usual rigmarole: was the music on too loud in the bar 500 yards back for anyone to hear me? How soon could I backtrack without alerting the guy to the fact I was spooked? Why hadn’t I stayed out the front? An hour earlier, I had taken an Uber from the hotel to the station. The driver had gone off the main route on to what he said was a short cut. “This doesn’t look right,” he said, as we swung off a suburban street on to a semi-dirt track and I thought: you’re telling me. He was talking pleasantly about TV shows; it was the middle of the day. But I followed our progress on the app until we rejoined the main road.
MAY31	Mueller stopped short of calling Trump a criminal, but did we need him to?	Did Donald Trump repeatedly break the law by trying to block multiple investigations into his mysteriously intimate relationship with Russia? The answer is rather similar to questions about the pope’s Catholicism and the propensity of bears to poop in the woods.
MAY31	What are our universities for? Taxpayers have a right to know	Eat your heart out, Henry VIII. Britain’s universities have pulled off the greatest institutional coup of our age. They have reversed the dissolution of these contemporary monasteries. The rescue job on student loans performed by Philip Augar this week is expected to channel another £6bn a year of state funds into universities and colleges. Almost half the nation’s post-18 cohort – principally the richer half – will continue to be removed from the labour force, supposedly to fructify in peaceful retreat for three years. Meanwhile, universities are sitting on £44bn of reserves accumulated since fees tripled in 2012, the other outcome of which is a staggering £100bn of student debt built up over the past decade. No one can say what the nation has gained for all this money.
MAY31	John Cleese isn’t alone in equating ‘English’ with white. Sadly, that view is mainstream	“Some years ago I opined that London was not really an English city any more,” is how John Cleese began a tweet on Wednesday. “Since then, virtually all my friends from abroad have confirmed my observation.” When eight long years ago he made a similar claim, he gave us the unabridged version. “I’m not sure what’s going on in Britain,” he said while appearing on an Australian TV programme. “Let me say this, I don’t know what’s going on in London because London is no longer an English city and that’s how they got the Olympics. They said: ‘We’re the most cosmopolitan city on Earth,’ but it doesn’t feel English.” He bemoans immigrants in London, but because of race and class he’s called an 'expat' in the Caribbean
MAY31	Young climate strikers could achieve even more by joining a union	Union membership in recent decades has been in stark decline. The picture has been particularly bleak over the past 20 years when it comes to young people. Fewer than one in 10 workers under the age of 24 are now in a union, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics released on Thursday. The proportion of unionised 16- to 19-year-old workers has halved since 1995, from 6.4% to 3.2%, with a similar pattern among 20- to 24-year-olds.
MAY31	My friend Walter Wolfgang’s life was a portrait in moral courage	Donald Trump flies into the UK next week, and we will be treated to the surreal spectacle of a widely reviled president meeting a defeated prime minister amid scenes of pomp, ceremony and protest. For all the high-level meetings he will attend, the president would gain far more by staying home and learning about the life of my friend Walter Wolfgang, who died this week at the age of 95. A lifelong peace activist, he was preoccupied in his final days by Trump and his growing belligerence towards Iran.
MAY31	There’s a new battle for Britain: resistance to Nigel Farage	All political parties were too self-absorbed to see it coming, but Nigel Farage’s 32% European election vote created a new dividing line in British politics – taking us well beyond the leave-remain split that has defined Britain since the referendum and threatens to dominate its politics for the foreseeable future. In the three years since 2016, when we should have been debating the bigger issue that the referendum raised – what kind of Britain we want to become – our rulers have been obsessed with one very narrow question: not even our future relationship with Europe, but merely the terms of our departure from it.
MAY31	I know antidepressant withdrawal symptoms are real. Why didn’t doctors?	It’s something of a relief to see before you, written down in black and white, what you have known to be true for a long time: in this case, that antidepressant withdrawal symptoms aren’t, well, all in your head. In a significant shift in position, the Royal College of Psychiatrists now accepts that it has not paid enough attention to patients suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms when coming off antidepressants. Patients are to be warned by doctors when they are prescribed the drugs just how hard it can be to come off them. Some will have been on them for years. They will have tried to wean themselves off and been so alarmed by withdrawal symptoms – mistaking them for a return of symptoms of their mental health condition – that they have given up the struggle. They will now be advised to use a gradual tapering-off process.
JUN1	Opium-pipers, bluffers and no-dealers impress in this Tory battle of nonentities	The official tagline for the Tory leadership contest is “EXPERIENCE MAGIC THIS SUMMER”. Its key value divide is between candidates who would smoke opium at an Iranian wedding, and candidates who would order a drone strike on one. We haven’t even begun to hear from frontrunner Boris Johnson, that flytipped sofa, who will probably be endorsed next week by visiting indignitary Donald Trump. Still, plenty to be getting on with. Esther McVey would order you a drone strike, no problem. The only issue is whether she’d be able to get all the gays in one place. This week, Esther waded into the grimly regressive row about LGBT teaching, suggesting that parents should have the right to deny their children educational access to reality (I’m paraphrasing). As she put it: “I believe parents know best for their children.” Yes babe! That’s why measles is back. That’s why you personally defend the refusal to pay a mother benefits for her third child unless she can prove she was raped.
JUN1	Politics may be broken. But it’s only politics that can save us	No one would cast Robert Mueller as the lead in a romcom. And yet watching him deliver a statement on Wednesday regarding his inquiry into Donald Trump, Russia and obstruction of justice was to experience a sensation familiar to all romcom devotees. It comes when the hero needs to reveal his true feelings but instead becomes tongue-tied. (Hugh Grant built a career on that moment.) You, the audience, are willing him to ditch the sub-clauses and double-negatives and just spit it out. You formulate the sentence in your head: it’s simple and straightforward. But he just can’t get the words out.
JUN1	Want to be Tory leader and say you’re a feminist? Show us how, exactly	Actions speak louder than words. And certainly T-shirts. Do you remember a few years back, when various celebs and politicians from Benedict Cumberbatch to Nick Clegg posed in This Is What A Feminist Looks Like T-shirts? It’s always dodgy when men do this stuff. Most women just think: “Why don’t you get on with being a good ally. Walk alongside us, not in front of us.” Yet this particular identity debate has now surfaced in the Tory leadership contest, which is suddenly chock-a-block with some unlikely specimens claiming to be feminists. Of course the leadership contest, in which 120,000 or so rank-and-file members of the Tory party choose the next prime minister, would do well to drape itself in T-shirts carrying This Is Not What Democracy Looks Like slogans, for it is indeed an affront to the very notion.
JUN1	What the new Lib Dem leader needs to do to make the party’s comeback last	When Vince Cable set a date for stepping aside as Lib Dem leader, back in March, it seemed clear that the contest to replace him would be about saving the party from oblivion. It was lagging far behind in the polls, still suffering from its poor performance in the 2017 general election, and everyone was talking about the terrible threat it faced from a brand new centre party, Change UK. The task of the next leader was big, but it was also fairly simple: to be a fresh face, and to persuade Change UK and the Greens to make pacts with them. They have spent nine years recovering from the last time they gained some traction with voters
JUN1	It’s time Corbyn reflected his own party, and opposed Brexit	There is a problem at the heart of the Labour party when the leader whips his MPs to support a motion calling for a confirmatory ballot on the prime minister’s Brexit deal and the chair of the party abstains. For a backbench MP to break the whip is bad enough, but for a member of the shadow cabinet to break collective responsibility is rare, especially when it goes without sanction. The dilemma helped shape Labour’s EU election catastrophe. The party sat on the fence, with the leader looking both ways, sometimes towards a confirmatory ballot, sometimes towards Brexit. From Ian Lavery’s recent Guardian article, it is obvious he was off the fence walking the fields where Brexit roams. Labour has paid the price.
JUN1	The Tories must do the unthinkable when selecting their leader, and forget Brexit	Dominic Raab wants us to know that he’s the man to negotiate with Brussels. Or at least, his friends do. Writing in the Daily Telegraph yesterday, the former Tory MP Nick de Bois recalled his time as Raab’s chief of staff at the Brexit department. It’s a paean that reaches a climax with a description of Michel Barnier ripping out his earpiece, and includes the line: “I have seen Dominic Raab look Michel Barnier in the eye and it wasn’t Dominic who blinked first.” Which is joyous news, if you use ocular moisture levels as your marker of greatness. Not everyone agrees that Raab played a blinder in Brussels. In the recent BBC4 documentary Brexit: Behind Closed Doors, we do indeed see Barnier tell a meeting that Raab made threats Theresa May “never dared to say”, but he also claims that Raab immediately backed down when challenged. (“He immediately took his words back … he is not always into nuances, Dominic Raab.”) So much for the Art of the Deal.
JUN1	This broken House of Lords doesn’t need reform. It needs scrapping	Imagine this for a gig. You get paid £50,000 for doing no discernible work, occasionally get to wear some funky-looking scarlet and ermine robes, prance around one of the world’s most iconic buildings, and even have subsidised meals thrown into the bargain. This is lifestyle that David Brookman, a Labour peer in the House of Lords, might recognise, according to a Guardian investigation. You, as a taxpayer, forked out the equivalent of two nurses’ salary last year in attendance and travel expenses for Baron Brookman of Ebbw Vale, who in a 12-month period didn’t participate in a single debate or submit any written questions. Still, who needs nurses? One in nine peers, in a full year between 2017 and 2018, did not participate in any House of Lords business (defined as speaking in a debate, holding a government post or participating in a committee), and 46 didn’t even vote: yet one of these still claimed a cool £25,000. (Lord Brookman did at least vote regularly.)
JUN1	Racial abuse in the playground? That’s just England in 2019	To celebrate my youngest sister’s birthday, I take her out for lunch. With five children between us, conversation is snatched: at any given time, someone is asking for a crayon or spilling their drink or moaning. It’s a prosaic enough half-term scene until my sister is suddenly reminded of something she wants to tell me. Last week, she recounts, she’d been walking down her local high street in a suburb of Bradford and heard a man shout out “fucking dirty wog”. She thought he had been speaking to her but then realised he had been referring to her nine-month-old daughter. This is England in 2019. I write this because the impulse might be to claim it as only a singular moment, and anachronistic. Yet yesterday the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) reported that racial abuse and bullying of children has risen by a fifth since 2015.
JUN1	You can’t teach schoolchildren ‘resilience’ when they’re micromanaged every day	Don’t tell the Conservative leadership candidates, but the education secretary, Damian Hinds, is holding a brainstorming session. He wants ideas on how we can toughen up British schoolchildren. Clearly he knows something we don’t about the future. “To truly prepare for adult life we need to make sure our young people build character and resilience,” he announced last week as he launched a new C&R initiative – as it will doubtless be shortened to in education circles. Yes, GCSEs and A-levels are important, Hinds said – but in 10 years’ time, exam results will be a “distant memory”. (Presumably Sats and Pisa rankings, too : the whole quasi-mathematical surveillance matrix that Hinds and his predecessors have painstakingly constructed for our children these past few decades?)
JUN1	Our glorious past is what we remember. The brutality behind it we’ve forgotten	Immediately after the second world war, German people were required to watch documentaries about the horrors of the concentration camps before they could get their ration cards. But the fact that they went, Tony Judt points out in his book Postwar, didn’t mean they actually watched. “In the half-light of the projector, I could see that most people turned their faces away after the beginning of the film, and stayed that way until the film was over,” wrote the German author Stephan Hermlin many years later. “Today I think that turned-away face was indeed the attitude of many millions.” As a German government official, surveying the 20% rise in antisemitic hate crimes in his country, advises Jews not to assume they can wear the kippah “everywhere, all the time, in Germany”, and an Italian far-right party tops the poll for the European parliament, we would do well to reflect on the corrosive impact of such determined “forgetting”. These memories need to be recovered not only to honour those who have perished or suffered only to find their experiences discounted and discarded: it is crucial for the moral potential and political vitality of the perpetrators too. It is simply not possible to deliberately “forget” the terrible things you have done and then expect to proceed as though they did not happen, and nobody noticed, just because you have chosen not to remember.
JUN2	It’s not his enemies but his erstwhile friends who are alarming Mr Corbyn	In politics, it is not your enemies who are the death of you. The game is up when you lose those you once called friends. The curtain finally came down on Theresa May when previously loyal Tory MPs declared that it was time for her to book a removal van. The most alarming development since the European elections for Jeremy Corbyn is not the sound of Tom Watson and other familiar foes challenging him. It is the anger of those whom he once counted as allies. The catalyst for a week of recriminations was Labour winning just 14% of the vote, the worst performance in a nationwide election since 1910 when the party was still in its infancy. This was a bit better than the more catastrophic result for the Tories, but emotionally it has been more of a shock to Labour because at least the Conservatives had warning that they were going to be obliterated. In its former stronghold of Scotland, Labour came in fifth with a vote share in single figures. In Wales, another historic bastion, it was third. Even in London, the spiritual heart of Corbynism, the party was drubbed into second place by the Lib Dems.
JUN2	Jack the Ripper’s victims had to be whores. Anyone saying different risks a trolling	You don’t need to spend much time on Twitter to know that the surest way to upset certain people is to challenge their preferred version of events, but if you want to watch those people, by and large white, male Anglo-Saxons, explode in real time, the social media site does provide a ringside seat. The historian Hallie Rubenhold made headlines last week when I interviewed her at the Hay festival about her book The Five, a biography of the victims of Jack the Ripper, and about the response to it from so-called Ripperologists – those obsessive devotees of the most famous unsolved murders in history who gather in murky forums to play amateur detective.
JUN2	Sin taxes on meat or flying won’t change a climate hypocrite like me. Rationing might	A favourite sport of the anti-green lobby is hunting out the climate hypocrites. It’s Emma Thompson’s lifestyle that has most recently been the subject of frenzied scrutiny after the actress addressed the Extinction Rebellion protest in London a few weeks ago. “Emma Thompson the first-class hypocrite!” blared one tabloid headline last month after she was spotted dining on beef carpaccio while flying first class to New York. So before I say any more about the lifestyle changes required to avoid catastrophic climate change, I’m going to hold my hands up. I’m a climate hypocrite. I care about the climate emergency. When I decided I couldn’t support Labour in the European elections, because of its Brexit position, I voted Green instead. But I’m ashamed to say I’m not great at applying my ballot-box behaviour to other areas of my life. The last time I ate red meat was last night. I’m heading to Gatwick to catch a flight after writing this.
JUN2	I was a D-day baby, but at least I wasn’t called Dwight	At the outbreak of the First World War, Sir Edward Grey, the foreign secretary, told a journalist: “The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.” It may sound now like a Brexit message – let the countries of continental Europe resolve their own conflicts, decide their own future relationships. Britain would stand aside and do its own thing. Such a notion was quickly shattered in 1914, as the enthusiasm with which volunteers sang their way to Flanders’ fields followed by conscripts slaughtered in their hundreds of thousands so cruelly demonstrated.
JUN2	Only a national government can deliver Britain from its Brexit nightmare	Brexiteers often hark back to the blitz. Maybe they think the “Britain standing alone” motif adds much-needed heroic purpose to a Brexit future in which Britain stands without trading partners or allies to tackle climate change. But they rarely invoke one feature of wartime: the national government steering Britain from disaster. Now that Britain faces its gravest emergency since the war, we might soon need another national government, purely to deliver a Brexit referendum.
JUN2	Both right and left should fear the justified rage of Remainers	The old parties are failing because they do not understand the driving forces of modern Britain: identity, authenticity and runaway disgust. For much of Westminster and the media, the only identity that matters is the identity of the working-class Leave voter. He is usually male and always white – for the ethnic minority working class has been forgotten. His authentic disgust will make the nation tremble if we do not bow to his wishes and give him the hardest Brexit imaginable. Forget that most of the Tory shires voted Leave or that young, working-class voters supported Remain or that the greatest predictor of attitudes to the EU is education, not class, or that the only solid promise the Leave campaign made was to keep us in the European free trade zone. The story of the angry white working class is set and everyone is sticking to it.
JUN2	Forget culture wars. Class is still the defining force shaping British lives	If you’re a woman living in working-class Middlesbrough, you are likely to die seven years earlier than if you were living in affluent Hart in Hampshire. If you are a disadvantaged child, you are 27% less likely to achieve five or more GCSEs at A*-C grades. If you attend a private school, by the time you are 40 you will be earning 35% more than a state school pupil. If you are homeless as an adult, you were almost certainly poor and working class as a child. Class shapes our world. For many, it constrains their life chances and checks their aspirations. For others, it confers a life of power and privilege.
JUN2	Behold the preening bodybuilders of the Tory party, craving attention	Come on, don’t be shy – who will go with the home secretary, Sajid Javid, to get the tattoos done? He wants “Revoke” across one set of knuckles and “Citizenship” across the other. If you don’t fancy that, how about holding LGBT people down for the former work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, while she steals their lunch money (and school sex-education rights)? Or cheering on Dominic Raab, or other Leave-ticket hopefuls, as they spit on the ground, offering to deliver Brexit by cage-fighting naked with the EU?
JUN2	The Spice Girls: cake fights and catty talk – what could be better?	Spice World – 2019 is, it turns out, only the group’s fourth proper concert tour. Today’s young pop hoofers, who never seem to be off the road or away from the endless churn of the promo rota, must be wondering with some envy how the Spice Girls managed that Beatlesesque feat of live shyness. Thankfully, despite some “sound problems” on the first few dates that muted vocals (perhaps they programmed the stage set-up assuming Victoria would be back), they seem to have given fans what they really, really want. This is a nostalgia tour and everyone is up for it.
JUN2	Democracy is the victim if the law starts to police politics	 ?The expanding empire of law is one of the most significant phenomena of our time.” So observed the recently retired supreme court justice Jonathan Sumption in the first of his Reith lectures two weeks ago. Last week, as if on cue to provide evidence for Sumption’s thesis, Boris Johnson was summoned to court, accused of lying during the Brexit referendum campaign when he said that Britain gave £350m a week to the EU. The claim may have been factually untrue. A lie, even. Allegedly. But the worst thing that could have happened to that alleged lie was for it to have ended up in court.
JUN3	The wrangling to become Tory leader is turning Britain into an oligarchy	Meanwhile back at the ranch, Britain must choose a new prime minister – and fast. Donald Trump may have been elected by just 46% of 63 million Americans, but Britain’s leader will be chosen by just 124,000 members of a benighted Conservative party. And those members must choose between two candidates preselected by their party’s 314 MPs. This is like some kind of oligarchy. If they are so obsessed by “honouring a referendum” on the EU, why not a national referendum on who should be prime minister? In reality, government by party in parliament has generally worked well and deserves respect. That a nation’s elected executive should be able to rely on a stable Commons majority is sound democracy, as any observer of America’s divisive constitution might attest. The current trouble is that the EU referendum shattered that stability. The Tories casually toppled Theresa May for negotiating what they knew in their heads, if not their hearts, was the only responsible way forward, a soft Brexit deal. They have now gone mad. All the candidates to succeed her are promising they can make pigs fly.
JUN3	Killdren are unlucky – 2019 just isn’t the year for songs about killing Tories	Since its inception, Glastonbury festival has been a safe haven for political dissent but it seems there are limits. Over the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that one of the bands booked to play the festival’s Shangri-La field, “two-bit rave-punk band” Killdren, had released a song called Kill Tory Scum (Before They Kill You). The paper also noted that the critically acclaimed London band Fat White Family had tweeted in 2015, in reference to a news story about the death toll of austerity: “If you voted Tory in the last election you have blood on your hands. Execute the fucking lot of them. SCUM.” Catherine Anderson, chief executive of the Jo Cox Foundation, told the BBC: “The direct incitement of violence and abuse, on any platform and in any sector, is wrong and something that we absolutely reject.” Within hours, Shangri-La had cancelled Killdren’s booking, although Fat White Family are still scheduled to play the Park stage. The outrage is excessive. It’s obvious from one listen to Kill Tory Scum (“Even if it’s your dad or your mum, kill Tory scum”) that the song is absurd, bratty hyperbole, not to be taken literally. Shangri-La’s hasty statement was rather sanctimonious, claiming that the field is “all about positivity and pacifism, unity and love”: criteria that it would be ridiculous to apply to every lyric by every artist. After they lost their slot, the band defended the “cartoonish and over-the-top nature of everything we do”. Won’t somebody think of the Killdren? The case against Fat White Family is even weaker, based on one four-year-old tweet, but the controversy says a great deal about Britain’s febrile political climate in 2019.
JUN3	I was on Love Island in 2018. This is what ITV needs to get right this year	As a doctor working in a busy hospital A&E in south-east London, I thought spending the summer of 2018 in the sun as a contestant on the ITV reality show Love Island wouldn’t be all that difficult. Sun, sea, attractive people and, best of all, no mobile phones – how hard could it be? It turns out I couldn’t have been more wrong. If the contestants in the new series are expecting a relaxed summer of sun by the pool, they are in for a shock. From the moment my phone was taken off me as part of the pre-show preparations, I realised it was not going to be a walk in the park. There would be no speaking to friends or family or knowing what was happening in the outside world. Then came the dreaded entrance to the Love Island villa, in which the men walk in, one by one, to a line of female contestants who are waiting, ready to step forward for you, or stay in line and reject you. My turn came and I stood there shaking as my worst fears were realised: no one stepped forward. I felt sick and ashamed knowing that very soon, millions of people would see my humiliation – including all my family, friends and colleagues.
JUN3	Why UK feminists should embrace sex worker rights	“Puta Feminista” (Feminist Whore) reads the banner taped to the wall, as women stream through the door at the Casa Roja. Freshly painted, the bright red casa is in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Constitución, in the heart of the red-light district. After today, it will be the new centre for Ammar – the Argentina’s Women’s Sex Workers’ Union. On any one day, up to 200 women arrive – morning, noon and night – to find clients on the corners of the neighbourhood. Lilian, 55, has been a sex worker for 20 years. She stopped working, but has been forced to return to the streets of Constitución to make ends meet. “We’re in the midst of a total crisis,” she says. “We used to work four to five hours a day. Now it’s 12, including on Saturdays and Sundays, just to cover the basic necessities.” Dramatic inflation (which reached nearly 50% last year), combined with a reduction in subsidies by the rightwing government under Mauricio Macri and at the behest of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have sent the cost of basic foodstuffs, electricity and water spiralling. A third of the population are living in poverty.
JUN3	The House of Lords needs reforming, but abolishing it is not the answer	Given the Guardian’s reports on the House of Lords, you might expect me, in my role as Lord Speaker, to come forward with some blanket defence. I do not. As this paper reported at the beginning of the year, I am opposed to what I called “passengers” in the Lords who make no or very little contribution. They are a minority, but they undo much of the good work done by the vast majority. In the past 12 months the House of Lords has made almost 2,300 changes to improve legislation; apart from daily oral questions, peers have tabled more than 8,000 written questions and taken part in more than 160 debates; while well over 300 peers have been active members of select committees which have published more than 150 reports on subjects ranging from tuition fees to intergenerational fairness.
JUN3	Britain is horribly divided – and that’s also the fault of remainers	In the buildup to the European elections, I travelled around Britain and had the sense of people talking about the state of the country in wildly different ways. “Democracy is broken,” shouted a Brexit supporter in Swindon. I met lifelong Tories on the affluent edges of the Cotswolds, anxious about how England seems to be embracing the politics of extremes. In Manchester, everyone was remain, but remarkably disengaged from the Brexit conversation. In Merthyr Tydfil, a woman who had voted for Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, offered the brisk rationale about her town that “it’s the same as it’s always been, so that’s why we need a change”. In retrospect, everything fitted the picture offered by that much-discussed YouGov poll last week, of a politics so turbulent that the Liberal Democrats are suddenly popular again, Farage is newly insurgent, and the two-party carve-up of 2017 seems like a distant memory. What polling wouldn’t pick up, however, was present in encounter after encounter: woven into very different conversations, a shared sense of weariness and exasperation. Clearly, the debate about Brexit is hardening, at speed. Compromise options seem to have been killed off by the 23 May vote, leaving no deal and the revoking of article 50 at the core of the argument. The most passionate advocates of another public vote seem to see victory as a likely prospect, barely pausing to think about the possible horrors of another referendum campaign. And among the leave and remain hardcore, there is something that is increasingly obvious: loathing and denigration not just of the Brexit debate’s figureheads, but the millions of people seen as being on the wrong side of the argument.
JUN3	Is Northern Ireland a democracy or a police state?	Those who investigate the dark aftermath of conflict walk on dangerous ground. The murder by dissident republicans of Lyra McKee in April was a chilling reminder that there are paramilitaries who are still intent on dragging us back into the hostilities of the past. Another case that has been playing out in Northern Ireland’s legal system is a shocking warning that this may also be true of the police. This case yielded a great victory for press freedom in Belfast’s high court last Friday, but the two brave investigative journalists who brought it about are still caught in a nightmare worthy of Kafka. They remain on police bail, facing unspecified criminal charges. This despite the fact that the highest judge in the Northern Irish state, the lord chief justice, has declared that on the basis of the evidence put before him, they have done nothing wrong.
JUN3	The Tories have drunk the no-deal Brexit Kool-Aid	Sam Gyimah on Sunday became the 13th contender to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader. Just think: if only four more Tories join the contest, there will be one candidate for every single percentage point the party racked up in this weekend’s Observer/Opinium poll (a paltry 17, nine behind the Brexit party which now, for the first time, leads the pack in Westminster voting intention). Now that’s what I call a target. Yes, it’s only one survey of popular opinion. But the poll enshrines the fundamental problem confronting the Conservatives in this race. It also helps to explain why the support of Donald Trump for Boris Johnson will not harm his chances in these very specific circumstances, and why Nigel Farage is playing such a central role in the whole fetid business. One way – the normal way – of considering this election is to assess each of the candidates as a prospective leader of party and nation. If the Tories are wise, they will consider carefully the claims of Jeremy Hunt, a seasoned veteran of government who has already proved to be a much more capable foreign secretary than Johnson (to be fair, he could hardly be worse). Matt Hancock – in spite of his sticky interview on Newsnight last week – is the future-facing candidate, especially good on the social implications of the technological revolution. Penny Mordaunt is, so to speak, the “woke Brexiteer”: a true believer in the UK’s departure from the EU who is also a committed social liberal.
JUN3	Three reasons why a Labor and Greens coalition wouldn't work	There is a sentiment I think is widely felt among progressive Australians: why can’t Labor and the Greens work together instead of this constant bloody squabbling? Conflict is dispiriting, but it’s inspiring to imagine the two parties somehow joining forces. A new and vigorous political movement that could smash the disunited and increasingly aimless conservatives. Of course, there are a few problems with this scenario.
JUN3	The reason Britain rolls out the red carpet for Trump? It’s what Britain does	This time it’s a full-blown state visit, rather than the brief smash and grab when Donald Trump insulted Theresa May, beefed with Sadiq Khan, and triggered a domestic mini-culture war because of a blimp. The buildup to this week’s pageantry was trailed on Sky News with an advertisement featuring an animation of that Donald Trump blimp casting a shadow over London with the tag line “He’s back”, with ominous music accompanying it, as if the whole affair were some sort of comedy-horror Ghostbusters movie. We have skipped the tragedy part, of history repeating itself, and gone straight to the farce. Hosting him right now is like asking your pugnacious neighbour over in the middle of your family row
JUN4	Brexiters beware: Donald Trump will trample all over our sovereignty	A diagram has been doing the rounds on Twitter related to the protests that will greet the three-day visit of the US president. Split into pizza-slice segments, it lays out the various causes and categories making up the anti-Trump offensive. “Women ? is one, while “families ?, “anti-corporate greed ?, “Europe ? and “Labour and union ? also feature. The format has prompted some puzzlement: what, for example, if I’m a woman and a member of a union, and I’m pro-Europe, and I’m not wild about corporate greed? What if a man were to be pro-women and also a member of the Labour party? Any confusion on the left ends there, though. Because we know where we stand on Donald Trump. We know why his state visit repels us, and we know why receiving him with all this pomp and ceremony is an insult to any proper notion of patriotism. We don’t need to go back over the arguments about “pussy grabbing ?, or consider again the implications of separating migrant children from their parents and imprisoning them, to clarify where we are on this president.
JUN4	China continues to deny Tiananmen, but we won’t let the world forget	He was just a kid, but he cried like an old man in despair.” Liane was trying hard to steady her emotions when she described to me how she had attempted to hold back a young boy whose unarmed brother had been shot by soldiers during the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. Liane was a student from Hong Kong when the 1989 Tiananmen movement erupted and she went to Beijing to support the demonstrations. On the night of 3 June, when 200,000 soldiers equipped with tanks and AK-47s were deployed against unarmed civilians, she was outside the Museum of the Chinese Revolution on the north-east corner of Tiananmen Square. She fainted after she failed to stop the young boy from dashing toward the soldiers, and was carried away covered with blood.

JUN4	I’ve had children at school for 27 years. At last I can stop pretending to like it	School’s out for ever. Just one more week and I will be free. FREE! I cannot tell you how I long for the end of school. You see, in the bizarre sociological experiment that is my life, I have had one child or another in school for about 27 years, and my youngest finishes next week. I have done my time. Obviously I sacrificed my offspring for the sake of my political principles, so these were state schools, of course. I never, ever want to hear another person saying they believe in state education – but just not for their very special child. Pray that I never need to inhale the stench of that angsty hypocrisy again while some dolt explains it is only “natural” to want the best for one’s children – as though I want the worst for mine. Gentrification is there in the class pictures. Those of my eldest are racially mixed and those of my youngest are not

JUN5	The climate crisis is our third world war. It needs a bold response	Advocates of the Green New Deal say there is great urgency in dealing with the climate crisis and highlight the scale and scope of what is required to combat it. They are right. They use the term “New Deal” to evoke the massive response by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the United States government to the Great Depression. An even better analogy would be the country’s mobilization to fight World War II. Critics ask, “Can we afford it?” and complain that Green New Deal proponents confound the fight to preserve the planet, to which all right-minded individuals should agree, with a more controversial agenda for societal transformation. On both accounts the critics are wrong.
JUN5	Brexiteers want a leader with Trump’s swagger. That would be the ruin of Britain	Donald Trump’s presidency and Brexit have their own special relationship, distinct from the celebrated 20th-century alliance between the US and the UK. The two projects were born a few months apart, the surprise electoral twins of 2016, delivered in similar pangs of voter rage. Both promised national renewal by defying foreigners. Each was greeted as a monstrosity by liberal diplomats who liked the old special relationship, being fond of the world order it represented. Three years later, the delinquent siblings meet, with Brexit Britain as host, Trump as guest. In developmental terms, they are stuck in political toddlerhood, struggling to articulate what they want and given to tantrums if not indulged. But they are on their best behaviour for a formal state visit. Trump laps up the pomp and frippery. He has a tinpot potentate’s vanity and appetite for parade-ground sycophancy. But the spectacle is also balm to the British ego, especially the bruised, Brexit part that feels insufficiently admired by the rest of the world. Eurosceptics kid themselves that royal hospitality will be repaid with trade concessions, while the pageantry animates a deeper nostalgia. It connects a certain British audience to memories of unalloyed majesty, when the gilded grandeur was a demonstration of hard, imperial power.
JUN5	The military crackdown in Sudan lays bare the dark heart of Bashir’s regime	Even though it was not unexpected, it is still horrifying. To assume that the Sudanese revolution would manage to topple not only Omar al-Bashir but also uproot the deeply entrenched network of military and security interests behind him was always optimistic. But the success of the protests so far, and the extent and consistency of the protesters’ efforts, offered a glimmer of hope that while civilians were negotiating with the transitional military government to end military rule, their leverage in the streets was strong. It became obvious, however, that the military regime and its associated security bodies were simply playing for time. And they have finally run out of patience. On Monday night the massacre began. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group created from the remnants of the infamous Janjaweed militia, moved against the main areas where sit-ins were occurring in Khartoum and opened fire. The troops burned the encampments, beat whoever they did not kill, and blockaded roads and hospitals so that medical support could not reach the wounded and the dying. There are reports of rape, pillage, and the bodies of the executed floating in the river Nile.
JUN5	Men built this system. No wonder gender equality remains as far off as ever	I’m not going to lie; it’s annoying to start one’s week with the news that no country in the entire world is set to achieve gender equality by 2030. Given that our world leaders seem to continually miss targets on every measure put forward to improve things, from climate change to poverty, I’m starting to suspect they don’t really care about anything. In any case, the UN reports that all but 10 countries have men as heads of government, so I’m tempted to paraphrase Greta Thunberg: we’re not here for you to tell us what you consider is politically possible in the society that you have created. The modern world was created by men, and it shows. The pay gap remains 23%; women are more likely to be in vulnerable work; we have less access to financial institutions; we’re less likely to have workplace protections and benefits; and we spend 2.5 times more of our time on unpaid work – in fact, women do so much unpaid work that if it were paid, it would account for between 10% and 39% of GDP.
JUN5	The west is complicit in the 30-year cover-up of Tiananmen	The events of 4 June 1989, when the Chinese government deployed the full might of its military to purge Tiananmen Square of students who’d been peacefully protesting there, have become known in China as the “June Fourth Incident”. Thirty years on, it is still thought of as an “incident”, a one-off event. In fact, it was part of a political movement in which every major Chinese city participated. To this day, a complete definition of 4 June 1989 as a historical event has not been realised, because defining a historical event requires not only the full facts but also multiple perspectives. And in its aftermath, the Chinese government intensified its oversight of free expression in China, deploying various tactics to suppress, arrest, detain and imprison anyone who spoke about “June Fourth”. It remains the most taboo and politically sensitive topic in China, much like the questions of Tibet and Xinjiang for the Chinese Communist party (CCP) and its machine of propaganda and censorship. Yet the facts and significance of “June Fourth” are not discussed in China. The exact events, the persons responsible for issuing directives, the methods of execution, the number of people killed and detained, and the killers responsible for the cumulative political decisions remain unclear. The memory of the past is an individual’s property. To deny it is to obliterate humanity.
JUN5	Yes, Jeremy Corbyn has to protest against Trump. But where does that leave politics?	There is almost nowhere on Earth Jeremy Corbyn belongs more than on a protest against a rightwing US president. His whole life might have been a preparation for this moment: 40 lonely years of preaching anti-US sermons in the rain to a handful of Stop the War faithful, only to find himself on the big stage for the big one. It marks a rare outbreak of leftwing unity after weeks of rage over Brexit, too. The revoltingness of Donald Trump is one of the few things on which virtually all factions of the Labour party still agree – and resistance has been a bonding experience for Britons more generally. From the student who mowed a giant penis into a meadow under his flight path to the Duchess of Cornwall being caught winking behind his back, every indignity heaped on Trump is a joy. How could Corbyn not be on the march, especially when the resurgent Liberal Democrats will be there in force, threatening once again to outflank him?
JUN5	Andy Ruiz Jr: champion of the ring, and of tubby underdogs everywhere	In these dark times, you have to take joy wherever you can find it: in footage of a deaf child being able to experience sound for the first time, in the epic lip-sync battle between Brooke Lynn Hytes and Yvie Oddly in this season’s RuPaul’s Drag Race, or any time a tiny dog (preferably a corgi, but a chihuahua at a push) tries to chase and catch a massive ball that would never fit in its itsy-bitsy jaws. This weekend, I found a new image that I will return to over and over again in times of crisis, whenever that picture of Nigel Farage covered in salted caramel milkshake just doesn’t hit the spot. It is my Mona Lisa. I want it everywhere – on my wallpaper, on my screensaver, on the inside of my eyelids so it’s the first thing I see in the morning and the last thing I see at night. It’s this, a photo of Anthony Joshua, that impossible Herculean demigod, being laid on his arse by Andy Ruiz Jr, a man whose physique can only be described as “Peter Kay in those John Smith’s ads from the noughties”.
JUN5	Want to tackle inequality? Then first change our land ownership laws	What is the most neglected issue in British politics? I would say land. Literally and metaphorically, land underlies our lives, but its ownership and control have been captured by a tiny number of people. The results include soaring inequality and exclusion; the massive cost of renting or buying a decent home; the collapse of wildlife and ecosystems; repeated financial crises; and the loss of public space. Yet for 70 years this crucial issue has scarcely featured in political discussions. Today, I hope, this changes, with the publication of the report to the Labour party – Land for the Many – that I’ve written with six experts in the field. Our aim is to put this neglected issue where it belongs: at the heart of political debate and discussion.
JUN5	An absolute state of a visit: what the Trump and Windsor snapshots tell us	Roll up, roll up! The freakshow is back in town. Which rather loses its impact when our own freakshow has not left town for the past three years, but never mind. Donald Trump is back in the UK for a full state visit. State is the correct word. If Theresa May was determined to bow out on a low, she’s done herself proud. The president of the United States was said to be bringing along his entire family this time. But despite reports, there seems to be no visual evidence that Tiffany has been allowed out of the White House basement.
JUN5	Criminalising people who attempt suicide is unjust and dangerous	The conversation around mental health has moved on, we’re told: we’re better at talking, better at listening. More recent wins for mentally ill people have been bolstered by historical changes in law, the narrative goes – the Suicide Act of 1961 one of the more obvious examples of positive legislative change. The reality is not as clear cut. Material gains for the community are few and far between – and despite the fact it’s been nearly 60 years since decriminalisation, mentally ill people are still being punished for attempts to take their own lives. Last month, Greater Manchester police was forced to defend its decision to prosecute two mentally ill women for “causing traffic jams” during attempts to kill themselves. One of the women explained that her mother, grandmother and uncle had all died in the past year; she was sentenced to a 12-month community order and ordered to pay £200 in costs regardless. The other, charged with illegally walking on a motorway, had £105 taken from her benefits payment and was sent back to the psychiatric ward she had fled from.
JUN6	Britain must not turn its back on the world made possible by D-day	They are saying that Thursday – the 75th anniversary – will be the last of the international D-day commemorations in which the veterans of 1944 participate. For obvious reasons that may well be so. The surviving soldiers who fought their way up the beaches of Normandy are in their 90s now, so it seems poignantly unlikely that more than a handful will return in 2024. But there is a more political reason why this week could be the start of a less unified approach to marking the liberation of Europe at the end of the war against Hitler’s Germany. The reason is that Donald Trump’s US and Brexit Britain, though both still immeasurably and justifiably proud of the roles their predecessors played in this epic climax of the war in the west, are each in their own way turning their backs upon the European order that the invasion of 6 June 1944 made possible.
JUN6	Farewell to Change UK – we hardly knew your name	After just three months, the party that was supposed to be Britain’s answer to Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance (formerly known as En Marche!) has split after taking just 3.4% of the vote in the EU elections. Six of Change UK’s MPs, including the interim leader Heidi Allen and spokesperson Chuka Umunna, have left the party to sit as independents, with (highly plausible) rumours that they will go on to join the Lib Dems. It would be tempting to point out how this is a bit like Brian McFadden splitting from his own solo career after leaving Westlife. Or take cheap shots about how they’re so crap that they’ve rehabilitated the Lib Dems, like a political version of a frat-boy wingman deliberately making themselves look rubbish in order to let Vince Cable look “bang-worthy”. Or mock the fact that the new party is now called – and I’m not even remotely kidding, Continuity Change UK – like a kids’ rock band thinking it’s cool to name themselves Hot Ice.
JUN6	Madonna’s age isn’t relevant. Her music is	When the carping over Madonna’s age began in earnest, the focus wasn’t on her singing, or songwriting, or even her stagecraft. The problem, according to certain sections of the press, lay with her hands. “Why do Madonna’s hands look older than her face?” asked the Daily Mail in 2006. Such was the paper’s concern over the then 47-year-old’s apparently awful paws, a plastic surgeon was drafted in to provide professional analysis. “As a person ages [the] plumpness goes, making the hand look bonier and more veiny … less elastic,” he said sagely. Since then, close-ups of Madonna’s hands have been as much a tabloid staple as Victoria Beckham’s scowl or Amanda Holden’s sideboob. Music critics tend not to pass comment on a musician’s appearance – to do so would undermine the seriousness of their endeavour. But the assessments of Madonna’s 14th album, Madame X, have nonetheless brought more subtle kind of disparagement. “Perhaps the erstwhile Queen of Pop should be content with the role of Queen Mother of Pop now,” said the Daily Telegraph’s critic, going on to note that a woman who has shifted 350m units and broken every record for a female artist going hasn’t had a Top 10 hit in a decade. Even in the Guardian’s review, which was mostly positive, the theme of her age was never far away.
JUN6	I know what drives young people to self-harm – I did it for years	I remember clearly the first time I self-harmed. I was an awkward 13-year-old girl, beset by problems with my body image. I had a budding eating disorder and was bullied mercilessly by my peers for being bisexual. The sensation of crushing hopelessness and self-hatred threatened to overwhelm me, so I addressed the pain in a way I believed wouldn’t hurt anyone else but myself. I turned all the tumult and sadness inwards, and the relief, although short-lived, was immediate. This began a pattern that would last well into my adult life. Trauma, in the form of losing jobs, sexual assault and family breakdown, prompted more self-harm episodes, resulting in countless stitches and permanent scarring.
JUN6	Waitrose’s package-free shopping is a PR move that will change little	Waitrose’s experiment in packaging-free shopping is an obvious win for the supermarket chain. Its decision to sell around 200 loose lines to shoppers at its Oxford store – they can now use their own containers to take home rice, pasta, lentils, cleaning products – will be catnip (now dispensed in self-service hoppers, presumably?), to ethical shoppers. The move co-opts the trend for “unpackaged” seen in more radical zero-waste shops and refillable wine and beer (growler-fills in Waitrose!) and ticks some useful, hip boxes for this rather stuffy middle-class brand. It is all positive PR and puts Waitrose on par with rival supermarkets who, facing predicted “polluter pay” legislation (more on that later), are suddenly super-keen to prove their green packaging credentials. Market-style loose vegetable aisles are being rolled out at Booths; Asda has removed the plastic wrap from its swedes; Morrisons has unsheathed its cucumbers (for part of the year); and both Iceland and Tesco are trialling schemes to pay customers to recycle plastic bottles (5.5bn worth of which are currently burned or dumped annually). Tesco is even experimenting with collecting and recycling “soft plastics” such as crisp packets, which local authorities generally cannot reprocess.
JUN6	The NHS cannot become a bargaining chip in our desperate deal-making with the US	Even when it’s in the process of being deliberately run down by the Conservatives so it can finally be privatised, our National Health Service makes America’s arrangements look monstrous by comparison. So those of us who have long suspected that privatisation is the ideological end-goal for many Conservative rightwingers were left unsurprised when the US ambassador, Woody Johnson, essentially said that our entire economy was up for grabs in a post-Brexit trade deal. Trump echoed this sentiment and then backtracked when interviewed by Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain (a cocktail of entities so loathsome that it can only add credence to the notion that we are hurtling along a dark alternative timeline following the rupturing of the universe caused by David Bowie’s death). Trump’s state visit may have seen the last few days of British diplomacy descend into a Boschian hellscape populated by sour-faced old colonialists, disturbingly shiny simulacra offspring, and a man in a wig and tailcoat who wouldn’t pass muster as an am-dram waiter. But more disturbing still was having to witness the to-ing and fro-ing over the bartering of our health service. Trump’s blustering over whether or not he wants to get his tiny mitts on our NHS is ultimately irrelevant: who truly believes that the man understands anything about the issues at hand? But when the time comes to discuss the parcelling off of NHS services in a desperate trade deal, the discussion will be dominated by US business interests.
JUN6	Damaging talk of ‘no deal’ spells doom for the Tories	We’ll come out, deal or no deal, on 31 October. That’s the spirit! We’ve got to have the courage to tell the people of this country we can do it if we really want to.” So says Boris Johnson in his jaunty launch video, all blind faith that he alone can leap the Brexit impasse when he is anointed prime minister (odds now 11/10). Where’s the democratic legitimacy? We the people are mere dumbfounded onlookers at the insolence of this coup, not “taking back control” but letting him seize it. Soon he will saunter into No 10 with no plans and an impossible promise to leave the EU on 31 October
JUN6	Why do US evangelicals support Trump? They’re giving Christianity a bad name	In the UK, the United States president is dismissed or condemned from almost all quarters, and most of us struggle to get our heads around the idea that millions of people voted for Donald Trump. One significant group of these voters were white evangelical Christians. According to the exit polls from the 2016 US election, white “evangelical Christians” voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by 81% to 16%. It has not been unusual for presidential candidates to court the so-called “evangelical Christian vote” in recent history. If you vote for a president, it doesn’t necessarily mean you support everything they stand for. I recognise that: the 81% represents a whole host of motivations and degrees of support rather than a united mass gathering under Trump’s banner. But it’s still a big number.
JUN6	I was fined for taking my child to Jamaica, but I'm one of the lucky ones	When it came to power in 1997, Labour picked up and ran with the Tories’ individualistic reforms to the school system. Along with school choice, league tables and academies, in came parental responsibility for absences. So I was disappointed, but not surprised, to be given a fixed penalty notice of £60 per parent as a result of taking our six-year-old out of school for two weeks during term time to visit Jamaica. The fact that my son will have the chance to engage with world renowned scholars during that time (as I’m going for work on a writing retreat) meant nothing to the local authority. It is deemed less valuable than sitting in his classroom, thinking about next year’s Sats. This is a reminder that we have replaced education with schooling, putting a premium on the state-mandated curriculum rather than the much wider world of learning. But as annoying as it is to be penalised for taking my child out of school, it’s not really parents like me who are the targets of the non-attendance punishment industry.
JUN8	Heavyweight Tory fantasists up the pace on the road to nowhere	As Theresa May formally relinquishes leadership of fratricidal comedy troupe the Conservative party, the contest to succeed her remains a dish best paired with arsenic. Or perhaps a lightly oaked strychnine. Still, what news from the revels? I’m afraid Kit Malthouse is already out. And that other guy. James Cleverly, maybe? They simply burned too brightly. Dominic Raab seems to have been disturbed during some policymaking again, leaving dogwalkers to find the remains of an idea to prorogue parliament so that no deal happens by default. On one level, this is the only policy position Dominic can adopt, having already resigned in protest at a deal he himself negotiated as Brexit secretary. However, Raab remains at large in this contest, with people warned not simply to avoid approaching him – that is a given – but to stay away from anyone even backing him. I mean, is he really going to drag the Queen into it? By “it”, I obviously mean a constitutional crisis, not his van.
JUN8	How Brexit is causing the strange death of British conservatism	Strange to say this of a country with a Tory government, but Britain lacks a conservative party. There are instead two revolutionary parties of the right, firmly set on a path that could be described as nationalist or populist. But it is avowedly not conservative. And now they are locked in a struggle that is dragging the older, larger party ever further from the values that are supposed to define it. That struggle would have been even more vivid if Nigel Farage’s Brexit party had won the Peterborough byelection. It would have filled Tory MPs with terror that Farage was coming to take their seats away, directly. Now they are consumed with a fear that amounts to the same thing: that the Brexit party will split the right-of-centre vote in sufficient numbers that even if Labour sees its own support collapse in dozens of marginals, Jeremy Corbyn’s party could still come through the middle and win – just as it did in Peterborough. Either way, the Conservative party is now gripped by fear of Farage. It is galloping towards the conclusion that it must offer what he offers, or else be swept aside. As Boris Johnson, the bookies’ favourite to be the next prime minister, tweeted in the dead of night after the Peterborough defeat: “Conservatives must deliver Brexit by 31st October or we risk Brexit party votes delivering Corbyn to No 10.”
JUN8	For England’s Lionesses to bring women’s football home, they’ll need our support	It’s almost time. At 8pm tonight the Fifa Women’s World Cup kicks off in Paris with an opener between hosts France and South Korea. The month-long tournament that follows will be a kind of test of whether footballing equality – or something approaching it – can ever happen for women. The teams taking part in the competition know what they have to do: win a football match, and then keep winning matches until they lift a trophy at the final on 7 July.
JUN8	Labour’s Peterborough win shows its grassroots strength. But Brexit risks persist	The Peterborough byelection could not have offered more fortuitous circumstances for the Brexit party. This is far from a Labour safe seat: it was held by the Tories with large majorities throughout the Thatcher and Major years, and lost again under Blair in 2005 to a rightwinger, Stewart Jackson, who once declared: “I’m at one with Ukip. ? Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour narrowly snatched the seat back in 2017, but its candidate, Fiona Onasanya, was imprisoned after perverting the course of justice and, after bizarrely comparing herself to Jesus Christ, was booted out by a recall petition. At this point, Labour officials privately thought the local party was doomed in a byelection. Peterborough’s 61% vote for leave places it comfortably in the top 20% most pro-Brexit constituencies in Britain. The Brexit party had impetus, having triumphed in the European elections just two weeks earlier, including a decisive victory in Peterborough itself. With polarisation over Brexit at its peak – and Labour itself particularly haemorrhaging support on its remain flank – you couldn’t have developed a more favourable opportunity for Nigel Farage in a laboratory.
JUN8	Do we need black people on our banknotes?	Usually, when a new campaign to rectify our national failure to acknowledge black ingenuity in building modern Britain comes along, I support it enthusiastically. I’ve backed the critique of our statues, for example, which promote white supremacists as heroes and ignore people of colour; and of our curriculum, which promotes ignorance about the racialised nature of British history. I’ve seen the need for a museum of empire, and the importance of books such as Washington Black, which told the fictional story of a black inventor erased from the historical record. But when I was asked to add my name to the petition calling for a black person to be the face of the new £50 banknote – a decision expected by the Bank of England this summer – I was hesitant. Not because I have any doubt about the strength of the argument. There have been 24 banknotes featuring a notable person since the first was issued in 1970: all have been white, and only three have been women – the last of these, Jane Austen, was chosen only after an extensive social media campaign and the threat of litigation.
JUN8	The Tories are bending parliament’s rules to get their way – like Charles I did	Every day seems to bring another sign of the collective emotional breakdown that has seized the body politic. This parliamentary session is now the longest since the 17th century. At the start of the year we had the longest period without an Opposition day (a day where the subjects for discussion are chosen by the opposition) since they were invented. The government has no majority in the Commons, but it has redrawn the rules so that it enjoys a majority on every committee. Even the Speaker has got in on the act, declaring that “forthwith” no longer means forthwith. So many historic precedents have been broken that it is easy to become inured to the craziness. A common cry around the scaffolded corridors of Westminster is “there is no such thing as normal any more”. So we should just take stock for a brief moment of the latest madness.
JUN8	Pity Ireland: the next page of the Trump family album	A collective sigh of relief as the Trumps left the UK en masse; the land a little less orange, a little less Sad! The palace staff keen to get cracking on Febrezing the shit out of all the furniture any of them touched. Harry unclenching his fists for the first time in 48 hours. Unfortunately for the Irish, Donald and Melania Trump arrived at Shannon airport to inflict themselves on another nation’s hospitality – like a less charming double-act version of Edward Gorey’s Doubtful Guest.
JUN8	Maradona and Naples created an unearthly and sometimes dark magic. I was there	Sundays would begin and end at a bar called Bollicine – bubbles – behind Piazza Leopardi station in the Fuorigrotta quarter of Naples. It was kept by a man called Enzo Cosenza, who also led choreography and singing in the city’s football stadium. That’s where we spent the time in between, across the span of two years with season tickets, watching Diego Maradona defy the laws of gravity and physics with a football. I was working in Rome, but commuting from Naples for romantic reasons, and I soon fell in love with Maradona as well. Ahead of Asif Kapadia’s much-anticipated documentary on the Maradona phenomenon, released next week, the talk is once again about Diego. The film turns the pages of a marvellous scrapbook, but doesn’t convey how Maradona and Naples shared a common heartbeat and soul. To understand Maradona in those days was to understand Naples, and vice versa: the same unearthly magic, the same brilliant light, the same maleficient shadows.
JUN8	Exit May. Now begins a battle for the soul of our democracy	Everything changes, but some things stay the same. To watch the Queen addressing elderly survivors of D-day this week was to be reminded that the point of monarchy is constancy. All hell might be breaking loose around her, but there she is, dressed as she has dressed for half a century and choosing her words with the care she always has. She has seen enough prime ministers come and go that one more presumably doesn’t make much difference. The rest of us, however, cannot afford to be quite so sanguine.
JUN9	As Theresa May exits stage left, the Tories dance ever rightward	The far right is defining politics. To understand how, imagine a line dance where each dancer takes a step to the right and points an accusing finger at the person next to him. You think we’re selling out British workers, says Labour, by not fighting for Remain, and threatening jobs and living standards by taking us out of the single market? Don’t think about what we are doing (steps to the right and points) – look at Theresa May’s deal that wouldn’t even keep us in customs union.
JUN9	It’s time gay people stepped aside... hetero whiners have rights too	At times like these, it’s a relief that LGBTQ people have absolutely nothing to worry about. Apart from Brunei wanting to stone them to death; Ann Widdecombe saying that science could “produce an answer” to being gay; the rise of homophobic hate crime, exemplified, last week, by a lesbian couple being viciously attacked on a London bus for refusing to kiss for the entertainment of leering heterosexual men. Just that sort of thing – relentlessly, globally, forever. Other than that, LGBTQ people have got it easy.
JUN9	Miley Cyrus, taking back control of her distorted image in Black Mirror	All hail the return of Black Mirror and its standalone dystopian techno-parables that are so able to predict the future that they elected a grotesque cartoonish hate-buffoon made famous by television and conjured up a prime ministerial scandal involving sexual activity with a pig. Its new, three-episode fifth season has VR gaming, social media addiction and a pop star/robo-puppy/voice assistant hybrid in its sights and, as ever, life imitates art, or vice versa, the pace of living being such that who really knows any more.
JUN9	We need to cut plastic waste: and supermarkets should lead the way	Last year Theresa May announced that by the year 2043 the government aimed to “eliminate all avoidable plastic waste”. It’s not soon enough. Over the past 12 months, the alarm bells have been ringing and the Blue Planet effect has got everyone’s attention. People want to see urgent action on plastics from the government and big business, and they also want to know how to take action themselves. And so, in a new series on BBC One, Anita Rani and I look at what can be done, on both a micro and macro level, to save our planet from the plastic menace. There are, of course, simple changes we can make. A few years ago in my War on Waste series I revealed that more than 2.5bn plastic-lined paper cups are clogging up our waste system every year because they can’t be recycled. Now most major cafe chains including Starbucks, Pret a Manger and Caffè Nero offer discounts to customers who bring their own reusable “keep cups”. We may also be on the brink of the widespread use of properly recyclable disposable cups (though a keep cup is always the better option).
JUN9	Pregnancy is the ultimate endurance test. If a man says it, it must be true	When Harry spoke to the press in his dazed and delighted way after Meghan had given birth, he said: “How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension.” I guess he meant labour, childbirth, that everyday agony and ecstasy that is part of women’s lives. How do we do that? After months of feeling not too grand while exposed to every myth going and being told what to eat, wear and how to behave, we have to get the baby out somehow. It’s what we do. Some women love being pregnant, some really don’t. Some sail through feeling mostly normal; others are sick, exhausted, permanently worried and just want it to end. Being pregnant is an ordinary thing that happens to women and yet it is absolutely extraordinary. Few tell the whole truth about it, as so often we are told to enjoy what is the most dangerous and precarious rollercoaster we will ever get on.
JUN9	Like May, the first woman in cabinet faced a lonely battle in a male-dominated world	The imminent departure of Britain’s second female prime minister reminded me of Margaret Bondfield. Unlike Theresa May, the former shop worker and union organiser is far from a household name – but she should be. Her story tells us much about the battle women fought to secure political representation and the way they were treated when they arrived in Westminster. It also tells us something about women in politics today. Ninety years ago today Bondfield made history when she became the first female cabinet minister.

JUN10	Hard Brexit is the drug the Tories need to wean themselves off	Imagine my surprise to learn in the Mail on Sunday that I had been a pupil at Eton. And not just that: I was among the “contemporaries of David Cameron”. As Dean Martin sang first and best: how lucky can one guy be? Sadly, this is all nonsense. No fancy waistcoats or winged collars for me. I did my A-levels in Catford, not Slough. True, I have been to Eton a few times over the years. But I never inhaled. The context of this journalistic schoolboy error (in every sense) was an article about Michael Gove’s allegedly louche lifestyle in his youth – inspired by his admission on Saturday that he “took drugs on several occasions at social events more than 20 years ago”.
JUN10	What kind of country have we become? Try asking a disabled person	I grew up in a Britain that said life would be full of promise for disabled people like me. We might not have conquered the media and corridors of power, but – unlike generations before me – by the 1990s we were no longer hidden from sight. Grim words such as “crippled” and “retarded” were no longer part of everyday speech. Charity tins that until recently symbolised the scraps handed out to us were now accompanied by concrete rights – from the groundbreaking disability civil rights law of my childhood to the welfare state’s tailor-made benefits and services for disabled people. Progress, though, is rarely as permanent as it appears. Nearly 20 years later, in the spring of 2013, I watched as David Cameron’s coalition government launched what would become an unprecedented assault on disabled people: from the bedroom tax to the rollout of “fit for work tests”, and the abolition of disability living allowance.
JUN10	Teaching children about LGBT issues is not brainwashing – it equips them for life	Last week, a high court injunction banned protesters against the teaching of LGBT-inclusive lessons from gathering outside the school gates of Anderton Park primary school in Birmingham. But on Monday, there is a chance that this could be lifted. Whatever happens, it is clear we need wider resolution on this debate in order to draw a firm line under it. To do so there are two challenges we need to tackle. One is the call of parental rights. The other is the idea of what is “age appropriate”.
JUN10	Arts institutions: cut your ties with BP	When Extinction Rebellion activists shut down London in April, we sounded the alarm loud and clear about the climate and ecological crisis that threatens humanity’s very survival. In response, around the world, governments, local councils, companies and professionals are stepping up and declaring a climate emergency. And yet, the silence from the major agents of climate destruction remains deafening. In the heart of London, the city that heard our rallying cry to “Act as if the truth is real”, BP, a global fossil fuel giant, is sponsoring the Royal Opera House Big Screen in Trafalgar Square. Rather than denouncing the damage these companies continue to do to our planet, our cultural institutions are lending them legitimacy.
JUN10	Why? The most difficult question for journalists to answer	Journalists learn from their first day in the trade that their articles should include the five Ws: who, what, where, when and why. The first four are straightforward enough, objective truths if you like. The fifth, however, often travels into subjective territory. It is frustrated by obfuscation and therefore results in speculation. Sometimes, despite our best efforts, it simply goes unanswered. Consider three examples. Why were journalists Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey arrested? Why did the BBC’s otherwise excellent documentary on Margaret Thatcher omit one of the defining moments in her reign as prime minister? Why do broadcasters go on using vox pops?
JUN10	If the magisterial 63 Up teaches us anything, it’s that we are sustained by love	On Friday night my wife, Lisa, and I watched the three episodes of 63 Up while my youngest daughter and her friend, in a respite from the brutal slog of GCSEs, caught up with a week of Love Island upstairs. Those of us who like to feel as if we have grown up with Michael Apted’s series – I was born the year after the first film, Seven Up!, was broadcast in 1964 – might be tempted to see some kind of tale for our times in that juxtaposition. There probably isn’t one, except to hope that some smart producer, with an eye on longevity, has signed up the love islanders for return visits in 2026 and 2033 and 2040, so we can observe the effect of time and mortgage interest and sleepless parenting on their muscle tone and wayward eyes. Each of the Up films has had its own emotional register. The Love Island equivalent, 21 Up, had a bit of shaggy haired, high-waistbanded 1977 excitement about the lottery of girl meets boy. Jackie and Lynn, two of the original friends from the East End primary school in the series, were already married by then. Tony, the artful dodger with aspirations to become a jockey, had met his future wife, Debbie, at a disco, and Paul, one of the boys from the care home, had moved to Australia and found his soulmate, Susan. Forty-two years on, this time around, two of those bonds – Paul’s and Tony’s – had endured, despite everything. Jackie has been divorced, married again, divorced, while librarian Lynn’s rock-solid marriage to Russ had ended with her sudden death in 2013.
JUN10	Our archaic first-past-the-post system is alarmingly unfit for a multi-party age	Labour’s tight win in Peterborough was a famous victory, one for the record books. You can go back more than a century and you will not find another case of an MP being returned at a byelection with a vote share as meagre as 30.9%. A win is a win, and the hissing sound you can hear is some air escaping from Nigel Farage’s balloon, but this was an incredibly narrow squeak. My one-stop shop for excellent electoral facts, David Cowling, has looked at every other byelection since 1918 and cannot find one in which the winner had the support of such a small minority of voters. Peterborough used to be a classic two-way marginal. The reds and the blues slugged it out and the other parties were spectators. As recently as the 2017 election, the combined Labour-Tory vote share was 95%. That shrank to just 52% in the byelection. This reinforces the message from the national opinion polls. The British electoral cake is now dividing up in a way that is without precedent. We have a four-plus party system with support split between the Tories, Labour, the Brexit party and the Lib Dems, plus a segment for the Greens. In Scotland and Wales, the nationalists make it a five-plus party system. It is not too much of a stretch to argue that we are really in a six- to seven-plus party system. The Conservatives contain within them at least two parties. The One Nation group of Tories would select a very different leader to the Moggite European Research Group. Labour is another unhappy marriage of ideological traditions that would be separated into different parties in other countries.
JUN10	Tea with the Trumps – a red leicester nightmare	Last Monday I attended the worst family dinner I have ever experienced. It honoured a visiting American with whom we were barely acquainted, but were somehow obliged to entertain. A few years previously our guest had suggested on a radio show that, despite thinking she was “crazy”, he could have “nailed” my late mother. She feared he was “stalking” her. Our guest had then clarified that he would only have had sex with my mother if she had an Aids test, perhaps because she had shaken hands with Aids sufferers.
JUN10	These D-day heroes evoked a glorious shared purpose. It’s now under threat	It was well done, in the end; in parts, beautifully done. In an era of anniversaries, there was never a chance that the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings could go by uncelebrated. But there were huge risks. Would the events feel like being locked in a glorious, vanished past? How not to appear extravagantly triumphalist or tip into schmaltz? How not to reawaken the stereotypes of the bad Germans? But the organisers got it pretty much right. The evocation of the day’s events – from paratroopers to the reenactment of cliff scaling – spoke for themselves. The speeches honouring peace and international co-operation were powerful and dignified, against a backdrop of veterans stressing “never again”. As these near the end of their lives, it was perhaps the last chance to bring their past to life, with personal testimonies of a bravery made to seem everyday. Even Donald Trump rose somewhat to the occasion, speaking to the common theme.
JUN10	Fake news will thrive as long we are happy to see only what we want to see	If a gorilla walked right in front of your eyes, you wouldn’t miss it, would you? Actually, half the country probably would. In a classic 1999 experiment, psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons showed people a video of basketball players, some wearing white shirts, some wearing black, and asked them to count how many times the players in white passed the ball. Halfway through the film, a woman in a gorilla suit saunters into the scene, faces the audience, thumps her chest and walks away. Extraordinarily, more than half of Chabris’s and Simons’s subjects were so intent on watching the ball being thrown that they failed to see the gorilla.
JUN11	Behold, the Tory leadership candidates: all in denial, all in dreamland	Imagine that some Rip Van Winkle, in a coma since 2010, suddenly wakes to look around and see what’s happening as the Tories choose our next prime minister. He’s an acute social observer, so he starts to check the facts of this decade and is shocked by what he finds.Wherever he looks, whatever he checks, he finds the scars of austerity are all around – and he assumes that’s what the candidates will confront. Talking to staff from his hospital bed he hears of 100,000 unfilled vacancies for overstressed NHS staff, with 2 million more people on hospital waiting lists. What kind of aftercare will he get, he asks? Not much, they say, with 1.4 million fewer frail people getting any social care, due to local councils stripped of half their funds.
JUN11	Do these homophobic attacks mean we’ll again have to hide our same-sex relationships?	“Not a safe space.” This is what my girlfriend half-jokingly whispers at me when I reach for her hand if we’re in a place where she doesn’t feel comfortable with a public display of affection. She says it jokingly to lighten the situation, which is in reality a depressing one, but also because the threat of violence doesn’t feel totally real to us. We have never been physically attacked because of our sexuality. Being middle class, white and feminine presenting in London puts us in a relative bubble of safety and privilege. Yet where and when we can hold hands, or whether we should do it at all, is something we constantly have to negotiate. On the one hand I feel a duty to utilise my safety and privilege to be publicly out and proud as a gay woman – to not shy away from public displays of affection. But on the other, I understand the complicated conversations and situations this can lead to. “If we hold hands in public it will normalise it,” I argued to one ex, who hated public displays of affection – mostly, she admitted, because of gay shame. “Why is the onus on us to normalise same-sex displays of affection?” she responded. To which I would wonder: “Well … who else is going to do it?”
JUN11	Extinction Rebellion’s tactics are working. It has pierced the bubble of denial	Extinction Rebellion is working. A YouGov poll last week showed that the protests by the direct action group, as well as those of millions of children led by Greta Thunberg, have sent public concern about the climate crisis to record levels. Extinction Rebellion shouldn’t have to exist. It only does because most of the media and government have failed. Despite Nasa warning we faced global disaster as far back as 1988, the media has taken an emperor’s new clothes approach. It has conveyed what Sir David Attenborough calls “our greatest threat in thousands of years” with the urgency of a quiche recipe on a daytime TV show, and with a detachment that suggests it doesn’t believe what it is saying. For years, it has told us the most you can do is recycle plastic and unplug your phone charger. But this hasn’t worked. Last year global emissions were the highest on record. Meanwhile, the scientific warnings have become louder and louder. The world’s leading climate scientist has urged parents to take to the streets.
JUN11	Notre Dame is becoming a symbol of Macron’s gung-ho presidency	To restore or to innovate? Ever since that terrible blaze laid waste to Notre Dame in April, the French nation has been divided between people who want to see the cathedral restored deliberately and precisely to its former glory, and those who prefer the view of the president, Emmanuel Macron, who vowed to “rebuild the Notre Dame so it is even more beautiful than it was”. Macron, in his typically forceful, overambitious style, has also insisted that the cathedral will be back to its best “within five years”. “We are a people of builders,” Macron said the day after the fire. “We have so much to rebuild.”
JUN11	The great Tory drug off shows they are delusional – from Gove to Andrea the ganja queen	‘Reality is just a crutch for people who can’t handle drugs.” This quote – attributed variously to Lily Tomlin, Tom Waits and Robin Williams – heaves into view as we enter the shebeen of hell that is the Tory leadership contest. Reality may be glimpsed at the edge of our peripheral vision, but it disappears as soon as any of them start to explain their hallucinatory view of Brexit. Witness, my friends, the effects of mass doping. Whoever wins is promising they will make the EU suddenly bend over, lay down the law in Ireland (which always works well) and give rich people free money.
JUN11	The UK should stop obsessing over GDP. Wellbeing is more telling	This morning, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released the latest set of GDP figures. It is a familiar exercise common to most countries: a day when the broad state of an economy is judged according to small changes in a single indicator. Yet last week, New Zealand broke new ground by eschewing GDP in favour of wellbeing as a guiding indicator when setting budgets and assessing government policy. Bids to the Treasury for money from now on will not only need a cost-benefit analysis, but an assessment of their wellbeing impact. Decisions about spending will be made on the basis of a project’s contribution to the wellbeing of the population, measured through four dimensions: human capital; social capital; natural capital; and financial and physical capital. It follows the Welsh government’s innovative Well-being of Future Generations Act, which places a legal requirement on public bodies in Wales to think about the long-term social, cultural, environmental and economic wellbeing impact of their decisions.
JUN11	It’s ridiculous that Michael Gove’s drug use could prevent him becoming Tory leader	Britain’s Conservative party is having a nervous breakdown. It is turning on the most competent candidate for its leadership, Michael Gove, for sniffing cocaine in his former life as a journalist. Unlike his chief rival, Boris Johnson, who joked about his drug-taking, Gove told the sober truth. The jokester laughs, the honest man is a hypocrite. Eight out of the 11 Tory leadership candidates have at various times admitted to taking illegal drugs. But all politics is hypocrisy, an edifice of pretence, insincerity and deviousness. The art lies in how you pull it off. Johnson has been a master of this art all his life. As his hero Winston Churchill showed, unsuitability for high office is no bar, given enough humour, personality and the gift of the gab. When a strait-laced Southern Baptist was asked how she could possibly vote for Donald Trump, she replied: “We are all sinners. He is one of us.”
JUN11	Chernobyl is still horrifyingly relevant – the lessons have not been learned	I was two years old and living in Kyiv when the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster happened. In spite of my grandfather’s fairly high military rank, we weren’t the first to know. When we did find out, I was, like many other children, shipped off to St Petersburg with my mother. My father, who was an engineer and had visited Chernobyl during his student years, later recalled how empty and ghostly Kyiv became. I don’t remember my grandfather speaking about Chernobyl, but I can imagine what it must have felt like for him. He was a combat veteran of the century’s most terrifying war and had hoped that his family would live out their lives in peace — and then this absolute horror happened. It was a tragedy compounded further by official cruelty and incompetence, by secrecy and the state’s inability to tell the full dark tale of what happened to a vulnerable populace.
JUN11	Gerraway with accentism – I’m proud to speak Yorkshire	Hopefully you haven’t subjected yourself to Still Open All Hours, the mystifyingly popular sequel to the classic Ronnie Barker comedy series of the 1970s-80s. If you have endured a whole episode then you’ll know that the Yorkshire dialect is a key element of the show’s humour. I watch David Jason’s Doncaster-based japes with a stony face. Perhaps the charm of the series is lost on me because I’m bored out of my chuffing mind by seeing Yorkshire’s working-class communities parodied for comic effect. We’re used to these trite “wi’ nowt teken owt” portrayals of regional dialect. Still Open All Hours, like Last of the Summer Wine, stands in a long tradition of hackneyed portrayals of bolshy but benign Yorkshire-sounding characters offering gentle, down-to-earth “by ‘eck, lad’ humour” with their hilarious flat vowels.
JUN11	The CPS is denying justice to thousands by secretly changing rape prosecution rules	This is a sad day. I belong to a national coalition of women’s organisations that have finally been forced to launch a legal challenge against the Crown Prosecution Service for its failure to prosecute rape. We believe the CPS has altered its approach in how it makes decisions on whether to charge or drop rape cases. For almost a decade, the CPS used a “merits-based” approach to building rape cases. This meant working from a thorough consideration of the law on rape (the seeking as well as the giving of consent, and being in a fit state to do so) and building a case that assumes the jury will make a decision without relying on “rape myth” prejudices.
JUN12	The Tory contest shows that the Brexiters’ dream is dying before their very eyes	Brexit is the reason the Conservatives are choosing a new leader, yet the competition has become a race to change the subject. Candidates are being judged not by any probability of success in taking the UK out of the EU, but by the ability to comfort fellow Tories that there is life for their party on the other side, once the deed is done. How to get there is a side issue.
JUN12	Why Corbyn is right to ditch social mobility	For decades now, social mobility has been feted as the answer to society’s ills. Conservatives have always embraced the idea of grammar schools – that giving a top tier education to bright children from working class backgrounds provides them with the opportunities their middle class counterparts take for granted. And from the mid-1990s, the Labour party shifted its emphasis from equality of outcome to equality of opportunity and raising aspiration. Social mobility has proven seductive to all sides of politics for two reasons. It is difficult to argue against: shouldn’t smart but disadvantaged kids be offered the opportunity to fulfil their potential? And the beneficiaries of schemes that pluck individuals from impoverished backgrounds and help them climb the social ladder tend to place great stall in their own backstory, and defend the system vociferously.
JUN12	Russian officials tried to frame Ivan Golunov. Instead they made him a hero	As of last Saturday, Ivan Golunov is officially the most popular personality in the Russian media, dwarfing Vladimir Putin. It feels surreal, even as I’m writing this, because Golunov is one of the humblest people I know. But since the weekend, his plight has captured the nation. Golunov is a reporter at Meduza, the Russian news outlet where I am investigations editor. Early in the morning on 7 June I was woken up by a call from Galina Timchenko, Meduza’s chief executive. “We’re in trouble, ? she said. “Ivan has just been arrested, something to do with drugs. ?
JUN12	The prospect of Boris Johnson as prime minister has reignited Labour’s civil war	Why now? That’s the obvious question arising from yet another bruising encounter between Jeremy Corbyn and his frustrated MPs, widely described as the worst meeting since the last one. The charge sheet is certainly serious, ranging from a failure to lead over Brexit to the way sexual harassment allegations against his aide David Prescott were seemingly brushed under the carpet and a long-standing reluctance to act on allegations of antisemitism (this time levelled against the new Peterborough MP, Lisa Forbes). But these are not fundamentally new problems. Labour MPs have been round this track again and again, and got nowhere. What is new, however, is that the whiff of a general election in the air has significantly raised the stakes.
JUN12	Urgency is what's demanded by young activists. But they're met with crumbling complacency	If there’s one word to sum up today’s political pace, perhaps it is urgency. Climate catastrophe is coming; hate crimes are rising; the far right is advancing and none of us can remember the last time parliamentary democracy wasn’t characterised by a hopeless race against a ticking clock. And yet, having spent a lifetime lulled into the complacency that comes with privilege and a centrist establishment, it seems our political class just isn’t getting it. We have 30 years to change the course of history, say school climate strikers. People are dying now, say human rights and equalities campaigners. Real change takes time and consensus and a series of repetitive votes in a crumbling old palace, say politicians.
JUN12	Kylie Jenner’s Handmaid’s Tale party was tasteless, but is the TV show any better?	Praise be, ladies. The world may be a dismal place at the moment, but Kylie Jenner is here to remind us that there is a bright side to everything – even torture, rape and oppression. The 21-year-old reality TV star and cosmetics mogul recently had the bright idea of throwing a Handmaid’s Tale-themed party for one of her BFFs. The book and TV show may be a downer, but, hey, the bright-red gowns look great on Instagram! Guests sipped “praise be vodka” and “under his eye tequila” cocktails while taking selfies – and completely missing the point of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel. Jenner’s bash, which she shared on social media (naturally), has prompted a backlash. It does seem remarkably tone-deaf to treat The Handmaid’s Tale like a hilarious joke when the US is becoming more like the fictional Gilead by the day. If you think that is an overdramatic comparison, just take a look at Alabama, which recently became the latest state to pass an extreme abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. Not only does the bill force women to have their rapist’s babies, but Alabama law means the rapist can get parental rights and sue for custody. Meanwhile, any doctor caught performing an abortion could get 99 years in prison.
JUN12	Disruptor has become a dirty word. And not just when applied to Donald Trump	There are many names people called Donald Trump during his recent UK visit. One of the more flattering was “the disruptor in chief”. When the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was asked about Trump, he responded: “He’s controversial. He’s a disruptor.” This description wasn’t Hunt’s invention. A couple of years ago, American commentators explained how Trump had disrupted the Republican party and was trying to disrupt the order of global foreign policy. Until fairly recently, calling someone a “disruptor” wasn’t a compliment. It bought to mind a disrupted rail journey, a disruptive child, a disruptive neighbour. Now being “disruptor” is a positive. Entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk are lauded when they seek to “disrupt” established industries such as car manufacturing. Large companies appoint “chief disruption officers”. Civil servants, teachers and school children are now encouraged to become disruptive innovators.
JUN12	Behold, the Tory leadership candidates: all in denial, all in dreamland	Imagine that some Rip Van Winkle, in a coma since 2010, suddenly wakes to look around and see what’s happening as the Tories choose our next prime minister. He’s an acute social observer, so he starts to check the facts of this decade and is shocked by what he finds. Wherever he looks, whatever he checks, he finds the scars of austerity are all around – and he assumes that’s what the candidates will confront. Talking to staff from his hospital bed he hears of 100,000 unfilled vacancies for overstressed NHS staff, with 2 million more people on hospital waiting lists. What kind of aftercare will he get, he asks? Not much, they say, with 1.4 million fewer frail people getting any social care, due to local councils stripped of half their funds.
JUN12	The populist right is forging an unholy alliance with religion	Why are so many religious citizens drawn to the rhetoric of authoritarian leaders such as Matteo Salvini, Viktor Orbán, Jair Bolsonaro and Narendra Modi? Even in countries with a strong secular tradition, such as France and the Netherlands, rightwing populists like Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders are quick to resort to language that presents “Judeo-Christianity” as the pillar of western European civilisation. In Belgium, the Flemish nationalist party N-VA has made a name for itself defending institutions “abandoned” by the Christian-Democrats, such as the Catholic schooling system and church services. In Italy, Salvini ostentatiously brandished a Catholic rosary as results from the European elections came in. In Hungary, Orbán has turned a defence of “Christian civilisation” into official state doctrine. Making a speech in Warsaw, where the ruling Law and Justice party has presented itself as the political wing of conservative Catholicism, Donald Trump echoed John Paul II’s old invocation: “We want God.”
JUN12	My mum was an addict. I know the pain and suffering this causes	Addiction is a life-threatening condition. It affects those around the addict who may never have touched a drink or taken drugs. As a child, I lived with an addict – my mother, Wendy. She was hardworking, great fun and loving. But I saw her struggle during, and in the aftermath of, failed relationships, with three children in tow.
JUN13	No-deal Brexit is still unlikely – but once again parliament has not ruled it out	It happened again. Parliament was offered a clear route to take back control, and it promptly handed the ball back to the government. Late Wednesday afternoon, by a margin of 309 votes to 298, MPs decided not to commandeer the parliamentary timetable in order to legislate against no deal. The first thing to stress here is that parliament has not decided to back no deal. It has not given the government carte blanche, and it certainly hasn’t resolved not to enact legislation in the future. Rather, MPs have decided, on this occasion, to reject what many saw as an opposition power-grab, and certainly what many Conservatives view as an affront to the constitution. Our all-important conventions dictate that ministers, not the opposition or backbenchers, run the legislative agenda.
JUN13	Ignore Boris Johnson’s bluster about Brexit. He wants a general election	Striding to the stage in a room filled with his rabidly Eurosceptic cheerleaders, Boris Johnson perfectly captured the tenor of the times, having been introduced by every Tory’s favourite bass-baritone, Geoffrey Cox. Johnson launched his leadership bid with a fictional plan for Brexit. He has promised to shred the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May, claiming that he can secure a better Brexit deal. EU leaders might have said they will not reopen the legal text, and have even disbanded the negotiating team in Brussels, but Johnson claims he can defy this political reality. There is little reason to believe this is true.
JUN13	Pride isn’t a party, it’s a time for queer people to fight again for their rights	History is but an unstoppable march towards freedom and enlightenment. Here is what is known as the Whiggish view of history, and if it wasn’t killed off on the battlefields of the Somme, Gallipoli and Passchendaele, it surely should have perished in Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka and Nanjing. Yet, somehow, even as a subconscious urge rather than a historical theory, it persists. While it is true that rights and freedoms can be won and secured through struggle and sacrifice, they can equally be sent hurtling into reverse. And that, it must be concluded, is the current threat facing LGBTQ people. As homophobic protesters gather outside primary schools to protest against children being educated about LGBTQ people – and succeed in stopping such lessons at one school – we have the grotesque sight of the Labour MP Roger Godsiff publicly backing them. Hundreds of Labour members have already signed a letter demanding his suspension and the party would be wise to listen to them. Labour has a rule allowing for the suspension of a member for bringing the party into disrepute; given Labour’s existential purpose is equality, surely endorsing anti-gay protests more than qualifies for bringing shame on the entire party – not least when they are publicly endorsed as a result by the fascist ex-leader of the BNP, Nick Griffin.
JUN13	Boris Johnson: a charlatan with bravado. Barely a word he spoke was trustworthy	The charm, the magic, the charisma were well polished – and this is as good as the man gets on best behaviour after weeks of behind-the-scenes training. If you puzzle as to how this man, unfit for every office he has held, can be about to sweep into Downing Street, his performance today is the answer. His snake oil of choice is optimism, so miserably lacking in politics now, radiating out of him like sunshine. All fake, all sun-ray lamp that turns off in private, but it outshines his rivals and dazzles anyone willing to ignore everything we know about his rotten-to-the-core character. Cheering in the room erupted rapturously from the remarkable assembly of MPs backing him from all wings of the party. Many know him bitterly well from trying to work with him, yet there they were, shamefully prepared to subject their country to the whims of a man they know is unsafe at any speed. A man without qualities, devoid of public spirit or regard for anyone but himself, consumed by lifelong ambition, needy for acclaim and irritable when it’s denied, willing to swing dangerously in any direction to be loved, a man to shame the country as its figurehead.
JUN13	Theresa May’s carbon emissions plan will fail if the chancellor remains complacent	In a new attempt to tackle climate crisis, the government is pledging to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. It’s seen as Theresa May’s bid to create a permanent legacy in her final weeks in office. While this target is still too slow, it’s a step in the right direction. Yet just days ago, her chancellor, Philip Hammond, raised concerns about the plan. In a leaked letter to May, he said the bill for moving to a zero-carbon economy would be upwards of £1tn. To caution about costs is a standard Treasury response to anything. But Hammond’s intervention, since he’s on the centrist wing of a party that appears to be moving ever further to the right, is particularly disquieting. If even he doubts that saving the planet is money well spent, what about the rest of his party? It calls into question whether this government can be relied on to reach its green targets.
JUN13	I was forced out of my job after having a baby. Then I was silenced by an NDA	For a lot of women, finding out you are pregnant opens up an array of questions. Will the baby be a boy or girl? Will everything go smoothly with the pregnancy? Sadly, another question that often pops up amid the excitement is: how will my employer take the news that I am expecting a baby? Pregnancy discrimination is a huge problem in the UK, with around three-quarters of pregnant women experiencing some form of disadvantage at work. In a survey for the Equality and Human Rights Commission, one in nine mothers reported that they were either dismissed, made compulsorily redundant or treated so poorly they felt they had to leave their jobs - that’s the equivalent of 54,000 new mothers a year. Yesterday, a new report from MPs highlighted evidence that some companies are pressurising women to sign non-disclosure agreements in order to cover up this unlawful behaviour and discrimination.
JUN13	Theresa May’s net-zero emissions target is a lot less impressive than it looks	Theresa May is doing her best to grab some good headlines in the closing weeks of her premiership. Setting a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions is vital, but her government’s plans are too little too late. Yes, Britain may be the first G7 country to set a net-zero emissions target by 2050, but others have shown greater ambition. Finland committed to be carbon-neutral by 2035, Norway has a 2030 target and eight EU countries have asked for all members of the bloc to commit to net-zero by 2050 and dedicate a quarter of the EU’s next budget to projects fighting climate change. Britain wasn’t among them.
JUN13	The New York Times political cartoon ban is a sinister and dangerous over-reaction	April, it seems, really is the cruellest month for the New York Times. On 25 April, its international edition (formerly the International Herald Tribune) ran a cartoon by the Portuguese cartoonist António Moreira Antunes, previously published in the Lisbon paper Expresso and depicting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a guide dog leading a blind Donald Trump. In the way of cartoons, the Netanyahu dog had a blue Star of David (presumably meant to signify the Israeli flag) dangling from his collar, while Trump wore a yarmulke. There was an instant outcry condemning the cartoon’s antisemitic imagery, including in articles and editorials in the New York Times itself. As a result, the paper has decided it will no longer publish any political cartoons in the international edition (the NYT domestic paper dropped cartoons several years ago) and is terminating its contracts with in-house cartoonists Heng and the multi-award winning Patrick Chappatte. In a statement released on Tuesday, the paper announced that it would “continue investing in forms of opinion journalism, including visual journalism, that express nuance, complexity and strong voice from a diversity of viewpoints”.
JUN13	Kylie Jenner’s party was stupid. But it won’t curtail the power of The Handmaid’s Tale	I felt a small spark of joy yesterday, as I imagined Margaret Atwood’s facial expression when confronted with the news that a member of the Kardashian family – Kylie Jenner – had provoked internet outrage by organising a Handmaid’s Tale-themed party. The novelist is known for taking no prisoners, and the footage, which shows Jenner and her friends squealing as they are confronted with Handmaid-themed costumes and cocktails, lays bare some of the most flagrant stupidity I think I have ever witnessed. Was I particularly offended? Before anyone cries “snowflake”, I was not. But I was astonished at the ignorance and privilege of the women in the video, who will never suffer if Roe v Wade is repealed, abortion is outlawed in the US and women’s bodily autonomy is drastically curtailed. The Handmaid’s Tale is a TV series to them, a piece of pop culture iconography that can be stripped of its context, but even then it is not without its dark connotations. The first series was a brilliant and faithful adaptation of the book, before the next series descended into violence so disturbing and gratuitous, that many women I know stopped watching. Yet the rape and the female genital mutilation and the torture did not preclude this story from being chosen by a young woman as the theme of a glossy celebration ripped of its context and appropriated.
JUN13	The Tory contest shows that the Brexiters’ dream is dying before their very eyes	Brexit is the reason the Conservatives are choosing a new leader, yet the competition has become a race to change the subject. Candidates are being judged not by any probability of success in taking the UK out of the EU, but by the ability to comfort fellow Tories that there is life for their party on the other side, once the deed is done. How to get there is a side issue.
JUN14	Boris Johnson may be an incompetent liar, but charm is his secret weapon	Charm is politics’ deadliest weapon. It is not charisma, the authority to lead through an electrifying presence. It is a subtler, more intangible quality, possessed by Boris Johnson. He may be blatantly unqualified as Britain’s next prime minister, but following yesterday’s first-round leadership ballot, he is still odds-on favourite. The basis for this lies in his disposition of charm. Johnson is the darling of the polls. He mesmerises punch-drunk Tories and disillusioned Labour voters alike. He emerges from his biographical record as incompetent, lazy, dissolute and a liar, yet the public’s response is that he is “our kind of liar”. He was sacked by the Times for story fabrication and was a wildly biased reporter while in Brussels. His default mode has always been that of standup comedian: funny, unpredictable, mildly dangerous. As the current campaign of his rival, Michael Gove, is derailed for far lesser sins, his campaign appears to glide forwards on sheer force of personality. The unfairness is grotesque.
JUN14	Two years after Grenfell, why are thousands still not safe in their homes?	The towers lit up one by one on Wednesday night. In London, Newcastle and Manchester, the message was simple. “Two years after Grenfell and this building is still covered in dangerous cladding”, read one. “Two years after Grenfell and the fire doors in this building still aren’t fit for purpose”, said another. At Frinstead House, a single-stair tower block next to Grenfell where residents watched the fire unfold from their windows two years ago, the message read, “2 years after Grenfell, this building still has no sprinklers”. Karim Mussilhy, vice-chair of the campaign group Grenfell United, whose uncle died in the fire, wrote: “Tonight, Grenfell United is shining a spotlight on tower blocks across the country still unsafe two years after Grenfell.”
JUN14	To shut down parliament would be simple. But it would be an outrage	Whoever is elected Tory leader and becomes prime minister will find the clock is still ticking. Britain is to exit the European Union on Halloween, 31 October. To avoid that outcome, the EU must agree to a further extension so that the government can alter the exit date. The new prime minister will also be confronted with the unforgiving arithmetic of the House of Commons. Most MPs oppose a no-deal Brexit, though Labour’s attempt to enshrine this in law failed yesterday. But MPs have also three times rejected the only seeming alternative: the withdrawal agreement so laboriously negotiated by Theresa May. The EU has insisted that no alternative agreement is available. Two candidates for the Tory leadership, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, propose breaking this deadlock by proroguing parliament – ending the session – so that MPs are unable to block a no-deal Brexit. This, some have objected, could involve the Queen – since prorogation, unlike the dissolution of parliament, which leads to a general election, is governed not by statute but by royal prerogative. Indeed, Lord Armstrong, the former cabinet secretary, has suggested that the Queen, before exercising her discretion on so contentious a matter, would consult with Jeremy Corbyn, as leader of the opposition, and perhaps also with others.
JUN14	As a new parent, I felt afraid and alone. The UK needs family-friendly policies now	The first day my partner went back to work after we’d had a baby, I had to shower, eat breakfast and make my lunch at 4.30am. In the dark. Without waking the neighbours. I had no other choice. My partner’s 90-minute commute and his 7.30am start time meant he had to leave the flat at 6am and wouldn’t be home again until 7pm. Thirteen straight hours of keeping an utterly helpless infant alive, on my own, having never done it before. If I wanted to eat, wash the night’s sweat, breastmilk and mustard baby shit off my body and have something for lunch, then I had to get it all sorted while there was someone else on hand to hold, rock, soothe, bounce or wind our baby. Because my partner was retraining (after a career change in his early 30s) he was entitled to precisely no paternity leave. Not so much as a day to bond with, attend to or care for his son. Let alone me. At his employees’ discretion he managed to get five days off as compassionate leave. Which is why, less than a week after giving birth, with blood still flowing from my body, my pelvis still creaking back together and having had less than two hours of continuous sleep, I watched him cycle off into the cold pre-dawn air, the imprint of the baby’s sling still marked against his shirt, as I prepared to face my first day, alone, with a baby. If I’d had a caesarean, I might not yet have been able to stand.
JUN14	Music saved my life. Banning drill takes hope away from black British kids like me	I grew up in Thornton Heath, south-east London. Although raised by a good family in a close community, I was exposed to violence and violent crime throughout my childhood and young adult life. I’ve seen people beaten and stabbed and shot. In 2011, I was involved in an incident where my mum was shot in front of me and my stepfather was shot and killed. I myself spent several years committing crimes, running from the police and, at one point, I went to jail. Although I now appreciate this is far from normal, we didn’t know that almost daily violence wasn’t the norm for most young British kids. I believe that we – me and my community – suffer from the trauma of what we experienced, to this day. Watching other artists make it out of “the ends” and on to our TV sets was a huge inspiration to me. They didn’t rap about butterflies and happy days; they rapped about a life that was like mine. But hearing their lyrics didn’t make me want to go out and hurt people, sell drugs and go back to jail. It made me even more empowered to make my life successful in a positive, legal, creative way. After being in a music crew for a couple of years, I formed a duo with my friend, Krept, in 2009, and I can honestly say that music saved my life. After the murder of my stepdad, it was music that actually pulled me out of my former lifestyle. Before music, there was just jail, gangs and getting arrested. Without music, I do not know if I would be alive today. Best-case scenario, I’d be in prison.
JUN14	Binge TV: a lovely sugar rush, but ultimately unsatisfying	How do you watch TV? All in one gulp or paced out slowly in weekly increments? This week a Radio Times survey suggested that the latter method is falling out of fashion, with 80% of respondents suggesting that they’d lost sleep binge-watching a programme, and more than half claiming to have watched more than eight hours of a show in one sitting. Yet how satisfying is binge-watching really? Yes, there’s something comforting about knowing that the next episode is only ever one short countdown away, but it’s also the case that being able to watch shows when we want and as frequently as we want (at least until that terrible moment when the episodes dry up) is increasingly affecting the way we consume TV – and not necessarily for the better.
JUN14	I was blocked from advising on UK drug policy – because I criticised UK drug policy	Last year, I applied to join the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which advises the government on drug policy. I thought I could bring expertise on the impact of policing on people of colour, on harm reduction and on legal alternatives to the criminalisation of drug users – all of which I have written extensively on – and the fact that I work directly with people who have a history of problematic drug use. But last October, I was notified by the Home Office that my application had been unsuccessful. In the feedback provided, I was told that the interview panel considered me to be “appointable” and I was described as having “impressive expertise”. However, the relevant minister ultimately decided I should not be appointed because of my social media activity. I submitted a subject access request to the Home Office – and the results were pretty shocking.
JUN14	My Catholic, trans child is living proof of how wrong the Vatican is on gender	The recent document from the Vatican’s Congregation for Catholic Education talks of an “educational crisis”, and alleges that discussions in relation to gender have “helped to destabilise the family as an institution”. As the parent of a trans child, I find this hugely disappointing. I have two teenage daughters. Their dad is Catholic, and they’ve been raised in the Catholic faith. When our youngest came out as transgender, we struggled. This was five years ago, and there was limited coverage of trans people in the media. We struggled in our own minds – how can our child know so young? What if she’s wrong? What does this mean? We struggled with our families – unsure of how to tell them, or indeed how they would react. We struggled with our church – would we still be welcome? Should we find a different one? A different school?
JUN14	Hong Kong is in danger. China’s promise of democracy was a lie	The ninth of June 2019 was a Sunday. Any other Sunday in summer at Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, old men and women would do their usual walkabouts and maids would gather, spread out groundsheets, cover them with spicy delicacies and listen to Filipino pop songs. But it was not like any other Sunday, at least not for me. Filled with anxiety, hope and anger, I joined the protest against Hong Kong’s proposed extradition law, alongside three classmates from my evening Spanish class. We were hopeful because perhaps there was a slim chance that our government would listen to us, for once. We were angry because our government had repeatedly lied to us. I had not taken part in any demonstrations since 2004, at which time I still had not yet completely lost faith in the sincerity of China’s promise of democracy for Hong Kong. But this time I just felt I had to.
JUN14	Sudan is heading for atrocity once again. The UK government must not sit by	Politicians and journalists frequently ask: where is the next Myanmar? Where will the next Syria be? The deteriorating situation in Sudan now presents an urgent test case of the strength of our resolve. In the last 10 days, at least 124 people have been killed by regime forces and more than 700 have been injured as protests have steadily engulfed Khartoum. There are widespread reports of sexual violence, mass arrests, gunfire in medical facilities and bodies floating in the river Nile. Beyond Khartoum, there have been larger massacres in historical conflict areas, where early reports suggest that people are being killed in even greater numbers.
JUN15	Brexit Britain is wallowing in dangerous talk of national humiliation	Launching his bid for the Tory leadership this week, Dominic Raab announced, histrionically: “We’ve been humiliated as a country.” For those of us who do not live on planet Brexit, this might have been mistaken for a belated reaction to the genuinely demeaning spectacle of Donald Trump’s state visit a week earlier. But, of course, like almost all of his fellow contenders to be the next prime minister, Raab was playing his part in a strange performance in which the national honour has been so horribly besmirched by the European Union that it can be salved only by taking the pain of a no-deal Brexit. Perhaps if you keep acting out phoney feelings, you end up not being able to recognise the real thing. Brexit Britain has been wallowing in a hyped-up psychodrama of national humiliation. It is, indeed, one of the very few things that remainers and leavers still share, even if they feel mortified for very different reasons. In relation to the EU, this sense of humiliation is wildly overplayed. But when Trump comes to town and really does degrade Britain, the sense of wounded dignity that ought to be felt seems curiously absent.
JUN15	Wake up, England: Boris Johnson’s ‘charm’ is just the arrogance of those born to rule	I recognise this feeling and I hate it. A friend is going out with a guy who humiliates her, spends her money, has affairs and is abusive. Yet she feels lost and is somehow dependent and when he promises he will make it all OK somehow, that he will change, and the future will be wonderful, she decides to give it another whirl. Anyway, she says, “what else is there?” Half-broken, she has lost the ability to even imagine a better life for herself. It is no use, my anger on her behalf or my lament over her passivity. And yes, this woman is you. She is England (not Scotland, you don’t need to explain the difference to me). I see you, England, on social media, bewailing our powerlessness and aren’t the Tories awful? God knows I feel your pain. I am just really bored of the self-flagellation of victimhood.
JUN15	Trump’s fanned the flames in Iran, now the fire risks getting out of control	The growing confrontation in the Gulf between the US and its Saudi-led allies on one side and Iran and its proxies on the other is now focused on the spate of recent mine attacks on oil tankers, which have been blamed by the US on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. This is a standoff that has been coming. It is incontestable that Iran has been guilty of destabilising overreach in the Middle East in recent years, as it has moved to build a crescent of Shia influence from Damascus to Baghdad and Lebanon to Yemen. But Iran’s actions can hardly be said to have occurred in a vacuum. As the Iran analyst for Crisis Group Ali Vaez recently argued, it has been the recent policy of “maximum pressure” on Tehran under the incoherent foreign policy of the Trump administration that has exacerbated the current tensions. In short order, the Trump administration has withdrawn unilaterally from the internationally agreed – and successful – Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) of 2015, whose purpose was to ease sanctions on Iran in exchange for verifiable limits on the country’s nuclear programme.
JUN15	Oxfam failed horribly on abuse. But I pledge to deliver radical change	This week Oxfam has been the subject of two incredibly difficult and important reports that identify serious failings in how we acted in the past: failings that were unacceptable and showed how far below our values we could fall. Yet these reports also include lessons that provide the path we must follow as we set out on a journey of what I hope will be transformative change. The Charity Commission’s report has left no doubt that what happened in Haiti in 2011 was shameful. The report by an independent commission into Oxfam’s global safeguarding practices and working culture again makes for sobering reading. It criticises our culture, with examples of sexism, racism and colonial behaviour. It also identifies major challenges, notably abuse in refugee camps where we and other organisations work.
JUN15	You saw me covered in blood on a bus. But do you get outraged about all homophobia?	On 7 June, characters from distant chapters of my life decided that my sudden trajectory into the headlines was an opportune time to reintroduce themselves, sending a torrent of misguided good vibes alongside the picture, asking had I seen it. Had I seen it? Had I seen it? Of course I had, as soon as it was taken. I was weeping bitterly, head ringing in pain as I sat next to my lovely date, Dr Melania Geymonat, who was calmer than I but dripping blood down her shirt front. We photographed the trail of our blood down the bus, ending at our still-bleeding faces as we awaited the police. I watched in real time as our faces – white, feminine, draped in pretty hair – circulated on every continent. Melania protected my name and information because I am a private individual without an online presence.
JUN15	Britain has a duty to help Hong Kong out of this dark moment	It took something out of the ordinary to provoke a million people in Hong Kong to take to the streets to demonstrate against proposed new extradition rules. Roughly one-sixth of the population demonstrated peacefully: families, young and old, lawyers, academics, students, professionals and manual workers. What caused such an outpouring against a piece of legislation? Quite simply, the people of Hong Kong – not British, but Hong Kong Chinese – have seen their government connive with the Communist regime in Beijing to undermine their way of life and freedoms.
JUN15	Chuka Umunna’s self-serving hypocrisy is emblematic of our broken politics	“You can’t trust a word the Lib Dems say”: here is an entirely accurate summation tweeted to the world in 2013 by the new Liberal Democrat MP for Streatham, Chuka Umunna. Announcing his second defection in four months, Umunna last night posed alongside Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, whom he once astutely declared “can’t run away from his record as part of the Tory-led government or try to pretend Tory policies have nothing to do with the Lib Dems”. Just two years ago, he bitterly declared he “can’t forgive” what the Lib Dems have “done to my area”; indeed that he “could never countenance suggesting voters support Liberal Democratic or Conservative candidates on account of their Remain credentials – this would require turning a blind eye to the cuts to our local schools, the NHS and other public services instigated by both parties in government from 2010 to 2015”. Everyone is entitled to shift their opinions: as John Maynard Keynes once put it, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” But what facts have changed about the Lib Dems since 2017? Both Cable and Jo Swinson, the frontrunner to replace him as leader, are unrepentant about the austerity they imposed on the country, and which Umunna all too recently passionately condemned them for. It gets better. At the end of April, a leaked document from Umunna’s Change UK revealed his then-party’s plans to wipe out the Lib Dems as an electoral force. Umunna has gone from seeking to politically extinguish a party to becoming its enthusiastic parliamentary representative in the course of seven weeks.
JUN15	Grenfell Tower, two years on: community members discuss what’s changed	I was in the cemetery just last week. I was showing my friend each grave, telling him about the person whose name is etched into the gravestone. He gasped as he realised that some gravestones had more than one name attached to them. It’s not a usual scenario, but then, is any part of what happened at Grenfell usual? We span two areas of the cemetery, visiting those we’ve lost, ending our visit by making prayers for peace, patience and blessings for each person who is no longer with us. A few days later, just last Sunday, I received several calls from people alerting me to a fire that had broken out at flats in Barking. Thankfully, no lives were lost, but life for all those who used to live there had changed … their possessions were destroyed within minutes.
JUN15	Help to buy has helped the well-off – and made the housing crisis worse	Conservative politicians have long professed their infallible belief that Britain should be a “property-owning democracy”. From Noel Skelton, who actually came up with the phrase in the 1920s, to Margaret Thatcher, who usually gets the credit, it is their maxim. So in 2010, when David Cameron found himself presiding over a fall in homeownership so severe that it hit a 30-year low and hearing that even the middle classes couldn’t get on the housing ladder, he felt compelled to act. Enter help to buy: a three-part scheme launched in 2013 made up of a highly controversial mortgage guarantee (which wound down in 2016), a government equity loan offering subsidised 40% loans in London, and 20% elsewhere to anyone who could get a 5% deposit together and an Isa. It was meant to help Generation Rent but, equally, to shore up the post-crash economy by creating buyers in a stagnating housing market. It was hailed as “the biggest government intervention in housing since right to buy”, but it wasn’t the first scheme of its kind. Labour introduced HomeBuy Direct in 2008 and George Osborne had launched a scheme called Newbuy in 2012.
JUN15	Another Etonian leader? Time for Labour to challenge the might of private schools	Not since Harold Wilson’s government set up a commission to deal with the “public school problem” has the Palace of Westminster hosted an event that could bring about the dismantling of Britain’s educational apartheid. But MPs this week held a debate on a programme for radical reform of a two-tier system that provides an elite education for a tiny minority of the population, and divides Britain into winners and losers. It could not come at a more propitious moment. Britain is on the brink of falling out of Europe; our mainstream political parties are tearing themselves apart; and populism is on the rise as people seek alternatives to the Westminster model of government. And yet, at this most critical moment in our nation’s history, we are reduced to spectators, watching in helpless horror as the Tory party goes through the motions of (in all likelihood) anointing Boris Johnson as yet another Etonian prime minister – the 20th in Britain’s history.
JUN16	When will the resistance in Britain to populism properly begin?	The resistance to the Johnson-Farage axis will not come from the parliamentary Conservative party. In private, MPs, who once made sure demagogues did not become prime ministers, admit that Johnson is a phoney, unfit for high office or any office. But the Tory party’s guardians no longer care. The gatekeepers are lifting the lock and urging the bullshitter to charge into the china shop. They calculate that only an alliance between the right and the far right can ensure their party’s survival. The pact may be unacknowledged. Johnson may neutralise the Brexit party by becoming more Faragist than Farage. The Tories will take his votes and he will fade into the background. I don’t see a man with Farage’s sense of entitlement fading willingly. His friends Matteo Salvini and Donald Trump have power in Italy and America respectively. Why should Britain’s man of destiny allow the Conservatives to pat him on the head and say: “The grownups will take it from here”?
JUN16	Are only certain kinds of people deemed worthy of our compassion?	When is a Good Samaritan not a Good Samaritan? When he or she helps someone undeserving of our humanity. In Arizona on 11 June, a jury was unable to reach a verdict on Scott Daniel Warren, a college lecturer accused of conspiracy to transport and harbour migrants after providing them with food and shelter. He faced up to 20 years in jail. He may still do if there’s a retrial.
JUN16	It’s last orders for working-hours boozing. We should drink to that	Has working-hours drinking culture died or is it just slumped in an office lavatory cubicle, sleeping off a liquid lunch? I ask, because the London Metal Exchange has banned staff from drinking during working hours, just as Lloyds of London did in 2017. Which has to be good. (City traders, dealing in millions and billions, probably need to be sober? Discuss). Though maybe it’s yet another sign of the end of an era.
JUN16	Binge-watching Jed Mercurio goes beyond the line of duty	According to a survey by RadioTimes.com, binge-watching is not the benign addiction that it appears to be. Almost one in five respondents said they had called in sick to work just so they could watch television, while half said they had watched more than eight hours in one go. I blame the United States. At least Britain has decreed that six episodes is plenty for a series. When I was heavily involved with The Good Wife, its 24-episode seasons really ate into my time. And I’ve been trying to watch Gilmore Girls for years and am yet to break the season three barrier. Will Rory ever get to college? I can’t tell you. It’s so long.
JUN16	We must transform our lives and values to save this burning planet	The case for action to tackle the climate emergency, on a scale far beyond anything that has yet been attempted, is increasingly widely understood. Almost three decades after the first UN climate treaty was agreed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and despite the commitments thrashed out among nation states at every summit since, global carbon emissions last year rose to a record 37.1bn tonnes. In October, UN scientists warned that within 12 years a target of 1.5C of global heating would be out of reach. Above this level, temperature increases are predicted to cause colossal disruption: 10 million more people displaced as a consequence of higher sea levels; greatly increased risk of fires, drought and extreme weather of all kinds; shrinkage of plant and insect habitats with massive effects on agriculture as well as nature; the extinction of coral.
JUN16	The Tory leadership battle is making Britain the kind of nation we used to laugh at	Imagine a faraway country, where an influential but controversial business with deep pockets hires itself a senior politician. It’s all perfectly above board, of course. He gets £275,000 a year for a few hours’ work a week, duly delivered to everyone’s satisfaction, while harnessing the company’s considerable soft power to support his personal and political ambitions. In due course, he runs for prime minister, with the company cheerleading all the way. Nobody is so unspeakably vulgar as to suggest any kind of quid pro quo. But if he wins, he will be legislating on matters of great interest to this company, from the tax affairs of its owners to the commercial conditions under which it operates. There is a minor uproar about all this, but people are largely resigned to the way things work in this country now. Besides, scandal has always miraculously slid off this particular politician without leaving a mark.
JUN16	Brexit Britain is wallowing in dangerous talk of national humiliation	Launching his bid for the Tory leadership this week, Dominic Raab announced, histrionically: “We’ve been humiliated as a country.” For those of us who do not live on planet Brexit, this might have been mistaken for a belated reaction to the genuinely demeaning spectacle of Donald Trump’s state visit a week earlier.

JUN16	Let’s get real before deepfake videos corrupt our democracy	“Deepfake”: it sounds like the title of a James Bond film. But deepfakes are becoming more dangerous, and frequently more sexually explicit, than anything 007 might get up to. A deepfake (the deep is taken from machine “deep learning”) is a computer-manipulated video, and the next frontier of conspiracy theory and fake news. Lots of us have been ringing the alarm bell for a while over deepfakes, but the nerdy language that explains their invention and evolution has perhaps meant that people haven’t paid attention. But this week an exquisitely realistic deepfake of Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, uploaded to Instagram (a Facebook-owned platform), cut through.
JUN16	Wake up, England: Boris Johnson’s ‘charm’ is just the arrogance of those born to rule	I recognise this feeling and I hate it.

JUN17	If you think Rory Stewart is the grownup choice, think again	These politically correct times make it difficult to keep up with the right nouns for thin-skinned online activists. Terms that attempt to pithily describe identities and behaviours are now slurs. You can’t even harass transgender women out of public life any more without somebody calling you a “Terf”; nor can you take pride in defending the centre ground of politics without highly unreasonable individuals defaming you as a centrist. No, the correct terminology for the custodians of legitimate discourse is simply: the grownups. The latest to win over the hearts and minds of the kind of people who describe themselves as “sensible” is the Tory leadership hopeful Rory Stewart. He’s managed to secure the endorsements of Kirstie Allsopp, David Aaronovitch, James O’Brien and Jane Merrick – all of whom, I’m sure, command a great deal of clout amongst the Ukip-ified Tory membership who will actually decide whether or not he becomes our next prime minister. But even if the politics of Stewart’s campaign don’t quite line up with the priorities of the Conservative grassroots , there’s no denying his cultural appeal. He’s a bit geeky, he’s posh, he makes car-crash video content – in short, he’s relentlessly himself.
JUN17	If you want to help Sudan, amplify the voices of those suffering its horrors	It has been two weeks since the Janjaweed, Sudan’s infamous militia, embarked on a brutal campaign to disperse and suppress a popular uprising against deposed president Omar al-Bashir’s military government. The country is still in shock. In its capital city, Khartoum, the atmosphere is that of a wake as the dead, raped and beaten are counted. The faces of the missing and presumed dead haunt social media, their families braced for the possibility of seeing their loved ones bloated and washed up on the banks of the Nile, where the Janjaweed’s victims are still surfacing. The full extent of this horror is still to unfold. As graphic videos of the violence began to circulate, the government shut down the internet, plunging the country into darkness, in which it still remains as the Janjaweed continues its campaign of state capture. The swaggering members of the militia prowl Khartoum’s traumatised streets, stabbing, shooting, mugging and harassing at will. The contrast to the heady days, not so long ago, when the city was the site of a colossal sit-in that became a cultural hub and a site of national reconciliation is almost too painful to note. That is my insurmountable torment, the fact that it happened so quickly, that Sudan’s cry of revolution was choked in its throat. The paint on the impromptu street murals mixed with the blood of the protesters who had made the sit-in a giant collage of hope.
JUN17	The urgency of climate crisis needed robust new language to describe it	Initial reader response was positive to the Guardian’s recent changes to the way it will refer to climate. “This is an epic struggle of ideas, crucial to our future,” wrote one aye-sayer. The announcement by editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, of five changes to the style guide generated reaction in media and science. For each change (in bold below) I asked Viner for her reasons, which follow here in italics. She began by reiterating that “none of the old terms is banned. If in a particular circumstance the original term is clearly more appropriate, then it should be used. But the preference is for the new terms.”Use climate emergency, crisis or breakdown instead of climate changeHuge-scale and immediate action is needed to slash emissions but they are still going up – that’s an emergency or crisis. Extreme weather is increasing and climate patterns established for millennia are changing – hence breakdown.Use global heating instead of global warmingGlobal heating is more scientifically accurate … Greenhouse gases form an atmospheric blanket that stops the sun’s heat escaping back to space.Use wildlife instead of biodiversity Biodiversity is not a common or well understood term, and is a bit clinical when you are talking about all the creatures that share our planet.Use fish populations instead of fish stocksThis change emphasises that fish do not exist solely to be harvested by humans – they play a vital role in the natural health of the oceans. Use climate science denier or climate denier instead of climate scepticVery few experts are, in good faith, truly sceptical of climate science, or of the necessity for strong climate action. Those arguing against it are denying the overwhelming evidence that the climate crisis exists. Readers took the discussion further, and I put some of their suggestions (bold) to Viner for her responses (italics).“Wildlife” is insufficient to describe “biodiversity”A reasonable argument … biodiversity is not banned, if it’s clearly the best term, then use it … wildlife is a much more accessible word and is fair to use in many stories.“Carbon emissions” should be “carbon dioxide emissions”“Carbon dioxide emissions” is technically correct, but a commonly used shorthand, “greenhouse gas emissions”, is even better if we’re talking about all gases that warm the atmosphere, ie including methane, nitrogen oxides, CFCs etc.Consider “climate instability” instead of “climate heating”“Global heating”and “climate breakdown” serve the same purpose as “climate instability”.Not heating, overheating“Overheating” implies a judgment about how much is too much. I think that judgment is captured by “climate crisis, emergency, breakdown”.
JUN17	Hong Kong is not China yet, but that feared day is coming ever nearer	Hong Kong has become a place whose present is unresolved and whose future is unimaginable. After the unexpected violence of the last week, no one can predict how the events of this afternoon, tomorrow, this week will play out. The only certainty is that Hong Kong’s way of life is under immediate threat and its people are coming out in force to defend it. But the curse of living in the eternal immediate present is that the stakes for this “last fight” could not be higher, especially since young Hong Kongers fear that if they are defeated in this battle, there will be nothing left to lose. The failure of the Umbrella movement five years ago, when Hong Kongers occupied important thoroughfares for 79 days, seeking greater democratic participation, to win any concrete gains has raised the stakes further still this time round.
JUN17	How to follow the Maybot? A droid PM	Perhaps we should have a robot prime minister. What do you think? It might be worth a go. Has technology advanced to the extent that some computer-centred entity could fail to do all the things Theresa May has failed to do almost as comprehensively? It’s possible. It might even fail to do them more quickly and efficiently – by which I mean succeed in accomplishing that failure more quickly and efficiently. Then again, to give May a bit of credit, the comparatively slow rate at which she failed to achieve any of her goals was the most commendable aspect of her premiership. Her order of preference was probably: succeed quickly; succeed slowly; fail slowly; fail quickly. She got her third choice – like so much of the electorate – and hence she’s been prime minister for a reasonably long time. So it wouldn’t be fair to conclude that her robot equivalent was better merely because it managed to reach her current nadir of non-success in, say, 0.37 seconds rather than two years and 11 months.
JUN17	Blunt knives to stop domestic violence? What next – stab vests in the kitchen?	Nottinghamshire police have been defending a new scheme to distribute blunt-ended knives to victims of domestic abuse. But some cooks are unconvinced by assurances from the force’s knife-crime strategy manager, Supt Matt McFarlane, that the utensils won’t compromise standards of food preparation. Has he really considered knife skills, in the round? The last time a similar innovation was proposed, rather persuasively, by three doctors in the BMJ, the late chef Anthony Bourdain considered it “another sign of the coming apocalypse”. And that roundly derided scheme was devised not with domestic stabbing in mind, but with armed young men with neither an obvious interest in, nor much opportunity for, home cooking. Isn’t that reason enough to rethink a plan that encourages women to cohabit with psychopaths whose suspicions, thanks to a new blunt knife, they may have alerted? Isn’t there a better case for free stab vests, for wear during cooking and whenever a known assailant might be around, in or out of the house? You can’t be too careful. As the Nottingham police and crime commissioner, one Paddy Tipping, said last week of the blunt knives project: “It is an excellent initiative. Some research shows that women are attacked around 19 times before they leave their home.”
JUN17	When will the resistance in Britain to populism properly begin?	The resistance to the Johnson-Farage axis will not come from the parliamentary Conservative party. In private, MPs, who once made sure demagogues did not become prime ministers, admit that Johnson is a phoney, unfit for high office or any office. But the Tory party’s guardians no longer care. The gatekeepers are lifting the lock and urging the bullshitter to charge into the china shop. They calculate that only an alliance between the right and the far right can ensure their party’s survival. The pact may be unacknowledged. Johnson may neutralise the Brexit party by becoming more Faragist than Farage. The Tories will take his votes and he will fade into the background. I don’t see a man with Farage’s sense of entitlement fading willingly. His friends Matteo Salvini and Donald Trump have power in Italy and America respectively. Why should Britain’s man of destiny allow the Conservatives to pat him on the head and say: “The grownups will take it from here”?
JUN17	Jo Brand’s joke: are we all now disgusted of Tunbridge Wells?	I don’t know about you, but I’m aghast. Thunderstruck, flabbergasted, jaw on the ground, fists in the air, full body-a-tremble outraged... In case you didn’t hear, in the past few days, Jo Brand has been catapulted from “funny-in-the-90s ? comedian to cause celebre, via a stint in the social media stocks. The trigger was a comment made on Radio 4’s Heresy, a comedy panel show that primes guests to challenge received wisdom on a range of topics via “heretical ? comments.
JUN17	Are only certain kinds of people deemed worthy of our compassion?	When is a Good Samaritan not a Good Samaritan? When he or she helps someone undeserving of our humanity. In Arizona on 11 June, a jury was unable to reach a verdict on Scott Daniel Warren, a college lecturer accused of conspiracy to transport and harbour migrants after providing them with food and shelter. He faced up to 20 years in jail. He may still do if there’s a retrial.
JUN17	Don’t mess with the Scots or we’ll send in the patrol boats	Perhaps it will come to be known as the Rockall Rammy and feature occasionally in future modern studies Higher papers. “Discuss Scotland’s seven-day period of imperial aggression towards Ireland in 2019 with reference to the island of Rockall.” You could fill your boots and make it up as you go along, just as the SNP did. When the Scottish government announced a few weeks ago that we were sending a patrol boat to shoo away Irish fishing vessels from the waters around Rockall, many Scots were intrigued. Rockall is an uninhabitable block of granite in the North Atlantic Ocean that was annexed by the British in 1955. It lies 163 miles distant from North Uist, making it around 30 miles closer to Britain than to Ireland.
JUN18	Theresa May could yet give us the ultimate parting gift: a Brexit referendum	The obscene sight of Tory leadership candidates splashing out cash by the bucketload is just one of the head-clutching, this-can’t-be-happening unbelievables of this extraordinary time. Spaffing it up the wall doesn’t begin to express the revolting spectacle of wild tax cuts and eye-catching gimmicks from the same austerians who garrotted every public service. Theresa May is the biggest spender, spraying goodbye billions on mental health, schools, colleges and a zero-carbon pledge, while Philip Hammond’s Treasury declares it “immoral” to steal from the emergency no-deal fund. What does she care? She is taking her revenge on them all. Who knows the dark recesses of her mind, this locked-in woman incapable of communication?
JUN18	I’m pregnant and forced to choose between being an MP and a mum	Even when you’ve spent a lifetime fighting for equality, you can still be floored by the way discrimination manifests itself. I never thought parliament would tell me to choose between being an MP and being a mum. My Labour colleague Tulip Siddiq was forced to postpone a C-section so she could cast a vote in the debate on Theresa May’s Brexit deal in January and that caused a rightful outcry. Westminster can – when it wants – make it possible to combine parenthood with legislating and Siddiq’s push for progress on a system that would have allowed her to vote by proxy demonstrates it. But allowing an MP to nominate someone to vote on their behalf when they need to be at home with their children is just one piece of a much bigger equality puzzle. During my first miscarriage, aching and bleeding, I joined a protest for the extradition of a man who had raped and murdered a constituent. The day after I found out that another baby’s heartbeat had stopped, I led a public meeting on gang crime. I even scheduled the procedure to remove the body on a day I didn’t have a constituency advice surgery. Heartbroken by all the years that I have struggled with fertility, I’ve kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected.
JUN18	The Wahaca row shows why workers need a new way to unite	A row recently erupted over workers’ conditions in the restaurant group Wahaca that turned out to be a little more complicated than it looked. Some diners had done a runner; another, law-abiding punter, Sarah Hayward, overheard the ensuing row and took to Twitter to complain: “Ppl next to us left without paying and their server is made to foot the bill from his wages. Apparently company policy. Utterly shameful employment practice.” After some social media to-ing and fro-ing, it turned out the server had been docked £3 on the £40 bill, then reimbursed as it did not amount to “gross negligence”. The company’s founder, Thomasina Miers, concluded: “It is a crazy world where one is hung before even being asked a question … it really saddens me that people are so quick to presume the worst.”
JUN18	From houses to wages, it's time we realised that size isn't everything	Among our nation’s many long-term property woes is that British homes are not only becoming less affordable, they’re also getting smaller. However, news from over the pond suggests shoebox living may not be a problem after all. In the US, average house sizes have been growing but satisfaction with them has remained flat. Bigger just means bigger; it doesn’t mean better. It’s just one study, but on this occasion the usual academic caveat of “more research is needed” is, well, not needed. Psychologists already know that we are compulsive comparators. Improvements to our own fortune don’t have any lasting effect unless they make us better off than those around us, not just better off than we were. Indeed, we often feel worse if we get more but see peers get even more still.
JUN18	Why I hate emojis	Should I ever be kidnapped or held against my will – I am talking about a boring wedding rather than a Liam Neeson Taken-type scenario – it will be very easy for my nearest and dearest to know something is up. I will text them those vile little gurning dots called emojis and they will know my world is falling apart. I have never knowingly used an emoji and I don’t intend to start now. Someone has to hold the line. Standards must be maintained. Recently I accidentally giffed – my phone had a sort of spasm in my bag – but I have since apologised. Gifs and memes are mostly lazy and formulaic, but occasionally marvellous. I can live with them – I am not an animal.
JUN18	I thought I would die in Brook House. Now my abusers will have to face justice	I thought this moment would never come, but I always clung on to hope. I spent nearly two years in Brook House immigration detention centre and I was abused by the officers, like so many other people there. It often felt as if no one would ever find out what was happening. But on Friday a judge ordered an inquiry that will make sure the voices of people like me are heard, and make sure our abusers will finally face justice. If you saw BBC’s Panorama documentary in 2017 on abuse in immigration detention services, you would have seen me. But what was shown on TV wasn’t even half of what went on. We were bullied every day. We were mocked all the time. There would be a casual racist taunt as you came down to breakfast – a casual punch as you went to your cell to try to sleep. And much more. Those who couldn’t speak English got it the worst. Someone I knew well tried to hang himself; the officers took their time in responding. They didn’t care whether we lived or died.
JUN18	Why the threat of an early election makes Tories double down on Boris Johnson	Will Britain’s next prime minister have one of the shortest premierships in recent history? Theresa May’s successor is yet to be selected but already talk has turned to whether an early election is imminent. With Boris Johnson the clear favourite for the job, his pledge to take the UK out of the EU by the end of October – deal or no deal – has led a number of Tory MPs to predict that a snap election will soon follow his arrival in 10 Downing Street. Johnson’s closest rival, Jeremy Hunt – who came second in the first ballot – has accused him of “effectively committing the country to no deal … or an election ?. Although the former mayor of London has said he plans to negotiate a Brexit deal, there is scepticism that a) Brussels would be willing to cede to his demands, and b) there would be time for such a renegotiation to take place before the end of the article 50 extension on 31 October.
JUN18	The EU's Islamophobia is getting worse – Britain must fight this from within	The European elections last month were widely seen as a test of the EU’s resilience. Many were relieved that far-right parties did not do as well as feared. However, nationalism is still on the rise across the continent, and the EU is not an innocent bystander. A meeting of two Islamophobes earlier this month brought this home to me. That day, Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi met with her Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orbán. At the top of their agenda was the danger of “continuously growing Muslim populations”. No surprises there. While Aung San Suu Kyi is complicit in the genocidal “ethnic cleansing” of some 1.1 million Rohingya Muslim refugees into Bangladesh, Orbán spearheaded the abhorrent fiction that the Jewish philanthropist George Soros is funding the mass migration of Muslims to Europe.
JUN18	Should dating apps tell us how sexy we are?	Marks out of 10: how attractive do you think you are? Perhaps you’d describe yourself as a six on a good hair day, or seven when you’ve caught the sun? Attractiveness, after all, is subjective, and can change from day to day. Besides, isn’t beauty in the eye of the beholder? But the truth is, if you have ever used an internet dating app, your desirability has been rated. It has to be. User rankings are integral to how most mainstream dating apps, purportedly including Tinder and Bumble, function. So would you want to know how you scored? Last week, the dating app Once emailed users (including me) to tell them that they can now discover how they have ranked. “To help our matching algorithm, we ask our users to rate each other [sic] pictures,” reads the email. “We have decided to be transparent and release this rating.” It was nearly 4pm and as a long-suffering glutton for pain, I jumped at the chance to ruin my day. I logged in – for the first time in several years – to find out how I ranked based on photos from younger, thinner times in my 20s. I thought I’d be crushed, and readers, I was right.
JUN18	It took me years to come out as bisexual. I just didn’t feel safe enough	I came out last year, just before my 34th birthday, as a bisexual woman. As a result, I regularly hear from people asking what they should do because they’re getting older and, sometimes, are more frightened to come out. I understand. I wasn’t sure what to do for a long time – I didn’t know if I was going to be accepted or understood. As a 35-year-old who had been previously engaged to a cis man and as someone who could have never imagined being publicly happy with a woman or nonbinary person – I empthasise. Coming out as bisexual – a misunderstood sexuality – added layers of insecurity and doubt. Will everyone think I’m just seeking attention? Do I just need more Instagram likes to make this go away? Just because I think Zoë Kravitz is beautiful does that really equate to being queer? Why didn’t you do this earlier?
JUN19	TV debate brought home a terrifying truth: one of these men will be PM	Perhaps the most scathing line of the night was the title. It was called Our Next Prime Minister and as the hour wore on, those four words sounded increasingly like a rebuke to the nation. Look at us, they seemed to say: a fabled country with a long, proud history and one of these five jokers is actually going to be our next prime minister. It was a painful hour, delivered via a format that featured too much cross-talk and too little cross-examination, that saw the candidates perched awkwardly on gameshow stools, repeatedly talking over each other and failing to answer the often sharp and pointed questions from members of the public.
JUN19	Johnson might be a dead cert for Tory leader but Stewart has reshaped the race	Boris Johnson’s ascent to the Tory leadership now looks unstoppable, judged by nervous fellow MPs to be the candidate best placed to vanquish the Brexit party by adopting their central demand for a no-deal Brexit. The apparent inevitability of his ascent has led careerist critics like Matt Hancock to ditch their principles and climb aboard, driven by the animating force of self-interest. Johnson emerged strengthened by the latest ballot and will be tested against other candidates for the first time in tonight’s leadership debate. Dominic Raab was eliminated having offered much the same Brexit position as Johnson but without his political agility. The other story is the momentum building behind Rory Stewart – despite passing the threshold required to proceed in the contest by only four votes. A reputed former MI6 officer who went to the same school (Eton) and same Oxford college (Balliol) as Johnson, Stewart is a very Tory insurgent. Against all expectations, he remains in the race and is now four votes ahead of Sajid Javid and just four votes behind Michael Gove. Yet even if he were to make it to the final two who will go forward for a ballot of all members, polling suggests that Johnson remains the overwhelming favourite.
JUN19	Hong Kong’s struggle is ours too. It’s a wake-up call to defend all basic human rights	Why do the Hong Kong activists matter to us? Because their cause is universal. Aerial images of vast crowds flooding the streets of the skyscraper-studded island are of course riveting. Equally fascinating is that, with China fast emerging as a global behemoth and surveillance state, this crisis serves as a barometer of what we might next expect of it and its president-cum-new-emperor, Xi Jinping. There’s also an astounding element of David versus Goliath in Hong Kong, something that awakens a deep instinct in us, a yearning to see bravery and determination in the face of great odds: young people defying a giant and leveraging surprising tactics in their struggle.
JUN19	The Tories want to back a winner. But they don’t know how to win	Two primal impulses are driving the Tory leadership contest: the desperate hunt for an election winner, and morbid fear of an election. Any tension between them is meant to be resolved by a Brexit miracle: the new prime minister releases Britain from European bondage on 31 October, and a thankful nation flings itself into outstretched Conservative arms. It is always a mistake to expect gratitude from electorates. Voters see political pledges as a contract, not a favour, and they quickly move on to new demands. Labour’s victory in 1945 is the benchmark. If Winston Churchill couldn’t bank a VE day dividend at the ballot box, there isn’t much prospect of Boris Johnson getting one for some rickety Brexit bodge job.
JUN19	The Iran crisis was created in Washington. The US must be talked down	In Washington, at times of stress, international crises play out in black and white. As in a flickering newsreel from a former age, complex events are reduced to symbolic emblems of right and wrong. Grainy video images of “evil-doers”, George W Bush’s favoured term, purport to show faceless Iranians acting suspiciously around a burning oil tanker in the Gulf last week. As new Middle East troop deployments are announced, US battleships are pictured bravely patrolling freedom’s frontline. Monochromatic simplifications of this type suit multiple purposes. In the present US-Iran crisis, they supposedly provide official “proof” of nefarious intent. They can be seen to justify escalatory US actions that might previously have appeared unreasonable and provocative. They place pressure on reluctant allies to fall in behind the advancing American columns. Most of all, since democratic consent apparently still counts for something, they are intended to rally public support.
JUN19	Cute? These eyebrow-raising dogs are master manipulators of the human heart	In a bit of news that, unusually for these times, doesn’t make one want to hunker down underground never to resurface, a study has been released about the adorableness of dogs. Everyone loves an animal study. One of my recent favourites was reported with the headline: “Cats are nice and enjoy spending time with humans,” which I presume was commissioned and carried out by cats. This week, thanks to a UK-US team of scientists, we learn that the archetypal puppy-dog-eyes expression that makes us so susceptible to doggies’ charms and desires is down to the evolution of a forehead muscle. This is found in domestic dogs we keep as pets but not their ancestors, wolves. 
JUN19	Tory leadership race: what’s the view from Europe?	Viewed from Europe, the race for the Tory leadership has taken on a surreal quality as Boris Johnson takes an apparently unassailable lead in the multi-round contest. As a plethora of hostile editorials and articles in the European press attest, the sight of a politician widely derided as a “mini Trump” becoming the new British prime minister has only confirmed the impression that the UK has been consumed by a populist revolution symbolised by the vote for Brexit. At one level this “noise” is more than superficial, since it points to a fundamental problem with the Johnson candidacy for Europe, which is the baggage he brings as a high-profile character who made a career out of lampooning the ideals, initiatives and institutions of the European Union. There is no doubt that Johnson’s record as both newspaper columnist and foreign minister will make it harder for Europe to justify making concessions to him that leaders were not prepared to make for Theresa May. Come the October European Council, there will be voices arguing that any concession to Johnson is a concession to “populism”, and should be avoided.
JUN19	Heathrow’s expansion plans make a mockery of the zero emissions strategy	The bosses at Heathrow must have been visiting another planet last week, or else they missed the government memo about legislating for net zero emissions by 2050. The plans unveiled today for a 50% expansion in the airport by 2050, including a third runway, all to be done in “a sustainable way”, take dissembling to new levels. Heathrow is already the largest single source of carbon emissions in the UK.
JUN19	The answer to the UK’s homelessness crisis is painfully simple: give people homes	I was just 15 years old when the 2007-08 financial crash hit – but I remember it like it was yesterday. I can replay in my mind the bankers leaving Lehman Brothers for the last time. I can see the lines of people waiting to withdraw their savings from Northern Rock. But the image that has stuck with me more than any other is the encampments of people in America – living out of cars, in tents and under bridges – having been evicted from their homes after the subprime mortgage crisis. I knew things were bad in the UK – I knew they might even get worse. But I vividly remember thinking: at least we are not the US.
JUN19	In Sudan and Hong Kong, protest is changing – and hope is rising	The massive demonstrations of recent weeks in Hong Kong and Sudan may seem to be totally disparate events. But they have more in common than meets the eye. The attempts by the authorities to disperse them with threats of violence or with peaceful promises is part of a wider global crackdown on people taking to the streets. But the creativity of protesters in finding ever new ways of making their voices heard, both online and in the streets, is the real trend to note. When governments are seen as flawed or repressive, people search for avenues other than just the ballot box. These are the politics of voice and not just of vote, as the Indian political scientist Neera Chandhoke has called it.
JUN20	From Thatcher to Brexit: this Tory folly was 40 years in the making	“I’d like to have led the Conservative party. I’d like to have been prime minister,” confessed a disappointed Conservative politician on Monday. It is proving to be that kind of week for the Tory combatants. Today it was Rory Stewart’s turn to come to terms with the dying of his national leadership dream, as Boris Johnson consolidated his grip on the Tory election in advance of today’s next rounds. But these words of regret did not come from Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock or any of the earlier fallers in this contest. Instead they were spoken this week by Michael Heseltine, in the final part of the BBC’s excellent five-part documentary, Thatcher: a Very British Revolution. It is what Heseltine said next that speaks most directly of all to the perhaps unsolvable problems facing today’s Tory party. If he had become prime minister, Heseltine said: “It would have been a different country.” He is right about that. But he didn’t. So it isn’t. And that is the Tory party’s problem.
JUN20	Rory Stewart's exit means the Tories have now given up on reality	For a tiny moment this week it seemed as though the Conservatives had allowed a glimmer of reality into the party’s bunker. Rory Stewart, a candidate universally derided when he launched his Tory leadership bid, had begun to impress his parliamentary colleagues, and on Tuesday night they had chosen him over the far more Brexit-friendly candidate Dominic Raab. The intrusion did not last long. Stewart finished last in the third round of voting on Wednesday evening and was duly eliminated. His momentum had derailed so spectacularly that he actually lost 10 votes, even though there was one less candidate in the ring.
JUN20	Society is obsessed with women’s genitals. So why are ads for sex toys still taboo?	Given society’s obsession with women’s sexual organs – how they should look, how they should smell – it is ironic that they are so intentionally concealed. The latest attempt to obscure any mention of women’s nether regions comes from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the company that runs the New York subway, which has rejected adverts by women’s sexual health startup Dame Products showing sex toys. Dame is now suing the MTA over its decision. Although the MTA maintains that the promotion of “sexually oriented business” has long been prohibited, the definition appears to be slippery (much to its disgust, no doubt). Several sexually suggestive, tongue-in-cheek-and-God-knows-where-else ads have been allowed, including ones for condoms and erectile dysfunction medication.
JUN20	My baby’s still learning to crawl. Must he really be taught ‘British values’?	As a recent migrant to this country, I got a shock when my husband and I looked for a childminder for our baby. The ones we met told us that alongside development goals such as eating solids and saying “Mama” and “Dada”, our child would be learning “British values”. One had an official Ofsted-approved British values “wheel” displayed on her wall, next to educational posters designed to teach shapes and colours. The wheel had a picture of a doe-eyed child in the centre, with green arrows radiating from the child to the values, written on a yellow disc. I asked her about this baffling graphic and she rolled her eyes. “Oh yes,” she said ruefully. “The British values. Got to have them.”
JUN20	Female academics are too scarce. So we’re banning job applications from men	Engineering has a huge impact on society. To responsibly advance science and technology, a university should be a balanced reflection of society. As a top engineering university we believe that diversity and inclusiveness is crucial for the quality of our teaching and research. More than that, we believe we can turn a fully representative academic workforce into a unique strength. This is why, from 1 July, all our job vacancies will be exclusively open to female candidates for the first six months after they are advertised. This is certainly a radical step, as the international headlines about our move attest. But we felt it was a necessary step as the more subtle measures we tried over the past 10 years were to no avail. The targets we set for female recruitment and the missionary work of our chief diversity officers were certainly useful in making our staff and community aware of inequalities and their own biases. As a result, at least two women are now on every selection panel. And yet, the gender imbalance persists with only 16% of our full professors being female – one of the lowest percentages in the Netherlands, and indeed in Europe. 
JUN20	I asked the five candidates about climate in the TV debate. None has a clear plan	Last night I asked the five candidates vying to be our next prime minister whether they would commit to taking the radical and drastic action necessary to tackle climate change. You may have realised from my reaction to the answers they gave that I was not impressed. As I listened to them fail to answer my question, I kept thinking, “one of these men is going to be our prime minister, the leader of this country in just a few weeks”. And I reflected on what I have been taught about leadership.
JUN20	Alarming and unnecessary: Facebook’s new cryptocurrency must be resisted	Have you heard about Facebook’s new “cryptocurrency”, called Libra? Its basic pitch boils down to “we messed up your privacy and gave your data to all sorts, and let foreign actors screw up your elections – now let’s see what we can do with banking!” That’s the quick way to view its announcement of Libra, which will be operated by Calibra, a new Facebook subsidiary. David Marcus, the brain behind it at Facebook, used the company’s typically humble phrasing to explain it thus: “The mission for Libra is a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.”
JUN20	A US war with Iran looms. Don’t for one second think that it is justified	We know how the story goes. The decision for war is made long in advance. That becomes the end point, and the evidence must be marshalled to achieve that goal. A long-lasting regime suddenly becomes an imminent threat. Exiles with minimal connections to their country of origin, but with fat bank balances, extensive links with rightwing thinktanks, multinational companies and western security services are wheeled out to solemnly declare that war must be waged on their homeland. A litany of never-ending human rights abuses is endlessly detailed: the sort ignored by our elites if they are committed by our allies, like the Saudi dictatorship, which has plunged Yemen into the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Critics of war are demonised as stooges or useful idiots of an enemy that imperils national security and menaces its own people, and as haters of their own country. While our Tory overlords committing to another military escapade is predictable, Trump’s 'coalition' will extend further
JUN20	I had special needs help in school. But the doors that were opened for me are closing	Anyone watch the Tory leadership debate on Tuesday night? Miserable spectacle though it might have been, something of wider interest did slip through the cracks. Amid the verbal jostling to determine who the biggest, bounciest Brexit boy in the room was, the five leadership candidates were forced to account for cuts to services for vulnerable children, including special educational needs and disability (Send) provision. This is not a new issue. Last month, parents, teachers and pupils held protests across the country, decrying what they termed a “national crisis” in provision for pupils. And as someone who personally benefited from Send provision as a child, it is a matter of great concern to me.
JUN20	Trying to unite the country over Brexit won’t win Labour a general election	Ahead of today’s meeting of Labour’s shadow cabinet, here is a thought experiment. In the latest YouGov poll, the party has lost half its vote at the last general election. Suppose three-quarters of those lost voters had switched to the Brexit parties or the Conservatives, while one-quarter had switched to strongly remain parties – the Liberal Democrats, Greens or SNP. Pro-leave MPs in Labour’s heartlands would say “told you”. The case for Labour pivoting to a strongly pro-leave stance would be overwhelming. The laudable aim of healing divisions cannot succeed while the issue of Brexit remains unresolved
JUN21	Hunt and Johnson are wildly different, but it’s the latter who can deliver Brexit	Now there are two. The choice of Britain’s next prime minister devolves to the Tory faithful – to many Britons a disconcerting prospect. The Tory leadership election has been an eccentric display of parliamentary oligarchy. It is the British way. Boris Johnson is now clear favourite to win. His rival Jeremy Hunt has emerged hesitantly from an uninspiring field, in which only the outsider Rory Stewart showed flashes of originality. He lives to fight another day. The third runner, Michael Gove, clearly paid the price for his past feud with Johnson, though he was the more able of the two challengers.
JUN21	Summer with the kids … long and costly for parents, but also a joy	The state schools in New York break up for summer next week, giving kids almost 10 weeks of holiday. (The private schools have already been out for a week.) Like daylight saving, this appears to be a historical anomaly pegged to the days when everyone worked on a farm, and children were required to work in the fields for two months. In Manhattan most kids will go straight into summer camp, the cheapest of which – not counting subsidised social programmes that are heavily oversubscribed – are about $500 (£395) per child per week and lets them out at a very uncordial 3pm. The annual grouse about the cost of the city reaches fever pitch at this time of year. Research shows, somewhat surprisingly, that during the long break parents actually spend more time with their kids
JUN21	Carmageddon: it’s killing urban life. We must reclaim our cities before it’s too late	What is the best way of wrecking a city? Pour cars into it. Heavy traffic, 50 years of research shows, breaks up communities, disrupts social life and crushes local cultures. Noise drowns out conversation and drives people indoors. Pollution makes streets inhospitable. Cars take up the space that might have been used for children to play, adults to meet, and local projects to grow. The fashion for SUVs is one of the two main reasons for rising road deaths among pedestrians
JUN21	This solstice, try Stonehenge as therapy	When was the last time you stepped outside and looked up? It’s hard to find the time to do it, and even when we do, high-rise cityscapes, light pollution and – the bane of all astronomy – “cloud” often limit the view of what lies beyond. But perhaps it is something we are fundamentally drawn to do. Throughout time, people across the world have looked up and wondered what was out there. Cultures around the globe have built structures to augment their views of the cosmos, and one of the most important sites for contemplating the heavens is undoubtedly Stonehenge. I recently visited this prehistoric monument and as I stood within the ancient stone circle, I felt, perhaps unsurprisingly, a strong connection to the past. Yet at the same time I felt strongly rooted in the present, and yet again, even under cloudy skies, I had a feeling of being part of the expansive universe that lay beyond. It was easy to imagine that our Neolithic ancestors would have gazed at the same skies. It made me think about our connection with the natural world – or our increasing disconnection from it – and the importance of conservation and protection, not just of this monument and others like it but of the world that has been rapidly changing around it since those enormous stones were raised 4,500 years ago.
JUN21	So British people aren’t socialising much? That doesn’t mean they’re lonely	Humans are social animals and the ways we connect – not only intellectually, but emotionally and sensorially – is crucial to physical and emotional “health”. Rituals such as eating together are fundamental in forming social relationships and emotional bonds. And this social connectedness is key to understanding loneliness. Sainsbury’s Living Well index has identified a reduction in eating with others as a significant index of a decline in wellbeing, especially among baby boomers. It suggests this is linked to the breakdown of relationships in later life; middle-aged people score highly in loneliness measures as a rule, too, particularly when they have experienced divorce and social isolation.
JUN21	Playing a video game gave me a kind of catharsis I didn’t know I needed	Whether they be written in the annals, painted on canvas, or coded into virtual space, fantasy worlds are captivating. It’s as if these stories wield a macrocosmic mirror, consistently challenging us with distorted versions of our own world. Although this distortion is initially confronting, it soon makes it easier to gravitate towards what’s at the core of these realms, and what that means in relation to our own. I first played The Witcher 3 about a year after it came out. I was invested in the series when it launched, having already played the other games and read some of the books, but I couldn’t put much time into the game — I was kept busy between studying English at university and working full-time hours at my supposedly part-time job. So, a little over a year late to the party, I put on my Witcher medallion and saddled up my trusty equestrian companion, Roach, before setting off on an epic quest across the harsh landscapes of Velen, the shady streets of Novigrad, and the tempestuous wilds of Skellige.
JUN21	Boris Johnson could be prime minister in a month. Is Labour ready to take him on?	The nation watches this strange array of men deranged enough to aspire to run a country in an insoluble crisis of their own making. As a despairing and departing chancellor spells out today at Mansion House, they all lie through their teeth: there will be no new EU deal, they will be stopped from leaving with no deal, they will not keep their wild tax-cutting promises – and they know it. Yesterday they ejected the only one who tiptoed closer to these truths, but Rory Stewart also swore blind he would Brexit, come what may.
JUN21	What does Biden have in common with Trump? Delusional nostalgia	Joe Biden is building a campaign of reminiscences. The former vice-president and current Democratic presidential frontrunner is pitching voters the idea that the past was better than the present, and that Biden, at 76, represents the past. “I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he represents as an aberrant moment in time, ? he said in his campaign announcement video. “With Trump gone, you’re going to see things change, ? he said last week, referring to the Republican party. “Because these folks know better. ?
JUN21	Labour should support leaving the EU – then it can be truly radical in government	The resignation of Theresa May, the rise of Nigel Farage’s Brexit party and the Tory leadership election have cast a sharp light on the choices confronting the Labour party. It appears that, notwithstanding frequent assertions to the contrary, the balance between leavers and remainers has not shifted much since the referendum. As soon as political leadership became available, leave’s mass support across England and Wales was reaffirmed, including in the working-class heartlands of Labour. Farage spoke to popular frustration with the parliamentary shenanigans over May’s deal and the associated failure of democracy since 2016. It is deeply unfortunate that a rightwing populist has again been able to make inroads into the natural constituency of the left. His success makes it vital for the Labour party to offer fresh leadership, while maintaining its working-class roots. For that, Labour must not side with remain.
JUN21	Heathrow’s third runway plan beggars belief. So don’t expect Boris Johnson to block it	I will lie down in front of those bulldozers and stop the construction of that third runway … Heathrow is just undeliverable, and the sooner we face that the sooner our salvation.” This was then London mayor Boris Johnson’s most famous pledge, made in 2015. Expanding an airport on the outskirts of a major city, he told delighted listeners, was “the kind of thing that could have happened in China in the 1950s”. It would be impossible in London, he said, because of the legal challenges, environmental costs and the offence to human rights. “It is just not going to happen.” As recently as last June, Johnson went awol as foreign secretary to avoid voting for Heathrow.
JUN22	Mark Field’s rage acts as a litmus test for our divided times	They came wearing red evening dresses and sashes, like something from a bygone age of suffragette protests. Or perhaps that should be suffragists, the more peaceful wing of the movement. For the climate crisis campaigners who set out to disrupt the chancellor’s annual Mansion House speech to the City had done all they could to look unthreatening, knowing that politicians are understandably jumpy about personal security nowadays. The protest was female-led, Greenpeace explained, in the hope of keeping it calm. Some hope. The police are investigating precisely what happened when protester Janet Barker walked behind the Conservative MP Mark Field, apparently heading towards the top table holding the great and good. But film of Field leaping up and grappling with her, before frog-marching her out with a hand around her neck, has gone viral for good reason. Whatever the police investigation concludes, it is hard to think of a more toxic image of Conservatism than an angry-looking man in black tie manhandling a woman away from a fancy banquet. Brute male force versus plucky female resistance; cosy privileged club versus outsider somewhere she wasn’t invited. No wonder we can’t stop watching and re-watching it.
JUN22	To defeat Boris Johnson, learn the lessons of Donald Trump	All we need now is for Boris Johnson to praise Mark Field, the government-minister-cum-self-appointed-close-protection-officer who thought the best way to deal with a peaceful distributor of leaflets was to ram her into a pillar and grab her by the neck. If Johnson lauds Field as “my kind of guy”, then the already long list of similarities between Britain’s near-certain next prime minister and Donald Trump will get longer still. Compiling that list might once have been an amusing parlour game for politics nerds; now it is essential preparation for what is to come. For Trump, you will recall, did not share the public shock at one of his party’s lawmakers using physical violence against a citizen exercising a basic democratic right. In the US case, the offender was Republican congressman Greg Gianforte, who bodyslammed a reporter – a Guardian reporter, as it happens – whose desire to ask a question irritated him. Trump offered no condemnation. Instead, the president said: “Any guy that can do a bodyslam, he’s my kind of guy.”
JUN22	The self-abasement of Johnson’s shameless gofers will not be forgotten	Who is the worst minor character in the Borisverse? We have to ask, what with the big man himself only allowed out on an electronic tag for around six minutes’ talking time on the BBC Tory leadership debate. Collectors of vignettes displaying Johnson’s contempt for the public will have enjoyed the spectacle of a takeaway being delivered to his house while the other candidates debated on Channel 4. Encouraging to see him building on his friend David Cameron’s legacy: trotters up even before you’ve screwed the country, instead of only after. The only other sightings of Johnson saw him accompanied by various childminders to vote for himself in a series of progressively apocalypse-beckoning votes in Westminster this week. Eventually, of course, Johnson himself will come for us all. He’s really the Tories’ Papa Lazarou, with his grotesque circus, his free-form gibberish, his expanding collection of wedding rings. And the rest. AND THE REST.
JUN22	With its links to BP, I can’t stay in the Royal Shakespeare Company	As a teenager, disenchanted with religion, I turned to Shakespeare for ethical guidance. I was inspired by the work of the Royal Shakespeare Company. It represented the ultimate company of conscious artists, speaking and playing Shakespeare with humour and insight. In my 20s I was fortunate to join the company, play Hamlet and Romeo, and become an associate artist. I have been delighted ever since to be connected with thousands of artists and audiences who have made the RSC what it is. And yet today I feel I must dissociate myself from the RSC, not because it is any less of a theatre company, but because of the company it keeps.
JUN22	Johnson’s campaign will probably succeed – but he’ll alienate people he needs	When the names of the final two Tory leadership candidates were announced, there were celebrations among Boris Johnson’s backers. Joining the Tory leadership frontrunner in the final was not his old foe Michael Gove but Jeremy Hunt. The foreign secretary beat Gove to second place by a mere two votes. Hunt was the candidate the Johnson campaign wanted to join him in the final. The view is that he poses the least threat as he voted remain and isn’t as skilled a debater as Gove. However, not everyone was so impressed with the result. Tory MPs quickly began to cry foul play and suggest dirty tricks. The reason? The numbers don’t add up. After Sajid Javid was knocked out in the first secret ballot of the day, at least four of his backers said they would now vote for Boris Johnson. Yet despite this, Johnson only managed to muster three more votes in total in the final ballot that afternoon. The suggestion is that Johnson supporters “lent” their votes to Hunt in order to secure a weaker opponent.
JUN22	Love Island is a lesson in how language, like, evolves	Love Island is not for everyone. You might not appreciate the dating show’s rowdiness; its relentlessness (nearly 50 episodes this season!); its raunch. But even if you’re able to tolerate all that, you might draw a line at the language. I’m not talking about swearing, because there’s something even worse, apparently: Love Islanders’ liberality with their discourse particles. This is not an innuendo. You can’t catch discourse particles. No, they are little words we use to signpost and structure our speech. Sometimes they are just used to maintain fluency, or to generate rapport. In short, they oil the wheels of communication. One of the big players is “like”. According to the Sunday Times this week, it was used 76 times in under five minutes during one episode of the ITV reality show. The paper provided an example from Islander Amy: “Molly was like ‘oh he’s my type’ and I’m like ‘no sorry you’ve already got two’. It’s like three out of seven boys.” (Not all of these likes are discourse particles, but more of that later.)
JUN22	Politicians must find solutions for the climate crisis. Not outsource it to us	“Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard,” said the American journalist HL Mencken, who died 60 years before the EU referendum but nonetheless seems to have known how things might play out. The British people have spoken and said … what, exactly? Last week’s BritainThinks survey of today’s attitudes found rampant pessimism, anxiety and gloom. “I cannot recall a time when the national mood was more despairing,” said the research firm’s boss Deborah Mattinson. Now we learn that the government is going to give this participatory democracy idea another go, launching a citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency later in the year.
JUN22	Like it or not, ‘Generation Snowflake’ has got a raw deal	The idea of generational conflict has come to prominence in the last few years, but few seem to agree on its shape and causes. Public discussion of young people, for instance, is so contradictory that they can appear to the casual viewer like a kind of Schrödinger generation; simultaneously both Generation Snowflake, the most over-entitled and coddled generation in history, and Generation Screwed, the most disadvantaged age cohort in modern times. Advocates for the latter can point to trends such as the collapse in home ownership among the under-35s. Proponents of the former argue that young people can’t afford a house because they are irresponsible and frivolous, spending their money on avocado toast rather than saving for a deposit. The current generational divergence is a consequence of the power the financial sector has held for the past 35 years
JUN22	On trans issues, Iceland has just put Britain to shame	Scotland joined England and Wales on Thursday in delaying a decision about proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act, against a backdrop of a bitter culture war. Meanwhile, Iceland has just passed one of the most progressive laws on trans and intersex rights without any public conflict. The law has the potential to make Iceland the world leader on LGBTI rights, with the condition that interventions on intersex infants will eventually be banned. As an Icelander I’m honoured to have been one of the people drafting the bill and to finally see a big part of it become a reality, four years after we started the process. The work was led by grassroots LGBTI activists in Iceland, and has been both the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life.
JUN22	Summer with the kids … long and costly for parents, but also a joy	The state schools in New York break up for summer next week, giving kids almost 10 weeks of holiday. (The private schools have already been out for a week.) Like daylight saving, this appears to be a historical anomaly pegged to the days when everyone worked on a farm, and children were required to work in the fields for two months. In Manhattan most kids will go straight into summer camp, the cheapest of which – not counting subsidised social programmes that are heavily oversubscribed – are about $500 (£395) per child per week and lets them out at a very uncordial 3pm. The annual grouse about the cost of the city reaches fever pitch at this time of year. Research shows, somewhat surprisingly, that during the long break parents actually spend more time with their kids
JUN23	Boris Johnson's character should be an issue for the whole nation	“What a non-story.  ?Couple have row’.” So tweeted security minister Ben Wallace, Boris Johnson’s 2016 campaign manager. But it appears he thought better of it and deleted that tweet when even every ardent Johnson-backing paper splashed the story of the midnight row between Johnson and his girlfriend. The Mail blazons Carrie Symonds’ cries in red, “Get off me … get out of my flat.” Should the police have been called? Go out with them of an evening, as I did the other day, and they assiduously attend all reports of rows when neighbours hear shouts, screams, crashing crockery and and other indications that a situation may seem to have turned toxic.
JUN23	Sapped by Brexit, it’s little wonder we dream of doing a Nick Clegg	You may not know it but you are about to become Nick Clegg. I don’t want to become Nick Clegg, I hear you protest. The idea is not only repellent but ridiculous. Facebook won’t offer me £1m-plus a year and a Silicon Valley mansion if I sell out. I agree that it won’t. But opting out is far more common than selling out and Clegg is the market leader in both. I called him in October 2018 to check a point in a piece I was writing. I should have paid more attention to the note of alarm when he realised that a journalist was on the phone. He told me he was in Sheffield. Ah, I said, you are preparing to fight Sheffield Hallam again. He lost the seat to a mentally troubled Labour candidate, who poured out levels of abuse against women, gay people and his own constituents that were too much even for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. Clegg could have retaken the constituency with ease and gone back to Westminster to champion the Remain cause. He almost laughed at my quaint suggestion. No, he wasn’t thinking of returning to politics. Two days later, I learned why when news broke of his new career. Technology specialists can describe the awfulness of a Liberal Democrat accepting the position of vice-president at a rapacious wannabe monopoly that has facilitated the corruption of liberal democracy by Putin and the super-rich and allowed the mass murder of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims to be incited on its site.
JUN23	Ethics fly out of the window at Oxford University when big donors come calling	What do we know about Stephen Schwarzman, the US financier whose name, following his £150m donation to the University of Oxford, is destined to become synonymous – as the Schwarzman Centre – with the humanities, the study of ethics in particular? Much of Oxford’s press release introducing him to British audiences dwells on the philanthropy evidenced in already-colonised academic zones: the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing; the Schwarzman Scholars programme at Schwarzman College (in China); the Stephen A Schwarzman Building (formerly known as New York Public Library); Yale’s Stephen A Schwarzman Center, Yale protesters having had less success, to date, than angry parents at Schwarzman’s old school, Abington. For a donation of $25m, he had wanted it renamed after himself, with separate spaces going to his twin brothers, Mark and Warren.
JUN23	Richard Ratcliffe’s wife was wrongly jailed and no one will help. What else can he do?	What a frightful pest Richard Ratcliffe is being – so thoughtless, cluttering up the lovely posh pavement outside the Iranian embassy in Knightsbridge, with his protest against his wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s wrongful imprisonment in Iran, where she is serving a five-year sentence for espionage. Another view might be: what else is Ratcliffe supposed to do, when the right to protest is all he has left? Ratcliffe has joined his wife on a hunger strike, demanding, among other things, her immediate release. He’s just spent the week stationed outside the embassy and plans to stay until at least this weekend, perhaps longer. Ratcliffe has been visited by family members and supporters, including SNP MPs and Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson. One important person Ratcliffe didn’t manage to see, even on Father’s Day, was his young daughter, Gabrielle, who lives in Tehran with her grandparents in order to be able to visit her mum in prison. Lovely.
JUN23	Mark Field’s rage acts as a litmus test for our divided times	They came wearing red evening dresses and sashes, like something from a bygone age of suffragette protests. Or perhaps that should be suffragists, the more peaceful wing of the movement. For the climate crisis campaigners who set out to disrupt the chancellor’s annual Mansion House speech to the City had done all they could to look unthreatening, knowing that politicians are understandably jumpy about personal security nowadays.

Brute male force versus plucky female resistance; cosy privileged club versus outsider somewhere she wasn’t invited. No wonder we can’t stop watching and re-watching it.
JUN23	Don’t stereotype young remainers. We fear for our futures, not our holidays	The current political crisis over Brexit has been a wake-up call for my generation: the doctrine that our parents and grandparents will leave behind a better world no longer holds. But, of course, not every young person feels this way. A significant minority – especially those in towns outside London and the south-east – do not necessarily share the enthusiasm of the 78% of young people who would back remain in a people’s vote on Brexit. And those that do will often have different reasons for their convictions too. We don’t want to leave them behind. This summer the campaign I’m part of, Our Future Our Choice, will join a tour of the whole country, calling on politicians to let us be heard. We will be gathering in Wolverhampton, Sunderland, Leeds, Glasgow, Derby, Belfast and many more towns and cities over the summer, leading up to one more huge rally in London on 12 October.
JUN23	The Mark Field video is chillingly familiar to anyone who recognises male violence	The gut knows. The gut processes what the eye sees. A woman slammed up against a wall. A man, eyes bulging with rage, his hands on her. He pushes her out of the posh dinner, his hands gripping her neck. She is shocked. The gut twists at the familiarity. Male violence so everyday that many will have experienced it, many will have felt sick watching it – and somehow still ashamed to admit that this had happened to them too. Elsewhere, long ago, somewhere more private. No one saw. The woman looked stunned. What could have been hidden in her red dress? Submachine guns, harpoons, ground-to-air missiles?
JUN23	Raise the Windrush anchor – and make it a statue to modern Britain	Almost a decade ago I started the campaign for a national Windrush Day, alongside a range of individuals and race equality organisations. It was conceived as a day to recognise and celebrate the achievements of the postwar migrants who first arrived aboard the Empire Windrush – a generation that made a significant contribution to the society we take for granted today. After years of lobbying, petitions, events, letter-writing, debates in parliament – and last year’s Windrush scandal, which put the government on the wrong side of history – Theresa May agreed to this annual commemoration. We should commit to realising this dream in four years, given that June 2023 will be Windrush's 75th anniversary
JUN23	The self-abasement of Johnson’s shameless gofers will not be forgotten	Who is the worst minor character in the Borisverse?

And yet today I feel I must dissociate myself from the RSC, not because it is any less of a theatre company, but because of the company it keeps.
JUN24	Boris Johnson’s pitch is all about his character. That’s why the row in his flat matters	Let’s begin with the straightforward part: any incident in which a woman is heard screaming in her home, and shouting “Get off me!” at a man, instantly becomes a matter not only of public interest but public responsibility. The precise motives of the neighbours who called the police on Thursday night to report the row between Boris Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds – and also alerted the Guardian – should be a matter of near total indifference. So what if they were “remoaners”, or Tory haters, or vacationing ministers in the Venezuelan government? Would it really have been better if they had let it be? Allowed whatever was happening to run its course, on the old, deplorable basis that it is intrinsically wrong to intervene in a “lovers’ tiff”?
JUN24	I was the victim of race hate crime – but by speaking up I felt empowered	One afternoon last month I boarded a train in Liverpool en route to Newcastle to take part in some writing events. I was sitting in a pre-booked seat. Nearby a man was blaring out loud music. A train conductor walked by and told the man to switch his music off, but shortly afterwards he turned his music up again. I then asked if he could turn the volume down as it was giving me a migraine. The man responded with a torrent of racist abuse: “Do you have a British passport? Get back on the banana boat. Paki cunt! Fuck off!” He continued to racially abuse me throughout the journey, berating “strange people” who “come over here on banana boats”. There was a whole carriage of witnesses.
JUN24	Free speech isn’t under threat. It just suits bigots and boors to suggest so	You can’t say anything these days. Free speech is a thing of the past. Young people today can’t cope with reality and if you try to tell them about it you’ll get arrested. You may think we live in a free society, but if you cross the PC brigade, they’ll haul you in for questioning and then they’ll disappear you. This sort of argument is everywhere. It often seems like the first line of defence when a notable figure has overstepped the mark. And just this month the academic Jordan Peterson launched a website, Thinkspot, to protect users from all the “censorship” that is around right now.
JUN24	The left is fighting back, even in Republican states, as it attempts to reshape capitalism	Behold the new political yobs. The British and American right, once keen to engage intellectually with the left and firmly anchored in business and the middle class, have now become yobs in their evidence-free, argument-free attitude to trade and foreigners. They are guided by noxious prejudice and the simple rule that their flag and interest must rule whatever. Yobs too in their attitudes to all the decent impulses in society: tolerance; the rule of law (that’s for suckers); a welcome to immigrants, fair play; respect for truth, personal integrity. The triumph of the new nativism is the triumph of the yob. Our societies, let alone our politics, have never been so threatened.
JUN24	A growing lack of trust in authority poses a serious danger to our health	Virtually every Bangladeshi and Rwandan believes that vaccines are safe. Fewer than half of Japanese or French do so. In western Europe, almost one in six of those with college education reject vaccines. In southern Africa, you’re twice as likely to do so if you attended university. These are among the often disturbing facts that tumble out of a new study, the Wellcome Global Monitor, published last week. A survey of 140,000 people from 140 countries, it is at heart an exploration of the relationship between science, trust and attitudes to vaccination.
JUN24	There are better answers than jail for women who have offended	Chris Tchaikovsky – queen of charisma, 6ft tall, witty, clever, the only one of six middle-class sisters to serve time in prison – was, for a period, head of the Happy Firm, a team dealing in stolen travellers’ cheques. Then she went straight, co-founding the charity Women in Prison. She died, aged 57, in 2002, but on Wednesday, her spirit will be at Westminster as women come to lobby their MPs to invest in a different kind of justice – one that works. A year ago this week, the government published its female offender strategy. It contained much of what Tchaikovsky campaigned for over decades. The strategy says that if justice is to be delivered and reoffending reduced, prison for women, the majority of whom (85%) commit non-violent offences, should be replaced. In its stead should come sentences in the community and intensive support to address the issues common to chaotic lives – addiction, trauma, debt, homelessness. By and large, it’s not posh people who do porridge.
JUN24	How a story about Northern Ireland's sectarian murals created a storm	Among the questions regularly asked of journalists are these: Where do you get your stories from? How do stories happen? How do you know a story is a story? And, inevitably, do you make stories up? Given that there is no single, straightforward answer to any of them, especially that contentious last one, I came across an interesting case last week that helps to cast some light on the process – perhaps I should say, mystery – of story-getting.
JUN24	Mark Rylance is brave to quit the RSC. That doesn’t mean he is right	Gentle Mark Rylance, that mercurial British actor, has done his bit to haul the ecological record of BP back into the limelight. He stepped away from his formal association with the Royal Shakespeare Company this weekend because of its continued receipt of sponsorship from the global oil business. “I do not wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer, tobacco salesman or anyone who wilfully destroys lives of others alive and unborn. Nor, I believe, would Shakespeare,” he said.
JUN24	Sapped by Brexit, it’s little wonder we dream of doing a Nick Clegg	You may not know it but you are about to become Nick Clegg. I don’t want to become Nick Clegg, I hear you protest.

JUN25	Poor Jeremy Hunt. The perfect Tory for a party that no longer exists	Boris Johnson had many motives to dodge a televised debate with Jeremy Hunt on Tuesday night but one factor trumped the rest: he didn’t do it because he didn’t have to. If Conservative party rules and our bizarre constitution can combine to let a man like Johnson sidle up to Downing Street, answering as few questions as possible, it makes sense for him to try. It is also natural that others should try to flush the frontrunner into the open. Hunt accused his rival of cowardice and the jibe clearly stung, as the truth often does. Johnson took to the airwaves, blustering ineffective rebuttals to the charge that he had anything to hide.
JUN25	Trump's toadyism to Saudi Arabia: a new moral low	It’s that time of a presidency when every incumbent pretends to be what he isn’t, or to do what he hasn’t. With a re-election year kicking off, everyone wants to know if the candidate can fill in the gaping holes in his record, to give voters some reason to hope or believe. In the case of Donald Trump, that means trying to look like something he hasn’t been for the last two and a half years: presidential, sane and worthy of the world’s respect. Just for once.
JUN25	Have sperm will travel. But what would an all-female planet look like?	If you’re a woman who has despaired over the past week, as you’ve observed the questionable conduct of jowly white men in positions of power and subsequently seen it defended by both men and women – take heart. The good news is that when our species eventually abandons this burned-out, used-up planet for a brave new world elsewhere in the universe, we can leave the men behind too. According to new research by scientists in Barcelona, frozen sperm can survive zero gravity conditions without deterioration, meaning that it will be far more economical to transport only women and sperm banks to populate our new intergalactic home, just as soon as we find a viable alternative planet. The idea of lost or distant worlds inhabited solely by communities of women who can procreate without men has been a staple of sci-fi and utopian fiction by women writers since the 19th century. Mary E Bradley Lane’s Mizora, a serial novel first published in the Cincinnati Commercial in 1880, sees Vera, a young political exile in Siberia, stumble on an all-female land which eschews conventional beauty standards (narrow waists are considered disgusting). On the minus side, it wholeheartedly embraces eugenics, eliminating any non-Aryans along with the men, so not perhaps the utopian model for our times.
JUN25	I always suspected BAME NHS workers were treated differently. Now I know it’s true	Although I’ve heard the dark whispers, the off-record conversations, throughout my 13 years as a doctor, I’ve never wanted to believe it. But now something I was warned about in my first year is out there in the open and we have to deal with it. Doctors in the NHS are treated differently depending on their ethnicity.
JUN25	Britain is still ruled by a privately educated elite. Let’s end this culture of deference	A new report by the Sutton Trust and the Social Mobility Commission has found that a tiny cohort of privately educated people, many of whom went to Oxbridge, continue to hold the top jobs in the country. The people holding those top jobs, in politics, the media, the judiciary and business, are five times more likely to have been to private school than the general population. It is not surprising, though it is depressing. I have often lamented the deference that so many of us still seem to feel towards those who embody this well-established pipeline from prep to parliament, who walk the walk and talk the talk of the old aristocratic elite – Boris Johnson’s continued rise, despite little evidence of talent or integrity, being the most pertinent recent example. There seems to be more than a little bit of Downton-ish forelock-tugging, “they were good to us up at the big house”, feeling of residual inferiority about it. Why the continued respect where there should be scorn and suspicion for those who buy themselves advantages in life and then coast through, seemingly answerable to no one?
JUN25	An avocado cafe is my worst nightmare. But this is Instagram’s world now – we just live in it	We need to talk about no-go zones. Enclaves of extremism are popping up around the world, and they are ruining neighbourhoods. Mobs of lawless social media influencers congregate in these areas, terrorising local people as they strive to capture the perfect picture, no matter what it takes. Sections of Notting Hill in west London, for example, have been overrun with militant Instagrammers using the picturesque streets as their own open-air photography studios. In Paris, influencers throng the pastel-coloured houses on Rue Crémieux, treating private residences like public props. A town in California had to ban tourists after thousands of people thronged poppy fields to capture selfies with the superbloom. Nowhere is safe. Not all Instagram worshippers are dangerous, of course. Some integrate seamlessly into society. However, there is a perilous faction of well-organised radicals intent on nothing less than the wholesale Instagramification of our lives. Please see, as exhibit one, a new app called Depalo which promises to lead influencers “to the exact latitude and longitude” of the most Instagrammable places in a city. The app, developed by a lifestyle blogger called Rebecca Aneloski, covers 14 US cities, but aims to expand globally.
JUN25	The politics of neither: how Northern Ireland is shunning unionism and nationalism	Northern Ireland is arguably as polarised as at any time since the IRA hunger strikes of 1981. It has been without a Stormont government since the beginning of 2017 due to divisions over matters such as the Irish language, Brexit and the legacy of the 30-year Troubles. Yet at the same time, the cross-community Alliance party recently had its biggest ever share of the vote, at 18.5%, in the European elections. And last week research suggested that more people than ever in the province, 50%, say they are “neither unionist nor nationalist”. The Northern Ireland Life and Times survey finds that half the population does not identify with the two main tribal groups who want to see sovereignty lie with either London or Dublin.
JUN25	Britain is now a remain nation. We can halt this rush to Brexit	The frontrunner’s domestic squall on Thursday night has acted as a lightning-flash illumination of the democratic fraud unfolding before our eyes. Had this tiff happened on Love Island, at least every citizen would get to vote. If a despairing lethargy hung over the prime ministerial contest, this fracas has electrified the preposterous nature of the non-choice, and our total exclusion from it. Pinch yourself: is this really happening in a democracy? This is now a remainer nation, held hostage by extreme no-dealers. Remember, this has never happened before. It was bad enough when MPs chose the sitting prime minister – John Major, Theresa May, Gordon Brown – but for the first time the Tory party’s misbegotten 1998 rules see our fate fixed by the votes of a tiny self-selecting oligarchy. This novel experiment in non-democracy couldn’t come at a worse time, with the ruling party seized by no-deal Brexit mania, forcing all candidates to abandon truth to woo the membership’s worst delusions. Only one, Sam Gyimah, represented anything approaching the British remain majority, but he couldn’t scrape eight nominations to get into the contest: that’s the nature of the Tory beast.
JUN25	I was Boris Johnson’s boss: he is utterly unfit to be prime minister	Six years ago, the Cambridge historian Christopher Clark published a study of the outbreak of the first world war, titled The Sleepwalkers. Though Clark is a fine scholar, I was unconvinced by his title, which suggested that the great powers stumbled mindlessly to disaster. On the contrary, the maddest aspect of 1914 was that each belligerent government convinced itself that it was acting rationally. It would be fanciful to liken the ascent of Boris Johnson to the outbreak of global war, but similar forces are in play. There is room for debate about whether he is a scoundrel or mere rogue, but not much about his moral bankruptcy, rooted in a contempt for truth. Nonetheless, even before the Conservative national membership cheers him in as our prime minister – denied the option of Nigel Farage, whom some polls suggest they would prefer – Tory MPs have thronged to do just that.
JUN25	The US’s Middle East ‘peace summit’ is nonsense. Palestinians are right to boycott it	In the toxic history of the enduring conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the Palestinians have often been accused of “never missing an opportunity to miss an opportunity”. This familiar charge has been repeated in the runup to an extraordinary event taking place in the Gulf state of Bahrain, convened by the US and starting on Tuesday. The Manama “workshop” – downgraded from “conference” to lower already rock-bottom expectations – is designed to discuss the “Peace to Prosperity” plan unveiled by the White House on Saturday. The document, the result of two years’ work by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, has already been subject to a torrent of undiplomatic abuse. Palestinians have made clear that they will not attend Manama – apart from the odd businessman prepared to defy a broad national consensus that unusually unites Mahmoud Abbas’s Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip.
JUN26	Shell is not a green saviour. It’s a planetary death machine	It is hard to believe it needs stating, but it does. The oil industry is not your friend. Whatever it might say about its ethical credentials, while it continues to invest in fossil fuels, it accelerates climate breakdown and the death of the habitable planet. You would think this point was obvious to everyone. But over the past few weeks, I have spoken to dozens of environmentalists who appear to believe that Shell is on their side. I’ve come to the bizarre conclusion that there is more awareness of the oil industry’s agenda within the arts than there is among conservation groups. Last week, the actor Mark Rylance brilliantly articulated his reasons for resigning from the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship by BP. The oil company had been subsidising cheap tickets for young people. It might be trashing the world these young people will inherit, but they can watch some great shows. This is bread and circuses – without the bread.
JUN26	Poor Jeremy Hunt. The perfect Tory for a party that no longer exists	Boris Johnson had many motives to dodge a televised debate with Jeremy Hunt on Tuesday night but one factor trumped the rest: he didn’t do it because he didn’t have to. If Conservative party rules and our bizarre constitution can combine to let a man like Johnson sidle up to Downing Street, answering as few questions as possible, it makes sense for him to try. It is also natural that others should try to flush the frontrunner into the open. Hunt accused his rival of cowardice and the jibe clearly stung, as the truth often does. Johnson took to the airwaves, blustering ineffective rebuttals to the charge that he had anything to hide.
JUN26	Labour can’t afford to lose its working-class heartlands by backing remain	What is going on with Labour, Brexit and the second referendum? On one level it looks pretty straightforward. In recent elections the party lost many more votes to the Greens and Liberal Democrats than to the Brexit party, through paying the price for Jeremy Corbyn’s Euroscepticism and fence-sitting. The simple solution is to guarantee another vote on any deal with Labour as the enthusiastic party of remain in any such contest. This aligns with shifting demographics in the country and a detectable Brexit remorse. What’s not to like?  Media coverage tends to give the impression that the only people who think that Labour should not back a second referendum are a few MPs from somewhere up north who are scared witless by Nigel Farage and their electors, and a couple of Corbyn’s closest aides. So it appears self-evident the party should stop triangulating, offer some leadership and hoover up the votes of remainers.
JUN26	I was once Orbán’s ally. I despair at what he has done to Hungary	I was still in university when, after Hungary’s first free elections in 1990, I entered parliament as a member of the newly founded, ambitious Fidesz party, which had been launched by a group of students that included Viktor Orbán, then a courageous young democrat. We felt that we genuinely represented the hopes of our generation. We gained 22 parliamentary seats. I come from a family that relates strongly to the legacy of Hungary’s 1956 revolution – I couldn’t resist the new winds of change. In parliament, we were ardent critics of everything anti-liberal or that threatened freedom of expression. We wanted to break entirely with the one-party communist state and develop a truly democratic society – something Hungarians had never enjoyed.
JUN26	Trump's toadyism to Saudi Arabia: a new moral low	It’s that time of a presidency when every incumbent pretends to be what he isn’t, or to do what he hasn’t. With a re-election year kicking off, everyone wants to know if the candidate can fill in the gaping holes in his record, to give voters some reason to hope or believe. In the case of Donald Trump, that means trying to look like something he hasn’t been for the last two and a half years: presidential, sane and worthy of the world’s respect. Just for once.
JUN26	Have sperm will travel. But what would an all-female planet look like?	If you’re a woman who has despaired over the past week, as you’ve observed the questionable conduct of jowly white men in positions of power and subsequently seen it defended by both men and women – take heart. The good news is that when our species eventually abandons this burned-out, used-up planet for a brave new world elsewhere in the universe, we can leave the men behind too. According to new research by scientists in Barcelona, frozen sperm can survive zero gravity conditions without deterioration, meaning that it will be far more economical to transport only women and sperm banks to populate our new intergalactic home, just as soon as we find a viable alternative planet. The idea of lost or distant worlds inhabited solely by communities of women who can procreate without men has been a staple of sci-fi and utopian fiction by women writers since the 19th century. Mary E Bradley Lane’s Mizora, a serial novel first published in the Cincinnati Commercial in 1880, sees Vera, a young political exile in Siberia, stumble on an all-female land which eschews conventional beauty standards (narrow waists are considered disgusting). On the minus side, it wholeheartedly embraces eugenics, eliminating any non-Aryans along with the men, so not perhaps the utopian model for our times.
JUN26	I always suspected BAME NHS workers were treated differently. Now I know it’s true	Although I’ve heard the dark whispers, the off-record conversations, throughout my 13 years as a doctor, I’ve never wanted to believe it. But now something I was warned about in my first year is out there in the open and we have to deal with it. Doctors in the NHS are treated differently depending on their ethnicity.
JUN26	Britain is still ruled by a privately educated elite. Let’s end this culture of deference	A new report by the Sutton Trust and the Social Mobility Commission has found that a tiny cohort of privately educated people, many of whom went to Oxbridge, continue to hold the top jobs in the country. The people holding those top jobs, in politics, the media, the judiciary and business, are five times more likely to have been to private school than the general population. It is not surprising, though it is depressing. I have often lamented the deference that so many of us still seem to feel towards those who embody this well-established pipeline from prep to parliament, who walk the walk and talk the talk of the old aristocratic elite – Boris Johnson’s continued rise, despite little evidence of talent or integrity, being the most pertinent recent example. There seems to be more than a little bit of Downton-ish forelock-tugging, “they were good to us up at the big house”, feeling of residual inferiority about it. Why the continued respect where there should be scorn and suspicion for those who buy themselves advantages in life and then coast through, seemingly answerable to no one?
JUN26	An avocado cafe is my worst nightmare. But this is Instagram’s world now – we just live in it	We need to talk about no-go zones. Enclaves of extremism are popping up around the world, and they are ruining neighbourhoods. Mobs of lawless social media influencers congregate in these areas, terrorising local people as they strive to capture the perfect picture, no matter what it takes. Sections of Notting Hill in west London, for example, have been overrun with militant Instagrammers using the picturesque streets as their own open-air photography studios. In Paris, influencers throng the pastel-coloured houses on Rue Crémieux, treating private residences like public props. A town in California had to ban tourists after thousands of people thronged poppy fields to capture selfies with the superbloom. Nowhere is safe. Not all Instagram worshippers are dangerous, of course. Some integrate seamlessly into society. However, there is a perilous faction of well-organised radicals intent on nothing less than the wholesale Instagramification of our lives.

The app, developed by a lifestyle blogger called Rebecca Aneloski, covers 14 US cities, but aims to expand globally.
JUN26	Spending time with my French family made me see Europe differently	When I was younger, I’d spend summers on the Côte d’Azur. Family scattered across continents regroup, coming back to take stock, chew fat, tentatively touch base. “Holy smokes,” says my uncle, dropping his holdall to the floor and glancing round the kitchen. “Long time.” We drink rosé from 11am, and in the supermarket my Yankee cousins can’t believe there is an entire aisle dedicated to yoghurt. Whenever I can, I sneak off and buy Gauloises from the tabac, because smoking in French is cool.
JUN27	Boris Johnson’s full English Brexit could rip the union apart	It is time to wake up, but there is barely a moment to smell the coffee. If Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, Britain will be sleepwalking towards the break-up of the United Kingdom. The minority who want this to happen are rubbing their hands at the prospect. The separate minority who say they don’t care if it happens seem beyond reasoned debate at present. But the majority who don’t want it to happen aren’t being much more attentive either. Unless this changes, they could be in for a shock more lasting than Brexit. Even when the twists and turns of leaving the EU dominated the daily news in the early part of this year it was difficult to get many English politicians or commentators to focus for long on the destructive consequences for the union. Now that Brexit has become the defining doctrinal obsession of a Conservative party leadership election conducted in the shadow of the Brexit party, even less attention is being paid to those possible consequences, especially in England. But the forces that are driving Britain towards its break-up are not sleeping.
JUN27	This photo is about bodies – migrant bodies, and our body politic. Don't look away	This is a story about bodies. A body of water. A river running through mountain, bosque, desert and city; along two pueblos, between two states and separating two countries.
JUN27	The two-child benefits limit is a sign of society’s growing inhumanity	Last week a Middlesbrough Conservative councillor apologised after describing benefit claimants as “pond life” who should be “washed and sterilised”. David Smith said: “There are so many genuine cases. But there is a large portion who are claimants that take the absolute piss. Yet they continue to breed. Rabbits, the lot of them.” I thought of Smith as I read through a new report by the Child Poverty Action Group into the impact of the two-child benefit limit – the government policy that, from April 2017, cut at least £53 a week in support from some of the country’s poorest families upon the birth of their third child. Poverty is not so much a mistaken result of the two-child limit, it is the intended consequence
JUN27	Boris Johnson is self-destructing. How much of Britain will he drag down too?	No one expected the final stage of the Conservative party leadership contest to be a staid and dignified affair. The Tories are now more spectacle than party, more farcical roadshow than government. But barely a week in, and it feels like events are escalating at the pace of a crammed last episode of a poorly crafted drama – the writers just want to wrap it up because they have already been told there will be no second series. Boris Johnson’s much anticipated interviews over the past 24 hours have been a series of how-did-we-end-up-here moments. In an interview on LBC yesterday, he petulantly refused to answer questions about an allegedly recent photo of him and his partner looking cosy after the domestic incident reported last week. “Why should I! ? he sulked. The rest of the time he descended into word salads and often just sounds, a harrumphing cornered animal. In another even more alarming interview, we saw Johnson talk about his supposed model bus crafting hobby in slow motion, his eyes glazing over. It wasn’t that it had the air of something made up that was worrying, it was that he seemed to be drifting away as he was fabulating. Like a chirpy robot running out of batteries and slowing down to a drawl, Johnson’s whole demeanour during the campaign so far is that of someone who has burned himself out just before destiny called. He’s tired and irritated and can’t keep up. His shtick, the bumbling posh boy swashbuckling act, is getting so old even he is bored of it, especially when it doesn’t quite cut it when scrutiny is at full-on potential prime minister levels.
JUN27	An Islamophobic security agenda shouldn't mix with arts funding	The last few days have seen a furore over the Bradford literature festival’s decision to accept funding from the Home Office. Some 12 speakers have pulled out of the event so far, in protest at the source of the money, the government’s “Building a Stronger Britain Together” fund, a scheme that supports projects that supposedly counter extremism. As a result of the row, reputational damage has been done to this award-winning festival. Let’s be clear why this has happened: the government refuses to engage with Muslim communities in a meaningful way – unless it is under the auspices of counter- extremism or counter-terrorism. Why does funding offered to Muslim communities so often appear under this guise? We’ve also seen this in the form of the goverment’s terrible Prevent counter terror strategy, which is a toxic presence and is already under review.
JUN27	After 40 years of climate activism, I feel a surge of hope	I am now 68 years of age but when I was 21, in my final year at university, I became aware of major problems then facing the world – war, poverty, acid rain, ozone depletion, desertification, deforestation, species loss, civil and military uses and abuses of nuclear power, pollution, population growth, consumerism and the climate crisis. I was determined to devote my life to helping solve these problems. After spending three years in Cameroon, learning about deforestation for timber and cash crops such as palm oil, and the exploitation of the rich resources of Africa to the detriment of locals and enrichment of corporations and western societies, I returned home to the nuclear weapons crisis of the cold war. I joined the Greenham Common protests, founded the Snowball civil disobedience campaign and then later the anti-nuclear weapons group Trident Ploughshares. I also became involved in work on the climate crisis. I learned that everything is connected and that it all has an impact on the climate, on biodiversity and on the sustainability of life on Earth. I discovered more about how our reliance on fossil fuels was causing the greenhouse effect and soon joined with climate scientists and local environmentalists to start a group in Norwich that tried to educate the public.
JUN27	Shell is not a green saviour. It’s a planetary death machine	It is hard to believe it needs stating, but it does. The oil industry is not your friend. Whatever it might say about its ethical credentials, while it continues to invest in fossil fuels, it accelerates climate breakdown and the death of the habitable planet. You would think this point was obvious to everyone. But over the past few weeks, I have spoken to dozens of environmentalists who appear to believe that Shell is on their side.

The oil company had been subsidising cheap tickets for young people. It might be trashing the world these young people will inherit, but they can watch some great shows. This is bread and circuses – without the bread.
JUN27	Rape crisis services are at breaking point. Do the Tory leadership candidates care?	In March I launched a petition calling on the government to sustainably fund rape support services after I was turned away from multiple rape crisis centres when I really needed help. More than 157,000 people have already signed the petition. I have met ministers at No 10, given evidence in parliament and 46 MPs have signed an early day motion on the issue. But support services remain inaccessible. What is the future prime minister going to do about it? The crisis centres I approached over a period of eight months had been forced to close their waiting lists due to exceptionally high demand and long-term underfunding. For years, rape counselling centres have been put in the impossible position of turning women like me away, because they know that those who are already on their waiting lists may have to wait as long as 14 months before seeing a specialist counsellor.
JUN27	I won’t stand for this dogs-on-train-seats nonsense	Ezra Pound had it mostly right: when you reflect on the way dogs behave, you’re left in no doubt man is the superior animal; when you go on to reflect on human behaviour, you start to wonder. He might have added a coda that the real source of bafflement and disgust is to be found in human behaviour around dogs. Take this week. Wanging round the internet has been a photograph of the BBC’s Emily Maitlis working on her laptop at a table on a GWR train with her pet whippet curled up peaceably on the seat beside her. “Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis slammed for letting dog sleep on seat of packed train” was the Daily Mirror’s pretty representative headline.
JUN27	Jeremy Corbyn is wrong about social mobility - it’s all about aspiration	I’m often asked what social mobility is in simple terms. For me, it’s about one word. Aspiration. It’s about being able to go as far as your effort, talent and hard work can take you in life, unimpeded by class, the school you went to or your background. Social mobility is fundamentally about there being a ladder of opportunity that everyone should have a fair chance of climbing. It’s about having a common stake in our country through having the same chance to build a life here. I was the first Conservative education secretary to have attended a comprehensive school
JUN28	‘Soft’ Brexit is dead. Now Labour must really embrace a people’s vote	How does class politics survive a full-blown culture war? This is the crux of Labour’s current dilemma. The basis of its political vision is that the economic interests of the majority are not only different from those of the elite, but on a collision course with it. This is pithily summed up by the party’s slogan: “For the many, not the few.” Yet the Brexit culture clash smothers any discussion of the real divide in British society, let alone how to overcome it. After the referendum, Labour had a strategy to deal with this. It accepted that while remain lost, the leave triumph was narrow, and therefore there should be a close relationship with the EU. This positioning granted the party permission to pivot back to talking about domestic issues. It prevented Theresa May turning the 2017 contest into the Brexit election she sought; the party instead could fight on issues – like taxing the rich and big business to invest in the economy, tackling student debt, and public ownership – for which there was majority support. Had she succeeded, the Tories would not have been deprived of their majority, and Britain would already have left the EU on the terms May desired.
JUN28	Boris Johnson’s talk of ‘global Britain’ is about to look even more ridiculous	Three years after the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum, the UK is no closer to figuring out how to leave the European Union – and what comes next – than it was when the result was announced. And now a Conservative party leadership election to replace the outgoing prime minister, Theresa May, is in full swing. To those of us watching from the outside, the debate between the candidates confirms that they have learned nothing whatsoever from the past two years of negotiations with the EU. Sadly, this comes as no surprise, given that the lead candidate is Boris Johnson, the leave campaign’s most prominent architect and a man who continues to dissemble, exaggerate and disinform the public about Brexit. In 2016, Johnson and his fellow Brexiteers duped a narrow majority of UK voters into thinking that leaving the EU would somehow furnish the NHS with an additional £350m per week. He also drummed up fears that Britain’s EU membership would somehow lead to mass immigration from Turkey (which happens to be the homeland of his paternal great-grandfather, Ali Kemal).
JUN28	The wild race to lead the Democrats could break the gender mould of US politics	It was a strange experience, watching the US Democratic candidates’ debate this week, and not having one’s eye drawn to the traditional solitary female on stage. For the first time, more than one woman is standing in the race and in Wednesday’s debate there were three in the line-up; in the follow-up debate tonight, a further three – and what’s wild is how wild it was. A broad spectrum of backgrounds and experience! No one woman carrying the symbolic weight of representing all women! It even took the burden off analysing what they were wearing. At the centre of the stage was Elizabeth Warren, the frontrunner whose popularity has surged over the past few months and a woman who often carries an air of being the only grownup in the room. Unlike Bill de Blasio, who spent much of the debate shouting from stage left like a man trying to order lunch in a crowded deli, Warren was calm, measured, disinclined to interrupt. Amy Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota, was spirited and amused. Tulsi Gabbard, the congresswoman from Hawaii, was slick and, to my mind, unconvincing, although plenty of people thought she won the debate. To watch these women perform was to be reminded, whatever one thought of her policies, of how lonely a figure Hillary Clinton had been.
JUN28	An Australian points-based immigration system? It’s just more Boris Johnson bluster	A “tough new Australian-style points-based system for immigration”: Boris Johnson’s radical new proposal, splashed across Thursday’s front pages? No, that was Liam Byrne, then the Labour immigration minister. In 2007. I was a civil servant then, and I complained to a special adviser colleague, more in sorrow than in anger, that what we were proposing had little or no resemblance to the Australian system – and wasn’t even really a points-based system. “Of course, I know that perfectly well,” he said. “But the focus groups love it.” It is in that light that we should read Johnson’s essentially vacuous pronouncements, spun in the Telegraph as the restoration of “control over our borders” and in the Financial Times, by contrast, as “bringing down barriers to skilled overseas workers”.
JUN28	Britain’s private rented sector isn’t fit for purpose. It’s unfair and unsafe	Another day, another housing crisis story confirming what we already knew: things are really bad. New research from Citizens Advice has found that not only do half of landlords not know about or understand their legal obligations, but that their tenants aren’t aware of their rights either and, even when they are, they don’t always feel able to enforce them. Two-thirds of tenants said that their landlord has not addressed disrepair in their home, 15% said they believed that disrepair was a major threat to their health and safety, and 32% said that their home did not have a carbon monoxide alarm despite requiring one. This, Citizens Advice says, leaves hundreds of thousands of renters living in mouldy, potentially dangerous homes with some missing smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors. 
JUN28	Beijing will not rest until it controls Hong Kong. We must keep fighting	Let’s put it in plain words: the people of Hong Kong haven’t defeated the proposed extradition law to China yet – we have only earned a small window to catch our breath. And so have the hardliners in the administration and the Chinese government. Last Friday, thousands of protesters staged a sit-in in front of the police headquarters in Hong Kong. Most of the protesters were in their early 20s; many were still high school students. They chanted slogans, demanding the full withdrawal of the unpopular extradition bill, the dropping of riot charges against peaceful protesters, and justice for the victims of police brutality.
JUN28	Care for the elderly is a scandal – but don’t expect a solution from Hunt or Johnson	Social care services are in freefall, with tens of thousands of people getting no help at all. What’s new? This week’s withering assessment from local authority directors of adult social services in England brings yet more evidence of the unfolding disaster hidden behind the lace curtains of 1.4 million neglected old people, home alone. More than 54,000 people have died waiting for care services that never came. Lip service is paid, nothing is done. There is a fiction that an ever-disappearing green paper, six times cancelled, will solve the problem. That’s a hollow hope: expect no more than a few hazy options, though even these are too politically frightening to see the light of day. Among the Tory leadership candidates, Jeremy Hunt made a token nod that cuts went too far, but care doesn’t feature in his eye-watering list of tax cuts and defence spending plans. Boris Johnson hasn’t mentioned it: he probably doesn’t know what it is.
JUN28	A mistake on a betting slip cost a punter £200k. How you react to that is telling	If I had to pick my favourite irrational fear – behind falling into open manholes, snakes coming out of the toilet and the unshakeable belief that my friends’ newborn baby secretly hates me and is going to beat me up as soon as he learns how fists work – it would probably be filling in forms. No matter how long I spend poring over them, painstakingly writing out everything in a black fountain pen and BLOCK CAPITALS, I’m positive I’ve made a mistake. What if, when confronted with one of those “do you consent to this company contacting you” questions, I wrongly ticked the box that allows them to message me via swarms of angry bees? What if, instead of requesting an aisle seat, I’ve mistakenly given my consent to be fired out of the plane via ejector seat if they’ve overbooked the flight? It’s a fear I’ll never get over, especially not after this week, when I learned of the horrifying story of David Smith, a 60-year-old punter from Loughborough, who managed to lose £189,000 on an accumulator by filling out a form wrongly. Move over Best Friends’ Thug Baby – this scenario has replaced all of my nightmares now. Two weeks ago, Smith picked six outside winners on an accumulator that added up to £212,000, a truly baffling amount of money. When he went to collect his winnings, however (presumably with a wheelbarrow, to take it back to a Scrooge McDuck-style vault), he realised that instead of writing “Bialco”, a winner in the 2.15 at Perth, he had put down the annoyingly similarly named Bailarico, third placed in the 3.40 at Goodwood. Personally I’d argue this is proof that horse-owners need to come up with more original names (Philip Seymour Hoofman, Pony Cascarino, Chevalerie Singleton, Horson Welles, anyone?). According to Smith, he had alerted the staff at his local Betfred to his mistake after the 2.15 but before the 3.40 race, and they had assured him that his bet would count. When he checked his winnings, however, the sixth bet was void, meaning that he had lost nearly £200,000, earning him the paltry sum of just £23,000 – a figure that at least could buy him 3,878 of the world’s smallest violins.
JUN28	There's no duty on UK employers to prevent sexual harassment. That has to change	Most of us understand how our physical wellbeing is protected at work – health and safety measures, much maligned by the right, have made sure of that. But what if you’re sexually assaulted? Shockingly, employers currently have no legal duty to prevent harassment – a glaring oversight that a new campaign by an alliance of organisations including Time’s Up, the TUC and Amnesty International is hoping to change. The alliance has also launched a petition, which has reached nearly 8,000 signatures in less than 24 hours. When I told friends I was working on the development of the campaign, their stories came flooding out. Working in bars with colleagues who wouldn’t stop touching them, threats of rape from managers, incessant, inappropriate comments on their appearance or sex lives – everyone I knew had a handful of discomfiting experiences. I had my own tales, too. The job stacking shelves next to a middle-aged shift manager who would constantly ask my colleagues whether or not they’d have sex with me; the ad man who made constant “jokes” about raping clients.
JUN28	At 68, my climate activism made me a criminal. But I refuse to give up	I am now 68 years of age but when I was 21, in my final year at university, I became aware of major problems then facing the world – war, poverty, acid rain, ozone depletion, desertification, deforestation, species loss, civil and military uses and abuses of nuclear power, pollution, population growth, consumerism and the climate crisis. I was determined to devote my life to helping solve these problems. After spending three years in Cameroon, learning about deforestation for timber and cash crops such as palm oil, and the exploitation of the rich resources of Africa to the detriment of locals and enrichment of corporations and western societies, I returned home to the nuclear weapons crisis of the cold war. I joined the Greenham Common protests, founded the Snowball civil disobedience campaign and then later the anti-nuclear weapons group Trident Ploughshares. I also became involved in work on the climate crisis. I learned that everything is connected and that it all has an impact on the climate, on biodiversity and on the sustainability of life on Earth. I discovered more about how our reliance on fossil fuels was causing the greenhouse effect and soon joined with climate scientists and local environmentalists to start a group in Norwich that tried to educate the public.
JUN29	Pictures of dead migrants inspire our sympathy. But what use is that to them?	On the morning of 17 January 2018 a humanitarian group, No More Deaths, released a report showing how, over four years, US border patrol agents had destroyed 3,856 gallons of water that had been left for migrants in the desert. That afternoon, Scott Warren, a No More Deaths volunteer, was arrested for bringing food, water, bedding and clean clothes to two men who had entered the country illegally. He found them in an area where 32 bodies had been recovered in the previous year alone.
JUN29	Of all the hills to die on, why on earth has Labour chosen Chris Williamson?	Shortly after this article was published, Chris Williamson’s suspension was reinstated, pending a meeting of Labour’s disputes committee. Purely in terms of story, I am confused by the stakes in the Labour leadership’s vision for the nation. If you tell me this is a transformative programme to uplift the many, then I expect the movie trailer voiceover to growl something like: “HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO DEFEND HUMANITY?” Instead, the tagline seems to be “HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO DEFEND CHRIS WILLIAMSON?”
JUN29	Forget Putin’s ‘liberalism’ jibe. This man runs a war machine	Vladimir Putin is on a high. Kicked out of the G8 in 2014 after the start of his military operations in Ukraine, he’s been making full use of the G20 summit in Osaka to bask in meetings with world grandees and soak up all the international media attention he possibly can, complete with a not very challenging interview with the Financial Times. Ever the opportunist, he takes what’s on offer, he glides, he smirks. And he watches with glee as we huff and puff at his provocations, whose over-riding purpose is to keep us on edge and play on our divisions.
JUN29	I felt the fear of abduction by China in Hong Kong. Appeasing Bejing has to stop	When I moved to Hong Kong in 1987, after my books had been permanently banned by the Chinese government, the territory’s distinctive character was immediately obvious. The pungent, salty air smelt of freedom. In China’s huge city boulevards and vast deserts and mountains, my thoughts always felt imprisoned, but in Hong Kong’s narrow streets and tiny, cramped bookshops they were set free and given infinite space to wander. No printed word was banned, no thought outlawed. For 10 years, Hong Kong became a refuge where I could speak, write and be published in freedom, without fear of arbitrary arrest. These basic civil liberties – security and free expression – are threatened by the passage of the much-reviled extradition bill that would allow suspected criminals to be sent to mainland China, where there is no chance of a fair trial.
JUN29	Europe learned from its mistakes in Hungary. It's protecting the law in Poland	Perhaps one day the spring of 2019 will be remembered as the moment when the European Union halted the destruction of democratic institutions in its member states. Just look at how governments in Poland, Hungary and Romania have backtracked on anti-democratic measures they were seeking to introduce. And this week, in a landmark ruling, the European court of justice declared that the enforced early retirement of Poland’s supreme court judges would be unlawful. Could this be a tipping point? What’s clear is that law, money and politics have aligned in ways that now make it more difficult for the Viktor Orbán playbook to be repeated across Europe. The EU’s record on this has been problematic. It failed to define and enforce red lines on democracy in Hungary as far back as 2011-2012. The EU and its institutions watched passively for too long as Hungary’s ruling party, Fidesz, took control of the state. Poland’s government tried to copy this but because it lacked a two-thirds majority in parliament it could not rewrite the country’s constitution as Orbán has. Some of its measures have been cruder and more obviously unlawful, especially when it replaced constitutional tribunal judges in rushed moves after the 2015 elections. But not all is lost. The fight to protect the independence of other parts of the judiciary continues.
JUN29	I'm a civil servant – and we can't make Boris Johnson's no-deal fantasy into reality	I’m a career civil servant. For years I worked quietly and unsnarkily in a government department under a secretary of state whose name would have stumped your average pub-quizzer back in the good old days before Brexit catapulted the UK’s political meme industry into the big time. Let me recap. In February, I was deployed into Operation Yellowhammer, a sort of temporary £1.5bn sweatshop for civil servants tasked with preparing the country for a no-deal Brexit scenario. Then, at the end of March, we coquettishly flirted with the no-deal iceberg as the prime minister’s deal got rejected for a third time, which nudged the deadline down the road a bit to 12 April.
JUN29	Pride has sold its soul to rainbow-branded capitalism	LGBT+ people worldwide are gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the June 1969 Stonewall riots, which led to the formation of the modern LGBT+ movement. More significant than the riots themselves was what they ignited: the formation of the Gay Liberation Front in New York. GLF inspired thousands to come out and join protests for LGBT+ rights. It organised the first Pride march, which took place in New York in 1970, and its revolutionary ideas and activism soon spread worldwide, including to the UK.
JUN29	Islamophobia is rife among Tory members. Johnson and Hunt can't just ignore it	Members of the Conservative party believe in deeply Islamophobic myths, taint the entire Muslim community with responsibility for terrorism, and among other things say they would prefer not to have a Muslim as Britain’s prime minister. So what was Theresa May’s response at this week’s prime minister’s questions? To flippantly turn a question about this stain on her party’s moral standing into a political attack on the Labour party. The Conservative party is facing a crisis, as the latest YouGov polling for Hope Not Hate revealed, but it is turning its face away from the reality of that crisis, hoping against hope that the problem will go away. Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson have a stark choice: do they go against the grain of members who express quite shocking views, potentially harming their chances of winning the leadership, or do they keep quiet because they’re too scared to say anything – or even because they agree with these disgraceful viewpoints?
JUN29	Kamala Harris just changed the direction of the presidential race	As the second round of Democratic presidential debates approached, one of the major questions on the minds of voters and political commentators was whether the candidates would focus on trying to differentiate themselves from each other, as was done the previous night, or whether they would focus on critiquing Donald Trump. Senator Kamala Harris chose to do both, and she did so effectively, in what turned out to be the breakout performance of the evening.
JUN29	Don’t let the UK’s love of Australia stretch to our barbaric treatment of refugees	When I first moved to the UK from Australia, I discovered an odd compulsion that British people had upon meeting me. After breaking the ice with a comment about how much I must love Fosters (I’ve never tried it) and dropping a reference I didn’t understand to 1990s-era Neighbours, they’d get to the real meat (on the barbie) of our conversation. “So,” they’d say, cheerfully, “Australia is really racist, right?” They weren’t wrong. Australia is really racist. But for a (usually white) British person to be smug about the racism of a nation that Britain colonised, while enacting genocide against the indigenous population, seemed a little hypocritical. Racism, like rabbits and tuberculosis, was a pest that Britain dropped on the island before disappearing and letting us sort it out for ourselves. And unfortunately we can’t just release myxomatosis and hope racism dies frothing at the mouth in public parks.
JUN30	Glastonbury isn’t just a fleeting experience – it’s a mirror of society	Glastonbury is another world. At least, that’s what it feels like when you’re there: it’s so vast, so utterly overwhelming. The size of Colchester is the latest comparison (as though that means anything to anyone). At night, if you stand at the back of the Green Fields, you can see the festival stretching down, twinkling, filling the valley all the way to the lit-up cross. Our tent is small, and so are you. Teeny-tiny you is inside enormous Glastonbury, part of it at all times, whether you’re being teased by drag queens in Block9, watching the sun come up in the Sacred Space, traipsing along the surprisingly quiet main drag in the heat or curled up on your coat in the foetal position somewhere between the Left Field and the Glade, wondering if you’ll ever stop shaking. It’s a Narnia of escapism, of living in the moment, a fantasy break away from the everyday. A bubble of joy – or at least a hiccup of concentrated sensation – in a world of never-ending routine. “In Glastonbury,” tweeted a friend yesterday, “my life is perfect and unsustainable.”
JUN30	The passions blowing Boris Johnson into No 10 could yet bring him down	Asked by his spin doctor in 2016 how a Brexit referendum could backfire, David Cameron replied in cod-Shakespearian English: “You could unleash demons of which ye know not. ? Well, ye know now. Brexit has pushed the right into a demonic orgy. It is throwing off the standards it once pretended to abide by – parliamentary sovereignty, family values, monarchism, unionism. For all its rage, don’t underestimate how much it is enjoying the release from its taboos. The Brexiters’ bacchanal is giving Conservatives a rolling revolution, which is pushing the country into a crisis no one foresaw.
JUN30	Lucy Bronze, the England player who won me over to the World Cup	I was so excited about England’s first match of the Women’s World Cup that I trotted off to my local. Last summer, it had been a regular haunt, thanks to the men’s World Cup, which filled the beer garden for almost every match, whether England were playing or not. On that first Sunday afternoon, two televisions were on, cricket on one and rugby on the other. I asked the landlady if they were showing the World Cup. She hadn’t known it was on, she said, but she gave one of the screens to us and we sat there, an audience of two, cheering bashfully. That already feels like a long time ago. What a delight this tournament has been. Support has grown as the games have progressed and England made their way to a semi-final once again. I’m a relative newcomer to enjoying sport, and certainly football, but the women’s game feels welcoming to someone like me. I never would have dreamed that I’d be talking about starting lineups and reading match reports, but I’ve begun to have tentative conversations about them, the words new and cautious as they form. I have never known the names of an entire football team... until now. The cheering has become less bashful already.
JUN30	Corbyn shuns Glastonbury and no one cares. Remainers have moved on	Why didn’t Jeremy Corbyn go to Glastonbury this year? Couldn’t he find his wellies? Was it too late to hire a yurt? Or is he hiding from Remain supporters? Again. When Corbyn attended the festival in 2017, preaching to the euphoric masses, it turned into a veritable Glastonbury on the Mount. Are members of that 2017 crowd a little embarrassed now – too much whooping, weeping and “Jez-mania” and not enough scrutiny? When Corbyn had cancelled appearing at Glastonbury the previous year, straight after the referendum result, the official line was that he was “focusing on the issues”. No one thought to ask why the rent-a-protest Labour leader, usually never happier than when air-punching at a mic stand before uncritical throngs, was suddenly too shy to appear before a massive festival crowd of hyper-emotional Remain voters needing reassurance?
JUN30	Pictures of dead migrants inspire our sympathy. But what use is that to them?	On the morning of 17 January 2018 a humanitarian group, No More Deaths, released a report showing how, over four years, US border patrol agents had destroyed 3,856 gallons of water that had been left for migrants in the desert. That afternoon, Scott Warren, a No More Deaths volunteer, was arrested for bringing food, water, bedding and clean clothes to two men who had entered the country illegally. He found them in an area where 32 bodies had been recovered in the previous year alone.

JUL1	Feel smug about western democracy? The G20 summit should make us reconsider	Next year, an Arab country will host the G20 summit for the first time. Which country has earned this honour? Such recognition as a player in this powerful global club? Its impressive climb in this regard is even more remarkable given that only a few short months ago, this Arab state was supposedly on its way to pariah status. That’s right. Saudi Arabia is hosting the 2020 summit, managing to not only overcome the reputational damage of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the country’s consulate in Turkey less than a year ago, but also doing so just weeks after more grisly details of the killing were revealed. Saudi officials were reported to have referred to Khashoggi as “the sacrificial animal” while discussing how he was to be dismembered. Saudi’s moment of coming in from the (relative) cold even had an official photo at last week’s G20 summit. All the world leaders lined up, looked at the camera and waved, apart from Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman – lost in mutual adoration – who only had eyes for each other.
JUL1	Trying to keep up with the Kardashians is returning women to the Victorian era	Kim Kardashian West is perched on a chair. She’s not quite sitting; instead, she’s pushing her hands into the armrests then leaning against the cushion. Her figure is grotesque: above her generous hips rests an already small waist, tightened beyond belief thanks to a flesh-coloured corset. She addresses the camera. “Anna, if I don’t sit down for dinner, now you know why. I’ll be walking around mingling, talking, but I can hardly sit …” – she tries to sit, she can’t – “I can only half-sit.” The Anna in question is Vogue’s Wintour and the dinner is the Met Gala’s, which took place in May. The video the quote is from was posted on 7 May, and has been watched more than 21m times since then. Perhaps she was right not to sit; a few weeks later, actor Elle Fanning attended a dinner at Cannes where she fainted and fell off her chair. Her dress, a vintage Prada gown with a corseted waist, was too tight.
JUL1	The Guardian was right to use a graphic image – but lessons have been learned	“It is the visual stories that have staying power,” a picture editor once wrote. From time to time an image condenses a public issue into human form so powerfully that it becomes both messenger and symbol. The latest is last week’s photograph of the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his 23-month-old daughter, Angie Valeria, floating face-down near the bank of the Rio Grande, on the US-Mexico border. The child’s arm, draped across her father’s neck, emerges from inside his shirt, where presumably he had tried to secure her. It gives the image a potent poignancy. “The tenderness, the way he never let her go. You can see the way he protected her,” said Rosa Ramírez, his mother in El Salvador, from where Martínez, his wife, Tania Vanessa Ávalos, and their daughter had begun their attempt to reach the US.
JUL1	Boris Johnson says hair-gate is ‘beyond satire’. Here goes…	I had this week’s column nailed by Tuesday teatime, 36 hours ahead of the deadline. Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Haircut Inconclusive-Cocaine-Event Wall-Spaffer Fuck-Business Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Johnson was the gift that kept on giving. Piccaninny’s fans had complained that as the neighbours who called the police to his screams-and-swearing-filled flat last Thursday self-identified as Remainers (as do 56% of the population now), their complaint was invalid. “As anyone who lives in London knows,” the Tuesday version of me wrote, in misguided haste, “the fearful cries of women are so commonplace that one soon learns to ignore them, and I myself am haunted nightly by the bloody and judgmental apparitions of all those I could have rescued. But there’s no time to dwell on that now. What’s done is done.” You get the drift.
JUL1	How can we lure back all the people who avoid news?	What happens if we produce journalism and nobody reads it? This is not an existential worry lurking beyond the keyboard of every reporter and editor, but a growing problem of “never-newsers”: people who deliberately or accidentally avoid the news. According to the recent Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism’s annual digital news report, about an average 32% of people regularly avoid the news, up from 29% in 2018. In the UK, news avoidance soared between 2017 and 2019 by 11 percentage points “mainly due to the intractable and polarising nature of Brexit”.
JUL1	It’s as exciting as a bowl of tofu, but the Lib Dem leadership contest matters a lot	‘You, my friends, are choosing a future prime minister!” declares one of the hopefuls to applause from the 450 activists who have come to hear the two contenders to be their party’s next leader. The audience in a lecture theatre at the London School of Economics asks thoughtful questions. The rivals, taking it in turn to answer, are unfailingly courteous towards each other. There is no shouting, interrupting or name-calling. I have heard ruder conversations between nuns. When one contestant speaks, the other spends a lot of time nodding along in agreement. They even smile at each other’s tepid jokes. That’s enough clues for you to deduce that I am not talking about the gory competition to be chieftain of the rancorous Tory tribe. The event I attended one evening last week was a hustings between Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey, contenders to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats. This contest is being neglected by the media and it is not hard to see why. Compared with the gristle and sizzle of the Tory struggle, the Lib Dem serving is as exciting as a bowl of tofu. Yet it is a mistake not to pay attention. The next Lib Dem leader could matter a lot. Consider these highly plausible scenarios for the near future: an autumn election, another hung parliament, a minority Corbyn government, a minority Tory government, a cross-party government, a second referendum on Brexit. In each case, the attitudes, skills and mettle of the next Lib Dem leader could be critical.
JUL1	Don’t blame parents for wanting the best for their kids. Change the private school system instead	The headmaster of Stowe was greeted with utter incredulity a few weeks ago when he publicly worried that his pupils were victims of social engineering. New figures out last week from the Sutton Trust remind us why his musings were so absurd. The tiny cohort of privately educated people is not two or three times more likely than the comprehensively educated to end up in influential jobs: the figure is a massive 12 times. So defenders of the status quo are arguing that the privately educated are twelvefold more qualified to be ministers, news editors and diplomats. It’s ludicrous and insulting.
JUL1	How Lincoln's disdain for demagogues pricks Trump's Fourth of July pomposity	Donald Trump is orchestrating his Fourth of July extravaganza to be his most spectacular act of self-flattery, his first appearance on the National Mall since his inauguration but before a certifiably larger crowd and ending with a burst of fireworks. He has always given careful thought to his staging. His introduction to The Apprentice, driven to the thumping beat of For the Love of Money, showed the master of the universe striding from a limousine at Trump Tower, riding in a Trump helicopter and climbing the ramp of a Trump airplane. Now, however, he will display himself on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. With the illuminated statue of the 16th president as his backdrop, Trump will highlight the magnitude of his own greatness by standing in reflected glory.
JUL1	The robots are definitely coming and will make the world a more unequal place	So the robots are coming for our jobs, are they? Yawn. That’s such an old story. Goes back to Elizabeth I and the stocking frame, if my memory serves me right. Machines have been taking our jobs forever. But economists, despite their reputation as practitioners of the “dismal science”, have always been upbeat about that. Sure, machines destroy jobs, they say. But hey, the new industries that new technology enables create even more new jobs. Granted, there may be a bit of “disruption” between destruction and creation, but that’s just capitalist business as usual. Besides, it’s progress, innit? We have now lived through what one might call Automation 1.0. The paradigmatic example is car manufacturing. Henry Ford’s production line metamorphosed into Toyota’s “lean machine” and thence to the point where few humans, if any, are visible on an assembly line. Once upon a time, the car industry employed hundreds of thousands of people. We called them blue-collar workers. Now it employs far fewer. The robots did indeed take their jobs. In some cases, those made redundant found other employment, but many didn’t. And sometimes their communities were devastated as a result. But GDP went up, nevertheless, so economists were happy.

JUL2	Jeremy Hunt seemed the sensible Tory option. No longer	A week ago there was a discernible cigarette paper between them: Boris Johnson was the bad character with charisma, the sociopath who would do anything, say anything, lie, cheat and swerve, his roguishness and proroguing priced in with the populism. Jeremy Hunt was dull as hell but more sensible, the man who (probably) wouldn’t drive the country off the cliff in a Boris bus. The three-quarters of voters who reject a no-deal Brexit could only hope against hope that, just possibly, Hunt might defy the odds and persuade the Brexit-crazed old white men of the Tory tribe to think again. No longer. The only useful role for the inevitable loser in the Conservative leadership contest was to pull the next prime minister back into the realms of reality. But in the death throes of this contest, Hunt emerges as a swiveller too, a turncoat peddler of the same hyper-dishonesty, just as ready as his opponent to wreck the economy and people’s lives.
JUL2	We laugh at Ivanka Trump – because to take her seriously is frightening	We have all been there, haven’t we? Standing at the edge of a conversation, pretty in pink, perhaps, hoping to be taken seriously but side-eyed. As most of us have some degree of self-consciousness, we hope the world doesn’t see this happening. But, like her father, idiot princess Ivanka Trump doesn’t really do embarrassment, so the fact everyone saw the handbag entrepreneur being snubbed by world leaders at the G20 doesn’t really matter. She does sleeves. She does bows. And it was her, not Melania (who has again gone awol), who walked into North Korea with her father. “Surreal”, she said. Indeed – although the transgressive, poetic power of surrealism is long gone. Surrealism can only disrupt the rational, and we are way past that. Ivanka, the daughter as wife substitute, travels the world talking about the empowerment of women. I think this means earrings. That her fembot ways enable her father to embolden those who will strip women of their rights is disarming, but not new. Thuggish men have always used women to soften their images. Asma al-Assad, anyone? What Ivanka does for the Trump regime is branding. Product placement. She is both product and placement and no one knows quite how to deal with it. World leaders may look awkward when she is placed in the middle of photographs, but they are complicit in allowing this to happen.
JUL2	Cliff Richard is right to seek anonymity for those accused of sex crimes	The injustice suffered by Cliff Richard in 2017 defied the maxim “words can never hurt you”. Anonymously accused of a sex crime, his good name was devastated by a publicity-seeking police force in collusion with a scoop-seeking BBC. Both later admitted fault and the BBC paid damages. Similar calumny was visited on other public figures, including the broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, former MP Harvey Proctor and assorted VIPs. The police thus became judge and jury in effectively punishing people for a crime of which none had been convicted or even charged. Both Gambaccini and Proctor subsequently received official apologies.
JUL2	You can expel an MP for fiddling expenses – but not violence or misogyny. Why?	I have never grabbed someone by the neck. Nor have I ever groped anyone, or looked at porn at work. I’ve never sent a colleague an inappropriate text message or asked someone I manage to buy sex toys for my partner. I have never been accused of rape. You would think that I wouldn’t need to clarify those things but, as a politician, I increasingly feel the need to. After all, there are more than a dozen men sitting in our House of Commons who have been accused of doing at least one of the above. When Mark Field was caught on camera last week shoving a peaceful Greenpeace activist, Janet Barker, seizing her by the neck and roughly escorting her from a black-tie dinner there was public outcry. As a result he has been  temporarily suspended from his ministerial position and police are investigating third-party reports of assault against him. I believe he should face recall by his constituents. But under current legislation that is impossible.
JUL2	The US right’s concern for the foetus doesn’t survive the trip down the birth canal	In Alabama, a woman who was shot in the stomach five times and lost her pregnancy as a result has been charged with the manslaughter of her foetus. Marshae Jones allegedly instigated a fight that resulted in the shooting, and, thus, according to a local police source, the “only true victim” was the “unborn baby”. Lieutenant Danny Reid further explained that the foetus is “dependent on its mother to keep it from harm, and she shouldn’t seek out unnecessary physical altercations”. If Jones can be tried for manslaughter, what other types of pregnancy loss can be treated as serious crimes? If a pregnant woman is hit by a car while jaywalking, is this manslaughter? How about if – despite knowing of the tiny risk – she chooses to eat soft blue cheese and miscarries due to listeria? What if she changes the cat litter and contracts toxoplasmosis?
JUL2	To cure my chronic pain, I had to learn about the links between mind and body	Chronic pain is an ongoing epidemic. It debilitates around 28 million adults in the UK alone. Yet society seems to have grown comfortable with there being no cure. Perhaps this is because we have been searching for the wrong type of answer, in the wrong place. I should begin by briefly explaining my own experience of chronic pain and what, seemingly against the odds, has helped me find relief.
JUL2	All hail the hyperleaders – the bellicose insurgents using the web to seize control	Back in the far-off days of Occupy and the Arab spring, we were told that the political future would be leaderless, “horizontal” – and defined by the egalitarian promise of social networks. But more than ever, any chance of political success now depends on charismatic, one-person leadership, and the crucial online currency of celebrity. On the left, this is the age of Jeremy Corbyn, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. On the right are Donald Trump, Matteo Salvini and the other figureheads of reactionary populism, whose most grimly fascinating example is probably Narendra Modi of India. All of these individuals present themselves as people from outside their countries’ establishments, and draw their energy from vast numbers of devoted supporters who gather online. In his own way, Boris Johnson clearly fancies his chances of becoming one of them. But more of that in a moment.
JUL2	Europe failed to act after the 2003 French heatwave. We cannot ignore this one	Several French temperature records were broken on 28 June during this historic heatwave, including the highest temperature ever recorded in the country since records began – 45.9C. The previous high was set during the 2003 heatwave, which was the most significant episode in France’s meteorological history until now. Saharan air has engulfed the country. On 20 June, while meteorologists were discussing the projections of the American global forecast system model, a map with a disturbing resemblance to Munch’s painting The Scream came to my attention. Within a few days, the media spotted this comparison and the image went viral. In 15 years of model observation I had never seen such high temperatures predicted for France, especially in June. The forecast, made more than a week in advance, proved correct: records were not just broken, they were smashed.
JUL2	Prevent is stopping free speech on campus and demonising Muslims	Many staff and students at universities across Britain will have welcomed Liberty’s condemnation of the chilling effect the government’s counter-terrorism strategy is having on free speech on campuses. Recently published figures from the Office for Students showed that more than 2,000 events across Britain’s 300 or so higher education institutions have been affected by Prevent. While some events were allowed to take place with conditions attached, 53 events or speaker requests on campuses were rejected altogether by university authorities. The demonisation of Muslims through the Prevent strategy has led to progressive dissent more broadly being curtailed.
JUL2	How Boris Johnson’s Scotland problem could keep the Tories out of power	Usually when a broadcaster airs vox pops on politics, they endeavour to make sure that the samples offer a balanced display of public opinion. But when Sophy Ridge took to the streets of Edinburgh for Sky News earlier this month to survey local opinion on Boris Johnson, there was little in the way of variety on offer. The comments from members of the public ranged from a Johnson premiership looking “quite scary” to being “incredibly divisive”. The highest praise was from a woman who thought he would “get us through Brexit” – before adding that she thought he was a “bit of a clown” generally. As Ridge summed up: “I’ll be honest, here in Edinburgh, it’s been hard to find anyone with a good word to say about Boris Johnson.” Perhaps that’s unsurprising when Johnson has a negative net approval rating of minus 37 in Scotland – the Brexit party’s Nigel Farage is more popular, on a mere minus 24. That same Panelbase survey found that more than half of Scottish voters could back independence if Johnson became prime minister.
JUL3	Corbynism’s greatest liability is now Jeremy Corbyn himself	The winner of the Conservative leadership contest will be the third prime minister in four years to take on Jeremy Corbyn, which is a measure of serial Tory dysfunction and the Labour leader’s tenacity. Corbyn has held his party’s top job for longer than Gordon Brown, John Smith, Michael Foot or James Callaghan. The man obviously has stamina, even if gossipy civil servants say it isn’t so. Other leadership qualities are more debatable. By conventional measures – election results and opinion polls – Labour’s recent record is poor. The party lost dozens of seats in May’s local council ballot and came third in the European poll three weeks later. Corbyn’s personal ratings mine depths of unpopularity from which, as a rule, opposition candidates do not recover. The defence used to be that normal rules do not apply; that conventional instruments did not detect the unique frequency of Corbyn’s appeal. Even stalwart supporters struggle to hold that line. Diane Abbott admits she is “beginning to worry” about Labour’s Brexit position. John McDonnell is reported to have compared the situation to a “slow-motion car crash”.
JUL3	Tennis prodigy Cori Gauff shows why role models still matter	One of the most embarrassing things that ever happened to me played out in Wimbledon. Venus and Serena Williams were renting a house on the road where I grew up. Like me, they were barely out of their teens – Venus had just turned 20 – but while I had just finished my A-levels, they were busy tearing up 120 years of tennis history. That was the first year Venus won Wimbledon, which prompted my mum to insist on baking a cake, frogmarching our whole family up the road, and handing it over to the bemused Williams sisters, declaring that as the mother of two black girls, she knew exactly how they felt. I was mortified, but in hindsight I rate my mum for this. She looked at the Williamses and saw role models for her own daughters. And she was right. The arrival of Venus and Serena had a profound impact on me and my sense of self. Their skill was so exceptional, even in an environment that proved repeatedly hostile – becoming the best athlete of her generation didn’t stop the press trolling Serena. They literally changed the game.
JUL3	The fight for democracy in Hong Kong is the defining struggle of our age	By accident or design, the eruption of political violence in Hong Kong has opened the way for direct rule from Beijing. It is unlikely radical new measures to bring Britain’s former colony to heel will be imposed overnight. But furious official statements in response to Monday’s unprecedented clashes suggest the “one country, two systems” principle that has kept capitalist Hong Kong functioning alongside, and within, communist China for the past 22 years could be on its last legs. This long-simmering crisis of mutual confidence, now finding expression through physical confrontation, is exactly what the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, which laid legal grounds for the 1997 handover, was intended to avoid. It states unambiguously that “the current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the lifestyle. Rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly … and of religious belief will be ensured by law.”
JUL3	Mark Field called homeless people ‘undesirables’. But it’s not just Tories who think this	In the past decade, thousands of people have been plunged into homelessness and hundreds of homeless individuals have died on the streets, unaccounted for. Year-on-year rises in homelessness have become so bad that now, when ministers are asked why, they shrug like a petulant teenager asked why she hasn’t handed in her homework. And things are getting worse. In the past month, the Guardian has reported on councils putting up walls to keep homeless people away from the one place they are allowed to be: the streets. Homelessness minister Heather Wheeler faced calls to step down after using “racist” language when referring to homeless people. And on Tuesday, it was reported that the Conservative MP Mark Field called a local homeless charity a “magnet for these undesirables to flood into Victoria”.
JUL3	Does Boris Johnson believe he can hoodwink the nation on Brexit?	The problem with assessing the intentions of a serial liar is that disbelief becomes second nature. So when Boris Johnson stated his Brexit plans in interviews last week and over the weekend it was largely overlooked. The media and public preferred to focus Johnson’s absurd claim that he enjoys arts and crafts of the vehicular variety. Less a dead cat than a dead kitten. What makes Johnson’s intentions even harder to assess is his absence of principles. He belongs to a vanishingly small group of Britons who believe in neither leave nor remain. It is not that he has changed his mind but that he has never much cared either way. For Johnson, Brexit was a passing bandwagon to the premiership, and he was prepared to climb aboard. It is testament to his political skill that he has hoodwinked the Brexit zealots into believing he is their man.
JUL3	Civil servants should discuss Corbyn – as long as it’s behind closed doors	Jeremy Corbyn is owed an apology, and when he meets Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service, he will presumably get one. Senior civil servants are not supposed to gossip to journalists, which means that whoever supplied Saturday’s Times with comments about longstanding rumours of the Labour leader’s supposed physical and mental unfitness to become prime minister simply doesn’t have a leg to stand on. Downing Street’s unexpectedly strong intervention in Corbyn’s defence, with No 10 arguing that it would “be inappropriate and unacceptable for comments of this sort to have been made or briefed to the press”, underlines how seriously the concept of political neutrality or civil service willingness to serve without judgment is taken. But let’s clear about what Sedwill should, and should not, be clamping down on here. Rumours have been flying for months not only about Corbyn’s physical health, which the leader’s office categorically denies, but more broadly about his intellectual capacity; his ability to master an endless series of complex briefs and take timely decisions on difficult issues, while simultaneously managing a sometimes fractious party and dealing with whatever unexpected crisis blows up. Some of that speculation has centred unfairly on his age, but some has more to do with the way he has led his party to date.
JUL3	It’s not that we’ve failed to rein in Facebook and Google. We’ve not even tried	In a BBC interview last week, Facebook’s vice-president, Nick Clegg, surprised viewers by calling for new “rules of the road” on privacy, data collection and other company practices that have attracted heavy criticism during the past year. “It’s not for private companies … to come up with those rules,” he insisted. “It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so.” Facebook’s response would be to adopt a “mature role”, not “shunning” but “advocating” the new rules. For a company that has fiercely resisted new laws, Clegg’s message aimed to persuade us that the page had turned. Yet his remarks sounded like Newspeak, as if to obscure ugly facts.
JUL3	Lil Nas X’s coming out shows why hiding LGBT life from children won’t work	This weekend I took my kids to a community fete in our north London borough of Haringey, complete with bouncy castle, Turkish dancing, tug-of-war and free curry. After a while the younger children present began to drag their heels, so the emcee put Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road on and surrendered the microphone – at which point they all, I believe the phrase is, popped off. Old Town Road was then played, sometimes in alternation with Baby Shark, a total number of 4,012 times, with children doing the shoot dance and hollering “can’t tell me nothing” into the mic all afternoon. Old Town Road has been in the UK charts for 14 weeks, of which two were spent at No 1. In the States the song has been top of the Billboard ranking for 12 weeks straight. Part of the song’s success, as any parent knows, is due to sales earned from streaming: children love Old Town Road. For proof, enjoy this viral tweet showing children going wild to the song when Lil Nas X performed at their school.
JUL3	Boys love these Lionesses too. A football revolution is coming	Last Friday morning I woke up to my nine-year-old son shouting: “Did you see that Lucy Bronze goal!?” as he burst into the bedroom. His six-year-old brother was right behind him, earnestly re-enacting the England player’s 20-yard thunderbolt with all his might. They’d followed our usual protocol for evening kickoffs on school nights, inaugurated with England’s men in the World Cup last summer and honed with Liverpool in the Champions League this season. They watch the first half with my husband and me before bed, then watch the second half on catch-up the next morning. That this time it was women playing rather than men made no discernible difference to their levels of interest or excitement. For them it was just football – and compelling football at that, in which England were doing well.
JUL3	The Handmaid’s Tale comes to life in Alabama. Women must heed the warning	Marshae Jones was five months pregnant when another woman, Ebony Jemison, shot her in the stomach, in an Alabama town called Pleasant Grove. The 27-year-old Jones survived but the foetus, hit by the bullet, did not. Jemison successfully pleaded self-defence, since her gun was drawn in the middle of a fight that Jones reportedly started and was winning – according to an unnamed police source – until the gun was fired. Since the shooter was exonerated, it seems odd still to be preoccupied with who started the fight. But this is one of two key elements in the extraordinary case against Jones, who was indicted for the manslaughter of her unborn child. As a pregnant woman, Jones’s alleged decision to provoke an altercation represented wilful endangerment. Since the law in Alabama confers “personhood” on a foetus, Jones was treated as she would have been had she endangered a child. Her lawyers have yet to decide whether or not to build a challenge to that idea of “personhood” into their case. 
JUL4	Forget what you think about Corbyn: a partisan civil service is a threat to us all	A firebrand leftwing Labour leader whose radical political prospectus terrifies the establishment; a smear campaign alleging ill health fostered by unaccountable figures seeking to oust him from power. This is the plot of A Very British Coup, a 1982 work of fiction by former Labour minister Chris Mullin that centres on the rise to power of plain-speaking Harry Perkins. Election euphoria has given way to turmoil and crisis. With Perkins deemed irretrievably unpopular, the media demands he stands aside for a more “moderate” colleague. At this moment, agents of the British state – supposedly impartial servants of the elected government – take the opportunity to strike. A far-fetched scenario, surely? It seems not. Last week the Times ran a front-page story headlined “Jeremy Corbyn too frail to be PM, fears civil service”. Officials were quoted as saying there were worries Corbyn was not up to the job “physically or mentally”. One asked: “When does someone say [he] is too ill to carry on as leader of the Labour party let alone prime minister?”
JUL4	The EU has nominated new leaders – but there will be no Brexit breakthrough	So the European Union, finally, has managed to nominate people to fill its top jobs. The era of Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk is over. And – of course – the announcements are being interpreted in this country through a Brexit-tinted lens. Hasty conclusions have been reached about what this latest revolution of the Brussels merry-go-round might mean for us. After all, both men who are being replaced have been key figures in the Brexit story. Save yourself the bother, though – because frankly, it doesn’t mean all that much.
JUL4	Soho has never been famous for its health-giving properties. Long may that continue	Soho has been ranked as the unhealthiest place to live in Britain – shock news that sends bears hurtling into the woods and the pope saying his rosary: in other words, no shit, Sherlock. Too many opportunities to get boozed up and fill your belly with calorific takeaways, and very few parks and green spaces in which to counter the excess and choking pollution, do not a Swiss sanatorium make. Nobody goes to Soho to get healthy, despite the recent arrival of the odd green-juice bar. They go to live the life of the flâneur, to soak up the psychic energy that generations of incomers – from 17th-century French Huguenots to the proprietors and staff of numerous Italian and Chinese restaurants, from music-hall artistes to struggling writers and artists – have imprinted into this tiny network of streets and alleys.
JUL4	If you care about migrants to the US, don’t call for humane detention – call for its end	It has long been obvious that migrants in the custody of the US Border Patrol were being detained in horrendous conditions. But not many cared to look, and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was mocked when she claimed that “concentration camps” were being run along the border. In the past few days, however, a series of exposures has demonstrated that extreme language is more than justified. First, Ocasio-Cortez and a congressional delegation visited two detention facilities in Texas, where they found detainees who hadn’t bathed in weeks, were sleeping on concrete floors and had limited access to drinking water. Ocasio-Cortez met with women crying “out of fear of being punished, out of sickness, out of desperation, lack of sleep, trauma, despair”. She said women had been encouraged to drink out of toilet bowls and that Border Patrol agents were laughing about the situation in front of the delegation.
JUL4	In turning their backs, Brexit MEPs behaved like attention-seeking toddlers	On Tuesday, Brexit party MEPs decided to take a stand against the undemocratic EU they’d been elected to democratically. Rather than do something frivolous such as returning their wages, they decided to turn their backs at the playing of the European anthem during the parliament’s opening ceremony, a move only slightly classier than mooning. When the 29 Brexiteers were elected to the European parliament, many were concerned that they wouldn’t represent the UK properly. And yet here they were on day one already crapping themselves for attention – and as such were representing the UK better than we possibly could have imagined. Shortly afterwards, Nigel Farage tweeted proudly “The Brexit party has already made its presence felt”, and he’s right, in the same way that a toddler smearing spaghetti on the walls of a fancy restaurant while repeating every swearword they know will grab the attention of their parents. Who knows what the party has in store next, but we should probably set our faces to apologetic cringe mode just in case. 
JUL4	Boris Johnson’s cynical ‘sin-tax’ freeze is a glimpse of what’s to come	Here’s a thing they teach in campaign school. If you’re about to make a political promise, first check the calendar. Just to avoid a clash that could make your policy proposal look utterly wrong-headed, inept and at odds with the available evidence. Boris Johnson must have bunked off that day, because he clearly missed that lesson. Instead, he’s issued what he doubtless hoped would be a crowd-pleasing promise to halt any new “sin taxes” on sugary drinks on the very day obesity was named as causing more cases of four common cancers than smoking.
JUL4	After urging land reform I now know the brute power of our billionaire press	All billionaires want the same thing – a world that works for them. For many, this means a world in which they are scarcely taxed and scarcely regulated; where labour is cheap and the planet can be used as a dustbin; where they can flit between tax havens and secrecy regimes, using the Earth’s surface as a speculative gaming board, extracting profits and dumping costs. The world that works for them works against us. So how, in nominal democracies, do they get what they want? They fund political parties and lobby groups, set up fake grassroots (Astroturf) campaigns and finance social media ads. But above all, they buy newspapers and television stations. The widespread hope and expectation a few years ago was that, in the internet age, news controlled by billionaires would be replaced by news controlled by the people: social media would break their grip. But social media is instead dominated by stories the billionaire press generates. As their crucial role in promoting Nigel Farage, Brexit and Boris Johnson suggests, the newspapers are as powerful as ever.
JUL4	The fight for fair housing is finally shifting power from landlords to residents	Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ll know there is a housing crisis – and even if you have been, your rent has probably gone up. Despite house prices having fallen slightly as a result of diminished consumer confidence, housing continues to devour outrageous amounts of income. In the UK and elsewhere, many poor, working-class and even some middle-class households experience housing as unaffordable, exploitative and precarious. Housing has been a site of injustice for so long that it is easy to think this condition is permanent. But across the world, activists are reinvigorating housing politics. Demands that have been marginalised are becoming mainstream. There appears to be a new level of awareness today that the residential is political. And there are some initial signs that the balance of power may finally be starting to shift away from landlords, developers and speculators, and towards tenants, activists and residents.
JUL4	In too deep: why the seabed should be off-limits to mining companies	When I was filming Blue Planet Live, I was struck by just how much of the ocean has been altered by humans. From industrial fisheries ensnaring ocean giants in kilometres-long lines, to finding our trash at some of the deepest parts of the ocean: it’s clear that however vast the seas are, we are causing profound harm. Yet at this point in history, when the oceans are facing more pressures than ever before, a secretive new industry is seeking to move into the deep sea, the largest ecosystem on the planet, to start mining for metals and minerals.
JUL4	If we want to help migrants, it's time to move from outrage to action	Having grown up just after the second world war, I’ve always wondered what I would have done if I’d known that Jews were being herded into (let’s call them) mass detention centers. What if I’d been aware that this was happening in my country? Now that people are being herded into mass detention centers in my country, now that children are being kept in cages, I have – like it or not – been given a chance to find out what I would have done. If there had been Facebook in the early 1940s, I would have posted on Facebook. I would have written opinion pieces from the safe distance of my study. I would have donated to humanitarian and legal aid organizations. I would even have traveled to Texas to hear the stories of asylum seekers and witness a trial in which 40 immigrants, some of whom had lived here for years, were all deported at once. I would have felt haunted, continually. Haunted and obsessed. And none of these things would have stopped the mass incarceration of children.
JUL5	Someone, please tell Jeremy Hunt: Britain no longer rules the waves	It was June 1997 and I was standing in the crowd on Hong Kong’s waterfront in torrential rain. A sad bugle played as the flag was lowered, and the royal yacht Britannia carried the Prince of Wales out to sea – and Britain out of its last Asian colony. We all had one thought. Thank goodness that’s over. Hong Kong’s last governor, Chris Patten, left what China clearly saw as a mess on the carpet, an elected assembly under the slogan “one country, two systems”. No one expected it to last, but Britain left with a certain dignity. So why did Britain’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, take it on himself this week to revisit the scene? He applauded Hong Kong’s recent demonstrations and warned Beijing not to crack down on the rioters. He said the Chinese regime should not use a few broken windows as “a pretext for repression”. Britain would not stand for it. He said there would be “serious consequences”.
JUL5	Osborne thinks he could run the IMF. Maybe gaslighting a country is a useful skill	Imagine: you have been very publicly sacked from your job and the mistakes you made have had dire consequences for society. When planning your next steps do you a) rethink your career goals and consider doing something different with less responsibility; b) go for a job you’re completely unqualified for; or c) go for a big promotion with even greater stakes for society? I assume most of us would go for a), and even if we wanted to, we wouldn’t have the option of b) or c) without facing rejection. However, that’s not the case for our former chancellor George Osborne, who after presiding over the worst economic recovery in recorded history, with severe and deadly public spending cuts, went for option b) and managed to become the editor of the Evening Standard – a job for which he is totally unqualified. And how has that gone? Losses of £11.5m aren’t too shabby. So, sensing now is the time to cut and run, he’s in the running for the top job at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Yes, it’s yet another example of a privately educated white male failing upwards. But it also shows us how without an ideological change at the top we are stuck with the same pool of arrogant neoliberals.
JUL5	The Tories are there to be demolished. But Labour is too inept to do it	If anyone missed the depth of this national crisis, just look at the latest dire economic figures: we’re plunging towards a recession of our own making, with Britain’s first quarterly contraction in seven years. Meanwhile the two would-be prime ministers daily demonstrate their unfitness for office with ever wilder promises and preposterous claims. More fox hunting, more sugar? Both are now fatally boxed into a no-deal future with no escape hatch, hostages to Nigel Farage and the European Research Group of hardline Tory MPs. Each bids to persuade the Conservative membership that only they can bar Jeremy Corbyn’s way to Downing Street. Jeremy Hunt claimed on Wednesday to be “the best person” to stop “this clear and present danger”, with Boris Johnson counter-boasting, as his lead narrows. But does the idea of Corbyn as a bogeyman to petrify all right-thinking citizens fly? Weakness, not red peril, is Labour’s electoral problem. Nothing in Labour’s last or next manifesto could be a fraction as radical as the earthquake the Brexiters have caused to Britain’s economy, its union, its internal harmony or its standing in the world. The nearest to revolutionary terror is Labour’s plan to raise the top level of tax for the richest 5% back to where it was in 2010. Popular plans to take back rail and the utilities to public ownership is hardly Venezuelan, since they leak as much money to shareholders as the water companies’ three billion litres leaked daily from broken pipes.
JUL5	What unites Johnson and Hunt in Northern Ireland? An inability to pretend they care	Winston Churchill called the train that smuggled Vladimir Lenin into Russia, “a sealed truck” carrying “a plague bacillus”. By contrast, the plane carrying Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson to Belfast this week was a bit more like a Tupperware container filled with norovirus. Conveyed at separate ends of a single private jet, Schrödinger’s leadership candidates took the roadshow of milky promises and hedged half-truths to Northern Ireland for a strange, and quietly pointless, Conservative party hustings in Belfast.
JUL5	A post-Brexit election is looking like Boris Johnson’s best bet	Boris Johnson seems to have taken Lynton Crosby’s advice, to deny any intention of calling an autumn general election once he’s installed in Downing Street – while, in fact, keeping his options open. The Tory frontrunner might also ask his election strategist what are the chances of leading the Conservatives to victory, and securing a large enough majority to implement Brexit on his terms. Two polls out this week tell very different stories, especially about the threat from the Brexit party.
JUL5	Enough of the climate nightmare. It’s time to paint the dream	Let’s talk about the dream, not just the nightmare. Imagine the cities and towns of the future: clean, green, with decent air quality, hospitable to walking and cycling, powered by renewables, with green space, not concrete jungles, and rewarding jobs in green industries. That isn’t just a conceit for the imagination but a tangible vision of the future produced today by Common Wealth, the thinktank of which I am a board member. Tackling the climate and ecological crisis requires urgently reimagining how we live and work. A Green New Deal – conceived of in the UK, popularised by US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and now powered by social movements here – should not just decarbonise today’s economy but build the sustainable and just economy of tomorrow. That’s why imagining a town transformed by a just transition to a low-carbon future isn’t just a nice piece of design, it is an essential symbol of where the climate movement now needs to take its case. That movement has an unprecedented chance to be heard as a result of the spectacular success of Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes in refocusing public attention on the urgency of action. But now, with people listening once again, our duty is to offer a compelling and attractive vision of the future.
JUL5	Want a truly mind-expanding experience? Learn another language	More than half the world’s people speak more than one language, and I am one of them: I speak English, Welsh, French and Italian, and wish that I could speak more. Being able to speak more than one language has opened up whole worlds of experience and understanding – so it is particularly saddening then to see reports that Brexit is putting British pupils off studying modern foreign languages at school. Some parents have even told teachers that it’s useless for their children to learn another language now that the UK is leaving the European Union.
JUL5	What Love Island tells us about the value of kindness	Is there gaslighting on Love Island? Maybe. From cruel jokes to crueller recouplings, commentators have been quick – and sometimes astute – to notice how patterns of behaviour on the programme can dramatise the more disturbing aspects of dating in the real world. These are interesting conversations and, as others have noted, Love Island’s capacity to spark wider discussions around consent, relationships and gender is part of what makes it such a fascinating show. Discussing signs of abuse in the abstract is useful, too: if seeing a TV character’s behaviour labelled thus helps one woman recognise that a sustained, amplified version of the same has happened in her life – and can be addressed seriously – then that can only be a good thing. But while the debate over whether certain contestants’ actions constitute abuse or not is a fraught one, there is something we can all readily agree on: often, it isn’t very kind.
JUL5	It’s the autumn of 2020 and no-deal Britain is on its knees…	It was Sunday 1 November 2020. The helicopter carrying his hush-hush VIP visitor was expected soon. Staring through the Chequers windows at the lawn where the unmarked Sea King would soon land, prime minister Boris Johnson could hardly believe what he was about to do. Even by his standards, it had been a year of scrapes, of winging it and of close-run things that would have destroyed another leader. In the summer of 2019 he had defeated Jeremy Hunt by an unexpectedly narrow margin. A year ago he had led Britain out of the European Union without a deal.
JUL5	How women anxious to have a baby are being exploited for profit	Get A Drip, a wellness company offering “affordable IV vitamin drips and booster shots”, has withdrawn a product it called a “fertility IV” from sale after the British Pregnancy Advisory Service said there was no evidence this “treatment” could improve fertility. The drip was advertised as costing £250. The only supplements medically recommended for women trying to conceive are folic acid and vitamin D, so you wonder what on earth it contained to warrant such a price tag (£250 would get you 28 bottles of folic acid from Holland & Barrett, incidentally). More to the point, how could the wellness industry have stooped to such a new, exploitative low?
JUL6	Ann Widdecombe’s political exhumation adds insult to ignorance in Strasbourg	Wondering vaguely where we’ll be in six months’ time, I find myself imagining a scene. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg is doing a live piece to camera from Downing Street, when an upper window of No 10 opens behind her. As she speaks, bin bags full of Boris Johnson’s clothes begin to be thrown from it, punctuated by various high-pitched reflections on his character. Like I say, it’s just a fictional vignette, set 10 minutes into a dystopian future. But would you honestly rule it out? Just over a fortnight before the money shot of the Tory leadership contest, very little seems impossible in our increasingly trashy country. After all, this is a week in which England – and it is always England – has once again been embarrassed by the behaviour of travelling fans. Fans of Nigel Farage, in this case, with the spectacle of his Brexit party MEPs turning their backs on a live performance of the European anthem at the opening of the new European parliament session in Strasbourg. We have seen it so many times before, of course – this pack mentality, this unprovoked loutishness, this excruciatingly entitled sense that it is acceptable, even imperative, to colonise a public space and behave absurdly rudely in it.
JUL6	Donald Trump wants to be a dictator. It’s not enough just to laugh at him	Maybe we’re too busy laughing to see it. Perhaps it’s the jokes and memes that Donald Trump generates in abundance, the gift that keeps on giving, that blinds us to a chilling fact that we’d rather not face. Put simply, the leader of the world’s most powerful nation is behaving like an authoritarian dictator, one who threatens democracy in his own country and far beyond. Here’s the latest example of how the comedy can distract. On Thursday Donald Trump marked the Fourth of July by praising the US military, invoking the heroism of an army that defeated the British in the 18th century in part because “it took over the airports”. Lol: behold, the ignoramus president. Cue more chuckles as Trump delivered that speech during a downpour, the Almighty himself apparently deciding to rain on Trump’s parade.
JUL6	Very heterosexual couples and 18th-century airports: it's 4 July, Trump-style	I cannot wait, as a global citizen and (for obvious reasons) constant consumer of news, for independence from Donald Trump. I will be celebrating every single day. Many of us will. And if you needed another reason (I anticipate that you do not), Trump’s latest boneheaded episode was to give an Independence Day speech that referenced American takeover of airports in 1775. The first ever flight is thought to have taken place in 1903. Trump, becoming the first US president to make a 4 July address in almost 70 years, stuck to his script for once. It’s just that the script was mostly wrong. As well as confusing the American revolutionary war (AKA the war of independence) with the war of 1812, Trump went on to make further historical errors. There was plenty more going on throughout the celebrations – let’s take a look.
JUL6	Labour’s fight against antisemitism must be far more radical	The Labour party owes the Jewish community an unqualified apology. But that is only a starting point in rebuilding the trust that has been shattered. A few months ago, I joined hundreds of other non-Jewish Labour party members in signing up as an affiliated member of the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM). Instead of Jewish members leaving Labour, Labour members joined the Jewish community.
JUL6	Syriza betrayed its principles – and the Greek people. Its days are numbered	In January 2015, progressives the world over hailed Syriza’s general election victory as a rejection of EU-imposed austerity and the dawn of a new era for Greece. Four years on, Alexis Tsipras’s once radical party goes to the polls on Sunday as a dead man walking – it’s now a confused political mishmash of leftists, social democrats, conservatives and rightwing populists that defends the very neoliberal policies Syriza once threatened to destroy the eurozone over. The party’s main difference from its rightwing rival, New Democracy, is a laughable persistence in claiming to be a party of the left. Its government record shows greater zeal in implementing the neoliberal programme of the European troika – the consortium of the European commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF – in the years since the 2008 financial crisis than any of its conservative predecessors.
JUL6	The Tories’ rift with the police underlines the party’s existential crisis	You used to know where you were with the Conservatives. They were the party of big business, of the union, of the police, of the Church of England. The latter can still accurately be described as the “Tory party at prayer”: a large majority of Anglicans plumped for Theresa May’s party in the 2017 general election. But the institution has drastically shrivelled, and since the 1980s successive archbishops of Canterbury have savaged unjust Tory policies, from Robert Runcie – whose condemnations of Thatcherism were labelled “pure Marxist theology” by a Tory cabinet minister – to Rowan Williams’ fusillades against the Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition. The lying, philandering likely successor to Theresa May is not, let us put this gently, exactly the embodiment of traditional Christian values.
JUL6	All hail Theresa May, reluctant hero of the Scottish independence movement	The problem with legacies and the obsession of departing leaders to bequeath them is that the wrong sort can breenge in and wreck the place. Tony Blair modernised the Labour party, repealed section 28 and drove investment in our moribund cities, but his tenure will always be disfigured by the Iraq war. Theresa May has spent the past month traversing the UK seeking to carve her name into any cause that will have it: mental health provision here; zero-carbon emissions there. Rather inadvertently though, she is also making a late run to be remembered as the handmaiden of Scottish independence. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has her own thoughts on this. “Scotland is heading inexorably towards independence – that will be Theresa May’s legacy, ? said Sturgeon ahead of the prime minister’s visit to Scotland on Thursday. This legacy may even stretch to an essay in a future modern studies exam paper: “Theresa May was responsible for delivering Scottish independence. Discuss ?.
JUL6	Boorish sex tourists are ruining Amsterdam. It’s time to ship them out	As I battled a pushchair across the unhelpful Amsterdam cobbles, three young Englishmen approached. “Where’s the red-light district?” they asked this bleary-eyed, breastfeeding mother. I thought about directing them straight into a cold canal, but politely waved in the direction of what the Dutch call De Wallen. A decade ago, I had no idea that they were the first drips in a flood of tourists. Now, 17 million visitors a year stay in Amsterdam, many keen to ogle women in red-lit brothel windows, party, and turn the centre into what city ombudsman Arre Zuurmond has called an “urban jungle”.
JUL6	Britain is run by a self-serving clique. That’s why it’s in crisis	Last week Boris Johnson delivered a speech to a Royal Horticultural Society audience in Wisley, Surrey, before heading to the affluent village of Oxshott to buy some fennel and tarragon sausages and have a cup of tea in the Munch and Wiggles cafe. In a series of interviews later that day, he was unwilling to reveal the provenance of the staged photograph of him and his partner, Carrie Symonds. He was, however, able to insist that Britain would leave the European Union, “do or die”, by the end of October. On the same day, the Sutton Trust and the Social Mobility Commission issued a report into elitism in Britain that “paints a picture of a country whose power structures are dominated by a narrow section of the population [where] social mobility is low and not improving”. Those who went to private school comprise 7% of the country’s population but 39% of the elite; those who went to Oxford or Cambridge university comprise less than 1% of the population but 24% of the elite. Senior judges, junior ministers, permanent secretaries and diplomats are among the least representative professions. But the media, and particularly newspaper columnists, are right up there, too. 
JUL6	Social care is a complex, human challenge. No wonder the Tories aren’t up to it	My mother has an informal patchwork of care arrangements, most of which she pays for herself. Some – a woman who perambulates her up the road and back – is provided by Age UK, and they’re all extremely nice, but none in the skill region of, say, giving a person a bath. So the other day I asked if we should look into the local authority’s domiciliary care arrangements. “Jesus, no,” she replied operatically but also very quietly (she genuinely is pretty ill). “Just kill me if I get to the point of needing anything like that.” “Obviously I’d love to help,” I replied, “but I’m not allowed to do that.” She gave me a look like I’d refused to break into a building that had a cat stuck in it. “Where’s Harold Shipman when you need him?” Was there ever anything easier for a politician to ignore than the subject nobody wants to talk about anyway? It’s like re-evaluating council tax bands so they actually make sense and are fair: only local authorities ever bring it up, and then everyone ignores them.
JUL7	When ‘respectable’ conservatives bow to the far right it’s always disastrous	The far right does not seize power. It is invited in to power by mainstream conservatives, who boast of their commitment to free societies. They do it for partisan gain. They do it because they hate and fear the left more than they hate and fear the far right. But most of all they do it because they have run out of ideas. The energy and the votes appear to lie with radical rather than “respectable” conservatives. The future is extreme, and, like prostitutes turning a trick, conservatives would rather lose their respectability than their chance of staying in the game. Leftish condemnations of “neoliberalism” miss that the Thatcher/Reagan ideology of the 1980s is over. Conservatives rarely admit it, in public at any rate, but an idea is still dead even if no one turns up for the funeral. Who can now pretend hopes that a small state and free markets would bring prosperity to the mass of people are anything more than a hollow joke? The 2010s have been the worst decade for wage growth in 200 years. The real value of average wages has still not staggered back to its 2007 level. The web’s enabling of fake news gets all the attention. But if it had never been invented, there would still have been a reaction against the emptiness of the promises of the old ruling order.
JUL7	In accusing all creeps of gaslighting, we dishonour the real victims	All women need the term “gaslighting”. Well, all people really. Rebecca Humphries didn’t even realise that she needed it until she was cheated on by the comedian Seann Walsh in the 2018 Strictly Come Dancing scandal. She’d had suspicions but, as she wrote at the time, Walsh “aggressively and repeatedly called me psycho/nuts/mental, as he had done countless times… when I’ve questioned his inappropriate and hurtful behaviour”. When her friend mentioned gaslighting, it was a relief to know that there was a term to describe her experience. Humphries, who has just spoken at the House of Commons about coercive control, says that single word gave her the vindication and courage she needed.
JUL7	Jean Paul Gaultier, challenging those who churn out fast fashion	Jean Paul Gaultier, a man of many notable achievements, including the perfect and most welcome corruption of the minds of kids who furtively watched late-night Channel 4 during the 1990s, has spoken about the responsibility of big fashion brands when it comes to waste. “Big groups are doing more collections, new collections… with a big amount of clothes. It’s absolutely ridiculous,” he told BBC News. “It’s not a question of thinking about what people need. It’s thinking about being bigger. It’s only a question of power and politics.” We hear over and over again that our addiction to consumption is causing environmental devastation, that the incessant need for more, quicker, bigger is hastening our demise as a planet, and that’s just the kind of upbeat conversation that I have in the pub when trying to lift the mood after England’s semi-final defeat to USA. (*Sips tea, cries.*)
JUL7	So the Philistines were not that philistine after all...	‘Oh my gawd!” a none-too-bright old schoolmate was fond of exclaiming if you said, for instance, that you didn’t like Merchant Ivory films. “You are SUCH a palestine!” He meant “philistine”, of course, and we all sniggered at him. But now it turns out, three decades on, that he is semi-vindicated. Whatever it was he did mean, it wasn’t philistine. As Satan, Judas Iscariot and Potiphar’s wife will testify, once you’ve got a bad press in the Bible it tends to stick. But far from being culturally challenged dunderheads well deserving of a good smiting with the jawbone of an ass, the historical Philistines were – the experts say – “great traders, master builders and one of the most civilised peoples of their time”.
JUL7	Once it was lonely being a female football fanatic. Not any more	On Tuesday night, England played the USA in the semi-final of the Women’s World Cup. BBC viewing figures showed that it was the most-watched TV programme this year, with a peak of 11.7 million people tuning in, far more than Britain’s Got Talent. Another 1.7 million watched online. What I love most about this is the normalisation of the women’s game, the normalisation of women reporting and commentating on it, the normalisation of men watching it. Of course there have been those dark corners of Football Twitter where the dinosaurs and losers huddle together for warmth, making jokes about women getting back into the kitchen. The ones who are still stuck in the 1960s. Let’s rewind right back to there. When I was in my teens, the manager of West Ham United, Ron Greenwood, was friendly with my parents. He knew I liked football (I kept quiet about my love of Spurs so as not to cause offence), and was a source of tickets for matches at Upton Park. One Saturday the whole family was invited. My father was whisked off to the boardroom, while my mother and I were ushered into the purdah of the ladies’ lounge with the players’ and directors’ wives. They might as well have shut us away in a drawer out of sight.
JUL7	Britain’s story of empire is based on myth. We need to know the truth	These days we’ve become wearily accustomed to depictions of Brexit Britain as oppressed by a villainously imperial Europe. Annexed “without permission”, Nigel Farage claimed melodramatically, defending Brexit party MEPs against charges of “disrespecting” the European Parliament. In a particularly far-fetched comparison, Ann Widdecombe MEP has compared Brexit with the resistance of “slaves against their owners” and “colonies against empires”. Prime ministerial frontrunner Boris Johnson too has spoken of Britain’s supposed “colony status” in the EU though, with a familiar double standard, he also believes that it would be good if Britain was still “in charge” of Africa. These bizarre comparisons can be made and go unchallenged because the stark fact remains that most Britons know very little about the history of the empire itself, still less the way in which its long afterlife profoundly shapes both Britain and the wider world today.
JUL7	Ann Widdecombe’s political exhumation adds insult to ignorance in Strasbourg	Wondering vaguely where we’ll be in six months’ time, I find myself imagining a scene. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg is doing a live piece to camera from Downing Street, when an upper window of No 10 opens behind her. As she speaks, bin bags full of Boris Johnson’s clothes begin to be thrown from it, punctuated by various high-pitched reflections on his character. Like I say, it’s just a fictional vignette, set 10 minutes into a dystopian future. But would you honestly rule it out? Just over a fortnight before the money shot of the Tory leadership contest, very little seems impossible in our increasingly trashy country. After all, this is a week in which England – and it is always England – has once again been embarrassed by the behaviour of travelling fans. Fans of Nigel Farage, in this case, with the spectacle of his Brexit party MEPs turning their backs on a live performance of the European anthem at the opening of the new European parliament session in Strasbourg. We have seen it so many times before, of course – this pack mentality, this unprovoked loutishness, this excruciatingly entitled sense that it is acceptable, even imperative, to colonise a public space and behave absurdly rudely in it.
JUL7	Donald Trump wants to be a dictator. It’s not enough just to laugh at him	Maybe we’re too busy laughing to see it. Perhaps it’s the jokes and memes that Donald Trump generates in abundance, the gift that keeps on giving, that blinds us to a chilling fact that we’d rather not face. Put simply, the leader of the world’s most powerful nation is behaving like an authoritarian dictator, one who threatens democracy in his own country and far beyond. Here’s the latest example of how the comedy can distract. On Thursday Donald Trump marked the Fourth of July by praising the US military, invoking the heroism of an army that defeated the British in the 18th century in part because “it took over the airports”. Lol: behold, the ignoramus president. Cue more chuckles as Trump delivered that speech during a downpour, the Almighty himself apparently deciding to rain on Trump’s parade.
JUL7	Very heterosexual couples and 18th-century airports: it's 4 July, Trump-style	I cannot wait, as a global citizen and (for obvious reasons) constant consumer of news, for independence from Donald Trump. I will be celebrating every single day. Many of us will. And if you needed another reason (I anticipate that you do not), Trump’s latest boneheaded episode was to give an Independence Day speech that referenced American takeover of airports in 1775. The first ever flight is thought to have taken place in 1903. Trump, becoming the first US president to make a 4 July address in almost 70 years, stuck to his script for once. It’s just that the script was mostly wrong. As well as confusing the American revolutionary war (AKA the war of independence) with the war of 1812, Trump went on to make further historical errors. There was plenty more going on throughout the celebrations – let’s take a look.
JUL7	Labour’s fight against antisemitism must be far more radical	The Labour party owes the Jewish community an unqualified apology. But that is only a starting point in rebuilding the trust that has been shattered. A few months ago, I joined hundreds of other non-Jewish Labour party members in signing up as an affiliated member of the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM). Instead of Jewish members leaving Labour, Labour members joined the Jewish community.
JUL8	Want to know what a Boris Johnson government would look like? I have just the book	Seven years ago, a group of Conservative MPs who had taken their parliamentary seats in 2010 brought out a slim manifesto for the future of Britain titled Britannia Unchained. Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Liz Truss appeared to speak with one voice: that of unabashed Thatcherites, convinced that hacking back tax and regulation and fixating on the demands of “business” was as appropriate for the 21st-century UK as it supposedly had been for the crisis-plagued Britain of the 1970s. Some of the text was so provocative that it read like trolling. “The British are among the worst idlers in the world,” read one passage. “We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.” To even start to compete with the rising economies of India, China and Brazil, said the authors, we need to avenge the “dependency culture” and “stop indulging in irrelevant debates about sharing the pie between manufacturing and services, the north and the south, women and men”. They advised fellow Conservatives to double down on austerity, and maintain their faith in old-fashioned laissez-faire economics.
JUL8	Cori Gauff is an inspiration – like teenagers everywhere	At Wimbledon, 15-year-old Cori Gauff, in her first grand slam match, dismisses her role model, Venus Williams. Then she pulls off an astonishing comeback against Polona Hercog. Another 15-year-old, Alex Mann, wows Glastonbury with his star turn, plucked from the crowds by rapper Dave. And, of course, Greta Thunberg, still just 16, continues in her astonishing quest to push the climate crisis to the top of all our agendas, this week squaring up to Opec chiefs, who branded her campaign the “greatest threat” to the oil industry. Teens are definitely having a moment. We adults can fall into the trap of being too judgmental, forgetting it’s teenagers' “job” to make our lives difficult
JUL8	Iran didn’t ask for this crisis, but it won’t stand for Trump’s bullying	In May 2018, the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was designed to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and had been agreed on after 12 years of exhaustive negotiations. The US began to impose new economic and political sanctions, targeting not just various sectors of the Iranian economy, but the state’s most influential entities and actors. The imposition of these sanctions has virtually killed off the possibility of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and will have political consequences for not just Iran and the US, but the whole region. The current situation is extremely fraught, with Iran responding to aggressive actions by increasing its level of uranium enrichment.
JUL8	We’re told that too much screen time hurts our kids. Where’s the evidence?	If you had attended the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ international congress in London last week you could have been forgiven for coming away with the following thoughts. Addiction to Fortnite, the online game, is a real disorder; social media is depleting “our neurotransmitter deposits”; and “excess screen time has reduced our attention span to eight seconds, one less than that of a goldfish”. Scary stuff! Only problem is, none of these claims is supported by facts or a drop of scientific evidence.
JUL8	Jeremy Hunt was meant to be the competent one. But a messy campaign did for him	‘Vote early and vote often” is such a tired joke in political circles that perhaps Jeremy Hunt felt he had to invent his own. Instead of telling Conservative members to rush back to the postbox with their ballots this weekend, the Tory leadership contender has been asking them to take a week or so to consider their decision. His “vote slowly” slogan is “try before you buy”: if Tory members want to see what he’d be like as prime minister, then they should wait to watch this week’s TV debates. It’s a lot of faith to put in just two television programmes, especially given the latest polling shows Boris Johnson to have a commanding lead over Hunt. But it’s also in keeping with Hunt’s main strategy throughout this campaign, which is to say yes to every single media bid, in order to get as much exposure as possible. Johnson, he claims, is dodging scrutiny by operating a “submarine campaign”. And yet all the TV interviews and newspaper profiles don’t seem to be working. What’s to say that this week’s programmes will change all of that?
JUL8	They’ve got Ivanka, we’ve got Stanley Johnson. When did politics become a family affair?	In the debate over Trump and Johnson, as to which man constitutes the more severe national embarrassment, the entry of Ivanka on to the world stage arguably gives the US monster an edge. For their achievements in lying, racism, conceit, incompetence, rudeness, jingoism, greed, crotch-length ties, laziness, fiscal opacity, diplomatic offences, hair choices, sexual incontinence and infantile fantasies featuring bridges, walls and tanks, the men are surely – taking into account that Johnson has yet to enjoy the enhanced misconduct opportunities that come with national leadership – well matched.
JUL8	Here’s how to make the media fit for modern Britain	The Britain of 2019 is very different from the Britain of 1964, the year I started my journalistic career. Among the most obvious changes are those of social class and ethnicity. A country in which the largest social group was both working class and white has been transformed. Naturally enough, these developments have affected the makeup of our media, but in different ways. Journalism has become an almost uniformly middle-class trade in which entrants are usually expected to have enjoyed a degree-level education. By contrast, running counter to the rise in the BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) population, media recruitment has not kept pace with that increase. It is assumed that the lack of working class and BAME media representation distorts output. I concede it may be unproven, or possibly unprovable, but I am convinced it is so. In their heyday, popular newspapers, which were overwhelmingly staffed by white working-class journalists, reflected the concerns and, yes, the prejudices, of the communities from which they sprang.
JUL8	Whatever we call them, wherever they are, detention centres are a disgrace	They are held in wire cages, with standing room only, sometimes for months. Adults have to wear the same clothes for weeks. Children have no washing facilities and sleep on bare concrete floors. Babies are fed from the same unwashed bottle for days. Children as young as four months are separated from their parents. Some are never reunited. The detention centres to hold undocumented migrants on America’s southern border are a moral abomination. But are they “concentration camps”?
JUL8	Behold, the new nanny-free state. Cheap pop for all and no one to say it’s bad for us	We are all children sometimes, desperate to ignore the fact that what we want is not always what we need. Our adult selves retain a fascination with excess, falling off the wagons of healthy eating and safe units of alcohol and 10,000 steps a day with – for some – too great a frequency for comfort. Weight-loss programmes falter not because we can’t educate our palates to enjoy grilled salmon and steamed green beans, but because sometimes – out of tiredness, or boredom, or excitement – we just really want a biscuit. I write as a woman who last week went to the very back of the kitchen cupboard in search of a small box of chocolate truffles I remembered having been given for Christmas. Reader, they turned out to be miniature bath bombs. It was a heartbreaking moment.
JUL8	When ‘respectable’ conservatives bow to the far right it’s always disastrous	The far right does not seize power. It is invited in to power by mainstream conservatives, who boast of their commitment to free societies. They do it for partisan gain. They do it because they hate and fear the left more than they hate and fear the far right. But most of all they do it because they have run out of ideas.

JUL9	The embassy leak will damage far more than the special relationship	Under the Vienna convention the diplomatic bag is inviolable. That’s because states have long accepted that ambassadors need to be able to report home in frank terms without the prying eyes of the host nation reading what they write. The principle still applies, even though sealing wax and Queen’s messengers have been replaced by encrypted emails. But all the effort to keep diplomatic communications secure counts for nothing if they are leaked by the home side. The scandal surrounding the reporting from British ambassador Kim Darroch in Washington is not that he was sending home his unvarnished analysis: that’s what good ambassadors have done for centuries. It’s that someone inside the British system deliberately amassed a stash of his assessments, then chose the moment of maximum impact to leak it. This was not a spontaneous decision to make public a single document: it required premeditation and therefore an agenda. Can it be a coincidence that the material appeared in the middle of the Conservative party’s leadership election?
JUL9	Not washing your clothes is fine, Stella – if you’re beautiful	Stella McCartney doesn’t dry-clean her clothes. Nor does she wash her clothes. I’ve really drilled into this to find out what she does when her clothes are dirty. “The rule on a bespoke suit is you do not clean it. You do not touch it. You let the dirt dry and you brush it off. Basically, in life, rule of thumb: if you don’t absolutely have to clean anything, don’t clean it.” There is, in the intersection of beauty, fashion, feminism and sustainability, a subtle variant to the concept of the humblebrag: ideas that sound woke but which only work if you’re an incredibly beautiful person with incredibly expensive clothes. Don’t wear makeup; don’t throw anything away; throw away all face creams and merely splash yourself in vinegar; don’t go to the dry-cleaner. It reached its apex with a suggestion from Vivienne Westwood that you never had to buy a new T-shirt, you should merely print out a slogan or photograph and affix it with a safety pin to your existing T-shirt. And all these ideas work magnificently well on a model, but miss the point of adornment, which is to distract people from what you actually look like, not bloody draw attention to it.
JUL9	The three mistakes behind Syriza’s demise in Greece	In January 2015, Alexis Tspiras stormed to power as a firebrand of the radical left. He vowed to wage war against the Greek oligarchy, stand up to the EU technocracy and strike fear into the hearts of investors around the world. “Greece leaves behind catastrophic austerity, it leaves behind fear and authoritarianism, it leaves behind five years of humiliation and anguish,” he proclaimed to a throng of supporters on election day in 2015.
JUL9	Farewell Kate Hoey, the wild Brexiteer who never let the facts get in the way	So long, Kate Hoey! It’s been a blast. In the way that being hit by shrapnel might be. Labour’s MP for Vauxhall has (finally) announced she will not stand as a candidate for the party in the next election. Hoey is an ardent Brexiteer and has voted consistently with the government on Europe. Vauxhall constituents voted almost 78% remain. Thank you for the memories, Kate. We will do our best to forget them. I do feel that with the name Hoey it isn’t particularly prudent to put yourself about a lot, but she made a hobby of hanging out in random parties. She especially liked socialising with Nigel Farage (“I really don’t think Nigel Farage is a racist,” she has said of a man who literally once blamed traffic on immigrants). Perhaps the nadir was when she joined him on that infamous Brexit flotilla – which at the time I thought was the most absurd thing we would ever see in British politics, but which since seems the equivalent of looking through a pinhole camera, ie we actually only glimpsed a snippet of the full, damaging fury of it all.
JUL9	I ran a bookies for 12 years – they deserve no sympathy for these store closures	Since the introduction of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in 2001, UK bookmakers have contributed towards increasing social degradation in our communities. I’ve seen it happen during my 12 years as a bookmaker branch manager. Gambling has always been a vice for people with either enough disposable income that only the winning counts – or for those drawn in by the promise of quick financial gain. But there is something sinister about FOBTs, in that they have increased access to quick winnings or losses on the high street, creating an environment more like a miniature casino. More training time was given to the launch of a new FOBT product than to social responsibility awareness
JUL9	Want to know what a Boris Johnson government would look like? I have just the book	Seven years ago, a group of Conservative MPs who had taken their parliamentary seats in 2010 brought out a slim manifesto for the future of Britain titled Britannia Unchained.

They advised fellow Conservatives to double down on austerity, and maintain their faith in old-fashioned laissez-faire economics.
JUL9	How can Kim Darroch represent Britain in Trump’s Washington now?	Uniquely dysfunctional, incompetent, unpredictable, faction-riven, diplomatically clumsy, inept. That is Donald Trump’s Washington according to Britain’s ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch. Or is it perhaps Theresa May’s London according to the US’s ambassador to London, Woody Johnson? The difference is that we know the first, but not the second. Leak inquiries, like that now ordered into the Darroch memorandum, are Whitehall’s most fatuous blood sport. They seldom find culprits and serve merely to magnify the original embarrassment. Usually the damage has been done. Diplomacy is about appearances and not much else. It is hard to see how Darroch can continue to lobby effectively on Britain’s behalf in Trump’s Washington – not least for highly implausible trade concessions post-Brexit.
JUL9	No wonder UK universities are failing on racism – most don’t value diversity at all	A frequent complaint levelled at universities is that they are ivory towers disconnected from the challenges of day-to-day life. For a particular constituency within those respected walls – black and minority ethnic (BME) students and staff – it’s a label that is no doubt more than a little ironic. White men continue to hold the majority of senior positions within universities. What is a more apt encapsulation of the stubborn resolve to maintain the status quo than the phallic symbol of an ivory tower?
JUL9	Amazon is 25 – let’s burst its birthday balloon	As any hormonal Catholic teenage boy knows, it’s perfectly possible to believe something is a grievous sin and yet repeatedly, almost compulsively, do it anyway. Almost 90% of the UK population should know the feeling, with the main difference that any guilt is more justly deserved. That’s how many of us knowingly and willingly buy from a company that has a terrible record on employee terms and working conditions, avoids paying tax as much as possible and shares responsibility for boarded-up shops in decimated high streets across the country. That company, Amazon, is 25 years old. I’m not sorry for pooping its party. Nor will Amazon be worried about the dearth of warm birthday wishes. It’s always the winner in its year-round game of pass the parcel and every day it gets a bigger and bigger slice of the world’s wealth cake.
JUL9	In Somalia, the climate emergency is already here. The world cannot ignore it	The climate emergency is wreaking havoc across the world, and it is the poorest countries that bear the brunt of the crisis. In Somalia, where I am acting country director for the aid agency Islamic Relief, the population is currently experiencing a drought that could threatenthe lives or livelihoods of more than two million people by the end of the summer, according to the UN. The climate has been wreaking havoc on Somalia’s seasons. Ordinarily there are four: the main rainy season between April and June (gu), the second rainy season between October and December (deyr), and the dry seasons that follow each of them. Two-thirds of the country’s population live in rural areas and are completely dependent on the rains for their crops and livestock. Last year, these people were set back when the deyr season produced less rain than usual. And again this year the gu rains almost failed, eventually arriving in tiny pockets of the country too little, too late. This has led to widespread crop failure, and a decline in livestock production, rapidly pushing communities in the worst-affected areas into food insecurity.
JUL10	Boris Johnson shows he'll be most ill-qualified PM of modern times	Tuesday night’s televised debate on ITV between Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson is the only chance the public will get to see the two candidates to succeed Theresa May argue their points head-to-head. But it won’t change anything. It had been delayed, by Johnson’s team, until the ballot papers had already gone out and in many cases already been filled in. There is plenty of evidence that the 160,000 Conservative members – a tiny proportion of the whole UK electorate – have long ago decided to put Johnson in No 10; some of them joined the party specifically for that purpose. 
JUL10	Britain is heading for a general election reboot, but it’s not going to fix Brexit	Have you tried turning it off and on again? The technique that IT engineers always advise for reviving an unresponsive computer might soon be applied to the problem of impasse in Westminster. In constitutional terms, that means an election. Few MPs like the idea, and none are sure what the trigger might be. But most struggle to imagine things carrying on much longer in the current deadlocked parliament. The next Tory leader (let’s roll with the polling and presume it is Boris Johnson) will not have a reliable majority on any matter of substance. If he tries to pursue a no-deal Brexit, he could lose a confidence vote.
JUL10	Labour urgently needs an independent process to root out antisemitism	The ugliness of the Labour party resorting to the tactics of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), akin to those seeking to cover up wrongdoing in big business, or sexual harassment by the powerful, is the stark new element in this ongoing story. The recent Williamson, Willsman and Campbell cases demonstrate that the party’s disciplinary process is shot to pieces
JUL10	The secret of a happy summer with your children? Know when to cave in	Yesterday was a good day. I caved on the Gatorade (one blue, one red, when really, they should have shared a single bottle), but held the line on the Skittles. After the park, we went for pizza at the usual place and I stayed firm on water at the table – no fruit punch, in spite of my deal with the waitress to secretly dilute it. And then this small triumph: ice-cream from the van on the way home, yes. But two bites in, when one of them changed her mind about which ice-cream she wanted and the other, predictably, dropped hers on the ground and wanted a replacement – Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen! – I did not give way.
JUL10	Don’t blame senior doctors. The NHS pensions standoff is politicians’ fault	Everyone loves to hate a fat cat. And so, in 2016, when former chancellor George Osborne decided to reduce pension tax relief for very high earners, he must have thought he was on to a sure thing. After all, with a UK average household income of only £26,000, who would ever complain about the fate of people so indecently well paid they could afford to set aside up to £40,000 a year in pension contributions? Three years on, Osborne’s slam-dunk strategy for bolstering the exchequer’s coffers is wreaking havoc on the NHS. Something as arcane and tedious as pension tax law is threatening to increase waiting lists, lengthen delays in starting cancer treatment and endanger the lives of NHS patients.
JUL10	Planting trees can help save the planet – but only if governments put people first	A new study extols the “mindblowing” potential of widespread tree planting as a solution to climate breakdown. The scientists claim that 1bn hectares of treeless land could be forested – an area equivalent to the size of the US – and the study’s authors say restoration of such areas could remove two-thirds (205 gigatonnes) of all the carbon dioxide emissions pumped into the atmosphere by human activities since the 1800s. A number of organisations and scientists are investigating these nature-based climate solutions. While studies show different levels of ambition and potential, all are clear that carefully restored ecosystems can help solve three interlinked crises: the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and poverty. For climate, the most urgent priority to meet the goal of keeping global heating below 1.5C is decarbonising the economy, but restoring our forests, grasslands and wetlands, plus enhancing soil health, could provide part of the solution to the climate crisis. Land restoration and stewardship can both help stabilise the Earth’s climate by storing carbon, and provide ecosystems critical for wildlife – forests, mangroves, wetlands and coral reefs. This can also benefit local communities, particularly in emerging regions of the global south least responsible for this crisis and already suffering most severely from the impacts.
JUL10	I didn’t ring a bell at the end of my cancer treatment. But I get those who do	No one offered me the chance to ring a bell on the final day of my cancer treatment, but if they had, I’d have declined. All I wanted to do, after three operations and six weeks of radiotherapy, was walk out of that hospital door and head off up the street to the life I’d had on hold and even, at times, felt might be in the balance. Now I had it back, my sole ambition was to return to what I’d had, as unobtrusively as possible. You have to find a way to cope; and since we’re all different, each of us finds our own way of doing that
JUL10	Casual racism is a fact of life for international students – they deserve better	“The international students never mingle.” “Their English is terrible.” “I hate walking behind international students because they walk so slow.” These are just a few of the phrases I’ve heard while I have been at university. I was surprised by the amount of subtle racism I encountered when I arrived three years ago to a place that I thought was going to be liberal, inclusive and universal. Yet racism towards international students is rarely acknowledged. As a British-Chinese person at university, I quickly realised that people always assumed me to be an international student, even though I grew up in Rugby, Warwickshire.
JUL10	A mental health diagnosis is only a start. It can never tell a patient's story	Who decides whether you’re clinically depressed or anxious, suffering from schizophrenia or living with a trauma-related disorder? In the UK, GPs diagnose milder forms of depression and anxiety but psychiatrists make the call when it comes to more severe and protracted forms of mental ill health. In the US, the handbook that sets out the criteria for diagnosis is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, now in its fifth incarnation (DSM-5). In Europe, the broadly similar WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is more commonly used. But a new study from the University of Liverpool has analysed five key chapters of the DSM-5 on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive, anxiety and trauma-related disorders and found so much scope for variation that the authors question whether diagnosing distinct mental health disorders such as schizophrenia is valid or helpful at all.
JUL10	In jumping in with Boris Johnson, even moderate Tories have lost all credibility	Look how they do it. The Tory party, its fellow travellers, its mighty backers, all with a deep financial interest in keeping Conservatives in power, gather round as their new leader emerges from that tiny group of elderly white male selectors. See the wagons circling. Forget any alarm they ever expressed about a Boris Johnson prime ministership. Come the day, watch them pay homage to their latest protector from the red peril. Even though none, not one, during the referendum mentioned the remotest possibility of a no-deal Brexit, almost all the Tory tribe are ready to pretend this is now the true “will of the people”, singing in blue harmony. Any doubters are whipped in by the great British press foghorn – 80% Tory-backing.
JUL11	Kim Darroch has resigned. Now Britain risks becoming a vassal of the US	The chief of Britain’s Foreign Office does nothing casually. He is a past master at saying nothing unintended in public. So when the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald, went before MPs this lunchtime after the devastating resignation of Britain’s Washington ambassador, Kim Darroch, his incisive directness was a revelation. It was the most eloquent evidence possible that the Darroch affair is not just a diplomatic storm but an existential challenge to Britain’s entire foreign policy. What precedent was there, the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat asked McDonald straight off, for the head of state of a friendly government to do what Donald Trump has done this week and make it impossible for Britain’s senior representative in that country to do his job? McDonald’s answer was monosyllabic, crisp and explosive. “None,” he said.
JUL11	My partner, Lyra Mckee, would be overjoyed about the same-sex marriage bill	It won’t always be like this. It’s going to get better.” My incredible partner, Lyra McKee, wrote these words years before we crossed paths. I remember reading her “letter to my 14-year-old-self” and being blown away by her bravery. Lyra opened up about the deep hurt so many of us felt as teenagers, and showed that families can be incredibly loving, supportive and accepting; particularly important in a place like Northern Ireland, where religious divides and conservatism still play a huge role. Lyra was terrified, anxious and, in a weird way, lucky. She knew her mind from a young age, was surrounded by friends from her area, who mostly turned out to be LGBT+ themselves, and had a family for whom her sexuality was not an issue. Some of us (me) take a lot longer to realise their true self. When Lyra wrote her letter in 2014, the idea of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland was almost preposterous.
JUL11	John Major’s threat to take Boris Johnson to court is a true act of public service	Twenty six years after he was caught by a hot mic denouncing the Eurosceptic “bastards” in his own cabinet, John Major has proved that he has not lost his knack for making news – and this time he very much knew the microphone was on. The former Tory prime minister told the Today programme that any move to “prorogue”, or suspend, parliament in order to drive through a no-deal crash-out from the European Union – a move Boris Johnson has pointedly refused to rule out – would be “completely and utterly against parliamentary tradition”, adding that “I, for one, would be prepared to go and seek judicial review to prevent parliament being bypassed.” In other words, a former Tory PM just threatened to take the next Tory PM to court to stop a no-deal Brexit.
JUL11	The tyranny of the schoolgirl skirt still haunts me	With “gender reveals” – ostentatious events to announce the sex of an unborn baby with a burst of pink or blue – becoming increasingly popular while, at the same time, unisex clothing is on the rise on the high street, it is difficult to tell how far we have got in terms of dismantling the gender binary. This week, it feels as if we may be making gains: by September, new statutory guidance will make school uniforms in Wales gender-neutral, meaning that items such as trousers, for example, will not be described as “for boys”. Gender-specific school uniforms are one of the earliest, most tangible ways in which gender inequality is entrenched. There is a reason girls are permitted to wear shorts for PE – skirts and summer dresses inhibit young girls in the playground and restrict their freedom to play in the same way as their male peers. It is an unconscious marker of limitation: if you climb the monkey bars in these clothes, you’ll flash your knickers to the class – so don’t climb them.
JUL11	Where is the outrage about the Tory party’s Islamophobia?	What Tory members think matters. Their party is in government. They select parliamentary candidates who go on to vote on legislation and become ministers, and they exert pressure on them through local Conservative associations. They are now electing the nation’s prime minister. So when evidence of racism is uncovered among their ranks, it should be regarded as a national scandal. Recent polls  conducted for Hope Not Hate by YouGov – which has a solid record when looking at party members – is horrifying. It found that 60% of Tory members believe Islam “is generally a threat to western civilisation”, with less than one in five dissenting; that 54% hold it to be “generally a threat to the British way of life”; and 43% do not want a Muslim as prime minister. Two-thirds believe the lie that parts of Britain are under sharia law; another 45% believe in the racist nonsense that there are no-go areas for non-Muslims; and 40% want to limit Britain’s Muslim population. Among the most chilling findings was that 42% believe “having people from a wide variety of racial and cultural backgrounds” has damaged British society, with just 39% dissenting.
JUL11	Workplace flexibility has its limits – bend too far and something breaks	Now that the election has been won, suddenly employer groups and the government are talking up the need for industrial relations “reform”. It is a push that, inevitably, is for more flexibility. But as the latest annual data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on labour force participation, mobility and job search reveals, this increased flexibility is a major driver of the current historically high levels of underemployment and the associated low wages growth. One of the things that is often forgotten amid the monthly unemployment rates is that, for the most part, people who are in work stay in work, and also mostly stay working at the same place. In the 12 months to February this year, fewer than 10% of all people employed changed employers – well below the record highs of the late 1980s, early 1990s:
JUL11	We need to redefine what ‘working class’ really means	What makes a person working-class? Being northern? Working in a factory? Being a plumber? Being white? Voting Brexit? If you watch TV or read a newspaper you will probably think all of the above. Unless you’re actually working-class, that is. From David Dimbleby declaring on the night of the EU referendum result that working-class votes were the decisive factor in the Brexit referendum (wrong) to TV dramas depicting the lazy and criminal, the mythology built about working-class people is wide-ranging and often damaging. This is important, because if we see class as purely about culture, we ignore the role of the economy, the state or community. New research on low-income Londoners from the Centre for Labour and Social Studies and the Runnymede Trust found that while just over half identified as working class, almost all shared what could be described as a working-class experience. On the negative side, this included feelings of being “dehumanised” by impersonal public services and excluded by gentrification. Social mobility didn’t work for many in a system rigged for privilege. However, there are signs of community-led solidarity.
JUL11	Individuals can’t solve the climate crisis. Governments need to step up	From climate change to child labour, the responsibility for solving major societal problems is increasingly being shifted to the individual. People feel in order to save the world they have to be “good”. Yet that is bad – because it paralyses change. Global challenges must be tackled by institutions. That’s why the UK’s Committee on Climate Change was absolutely right to criticise the government in the strongest terms today for failing to take more action against the climate crisis.  Personal sacrifice alone cannot be the solution to tackling the climate crisis. There’s no other area in which the individual is held so responsible for what’s going wrong. And it’s true: people drive too much, eat too much meat, and fly too often.
JUL11	It's not just tennis players – grunters are everywhere. And they're not to be trusted	When the umpire at Wimbledon calls out “quiet, please”, a religious hush falls over the court. The only things that break the silence are the gentle pop of a bouncing tennis ball, the faint murmur of the crowd, and the passionate grunting of the players. Grunting is a strange quirk of professional tennis, but it’s also quite common among the rest of us. Visit your local gym and you will find people groaning during their workout. Many have shared an office with a person who groans as they hammer away at their keyboard. One friend complained about how her husband would grunt as he struggled with boxes she would lift in silence. Perhaps the strangest story I heard was about archaeologists who would habitually grunt in the midst of over-enthusiastic soil clearing.
JUL11	Ethnic diversity makes Britain’s culture great. It would be a disaster if we lost it	A couple of weeks ago, a young black man from south London stood up in front of tens of thousands of people and delivered one of the most celebrated performances in the history of Glastonbury. A few days later, an England cricket squad – almost half of whom were born abroad or are from an ethnic minority background – made it into the semi-finals of the World Cup. Meanwhile over at Tate Modern, a British artist of Nigerian origin is displaying an artwork made up of thousands of books imprinted with the names of migrants who have made significant contributions to British culture. Today, some of our most brilliant prospects in art and culture are from minority ethnic or migrant backgrounds. We present a gloriously multicultural face to the world. And that is important not just for the story we tell to others, but for the stories we tell ourselves. Think of the cultural power of the first Asian families on EastEnders, the breakthrough of Soul II Soul in the 1980s, or the nation-defining literary output of Zadie Smith.
JUL12	Trump created a storm over Kim Darroch. Boris Johnson will bring a hurricane	Imagine chaos. Dream disruption. Think of a hundred Kim Darrochs as the Boris Johnson moment approaches. Tear up the script. Shout “no deal”. Laugh with Johnson, cry with him. Welcome to anarchy hall. Even as a stubborn Eurosceptic, I can see no conceivable benefit in Britain leaving Europe’s economic area on 31 October, least of all without any sort of customs deal. For a nation to initiate controls on border movement and trade with its adjacent continent is mindless self-harm, in this case driven by populist machismo. Yet that is what both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have agreed to countenance after this week’s leadership debate.
JUL12	Parliamentarians shouldn’t need CCTV in Westminster ‘groping hotspots’ to behave	Perhaps until this week, you’d forgotten that Westminster has been plagued by questions about its working culture. It would be understandable: between Brexit, Trump and the implosion of the Labour party, it takes something exceptional for news editors to care again about gropy MPs or bullying lords (“It’s too much of a 2017 story,” an editor friend sighed to me about a harassment case her boss chose not to cover). This week, two more major reports about harassment in Westminster have been published: one by Naomi Ellenbogen QC into bullying and harassment of House of Lords’ staff, the other by Gemma White QC into that of MPs’ staff. Perhaps some of the content will still shock you: 20% of Lords staff have been bullied in the past year, before you even add sexual harassment into the stat; MPs’ staff repeatedly use the word “career suicide” when discussing why they don’t make complaints. But to those of us who have made complaints, it is all too familiar.
JUL12	I know from painful experience how poisonous the debate around obesity is	The debate around obesity has been rekindled recently following proclamations by Tory leadership candidates, but many commentators who speak on the subject seem to have no sensitivity to how the language or imagery they use fuels hurtful perceptions that obese people are lazy, inhuman or a burden. The mass of statistics being thrown around dehumanises individuals, many of whom already know what to do and are trying their best to do it. Should foods with high sugar content be taxed more? Boris Johnson, who looks certain to be our next prime minister, doesn’t seem to think so. And he has boldly called for a review (even though there is already one under way). 
JUL12	A progressive, united Ireland seems more likely than ever – thanks to the DUP	It’s an odd time for the DUP. Having spent the past two years backing the government on a Brexit that a majority of Northern Irish citizens voted against, it now finds support for Irish reunification at its highest ever level in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and, crucially, among their supposed ideological fellow-travellers in the Conservative party. More pressingly still, MPs this week voted to extend crucial human rights to Northern Ireland, direct from Westminster, paving the way for the decriminalisation of abortion and the implementation of marriage equality, in line with the rest of the UK. How did a party as frothingly opposed to liberal social change as it is to Irish reunification end up presiding over a reality in which both are more likely than they have been in decades?
JUL12	Goats get emotional? Humans shouldn't be surprised – all mammals are amazing	Wicksteed Park in Kettering is not known for its miracles, but on that day, it was if a holy statue was weeping blood. Within minutes of the incredible event beginning, a great crowd coalesced. The elderly and infirm got out of their chairs. Children were put on shoulders. There were gasps. There was awe. I can tell you what happened but you may prefer to sit down first. Because two weeks ago, almost to the day, a goat in this small-town theme park climbed a tree in its enclosure. “But … goats can’t climb trees,” came the murmurs from the crowd. “What is it doing?” they asked, with confused astonishment. I watched with great delight. These people clearly had an idea of what a goat is and what a goat does and were being met with a new reality where goats could also happily climb trees, a behaviour goats regularly employ in the wild to find the juiciest leaves. To the people of Kettering, who were not aware of tree-climbing goats, it was as if they were looking at a flying monkey. I was reminded of this incredible scene when hearing of this week’s news that goats have been shown capable of distinguishing emotions in one another’s bleating calls. If you haven’t yet heard, it’s a neatly designed experiment. Researchers recorded goat calls when goats were at their happiest (feeding and being reunited with other goats) and recorded calls when goats were at their most fraught (watching others eat but having to go without food temporarily). They then played back these calls to other goats, to see if happy or sad goat sounds caused physiological responses in the listening goat, specifically by measuring the listener’s heart-rates. And, hey presto, the results proved the link. When listening to happy calls, for instance, a goat’s heart-rate increases with apparent excitement. Not only can it climb trees, a goat can listen and learn about its surroundings by tuning into the bleating of other goats.
JUL12	I'm supposed to be a mentor but I am jealous of his perfect chakras	My colleague Michael Safi was finishing his stint as the Guardian’s India correspondent, having covered the world’s biggest election, the Sri Lankan mosque attacks, the Delhi climate emergency and the plight of members of the country’s lowest caste – the Dalits. Yet in his three years as south Asia correspondent, he had never discovered his dosha.
JUL12	The US-UK 'special relationship' isn't broken – it's just entering a dangerous new phase	The dumpster fires of US and UK politics have converged, and the special relationship is going up in flames. The resignation of Kim Darroch, UK ambassador to the US – and a longtime British civil servant – because of a temper tantrum by Donald Trump is an illustration of the toxic politics of both countries, and the real damage it is doing to the US-UK alliance.
JUL12	For the sake of cinema, Disney needs to be broken up	It’s the kind of commercial supremacy about which Walt Disney and his brother Roy probably fantasised when they founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in 1923: just past the midway mark of 2019, the year’s four top-grossing films in US cinemas are all Disney releases. (The same would apply globally, but for the disruption of Chinese sci-fi blockbuster The Wandering Earth.) The four films in question – Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel, Aladdin and Toy Story 4 – have collectively grossed more than £4.3bn worldwide, with the studio’s noisily hyped remake of The Lion King set to join their ranks and substantially boost that number next week. More money-spinning sequels – Frozen 2, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil – lie in wait for autumn and winter.
JUL12	Labour won’t just end austerity, it will enrich people’s lives	As the Conservative party’s leadership election descends into an ugly no-deal Brexit competition, it is fair to say that there hasn’t been much serious discussion about what the Tories want a post-Brexit Britain to look like. There has been the usual 1980s-style obsession with swingeing tax cuts, and some back-of-a-cigarette-packet attempts to reverse some of the cuts that both of the contenders voted for, but it’s been left to others to talk about the harsh realities faced by millions. A report, There is an Alternative, which was published last week by the IPPR thinktank, brought a welcome blast of cold air to anyone who thought austerity had come to an end, as Theresa May promised it had last year. The authors lay bare the deficit in care, which has terrible consequences for those who need it and their loved ones, who are often having to fill the gap themselves.
JUL12	The BBC’s Panorama set out claims of antisemitism in the Labour party. Our panel responds	Those who Labour’s high command refers to as “outriders” have been out and about on Twitter, busily doing precisely what a memo of “guidance” suggested they should: seeking to counter the BBC Panorama investigation of Labour antisemitism. Most viewers, though, may well have a very different reaction to what they saw on the programme – which was a group of young, committed servants of the Labour party so distressed by what they witnessed being done by the top brass of the party they loved that they were driven to despair, depression and, in the case of the onetime head of disputes, Sam Matthews, contemplation of suicide. Perhaps, at last, Labour party members will find this too much to stomach. Perhaps those who were not moved by the testimony of Jews; who dismissed Jewish anxieties about antisemitism within Labour as lies, as smears, as “mood music”, as attempts to weaken Jeremy Corbyn; who believed Jews, uniquely among ethnic minorities, could not be trusted when pointing out the racism they faced – perhaps those people will listen instead to the voices of the whistleblowers who, showing great courage, spoke to Panorama.
JUL13	Ruining a country near you soon: the beta males who think they’re alphas	If the Tory leadership election unfolds as widely expected, the UK will basically be ruled by a Fathers4Injustice activist. Boris Johnson is the kind of guy who’d don Spider-Man pyjamas and scale a building in order to see less of his kids. Sorry, fewer. Even so, he remains a remarkably typical hero of our political times. “There are two kinds of women,” Harry explains at one point in When Harry Met Sally. “High maintenance and low maintenance.” “Which one am I?” Sally asks. “You’re the worst kind,” he says. “You’re high maintenance, but you think you’re low maintenance.” In many ways, there can be no greater therapist’s case study than Trump
JUL13	The roots of Labour’s antisemitism lie deep within the populist left	In Britain we sometimes imagine that populism lurks in our future or over there, in Donald Trump’s America or Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. Even those who are alarmed by the prospect of populist politics and all it entails take comfort that we’re not there yet, that it’s still some time, or distance, away. But what if that’s wrong? What if it’s already here? If populism is a politics that pits the virtuous mass of ordinary people against a wicked, corrupt elite, then Britain was an early adopter. The leave campaign won in 2016 by suggesting the noble British people had been cheated of their democratic birthright by the evil bureaucrats of Brussels. Now the Brexit party offers textbook populism, railing against an establishment bent on thwarting the “will of the people ?.
JUL13	The angry chef or the Michelin guide: which giant ego are you rooting for?	Marc Veyrat, a French chef and Bob Dylan lookalike (he’s as famous for his Michelin-starred cooking as he is for his wide-rimmed black hat), has been in the news this week. Or rather, to do him justice, he’s gone full-tilt Gordon Ramsay in the news this week. In January, the Michelin Guide demoted his Haute-Savoie restaurant, La Maison des Bois in Manigod. He became, as he put it, the only chef in history to get a third star one year – and lose it the very next. And the six months since have been a living hell. A few weeks ago, he texted – texted! – the French weekly Le Point, saying: “Hello, call me back please, it’s urgent.” And when they did, he proceeded to relay, in great, indeed in operatic detail, quite how awful the fallout has been.
JUL13	Megan Rapinoe’s ‘egotism’ is the perfect antidote to Donald Trump	This week it has been gratifying to watch Americans – specifically, American men – grapple on social media with a concept long cherished by the British as a thing we love to hate. If our characters are organised as much around that which we despise as revere, it is safe to say that the ancient British revulsion for Being Up Oneself is a central force in national life that, until this week, many Americans claimed to find mystifying. And then along came Megan Rapinoe. Traditionally in the United States, being up oneself has been a default attitude practically enshrined in the constitution. As an American, you are obliged to at least pay lip service to the idea that anything is possible, and all that stands between you and your dreams is your own winning hustle. Self-deprecation, that sly old song of Europe, is neither appreciated nor understood. There is no integrity, in the US, in hiding one’s light.
JUL13	The UK must stand up to Trump over Iran	Not for the first time, nor certainly the last, the Gulf is a veritable tinderbox. The immediate reason for the increase in tensions is the Royal Marines’ seizure of an Iranian tanker that was allegedly en route to Syria, in violation of EU sanctions. Rather than defuse the situation, the Tory leadership contender and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was quick to resort to sabre-rattling and a reassertion of British militarism on the high seas. For some Iranians this reawakens bitter memories of the UK’s infamous oil blockade in the early 1950s, culminating in the overthrow of the popular prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh. The very same prime minister who dared to nationalise the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, better known today as BP. In any case, what with seized ships in the Mediterranean and trouble in the Strait of Hormuz there is a danger of missing the wood for the trees in explaining what has brought about this crisis. The nature of Trump’s endgame is anyone’s guess. He most likely has little idea himself
JUL13	Of course Boris Johnson wants a royal yacht. He’s the king of fake-it-till-you-make-it	Boris Johnson has no policies, it appears, beyond tax cuts for the rich and – oh – “optimism”. Act happy. Act big. He wants the Queen to have a great big yacht. At a hustings last night he burbled on about the royal yacht. One of the things that all wings of the Labour party can agree on is that it was a good thing to decommission HMY Britannia in 1997. If the royal family wants a yacht it has more than enough dosh to buy its own. Johnson, of course, doesn’t see it that way. Nor does the newspaper that pays him a quarter of a million pounds a year. The Telegraph has campaigned for a new royal yacht and Johnson has argued in the Commons before about it. It was regretful, he said in 2016, that this was not a priority for Theresa May’s government.
JUL13	Syriza’s defeat shows the left needs a plan to hold on to power, not just win it	The day after Jeremy Corbyn scraped together the parliamentarians’ names he needed to get on the Labour leadership ballot in 2015, he headed off in search of voters. “We didn’t have a campaign. We didn’t have an organisation. We didn’t have any money,” he told me. “All we had was my credit card and that lasted for about a week.” He stood so that at least one candidate would make the argument that Labour should oppose austerity and shift to the left. No one ever expected him to win that argument, least of all him. But as the rallies grew, unions came on board and his polling numbers soared, the implausible started to look inevitable.
JUL13	Britain needs a calm and assured prime minister. It needs Jeremy Hunt	It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Like most Conservatives, I wanted Brexit wrapped up and out of the way under Theresa May’s stewardship, allowing a new leader to begin a new chapter, reinvigorate the party and – at long last – change the subject. So much for that. Far from drawing a line under the unhappy recent history of British politics, the new prime minister will face exactly the same problem as his predecessor. He will also face the same parliamentary maths and apparently, despite the personnel changes in Brussels, the same stance from the EU. The first question on the minds of many Conservative party members as they ponder over their ballot papers, then, will be who is finally going to get Brexit signed, sealed and delivered.
JUL13	Amber Rudd is further proof that the idea of compassionate Tories is a myth	Oh, Amber Rudd, how could you? A paragon of Tory moderation, a solid bulwark against the rampaging Tory right, a torchbearer for Remainia and one nation Toryism – and one of our saviours against the self-inflicted disaster of no deal, now a champion of a hard Brexit. Surely these are malicious rumours: just weeks ago you were described as the “cabinet’s leading pro-European” and were apparently leading the battle against a drunk and disorderly exit from the EU. Sure, you’ve always had your foibles – consistently voting for all Brexit legislation, slashing and decimating public services and the welfare state, deporting refugees – but let he who has not stripped disabled people of benefits cast the first stone.
JUL13	Trump’s summit shows he needs the tech giants as much as they need him	Yesterday, Donald Trump convened a summit at the White House, its remit: “a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today’s online environment”. But of course it was Trump. It was never going to be a dry, sober policy event. Joining him was a constellation of people from the world of the “alt-right”, alternative media and conspiracy theorising.
JUL14	Narcissists and cliques control the main parties and threaten democracy	Party democracy is the enemy of representative democracy. Party democracy stops MPs speaking out against racism and warning of the perils facing their country. Party democracy makes politicians put their members ahead of their constituents. Party democracy makes them flatter coteries of arrogant obsessives. Party democracy is the enemy of conscience and judgment. To borrow a phrase, the party has become the enemy of the people. Who does your MP represent? Who are they frightened of? You and your neighbours? What creaking haycart brought you and the rest of your yokel friends into town? “Control of politics has passed to unelected and irresponsible members,” says the historian Robert Saunders, one of the best analysts of British democracy’s decay. “Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt needs the support of about 70,000-80,000 Tory members to become prime minister. That’s roughly the size of one parliamentary constituency.”
JUL14	So, guys, you reckon you could take a point off Serena Williams?	Let us for a minute extend the benefit of the doubt to the 12% of men who believe they could take a point from Serena Williams in a tennis match, no doubt further emboldened by her defeat in the Wimbledon final. For who can say what manner of fugue state they fell into as they answered a simple polling question? Could they have collectively imagined, as they pictured the holder of 23 grand slam titles shaping up to serve, a freak calamity overtaking her? A sinkhole opening up on her side of the net, perhaps, or a thunderbolt sent by a jealous athletic god; or, in more sinister fashion, a tripwire rigged up by an incel saboteur to fell her as she rushed in for the volley.
JUL14	Johnson failed Kim Darroch abysmally. He doesn’t deserve to choose his replacement	I can think of no previous occasion where an ambassador or, for that matter, a minister has had to resign because he has told the truth, rather than because he has told a lie, in the performance of his public duties. That has been the fate of Kim Darroch. There are three people responsible for the loss to the UK of a hugely competent, professional and honourable public servant. The first person who should hang his or her head in shame is whoever was responsible for the leak in the first place. Whatever the motive, it was a treacherous and indefensible act of disloyalty.
JUL14	How can you accept gay people, but find it distasteful that they have sex?	The number of people believing there is nothing wrong with gay sex has fallen for the first time since the Aids crisis. The British Social Attitudes survey puts it at dipping from 68% in 2017 to 66% in 2018, leaving a third of the population in some way opposed. NatCen, who conducted the survey, said that, while further polling was advisable, “liberalisation of attitudes does seem to be slowing down”. The findings coincide with the first decrease in more than a decade of people comfortable with pre-marital sex. On the plus side, last week also saw the Commons victory for gay legislation in Northern Ireland. Still, what a hammering same-sex couples have had recently – everything from attacks on buses to Ann Widdecombe (the Aunt Lydia of Brexit, anyone?) pondering how science could “produce an answer” to gayness. In this context, is the NatCen survey indicative of new attitudes, or yet more evidence that people are feeling bolder about expressing previously veiled prejudices?
JUL14	Would any woman want to be alone with Robert Foster now?	It was a decision, said Mississippi state representative Robert Foster, made out of “respect for my wife”. The politician and gubernatorial candidate had said that a female journalist, who had interviewed him many times before, would be allowed to spend the day on a campaign trail “ride-along” with him only if she brought along a male chaperone. His own campaign director acknowledged that it was a “weird” thing to ask. The journalist, Mississippi Today’s Larrison Campbell, refused and called it sexist. The ride-along did not happen. The inevitable outrage dissolved into an inevitable liberal left and religious right bunfight. No wonder: everything about this story, bar Campbell’s ability to argue with an articulate conviction that Foster’s decision barely deserved, is terrible. During his many interviews, Foster tried various methods of justifying his refusal to be alone with a professional woman doing her job. (It made me wonder if he has the same stringent policy when it comes to dentists, doctors, plumbers, even. Does he ask for a new cab if it arrives with a female driver? Manufacturers take note: religious extremists may now be an untapped market for driverless vehicles.)
JUL14	Spider-Man is showing our boys that normal guys can be heroes too	Not all superheroes wear capes. But if they come in many guises, what they tend to have in common is a desire to save the world. And that’s what makes the new Spider-Man movie so interesting: here is a superhero who would rather do almost anything else. He has the godlike powers, the suit, the crowds gasping in adoration. He has a monster to fight and (this being a Marvel movie) a standing invitation to join the Avengers, and turn the gig into a full-time job. But what he really wants is to have a life instead. The teenage Peter Parker just wants to hang out in Europe on a school trip, spend time with the girl he awkwardly admires from afar, and be a normal guy doing normal stuff rather than carrying the world on his shoulders.
JUL14	Ruining a country near you soon: the beta males who think they’re alphas	If the Tory leadership election unfolds as widely expected, the UK will basically be ruled by a Fathers4Injustice activist. Boris Johnson is the kind of guy who’d don Spider-Man pyjamas and scale a building in order to see less of his kids. Sorry, fewer. Even so, he remains a remarkably typical hero of our political times. “There are two kinds of women,” Harry explains at one point in When Harry Met Sally. “High maintenance and low maintenance.” “Which one am I?” Sally asks. “You’re the worst kind,” he says. “You’re high maintenance, but you think you’re low maintenance.” In many ways, there can be no greater therapist’s case study than Trump
JUL14	What Love Island teaches us about 'himpathy'	You might be surprised to learn that Love Island is shedding light on contemporary developments in feminist philosophy. You might also be surprised that philosophers are avid watchers of reality television. But the ITV show gives us a unique opportunity to observe the relationships of 20-somethings – from their beginnings to the point where they flourish and, often, break apart. With these glimpses of human behaviour – albeit in the context of a television show – we can get an insight into how many women act, particularly at the end of a relationship.
JUL14	The roots of Labour’s antisemitism lie deep within the populist left	In Britain we sometimes imagine that populism lurks in our future or over there, in Donald Trump’s America or Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. Even those who are alarmed by the prospect of populist politics and all it entails take comfort that we’re not there yet, that it’s still some time, or distance, away. But what if that’s wrong? What if it’s already here? If populism is a politics that pits the virtuous mass of ordinary people against a wicked, corrupt elite, then Britain was an early adopter. The leave campaign won in 2016 by suggesting the noble British people had been cheated of their democratic birthright by the evil bureaucrats of Brussels. Now the Brexit party offers textbook populism, railing against an establishment bent on thwarting the “will of the people ?.
JUL14	The angry chef or the Michelin guide: which giant ego are you rooting for?	Marc Veyrat, a French chef and Bob Dylan lookalike (he’s as famous for his Michelin-starred cooking as he is for his wide-rimmed black hat), has been in the news this week. Or rather, to do him justice, he’s gone full-tilt Gordon Ramsay in the news this week. In January, the Michelin Guide demoted his Haute-Savoie restaurant, La Maison des Bois in Manigod. He became, as he put it, the only chef in history to get a third star one year – and lose it the very next. And the six months since have been a living hell. A few weeks ago, he texted – texted! – the French weekly Le Point, saying: “Hello, call me back please, it’s urgent.” And when they did, he proceeded to relay, in great, indeed in operatic detail, quite how awful the fallout has been.
JUL15	Labour can effect positive change, but not while its internal politics are so toxic	After a long tumble into disgrace and confusion that dates back well over a year, the story playing out at the top of the Labour party increasingly seems to be so dreadful that it defies belief. Jeremy Corbyn is doing a very good impression of someone who would rather be anywhere else. The party’s supposed leap forward on Brexit policy seems to have resulted in a stance not quite as bamboozling as the one it replaced, but it is still surrounded by unanswered questions; the leadership’s dearth of collective energy as the agenda of a Boris Johnson government takes shape is miserable to behold. Obviously, the people at the top have other things on their minds. Woven into everything is the ever-widening story about antisemitism, which now includes signifiers for almost every aspect of the party’s malaise – from the presence in the party of hateful attitudes towards Jewish people, through allegations of the awful treatment of young party staffers by powerful people at the top, to the sense of any sensitivity and seriousness now being drowned out by the familiar sound of belligerence and faction-fighting. All too often, anti-imperialists seem to keep the company of very rum people indeed
JUL15	A decade after my mother’s murder, fear still reigns in Chechnya	Aged eight, I have a nightmare. Russian soldiers are breaking down the door of our flat. Mum and I run into the sunlit living room. A hand grabs me roughly and yanks me away from my mother, causing a sharp pain in my elbow. Her screams echo in my ears – but I can’t utter a word. Then I hear a cry so heart-rending that it turns into a hoarse rattle: “Lana! ? I’m forced on to my knees in the dark corridor. “Please, please, spare her, ? I beg, before hearing a shot. No more screams. I slowly look up at a soldier, but I can’t see his face. “Just kill me, ? I whisper and hear another shot. There is a sharp pain in my chest and I feel myself going. Then I wake up. My home was in Chechnya, and my mother was Natalya Estemirova, a human rights activist – and we were at war with Russia. The reason the war started always confused me. The general consensus was that it was a war for independence – but even as a child, I felt that it was more complicated than that. Listening to Mum’s conversations was no good; it was like tuning into a TV series halfway through. Dudaev, Raduev, Udugov, Lebed, Maskhadov, Shamanov – those names jumped out of her mouth like secret spells. Some of them were more familiar than others.
JUL15	The cult of optimism got us into this mess. It’s time to embrace pessimism	When historians write the last pages of their books, and the producers of history documentaries sit down to edit the final minutes of their programmes, there is often a strong urge to look to the future and emphasise the positive. That impulse is at its most acute when the subject of the book or documentary in question is British history. The classic formulation is something along the lines of: Britain and her institutions are remarkably adaptable, the nation has survived two world wars and endured the loss of empire, we will surely cope with whatever the future has in store… roll credits, press send, everyone down the pub.
JUL15	Where are the politicians with principles they would stand down for?	In her swansong appearances at the dispatch box, Theresa May is endeavouring to get in touch with her funny side. She recently tried mocking Jeremy Corbyn by quoting Groucho Marx. “Those are my principles, and if you don’t like them... well, I have others.” I expect most of the public take the Groucho view of politicians. In my experience, though, it is not true to say that their principles are endlessly mutable. Rather, what most politicians have is a hierarchy of convictions of varying degrees of flexibility.
JUL15	Spoiler alert: it’s getting harder to keep plot lines from readers	“I can’t be the only one in the boat on this,” complained a reader about separate newspaper interviews in which actors discussed the fates of characters they had played in two immensely popular television series, Game of Thrones and Line of Duty. Don’t click the hyperlinks in this article if you are in the same boat. In the reader’s view, “There’s now an explosion of content and not everyone gets to watch on the day of broadcast. I can’t afford HBO and I don’t download illegally, so I haven’t seen GoT [season] 8 yet. And it’s only been a few weeks since it was shown.” I sympathise, especially as premium sporting events move from free-to-air to pay TV. But it is precisely because communications have changed so much that the main responsibility for avoiding information that discloses a plot line, the fate of a character or the result of a sports contest is shifting from media professionals to individual audience members.
JUL15	Narcissists and cliques control the main parties and threaten democracy	Party democracy is the enemy of representative democracy. Party democracy stops MPs speaking out against racism and warning of the perils facing their country. Party democracy makes politicians put their members ahead of their constituents. Party democracy makes them flatter coteries of arrogant obsessives. Party democracy is the enemy of conscience and judgment. To borrow a phrase, the party has become the enemy of the people. Who does your MP represent? Who are they frightened of? You and your neighbours? What creaking haycart brought you and the rest of your yokel friends into town? “Control of politics has passed to unelected and irresponsible members,” says the historian Robert Saunders, one of the best analysts of British democracy’s decay. “Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt needs the support of about 70,000-80,000 Tory members to become prime minister. That’s roughly the size of one parliamentary constituency.”
JUL15	Working class versus minorities? That’s looking at it the wrong way	Officials eyeing you with contempt. Police treating you as scum. A sense of being constantly watched and judged by professionals. Living in fear of benefit sanctions. A lack of community facilities. Such is likely to be your experience if you are working class. Such is also likely to be your experience if you are of black or minority ethnic origin. But here’s the odd thing: people from the working class and minorities are rarely seen as facing the same kinds of issues. Instead, in political debates from Brexit to welfare benefits, minorities and the working class are seen as having conflicting interests and often set against each other. We are Ghosts: Race, Class and Institutional Prejudice, a report published last week by the thinktanks Class and the Runnymede Trust, attempts to address this. Based on interviews and focus groups, almost entirely in
JUL15	So, guys, you reckon you could take a point off Serena Williams?	Let us for a minute extend the benefit of the doubt to the 12% of men who believe they could take a point from Serena Williams in a tennis match, no doubt further emboldened by her defeat in the Wimbledon final. For who can say what manner of fugue state they fell into as they answered a simple polling question? Could they have collectively imagined, as they pictured the holder of 23 grand slam titles shaping up to serve, a freak calamity overtaking her? A sinkhole opening up on her side of the net, perhaps, or a thunderbolt sent by a jealous athletic god; or, in more sinister fashion, a tripwire rigged up by an incel saboteur to fell her as she rushed in for the volley.
JUL15	Money’s no object for Facebook, so hit it where it hurts	If you want a measure of the problem society will have in controlling the tech giants, then ponder this: as it has become clear that the US Federal Trade Commission is about to impose a fine of $5bn (£4bn) on Facebook for violating a decree governing privacy breaches, the company’s share price went up! This is a landmark moment. It’s the biggest ever fine imposed by the FTC, the body set up to police American capitalism. And $5bn is a lot of money in anybody’s language. Anybody’s but Facebook’s. It represents just a month of revenues and the stock market knew it. Facebook’s capitalisation went up $6bn with the news. This was a fine that actually increased Mark Zuckerberg’s personal wealth.
JUL16	It’s folly for Jeremy Hunt to think Britain can solve the Iran crisis without the EU	Jeremy Hunt’s well-publicised dash to Brussels to save the world from war with Iran will be seen by his more cynical opponents as a last-minute bid to save his Conservative leadership hopes. Before attending an EU foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday, Hunt declared portentously that the prospect of Middle Eastern states acquiring nuclear weapons posed “an existential threat to mankind”. That’s scary stuff, certainly deserving of a seasoned statesman’s full attention. Showboating aside, what the foreign secretary’s Brussels mission really demonstrates is that unilateral British efforts to defuse the Iran crisis have failed miserably. In particular, this failure has cruelly exposed the hollowness of Britain’s claims to wield special influence in Washington’s corridors of power. Donald Trump could not give a fig what Britain thinks. All efforts to change his mind (including two Boris Johnson trips to Washington as foreign secretary) have flopped.
JUL16	From Trump to Boris Johnson, we’re moving from post-truth to post-shame	A confession: I tend not to read the online comments about anything I write for the Guardian. But as I am about to embark on a short “politics of mental health” speaking tour down under, I made an exception for the comments section beneath an interview I did for Guardian Australia. I am glad I did. For there were two comments so good they left me wishing I had written them myself. I shall certainly be using them in future. I have no idea who sleuthfortruth is, but someone should find them and hire them as a speechwriter. “Voting for a populist party is like diving headfirst into an empty swimming pool, because you’re angry that there’s no water in it.” Brilliant. Trump and Brexit to a tee.
JUL16	Trump’s race fantasy is clear: the US as home for whites fleeing Europe	“Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came?” Donald Trump wondered, of four “progressive” (his “punctuation”) Democrat congresswomen: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, born in New York; Rashida Tlaib, born in Michigan; Ayanna Pressley, born in Ohio; and Ilhan Omar, born in Somalia, raised in the US and a naturalised American. Impossible to tell why he chose these women rather than, say, Mike Pence, also born in the US but of Irish ancestry. Or, for that matter, why Trump himself doesn’t return to the Outer Hebrides, birthplace of his mother, which is riddled with crime (against knitwear). Imagine how incredibly full Scottish politics would be if everyone whose parents were born there went back and tried to govern it. We’d be seeking independence from them.
JUL16	Don’t let nationalism win – we can create a better Europe from within	If you have ever had a close, meaningful relationship, you will know just how important honest and open communication is – all the more so when that relationship is in jeopardy. However scary it seems, we know deep down that at such fraught moments the unadulterated truth must be spoken out loud – without it there is no real chance of growing closer. The same goes for the European Union. I absolutely love the EU – but if we Brits get a chance for a second referendum in the UK, we will need to argue for remain in different terms than we did last time. We will need to articulate the value of our continuing relationship to the EU in an honest and grownup conversation. We have learned from 2016 that simply cheerleading will not defeat the elaborate lies we know our opponents will concoct, and the disinformation they have already propagated.
JUL16	My own list of hideous men: from a dodgy driving instructor to Boris Johnson	E Jean Carroll’s list of “hideous men ? is a magnificent essay that ends with her detailed allegations about being raped by Donald Trump. People seem not to care much about such accusations, or the racism made explicit by his tweets over the weekend. Her list reminded me of incidents in my own life often involving harassment and assault, but made me also want to start another list of hideous men who have undermined me not sexually, but in every other possible way.
JUL16	Christine Lagarde will have to confront Berlin if she’s to save the euro	Christine Lagarde was a key member of the infamous troika – Greece’s official creditors – who crushed our people’s resistance to perpetual debt bondage. The other key figure alongside the International Monetary Fund’s then managing director was Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who played a central role in that drama by engineering the closure of Greece’s banks. Now, four years later, Lagarde has been anointed to succeed Draghi at the helm of the ECB. Despite her role, and the dealings we had when I was Greece’s finance minister, not once did I feel animosity towards her. I found her intelligent, cordial, respectful. She even acknowledged, in private at least, that Greece had been given a raw deal and that my campaign to cut our public debt was right and proper. Lagarde’s priority was holding the troika’s line and minimising any challenge to its collective authority.
JUL16	If there is an 'immigrant' who has failed to integrate in America, it's Donald Trump	Why does Donald Trump hate America so much? What is it about this German-American that makes him think he can tell native-born citizens what to say and how to behave? “So interesting to see ‘Progressive’ Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,” Trump tweeted.
JUL16	Meghan and Harry can't cut out the media completely	Shamefully perhaps, I’d never heard of “mum-shaming” until I read that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, was being trolled on Instagram for not holding her new baby correctly. When I Googled it, the top stories were all of Meghan holding baby Archie in the Sun, the Express and the Daily Mirror. Although these “cruel trolls” were largely anonymous, they were widely quoted by the papers. One, according to the Mirror, wrote: “Why can’t she hold the baby properly after two months? Clearly the nanny looks after him most of the time.”
JUL16	Boris Johnson is about to inherit a crisis his EU-bashing helped spawn	It was not just the persistently overcast skies – a weather pattern once dubbed the “Brabant gloom” by Roy Jenkins, a former European commission president – that made working in Brussels for the Daily Telegraph in the early 1990s a joyless experience. It was my role as deputy to Boris Johnson, then “bureau chief” in name but solo performer in practice, that ensured my first job as a foreign correspondent was a trial of endurance. There were just the two of us in the Telegraph office, and we were working long hard hours reporting on the political and economic convulsions of the Maastricht treaty negotiations. The story itself, of negotiations that played out in meeting rooms of Brussels, was full of political intrigue and drama. And whatever happened was likely to shape Europe for years to come.
JUL16	European governments are fuelling Euroscepticism	After days of drama and late-night meetings, EU heads of government recently nominated their candidate to replace the Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker when he steps down as president of the European commission in October. As expected, the name to emerge was a German, but not the German who was expected. Rather than Manfred Weber, the lead candidate, or Spitzenkandidat of the biggest political group in the European parliament, the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), Ursula von der Leyen, the German minister of defence was announced as the nominee. As some celebrated (finally) the promotion of a woman to the most powerful EU position, others (rightly) criticised her nomination for rendering the European electorate irrelevant in the process. In political science, European elections are referred to as “second-order” elections, as opposed to “first-order” elections, which determine national governments. In fact, European elections don’t even determine the EU’s “government”, which is constituted by the executive body, the European commission and the European council, where the member governments make new laws.
JUL17	Pro-Europe Tories must locate their rebel spirit – and make the case for remain	If hardline Brexiteers were free to shop around for beatable enemies they probably wouldn’t change much about the current state of British politics. Their preferred candidate is well ahead in the final straight of a Tory leadership contest, and his rival doesn’t dare to contradict him on the issue that matters most. In hustings on Monday night, Boris Johnson ruled out any Brexit compromise based on revision of the Northern Irish backstop. And that is the only route to a negotiated, orderly resolution visible from Brussels. No backstop; no deal. Jeremy Hunt might have inserted some practical reality into the conversation, if only for the sake of his intellectual credibility, but instead he endorsed the central tenet of Johnsonism: the only Brexit deal worth aiming for is one that doesn’t exist.
JUL17	Trump’s ‘go back’ racism is crude, but may be dangerously effective	Pity Donald Trump. Even his racism is the most unsophisticated kind. Every black and brown person knows a “go back to where you came from” racist. For many of us who have never been migrants, to have this muttered at us was the first signal that to be a visible minority means to be forever perceived as an immigrant. And that being perceived as an immigrant is bad. “Go back” racists are rarely intellectually capable of engaging with the question of whether the destination they deem so suitable for us actually exists. Trump’s latest outburst – in which he said four congresswomen should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came”, is a case in point. For the US president to say of Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, “if they’re not happy here, they can leave”, makes no sense because the women in question are Americans. Yet it makes perfect sense because they are not white.
JUL17	Scarlett Johansson could ideally play ‘any person’. But our world is far from ideal	“As an actor, I should be allowed to play any person, or any tree, or any animal because that is my job and the requirements of my job,” the actress Scarlett Johansson told As If magazine in an interview obtained by the Daily Mail that has since gone viral (she later said her comments had been taken out of context and used as “clickbait”). Not exactly surprising, coming from a woman who has played a cyborg (Ghost in the Shell), an alien (Under the Skin) and the disembodied voice of an artificially intelligent virtual assistant (Her), but it’s offensive nevertheless to hear a cisgender white woman assert her unassailable right to play whomever (or whatever) she pleases. Or as Vanity Fair’s film critic K Austin Collins put it in a tweet: “you cant just go around likening ‘playing a tree’ to ‘playing an asian woman’ lmao come on”.
JUL17	Liam Fox wants children to learn about global trade. But it’s Brexiters who need the lessons	International trade secretary Liam Fox has shown us what happens when one of the leaders of the revolution spends three subsequent years looking at paperwork. The fantasy lives – just – but must now inhabit a lever-arch file outlining everything the UK still doesn’t understand about global trade. In recent weeks, dyed-in-the-wool Brexiter Fox has warned against no deal, explained why Boris Johnson cannot use Gatt article 24 to unilaterally implement a deal with the EU, and pointed out that we cannot negotiate a new package with the US before Brexit has taken place. The reason for his newfound pragmatism was perhaps revealed by Monday’s announcement that the government is seeking to train 12 new professional trade negotiators, and Fox’s declaration that trade should be taught on the national curriculum. So there we have it: the government has discovered that trade depends on rules, and almost nobody in Britain knows what they are.
JUL17	No, Boris Johnson, working harder is not a solution for poor mental health	Boris Johnson is quite the renaissance man. He builds buses! He writes columns! He dabbles in politics! And now, it would appear, he fancies himself a mental health expert. On Sunday, Johnson used his Telegraph column to share his brilliant solution to Britain’s mental health crisis: drown out your inner demons with work. Yep, according to the sentient shock of hair that will probably be Britain’s next prime minister, you can rid yourself of depression by working harder. Johnson’s views on mental health largely seem to be influenced by that famous wellness guru, Winston Churchill. “It was with work that [Churchill] pitchforked off his depression,” BJ informs us in his column. “[A]nd what was true for Churchill is basically true for all of us: that to a very large extent we ‘derive our self-esteem from what we do’. It is often from our jobs … that we get that all-important sense of satisfaction.”
JUL17	School textbooks are on the way out – and pupils will lose so much with them	The world’s largest publisher of textbooks is preparing to throw in the towel on print and paper: Pearson has announced a digital-first strategy for its US market. New books will be published in electronic rather than print form, and Pearson will update its physical textbooks much less often from here on in. The UK is expected to follow in due course. Students in the US, who increasingly opt to rent secondhand textbooks rather than buy them new, are eating into Pearson’s profits; so it has decided to cut the problem off at the source. Or, as it puts it, “It is time to flick the switch in how we primarily make and create our products.”
JUL17	Hong Kong showed China is a threat to democracy. Now Europe must defend Taiwan	Hong Kong’s administration has backed down over the controversial extradition bill, but the canary in the coalmine of China’s tacit acceptance of democracy is already dead. Under China’s “one country, two systems” model, Hong Kong was given the guarantee that the freedoms of its citizens would be preserved and respected. Meanwhile, for a long time in the west, the consensus was that, as its economy grew, China would start to look more like Hong Kong. Regrettably, in recent years the opposite has happened and Hong Kong looks more like China by the year. Perhaps we were naive to believe that this erosion of Hong Kong’s democracy was not inevitable. Beijing makes no secret of its view that democracy and Chinese civilisation are incompatible. The protesters in the streets of Hong Kong would beg to differ, and I hope they succeed through peaceful means.
JUL17	This genetic breakthrough on anorexia should transform how the disease is seen	Once upon a time, disease was thought to have been sent by God as a punishment for sin. If not, then it must surely be the work of demons, witches or groups regarded as social outcasts. Thankfully medicine has moved on from the days when Jews were blamed for outbreaks of the plague across medieval Europe, yet with psychiatric illnesses something of the old accusatory myths seem to linger. Until relatively recently, autism was still wrongly blamed on so-called “refrigerator mothers”, who supposedly damaged their children by being cold and unloving. The discovery that autism has a genetic component turned our understanding of the role it plays in families upside down, and now something similar may be happening with anorexia.
JUL17	Putting Alan Turing on the £50 note is a triumph for British science – and for equality	Over Christmas, I had the unusual delight of reading short biographies of 989 dead scientists. As a member of the Bank of England’s banknote character advisory committee, I was sifting through potential nominees to be included on the new £50 note: the sheer volume of UK scientists, put forward by more than 225,000 members of the public, reflected the enormous contribution our small island has made to international scientific progress over the past few centuries. The advisory committee finally arrived at a list of 12, which we duly presented to the bank’s governor, Mark Carney. All were outstanding scientists in their own right, universally agreed to have made a significant and enduring contribution not just to the world of science, but to society as a whole. They ranged from Stephen Hawking and Rosalind Franklin to Dorothy Hodgkin and Srivanasa Ramanujan. It was a list to challenge the outdated stereotype of the socially awkward old white man, working diligently alone in his laboratory. A damaging trope that still prevents many young people today from seeing a place for themselves in science.
JUL17	Bullies told me to 'go home'. Now, Trump is making me relive those moments	Being an American-born US citizen and hearing “go back to your country” repeatedly as a child and an adult so shook up my sense of self I had to write a whole novel about it, pushed by that kind of naive artist’s insistence, I need you to know how this feels. I grew up in northern Minnesota, where our family was the only family of color in a small mining town. It was a town rich with immigration – its “ethnic days” boasted more than 100 nationalities (but always somehow forgot us) – all European. I still subscribe to our hometown paper and see that now, as then, a Finnish club continues to meet at the public library every week, the Sons of Norway (yes, still “sons”) club is so active it has won national awards from its main organization.
JUL18	Democrats are right to condemn Trump’s racism, but they risk walking into his trap	You’d think it would happen all the time. Given how often they’re drawn from different parties, it should be routine for the US House of Representatives to condemn the president. In fact, it’s rare. Until last night, the House had not made that formal move since it admonished William Howard Taft more than a century ago. So Donald Trump has earned himself yet another place in the history books, rebuked by the House late Tuesday night for telling four members of that body – all women of colour, three of them born in the US and all American citizens – to “go back” to where they came from. For anyone opposed to prejudice and bigotry, the moral argument for the resolution is unassailable. Not many would want to dispute the text’s contention that “President Donald Trump’s racist comments ... have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.” That is little more than a statement of the truth. Proof came swiftly, when presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway referred to the four Congresswomen as “the dark underbelly” of America and, following a question about the issue during a press huddle, immediately asked the (Jewish) reporter who had asked it, “What’s your ethnicity?”
JUL18	We shouldn’t have to live in a world where women are afraid to say no	Some years ago, I worked for a man several decades older than me who consistently made oleaginous and sexualised comments to me and the other young women in our workplace. He was completely oblivious to the fact that our disgust towards him was a shared point of bonding, and that we would wince every time he was in the building; I expect because every time he said something we would force a smile, entrenching his delusion that we actually enjoyed his behaviour. I thought about him again this week when I read that the Manchester teenager Gabrielle Walsh had been knocked unconscious after she told a man who followed her from a nightclub: “I’m sorry, I’m not interested.” Although Walsh’s experience is much more extreme and frightening than mine, both examples reveal the reluctance women feel to rebut a man’s unwanted advances when he holds some sort of power – be it physical or economic. In the wee small hours when alcohol is flowing, perhaps a man will just be crazy enough to physically harm you if you tell him no. If that man is your boss, maybe you’ll find your work life becoming that little bit harder after you inform him that what he regards as swashbuckling charm is actually sexual harassment.
JUL18	Radical change is needed to ensure farms produce healthy food. MPs must act now	A profound ecological transformation of food and farming is achievable, desirable and urgently needed. That’s a message that comes across loud and clear from the RSA Food Farming and Countryside Commission (FFCC) at the culmination of an innovative and independent two-year inquiry. It provides a clear diagnosis of the causes of the current environmental and health crisis linked to how we produce and consume food. It describes how, over the last 70 years, agriculture has been about specialisation, consolidation and control over nature, with many farmers simply raw material suppliers to a processing industry. This model of agriculture has driven deforestation, wildlife loss, soil degradation and diet-related ill health.
JUL18	Poor tenants pay for landlords to live like kings. It doesn’t have to be this way	I have a friend who works almost every waking hour, mainly to pay the rent. Her landlord lives on a beach, 4,000 miles away. He seldom responds to her requests, and grudgingly pays for the minimum of maintenance. But every so often he writes to inform her that he is raising the rent. He does not have to work because she and other tenants work on his behalf. He is able to live the life of his choice because they give their time to him. As there is a shortage of accessible housing, they have no choice but to pay his exorbitant fees. People say, ‘I work for Tesco' or, ‘I work for Deliveroo', but the reality for many is that they work for their landlord
JUL18	The military has recognised its harassment problem. Now it must talk about it	Recently I had coffee with a fellow veteran. She recalled her experience of going to sea with the Royal Navy for the first time. On being shown which compartments she could use to dry laundry, she had her attention drawn to special cages for her underwear “so it wouldn’t get stolen” by men on board. She thought at the time this was thoughtful treatment of women at sea. She and I have together come to see these sorts of behaviours very differently. I experienced being told explicitly “I wasn’t welcome” as a woman in a new role, “it wasn’t a problem that I was a woman” in another more senior role; the former comment openly hostile but the latter more subtly demeaning. These comments came from men ranked above me at different points in my career. I felt at the time I had “to suck it up” and I, like my friend, struggled with recognising unacceptable behaviour for what it was. This, I believe, is part of the problem identified by the Ministry of Defence in its Report on Inappropriate Behaviours.
JUL18	Revealed: the three-word question consuming the world’s biggest brains	What is preoccupying the world’s leading minds? It is an audacious question for sure. Some might say leading physicists will be concentrating on physics, leading philosophers on philosophy, historians on history and so on. And yet when we look back on different eras, we can sometimes spot a thread – the preoccupation with truth in ancient Athens, with beauty in Renaissance Europe, with political “reason” during the Enlightenment, with scientific progress during the industrial age. There is, I believe, likewise a new preoccupation lurking in the biggest brains of our time, and that theme is summed up in one word – identity.
JUL18	I challenged Corbyn on antisemitism a year ago. Things have only got worse	Today marks one year since my face-to-face encounter with Jeremy Corbyn in the lobby of parliament in which I called him a racist and an antisemite. Afterwards I went out for the evening and switched off my phone. It was late that night when I switched it back on again and realised our confrontation had hit the headlines.
JUL18	Millennials won’t let go of children’s toys and films – and kids are paying the price	Last week Mattel announced the launch of a Ziggy Stardust-inspired Barbie. Yet the number of seven-year-olds saving up their weekly pocket money to splurge on £40-worth of David Bowie-inspired plastic is probably limited. The intended demographic is more likely to be the current darlings of the marketing world: millennials. A few weeks ago I took my nine-year-old daughter Maisie to see Toy Story 4. Some of the audience sniggered and guffawed at actors Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele’s fluffy comedy duo, Ducky and Bunny, and nodded sagely at Forky “finding himself”. But what I didn’t hear were any children laughing – odd when you consider the supposed target audience for a Disney film. When we left the theatre, Maisie pithily commented, “Well that was trash.”
JUL18	Boris Johnson could hide as a columnist and at City Hall. He can’t in No 10	Ahead of the London mayoral election of May 2012, I was invited to chair a hustings at St James’s Church in Piccadilly. The main attractions were Boris Johnson, seeking his second term, and his doughty detractor Ken Livingstone, alongside their good-natured warm-up acts of Jenny Jones for the Green party and Brian Paddick for the Lib Dems. Before we took the stage, there was a drinks reception in the rectory. Boris Johnson was holding court, but greeted me to listen to my proposed rules of engagement and graciously remembered that we shared a comment page at the Daily Telegraph at the time. What struck me was that he was softly spoken, genial and engaging.
JUL18	Pro-Europe Tories must locate their rebel spirit – and make the case for remain	If hardline Brexiteers were free to shop around for beatable enemies they probably wouldn’t change much about the current state of British politics. Their preferred candidate is well ahead in the final straight of a Tory leadership contest, and his rival doesn’t dare to contradict him on the issue that matters most. In hustings on Monday night, Boris Johnson ruled out any Brexit compromise based on revision of the Northern Irish backstop. And that is the only route to a negotiated, orderly resolution visible from Brussels. No backstop; no deal. Jeremy Hunt might have inserted some practical reality into the conversation, if only for the sake of his intellectual credibility, but instead he endorsed the central tenet of Johnsonism: the only Brexit deal worth aiming for is one that doesn’t exist.
JUL19	Farewell, Theresa May. Your best was far from good enough	On Wednesday, in her last major speech, Theresa May lamented a growing culture of absolutism in politics. Introspection was never her strong suit, and this speech to the Chatham House thinktank was no exception. In a scarcely veiled swipe at the populist right, at home and abroad, she bemoaned an “inability to combine principles with pragmatism … [from those who believe] that if you simply assert your view loud enough and long enough you will get your way in the end”. This from the leader who produced a deal without consulting other parties, refused to compromise on it, put it to parliament three times and lost every time, and would have tabled it for a fourth time if she’d been able.
JUL19	Scotland has a drugs problem – and it’s called Westminster	Scotland’s drug mortality rate cannot be shelved as just another misery statistic. It has risen by 27% in a year and is three times England and Wales’s rate, 50 times Portugal’s and higher even than that of the United States. Westminster is clearly deaf to this tragedy. There is only one solution. Declare it Scotland’s problem. Let Scotland decide what to do. Every country in the developed world is now inquiring, experimenting, searching for how to tame the menace that modern narcotics pose. Every country, that is, except Britain, where for half a century a futile “war on drugs” has been delegated to the police, the courts and the NHS. The sole beneficiaries have been drug dealers and their political sponsor, Her Majesty’s Home Office, relieved of lifting a finger in response.
JUL19	Why Paul McCartney’s It’s a Wonderful Life musical is going to be terrible	It’s easy to be sceptical about Paul McCartney’s announcement that he’s written a musical adaptation of the 1946 Frank Capra film It’s a Wonderful Life, but that won’t stop me. The nightmare scenario is that he has brought to the musical table not the genius of Hey Jude, Here, There and Everywhere and Norwegian Wood, but the creative acumen responsible for the Frog Chorus, Mull of Kintyre and, there’s no easy way to say this, Wonderful Christmastime – the very acumen that, on a personal note, in December 1979 made me contemplate disowning British citizenship and living in Vanuatu. The paying public may yet compel me to put my scepticism where the sun doesn’t shine
JUL19	Pardon the rant, but here’s why I love my Mooncup so much	If you’re a Guardian-reading woman of a certain age, it’s likely you’ll have been party to the evangelical Mooncup rant. In the Mooncup rant, one woman tells the other about a convex piece of medical-grade silicone that has saved her life. She uses it each time she gets her period, and spends the rest of her time talking about it. The cup has saved her thousands, is proof of her eco credentials and is now, essentially, the best thing ever. I’m relatively new to menstrual cups, turning to them two years ago after an organic tampon company’s cardboard applicators injured my gentlest parts. And I’ve got the devotion of a convert, regularly proselytising about my Mooncup with all the spittle-flecked frenzy of a televangelist. A new study published by the Lancet this week has proved my claims. Researchers from the Medical Research Council, the Department for International Development and the Wellcome Trust found that menstrual cups were just as reliable as tampons.
JUL19	This Commons vote shows how weak a Boris Johnson government would be	It is a measure of how far British politics has passed through the looking glass that MPs feel compelled to put in law that prime ministers should govern with the consent of parliament. There was a time, not too long ago, when that sort of thing was understood as a convention underpinning democracy. The imminent arrival of Boris Johnson in Downing Street has made it prudent to get implicit constitutional principles down in writing. The amendment that passed today would not forbid Johnson from dissolving the House in order to get Britain out of the EU without a negotiated deal. It is a more convoluted device, attached tenuously to a passing bill pertaining to Northern Ireland. It instructs the government to report to the Commons on a timetable that would preclude prorogation. Crudely speaking, it wedges the parliamentary door open in the run-up to the 31 October Brexit deadline – in case Johnson plans on shutting the legislature down to facilitate a desperate dash for no deal.
JUL19	Jeremy Corbyn’s weak leadership betrays those Labour would lift from poverty	With dexterity, decisiveness and a thwack of firm leadership, Jeremy Corbyn sacked Dianne Hayter last night as shadow Brexit minister. (She can’t be fired from her elected role as deputy leader of the Lords.) With just that same speed, he expelled Alastair Campbell from the Labour party in May, as a dead-cat distraction following Labour’s disastrous European election results. What had Hayter done? She had deployed a somewhat tired old political metaphor, “the bunker mentality”, comparing Corbyn’s inner circle to the paranoid denial of disastrous reality that defined Hitler’s last days. The same was said of Thatcher’s final hours in power, in denial over her poll tax calamity. It was said of Gordon Brown in his telephone-hurling phase, of Tony Blair’s secretive sofa government and of Harold Wilson’s kitchen cabinet. It’s never a good idea to use Hitler as a metaphor for anything else, but the claim by Corbyn’s spokesman that her words were “grossly insensitive to Jewish staff” would be laughable if it didn’t look like such a pathetic attempt to divert criticism from the party’s failure to deal with antisemitism, which Corbyn should have scotched more than a year ago.
JUL19	The lesson from the ruins of Notre Dame: don’t rely on billionaires	You remember the story, of course you do. One of the most ancient and holy buildings on Earth, Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, goes up in flames. As pictures of the inferno are beamed around the world, adjectives rain down: it is atrocious, disastrous, diabolical. Barely has the fire been put out before some of the richest people in France rush to help rebuild it. From François-Henri Pinault, the ultimate owner of Gucci, comes €100m (£90m). Not to be outdone, the Arnault family at Louis Vuitton put up €200m. More of the wealthy join the bidding, as if a Damien Hirst is going under the hammer. Within just three days, France’s billionaire class has coughed up nearly €600m. Or so their press releases state.
JUL19	Trump and progressive Democrats want the same thing – and Pelosi is in the way	American politics makes some extremely odd bedfellows. That’s worth keeping in mind when trying to understand why Donald Trump Twitter-trolled four progressive, first-term congresswomen of color – Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan – in his now-infamous “go back” tweet. Although Trump and “the Squad” (the collective nickname for the congresswomen) have venomously denounced each other, the reality is that they both want the same thing: to make the women the public face of the Democratic party. And their greatest obstacle is the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. The Squad have welcomed and sought out public attention because they want to use their celebrity to push the party to the left, just as the conservative movement pushed the Republican party to the right in decades past. They believe that this transformation not only will lead to progressive legislative victories, it will also win elections. As Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, recently told the Washington Post:
JUL19	I reported on misogyny in parliament 29 years ago – shockingly little has changed	Twenty-nine years ago this week I carried out an investigation for the Guardian about the endemic levels of sexism in parliament. A generation later, although much has been done, it is shocking to discover that so little has changed. Last week’s reports on bullying and harassment in the Commons and Lords by the QCs Gemma White and Naomi Ellenbogen reveal a parliament that is still chauvinistic, lecherous and patriarchal.
JUL19	Sadiq Khan has rejected the Tulip. But that won’t save London’s skyline	Tulipmania is no more. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has rejected Norman Foster’s 1,000ft “Tulip” for the City of London, crowning an unhappy week for the architect. On the same day, his obsession with “iconic” edifices hit a wall in Paris, where his gigantic twin towers at La Défense were rejected. Khan for once agreed with Historic England and others that the Tulip was just “a lift shaft with a bulge on top” – a bulge with unpleasant blisters on its side. He did not like it at all. For London, this was something of a surprise. Khan even deplored the Tulip’s “poorly designed public space at street level”. This makes his approval of Renzo Piano’s bleak glass cube now rising next to Paddington station the more bizarre, situated as it is in a conservation area. The mayor has previously been as meek as Boris Johnson was in the presence of London’s all-powerful developer lobby. Speculators knew that, if they just offered him a handful of “affordable” flats – usually a mere 20% off asking price – they could get any height they wanted. He is even said to favour taller towers looming over conservation areas in Notting Hill and South Kensington.
JUL20	Held captive by his carers for four weeks … let’s look at Boris Johnson’s best bits	T-minus five days off a likely Boris Johnson premiership, I would like to thank all the Conservatives who explained exactly why putting us through the stone-cold shitshow of a campaign was so essential. It was important, these red-trousered political scientists all told us, because the process allowed the candidates to be properly tested. It didn’t happen last time, and look how that turned out. Preach. Had we gone through the whole rigmarole in 2016, we might have found out about teenage Theresa May’s Betamax crop-circle habit before it was too late. Or that, if asked to state a preference between Midsomer Murders and Sherlock, May would one day simply reply, “I’ve watched both.” Instead, what happened, happened. I guess you don’t make that magnitude of mistake twice.
JUL20	I tried to find an upside to no deal. I couldn’t	Think of it as a coping strategy. Just as supporters of a team knocked out of the cup console themselves that “Now we can concentrate on the league”, so I have tried to reassure myself that a no-deal crash-out from the EU might not be such a disaster. That, you never know, it might even be a good thing. Such a strategy remains necessary because no deal still waits for us on the other side of summer. It is, as the Brexiter ultras delight in pointing out, the legal default. It remains the law of the land unless and until MPs vote for something else. True, on Thursday, MPs placed an obstacle in the path of the likely next prime minister, preventing Boris Johnson from simply suspending parliament – which would have been a dictator’s move as well as a dick move – by requiring the Commons to sit through October. But that only makes no deal harder; it does not make it impossible. All it will take is MPs who were once staunch in their opposition to leaving the EU without a deal to fold. Amber Rudd has done it. This week Labour’s Sarah Champion did it. More could follow. For that reason, remainers need to gird ourselves for Halloween, to have a comfort blanket in the drawer, ready to cling to if the worst happens. Which is why I’ve been busy knitting these past few weeks, coming up with the arguments that might help us self-soothe. Here goes.
JUL20	As your old friend, Boris, I’m asking you to stop Brexit	Dear Boris, You and I are friends, despite being on the opposite sides of the great political divide of our generation. But what does our friendship mean?
JUL20	EU officials don’t relish the idea of no deal – but they are prepared to play hardball	The top EU officials working on Brexit believe that the most likely outcome is for Britain to leave without a deal at the end of October. Last Monday’s debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt – in which both said that the withdrawal agreement’s “Irish backstop” would have to be excised altogether rather than just modified – reinforced the gloom in Brussels. EU officials do not want no deal but think they are powerless to prevent it. They see the Conservative party driving the UK towards the cliff edge and fear MPs are incapable of grabbing the steering wheel to avert disaster. For many months EU officials have thought that Johnson, the likely next prime minister, had only two options: either to “put lipstick on the pig” and dress up Theresa May’s deal to make it prettier, with extra protocols and interpretations; or to seek a fundamental change such as insisting on a time limit for the Irish backstop. The EU would have been happy to collaborate over the first option, but Johnson has now explicitly ruled that out. He has even rejected a time limit on the backstop.
JUL20	How dare a woman breastfeed her baby on a plane! She might offend the bigots	Well, I for one welcome the news: as of this week, anybody asked to cover up while breastfeeding on a KLM flight can now walk, bare-breasted, across the plane, milk firing into the air, their baby howling at their shoulder, and immediately hand that screaming, hungry, suffering child to the person who made the complaint, who must then look after that baby for the entirety of the journey while the previously breastfeeding passenger lies back, watches a film, reads their book, has a glass of wine or enjoys a much-needed nap. Because, my friends, that is precisely what I would do if someone asked me to cover myself while breastfeeding. This week, the Dutch airline KLM garnered a lactic tonne of deserved criticism after it put out a tweet stating that “to ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board, we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding, should other passengers be offended by this”. This was itself a response to one customer’s complaint, posted on Facebook, that she had been asked by a flight attendant to cover herself with a blanket – you know, like an actual fire – while breastfeeding her baby because someone else on the plane had complained.
JUL20	No deal would be disastrous. Labour must lead a national campaign to stop it	Off a cliff they march: bowler hat-wearing, besuited Englishmen, left leg raised theatrically – à la Ministry of Silly Walks – over the precipice before they topple into the abyss. This was the front-cover image of the New Yorker sketched in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 Brexit referendum result, but it surely even better captures our current predicament. Sing it gently: It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like No Deal. Under Theresa May, this was always an empty threat, even though she paved its way with her inflammatory declaration that “no deal is better than a bad deal”. Under the clownish charlatan due to succeed her – drunk on rightwing populism, English nationalism, messianic delusion and Conservative existential angst – it is now a tangible possibility.
JUL20	Extinction Rebellion protesters aren’t anarchists – we just want to save our world	I am a retired doctor, a husband, a father and grandfather – I am also one of more than 1,000 Extinction Rebellion protesters who have been arrested by police. During the April demonstrations in London, I sat on Waterloo Bridge with many others and refused to move in full acceptance that this nonviolent action would lead to my arrest. For many years I have been aware of the growing threat to life on Earth due to our overconsumption of the planet’s finite resources, our pollution of land, air and sea, our disregard for other forms of life and, in particular, our reckless burning of fossil fuels. It’s now clear that global heating and biodiversity loss are proceeding even faster than predicted just a few years ago and we are reaching a tipping point beyond which it will soon be too late to avoid the extinction of life as we know it. Like most of my generation living in the wealthy parts of the world, I must accept the guilt and responsibility of my own contribution to this situation.
JUL20	Donald Trump is the archetypal far-right charismatic leader. But his magic won’t last	First “Lock her up!” and “Build that wall!”, now “Send her back!”. Donald Trump’s record of using such slogans to normalise misogyny and stoke prejudice has become exhaustive, and ever more overtly racist. His Twitter feeds have even recycled content from extreme-right groups that historians of fascism like me consider deeply worrying. Yet this all proves tremulously popular. Academics who study fascism are well placed to see that Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip public persona is a carefully constructed device, designed to consciously and deliberately break liberal taboos, setting an example to others that they can do likewise. The most recent ratcheting-up of his endorsement of racist language came this week, displaying once again the powerful relationship between the leader who seeks to embody prejudice in the pursuit of power and followers who convey this power on him in their millions. True to form, it started with a tweet. He told four congresswomen of colour to “go home”, fuelling outrage from many who were rightly incensed by this latest attack on decency in public discourse. Then, during a rally in North Carolina a few days later, he focused on one of these congresswomen, Somali-born US citizen Ilhan Omar.
JUL20	Farewell, Theresa May. Your best was far from good enough	On Wednesday, in her last major speech, Theresa May lamented a growing culture of absolutism in politics. Introspection was never her strong suit, and this speech to the Chatham House thinktank was no exception. In a scarcely veiled swipe at the populist right, at home and abroad, she bemoaned an “inability to combine principles with pragmatism … [from those who believe] that if you simply assert your view loud enough and long enough you will get your way in the end”. This from the leader who produced a deal without consulting other parties, refused to compromise on it, put it to parliament three times and lost every time, and would have tabled it for a fourth time if she’d been able.
JUL20	What’s really behind the spread of Lyme disease? Clue: it’s not the Pentagon	The first indication I’d picked up a tick-borne disease three years ago was the excruciating arthritic pain in my feet as I hobbled to a dinner party at a neighbour’s house in Jerusalem. Later that night I experienced flu-like symptoms, including a raging fever that, even with antibiotics, would last for more than a week.
JUL21	New PM, take note: the Iran crisis could escalate into war	The boarding and holding of the tanker Grace 1 off Gibraltar, while allegedly carrying Iranian crude oil to Syria, in breach of European Union sanctions regime, was clearly going to provoke a response. Indeed, the Tehran regime clearly articulated the fact that they would do something in retaliation. Having already carried out a number of attacks on international tankers in and around the strait of Hormuz, a week ago, an attempt was made to take a British-flag registered ship, the BP British Heritage. It was only thwarted by the close presence of HMS Montrose.
JUL21	Trump revives the idea of a ‘white man’s country’, America’s original sin	The idea that some US inhabitants deserve the land, deserve to stay and to occupy it, and that others must go – to be exterminated (Native Americans), to be exiled (black people), to be driven out (Chinese and Japanese people), to be barred from immigrating (Italians, Jews and other southern and eastern Europeans), to be removed (Mexicans) and, briefly, challenged as citizens (Irish Catholics) – has changed shape over time in terms of the permitted stayers and the non-permitted exiles. But the conviction that only some people – that is, white people (however defined) – deserved US citizenship based on race held on for a very long time. After all, the initial US Congress began its work in 1790 by limiting eligibility for naturalisation to the free and the white.
JUL21	Our next PM needs to become an Iran expert. And fast	An incoming prime minister could be forgiven for feeling that the fates have been a touch unkind. As well as no majority in parliament, an uncertain domestic agenda and the vortex of Brexit, now a fully formed international crisis sits in the in-tray marked “Iran”. It will be an early test of diplomatic dexterity. We should not be here. As always, it helps to see the world as others see it, without compromise or acceptance of another’s perceptions. Iran has long and complex relationships all round. A Shia state surrounded by Sunni states, it sees its history as one requiring constant vigilance to survive in a world that stood by when it was attacked by Iraq and lost perhaps up to a million people, and one where economic sanctions threaten its people and government stability.
JUL21	Condemning poor children to a life without culture is a form of cruelty	Disadvantaged children in England are being priced out of a cultural hinterland. A Social Mobility Commission study, from the University of Bath, reports that children aged 10-15 from low-income families are three times less likely than wealthier peers to engage in out-of-school musical activities, such as learning an instrument or joining a choir or orchestra. There were also differences according to race – 4% of British Pakistani children took part in music classes, compared with 28% of Indian children and 20% of white children – and regional divides: 9% of children in north-east England played a musical instrument, compared with 22% in the south-east.
JUL21	Gwendoline Christie: let’s hear it for all the underdogs at the Emmys	It cost Gwendoline Christie, Alfie Allen and Carice van Houten $225 each to submit themselves for consideration to the Emmys, which, given that all three were announced as nominees last week, sounds, retrospectively, like a bit of a bargain. The Game of Thrones actors were not put forward by makers HBO, which is fair enough, I suppose, since the show had roughly 7,000 actors in every episode and not playing favourites would have been a budget-busting exercise in diplomacy. After all, they spent all their money on dragons. Apparently, it is common practice for people to submit themselves, if their network does not, but it is less common for them to actually win the nod having done so. The internet seemed impressed by the go-get-’em attitude of the trio and, to show its approval, allowed the meme of Brienne of Tarth writing in the Book of Brothers to graduate from a Sex and the City/Mean Girls spoof to a symbol of knowing one’s own value and pushing for what you want.
JUL21	The moon was once a frontier. But new worlds now beckon	My favourite childhood reading in the 1950s included the Eagle comic, especially the adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future – where the brilliant artwork depicted orbiting cities, jet packs and alien invaders. When spaceflight became real, the suits worn by the Soviet cosmonauts (and their US astronaut counterparts) were already familiar, as were the routines of launching and docking. My generation avidly followed the succession of heroic pioneering exploits such as Yuri Gagarin’s first orbital flight and Alexei Leonov’s first spacewalk. But of course the day most etched in our memories is 20 July 1969, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted the first human footprints on the moon’s dusty surface. The exploit seems even more heroic in retrospect, given how primitive and untested the technology was. Nasa’s entire suite of computers was less powerful than a single smartphone today.
JUL21	Boris Johnson’s take on Islam is historically illiterate	“You mustn’t let facts get in the way of a good story,” Boris Johnson was reported to have once told the French journalist Jean Quatremer in the early 1990s. It is a claim that defined much of his journalistic career and also appears to shape his pronouncements on the Muslim faith. In an essay written by Johnson in 2007 and unearthed by the Guardian this week, he claims that the Muslim world is “centuries behind” the west, because of a “fatal religious conservatism” that prevented the development of liberal capitalism and democracy. According to Johnson “virtually every global flashpoint you can think of – from Bosnia to Palestine to Iraq and Kashmir” is defined by “some sense of Muslim grievance”. Echoing his hero Winston Churchill’s view that there was “no stronger retrograde force” than Islam, Johnson believes “that the real problem with the Islamic world is Islam”. Johnson has been here before, with his attacks last year on the Muslim faith as “bizarre and unattractive”, and likening women in burqas to “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”. This clearly played well with the Tory grassroots: a recent poll of party members found that 56% believe Islam is “a threat” to the “British way of life” (whatever that is). But Johnson’s 2007 essay – an appendix to a later edition of his book praising the Roman empire – reveals a level of historical ignorance shocking even for such a political opportunist.
JUL21	Held captive by his carers for four weeks … let’s look at Boris Johnson’s best bits	T-minus five days off a likely Boris Johnson premiership, I would like to thank all the Conservatives who explained exactly why putting us through the stone-cold shitshow of a campaign was so essential.

Which is why I’ve been busy knitting these past few weeks, coming up with the arguments that might help us self-soothe. Here goes.
JUL21	The government is fuelling homelessness by freezing benefits as rents soar	I left the job I loved at John Lewis to run to be the Conservative mayor for the West Midlands because I believed I could help restore pride in the region. That meant expanding the economy, and two years later, business growth is strong. However, alongside the cranes and new offices, rough sleepers are to be found in doorways and at mobile soup kitchens. Behind closed doors, there are thousands of people sleeping on sofas at the homes of friends or family, families in B&Bs and vulnerable people living in some of the worst-quality shared housing. No one can take pride in that. We have made some progress in tackling homelessness, securing around £10m from the government to roll out Housing First, a model of homeless support developed in Helsinki, Finland. Some 73 homeless people have been given accommodation and support through the scheme since it was launched in the autumn. It’s a good start, but we need to go much further.
JUL22	Boris Johnson, the prime minister? I’m sorry to say that I’m partly to blame	How can this be happening?” I have lost count of the number of times I have been asked this question in the past few weeks. What people want to know – and I mean people from across the political spectrum – is how Boris Johnson, barring a serious upset, is about to become prime minister, first lord of the Treasury, and generally in charge of everything. How?
JUL22	Why you don’t hear Trump or Farage talking about the tech revolution	This week’s nightmare is the arrival of Boris Johnson; the autumn brings the Brexit watershed. Soon after, the 2020 US election takes shape, compounding the sense that politics everywhere is in a state of complete unpredictability. All that is clear, perhaps, is that the forces gathered around Brexit, Donald Trump and the various brands of European populism still think things are going their way. For some people, everything comes down to the failures of neoliberalism and its inbuilt globalisation, and the long aftershocks from the crash of 2008. Others, with very good reason, focus on racism and bigotry, and the spectacle of white men who are apparently convinced that their time at the top is about to come to a close and therefore lashing out. There are also people who seem to think that any sober, cause-and-effect explanations of a global crisis are impossible amid the mess: they tend to take refuge in rather specious ideas about “collective derangement” and national nervous breakdowns.
JUL22	MPs must find the courage to stop a mindless no-deal Brexit	There can be no better illustration of the disconnect between the people and the Tory leadership than its wilful ignorance of the sheer scale of the growing countrywide opposition to its mindless stampede towards a no-deal Brexit. A poll by Hope Not Hate released on Monday will show that, by a margin of two to one, British people think that the economy, their families’ economic prospects, inward investment into the UK and even their exposure to terrorism will take a turn for the worse if we crash out of the European Union on 31 October. Only 17% of women think no deal would be good for Britain. They are right to be worried: the no-deal Brexit we are now being offered is not the Brexit promised before and during the referendum. “What most people in this country want is the single market, the common market”, Boris Johnson is on record as saying, along with “Personally, I would like to stay in the single market”. “Wouldn’t it be terrible if we were really like Norway and Switzerland? Really?” said Nigel Farage. “They’re rich. They’re happy. They’re self-governing.”
JUL22	As a psychiatrist, if I had severe depression I’d choose the ‘barbaric’ therapy	It might come as quite a surprise to learn that, as a psychiatrist, if I ever had the misfortune to develop severe depression, my treatment of choice would be electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Why? Well, to put it simply, ECT is the most rapid treatment for severe depression that we currently have to offer – with a recent study in the BMJ highlighting its effectiveness. For the uninitiated, ECT is a medical procedure in which an anaesthetised patient has a small electrical current applied to their scalp in order to induce a seizure for the purposes of treating severe mental illnesses and occasionally neurological disorders too. Each treatment takes just a few minutes and is usually administered two or three times a week. ECT course length varies depending on the needs of the patient, but on average eight to 12 treatments are given.
JUL22	Iran is upping the ante in the Gulf. The UK must not take the bait	It was like something out of a movie. To shouts of Allahu Akbar!, masked soldiers drop down ropes from a military helicopter on to a British oil tanker while Iranian navy speedboats surround the vessel. By radio, a voice warns the ship’s captain in English: “If you obey you will be safe”. There is no doubt that the Friday seizure by Iranian Revolutionary Guards of a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, was in part a piece of theatre intended to appease domestic clamour for Tehran to assert itself. It came in response to the UK military’s 4 July detention of an Iranian tanker, the Grace 1, in Gibraltar, allegedly for shipping oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. But the tit-for-tat response should also be evaluated as part of the Iranian attempt to push back against Donald Trump’s unilateral abandonment of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and his reimposition of economic sanctions. It is not clear if this strategy will do much to convince an exasperated Iranian public suffering under sanctions. It is also fraught with risks of escalation, threatening to further complicate UK-Iran bilateral relations and endanger wider European efforts to save the JCPOA, the international deal that committed Iran to strict curbs on its nuclear programme, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The risks are, at the moment, seen by Tehran as a necessary gamble to improve its international leverage if dipomatic negotiations resume. Two weeks of fruitless mediation efforts to release the Grace 1 prompted Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei to state: “The Islamic Republic and its committed forces will not leave this evil without a response.” It seems the Stena Impero is a pawn in a bigger game.
JUL22	Boris Johnson’s braggadocio will soon come back to haunt him at Number 10	For Theresa May, the worst has been saved for last. After taking her final prime minister’s questions, she will be driven to Buckingham Palace on Wednesday afternoon to perform the most personally disagreeable task of her time at the top. After tendering her resignation, which will be painful enough, she will have the even more hateful duty of recommending that the Queen invites Boris Johnson to become the new prime minister. Her failings have been a major contributory factor to his ascent. Tory activists think he will deliver them the Brexit that she couldn’t and cheer them up after the torture of the May years. Tory MPs believe that he has the campaign skills to scupper Nigel Farage and squash Jeremy Corbyn. None of which is going to be much use to him in the critical opening weeks of a premiership that will inherit all the problems that defeated Mrs May and with some extra challenges of his own.
JUL22	We must talk about Palestine – without being antisemitic	It’s hard to write or talk about antisemitism and the Labour party’s handling of it without descending into deep despair, and not just at the mirror the sorry tale is holding up to the whole of our society, which seems to be becoming less tolerant, more racist and less safe for minorities. This is having greater consequences than the Labour leadership can imagine. In particular, it is stifling the ability of commentators and decision-makers to talk sensibly about the real issues in Palestine. My mother is Palestinian. These issues are deeply personal; we still have family in the West Bank. I am very worried that, at this critical juncture in the history of the region, activists, parliamentarians and journalists feel that they cannot speak out for fear of being branded as antisemitic. My plea is that we must speak more about Palestine, not less, and in this current climate it is something members of both houses of parliament have confided that they are more fearful than ever to do.
JUL22	The diary of Carrie Symonds, aged 31¾	Downing Street minus seven Usual mad dash to get in before lunch, but enough time to see my Sun debate strategy was a game-changer! Long to tell B but he said he’s got lifesaving surgery first thing, so I’m not on any account to worry he’s met someone younger and stayed out all night.
JUL22	New PM, take note: the Iran crisis could escalate into war	The boarding and holding of the tanker Grace 1 off Gibraltar, while allegedly carrying Iranian crude oil to Syria, in breach of European Union sanctions regime, was clearly going to provoke a response. Indeed, the Tehran regime clearly articulated the fact that they would do something in retaliation. Having already carried out a number of attacks on international tankers in and around the strait of Hormuz, a week ago, an attempt was made to take a British-flag registered ship, the BP British Heritage. It was only thwarted by the close presence of HMS Montrose.
JUL22	Guinness World Records is on a slippery slope	The world has a new steepest street! But it’s more than 1,000 years old. So, did something happen to the previous steepest street? Is this an off-colour attempt to look on the bright side of a horrendous natural disaster? No, the previous steepest street is still there. So, has the old one somehow got less steep, perhaps because of a horrendous natural disaster? No, it’s as steep as ever. There is no horrendous natural disaster involved with this story. So what’s happened?
JUL23	The fightback for liberal Britain begins here. Jo Swinson can lead it	While we all obsess about Britain’s new Brexiteer Conservative government, don’t lose sight of this: under Jo Swinson, the new leader they have just elected by a clear majority, the Liberal Democrats have a chance of leading a fightback for liberal Britain. The great unrepresented liberal Britain, that is, that people around the world admire and miss. To achieve this, the Lib Dems must dramatically raise their game, reaching parts of a troubled country that they have not touched for a century. “The Strange Death of Liberal England” is one of the most memorable book titles in British political history, so I am tempted to conjure up The Strange Rebirth of Liberal England. But liberal England never died, and nor did liberal Scotland – whence Swinson comes – and liberal Wales. Indeed, the British Social Attitudes survey shows that, in attitudes to sexual orientation and ethnicity, British society has become more liberal in recent decades.
JUL23	By punishing Iran, Trump risks a full-scale war between our two countries	Twenty-one years ago, on my recommendation, the UN general assembly named 2001 the year of “dialogue among civilisations”, and signalled its commitment to peace and its rejection of war and violence. The Iranian people, despite their own historic grievances and troubled history, opened a hopeful new chapter of engagement and dialogue with the Great Powers (US, UK and Russia). These hopes, however, were dashed by the terrorist atrocities of 11 September, 2001 and their tragic aftermath in devastating wars in west Asia. The catastrophic wars of Iraq and Afghanistan and other interventions in the region exacerbated already extant problems, and paved the way for the growth of international terrorism, civil wars in Syria and Iraq, and the depredations and war crimes still unfolding in Yemen. These conflicts have made the region unsafe and have impinged on security around the world. The Middle East once again faces a crisis not of its own making; a crisis which was both unnecessary and avoidable
JUL23	I’m a Jewish woman. And, finally, I feel hopeful about Labour	As someone who is both black and Jewish, Labour’s antisemitism crisis has been uniquely distressing. Traditionally the anti-racist party in British politics, Labour has always made me feel safe and secure as a black woman. But as a Jewish woman, I have felt increasingly alienated, unwanted and threatened, resulting in me cancelling my party membership in 2017. After years of failure in rooting out antisemitism – a recent example being Chris Williamson’s re-admission to the party – when I heard of Jeremy Corbyn’s “No Place for Antisemitism” initiative this weekend, I immediately felt cynicism and distrust. It was to my surprise, then, that after exploring the website, I found a renewed sense of hope. For the first time since 2017, I had been given a reason to think that Labour can be better. Labour has now released statements and materials that actually feel sincere, measured, and compassionate
JUL23	Was Leonard Cohen’s Marianne the last artist’s ‘muse’? Let’s hope so	What are the life skills appropriate to an artist’s muse? Hotness is a given; and sexual availability, while not compulsory, has generally been appreciated. The ability to keep a house tidy is a plus, as is being supportive of the artist at all times, even if he – and it is nearly always he – is being an arsehole. It helps, of course, to be mysterious; if one is to be endlessly gazed at, it’s best not to give everything away at once. As for a life, and a career of one’s own, well, history has shown that such things are rarely tolerated. In Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love, out later this week, the filmmaker Nick Broomfield examines the on-off relationship between the late Marianne Ihlen, a Norwegian single mother, and the poet and musician Leonard Cohen, whom she met on the Greek island of Hydra and who died just four months after her in 2016. Ihlen was immortalised in the song So Long, Marianne, and inspired Cohen to write Bird on a Wire. Since Ihlen gets first billing in the title, one might assume that this is her story, a biopic of sorts, but instead it depicts her through the prism of the men in her life. These include the novelist Axel Jensen, who left her not long after their son, Axel Jr, was born; Cohen, the towering genius whom we are told she could never hope to tame; and Broomfield himself, who had a fling with her during a visit to Hydra in his early twenties.
JUL23	Boris Johnson is as likely to avoid an Irish backstop as fly to the moon	Build that wall! Build that wall! So Donald Trump’s fans roared their support for his xenophobic rants. So scream fans of Boris Johnson’s no-deal Brexit. He wants walls against the EU in place by 31 October. But he has no more idea than Trump about how to erect them. This is despite having been foreign secretary and with a former Brexit negotiator, Dominic Raab, at his side. You cannot be outside a customs union and not have a border. You cannot have friction and no friction. A bureaucratic mountain of technology may withdraw the border some miles back, but somewhere there must be tariffs, payments, forms, regulation and inspection. A 40% tariff on a shipment of lamb is a barrier, wherever it gets levied. A chlorinated chicken inspection is a wall, wherever it is done.
JUL23	Labour still doesn’t take the threat of Boris Johnson seriously	Jeremy Corbyn’s support among Labour members has collapsed, according to polling for the Times: nearly two-fifths of them would like to see the leader step down before the next general election; 43% say he’s doing a bad job; more than 70% see antisemitism as a genuine problem; and 27% want the leader to stand down immediately. But one man’s collapse is another’s resounding mandate, and the leadership is apparently taking solace from the fact that three-fifths of the members are still supportive. The 56% continuing to back Corbyn into the next battle is not a vast reduction from the 61.8% who supported him against Owen Smith’s challenge in 2016. From this perspective, the leader retains the force field he’s had since his first election a year before that. The parliamentary party can rebel, and the mainstream media cavil all they like, but with the members on his side, Corbyn is unassailable.
JUL23	America's red scare is back. And it's racially tinged	The Republican party has come out swinging against socialism – a strategy sure to be a mainstay of its 2020 campaigns. “Our opposition to our socialist colleagues,” the Wyoming senator Liz Cheney claimed, referring to the congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, “has absolutely nothing to do with their gender, with their religion, or with their race. It has to do with the content of their policies. They are wrong when they attempt to impose the fraud of socialism on the American people. They are wrong when they pursue policies that would steal power from the American people and give that power to the government.” It’s a bold line coming from the daughter of a man, the former vice-president Dick Cheney, who did more to centralize power in the executive branch than perhaps any other public official in living memory. It’s also a bald-faced lie. Cheney’s diatribe against socialism – like Trump’s racist railing against the same group of progressive freshman congresswomen to “go back” to where they “originally came from” – has a long legacy in American history: it’s called red baiting.
JUL23	Boris Johnson, the prime minister? I’m sorry to say that I’m partly to blame	How can this be happening?” I have lost count of the number of times I have been asked this question in the past few weeks. What people want to know – and I mean people from across the political spectrum – is how Boris Johnson, barring a serious upset, is about to become prime minister, first lord of the Treasury, and generally in charge of everything. How?
JUL23	I am a woman in my 60s – that doesn’t make me a granny	I am a 66-year-old woman and I am many things: a writer, poet, editor, dancer, gardener – but one thing I am not, is a grandmother. Despite how the world often chooses to represent me. Every other day you will probably see “granny” used in reference to older women: on the BBC; in broadsheets and tabloids; in the local press; on YouTube and other social media. It’s a veritable granny fest.
JUL23	I was hired to sell ice-cream for the summer – instead I got to read the classics	It was the summer after my first year of university, and I was back in uniform for the first time since school. The blue baseball cap and polo shirt combination was not glamorous, and I hated wearing my hair up, but the ice-cream parlour in the Snowdonian village of my childhood was hiring, and I needed the work. These sorts of summer jobs are on the decline among young people with technology at their disposal, but I didn’t have the option to become an influencer or an internet millionaire. Back home, everyone I knew worked a summer job, but my distinctly posher university friends were off on adventures: backpacking around South America, repairing to their families’ houses in the south of France, Interrailing. I had already wasted a substantial wodge of cash on a quixotic attempt at a law degree that had me begging fervently to transfer courses before the tedium of property law actually killed me. Back in the village I had worked so hard to leave, I was doubting whether I could afford university at all.
JUL24	Brace yourself, Britain, for a long stint of bad government under Boris Johnson	If Boris Johnson is the answer, what was the question? To the 92,153 party members who voted for him, the new Conservative leader offers a remedy to two ailments: persistent membership of the EU and shrunken Tory popularity. Applying generous doses of Boris-branded tonic is meant to clear up both problems at once. About a third of Conservative members were unconvinced by this plan and with good reason. Johnson’s promise to “deliver” Brexit by 31 October cannot be kept. The UK might cancel its European treaty obligations on that date, but there is no closure while the future relationship is unsettled. The less amicable the separation, the harder the negotiations that follow. There are people who believe that Johnson is the best person for that job and there are people who have worked with him and understand what is involved. There is no overlap between the two groups.
JUL24	Boris Johnson: the clown is crowned as the country burns in hell	Well, here we are then. Someone who could easily be rejected as a Guess Who character for looking too ridiculous is now to lead the country. A man whose DNA profile is the exact same as a Bernard Manning joke. A man who mentioned the 20 hustings he had taken part in, approximately 30 seconds after Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis talked of the 16 hustings held. With 8,000 members of the Johnson family watching on – and Jeremy Hunt, looking for all the world like a sub who’s never gonna get off the bench and knows it – Boris Johnson was announced as the new leader of the Conservative party, and, in short order, the new prime minister. Elected by a staggering 0.2% of the nation, we can’t say it isn’t the will of the people.
JUL24	In believing Carl Beech, the Metropolitan police put the public at risk	Many months before the Panorama investigation into Operation Midland was broadcast in October 2015, I sat in a cafe in central London with a very senior officer who had just left the Metropolitan police. He was there as a go-between, doing a favour to ex-colleagues; an unofficial channel, trying to convey the Met’s new thinking about investigations into historic sexual abuse, in light of their failings over Jimmy Savile. I asked him about his general approach when he came across allegations like the ones being made by the man we knew then as Nick, and now as Carl Beech. The officer spoke plainly: as a principle, he told me, he tended to assume in cases like this that there was no smoke without fire. There ought to be a general rule that a celestial alarm bell will ring every time a police officer says that. But none rang, neither in Scotland Yard nor in enough newsrooms around the country. Operation Midland continued for more than another year.
JUL24	The Lib Dems are deeply stained by austerity. Don’t trust them	The Liberal Democrats are back, or so we’re told, with Jo Swinson’s leadership victory being pitched as the rebirth of the party. The unique conditions of Brexit have given the Lib Dems not only a reason to exist but the opportunity to detoxify their brand after their fatal coalition with the Conservatives, and to cast themselves as a reforming, progressive party in troubled times. And yet remarkably little has changed since the days when Nick Clegg stood laughing in the Downing Street rose garden next to David Cameron as he signed Britain up to years of sweeping public spending cuts. When asked throughout this summer’s leadership campaign, Swinson (and her opponent, Ed Davey) consistently defended her party’s role in austerity measures. In an interview with Channel 4 News, Swinson said she had no regrets about the coalition, stating it was the right move “to get our country back on track”. This is despite the fact it has been shown that austerity shrunk the British economy by £100bn, and has even been linked to 130,000 preventable deaths. Swinson acknowledged “there were policies we let through [in coalition] that we shouldn’t have done”, naming the bedroom tax, but remained unrepentant on a whole host of others.
JUL24	Brexit highlights Ireland’s divisions. But sport shows how united we can be	Depressed about Brexit? There’s always golf. As Brexit threatens the economic – and actual – security of Ireland, north and south, maybe what we can lean into a little more on this island is the unifying power of sport. Sport in Ireland overlaps with identities in curious ways, but there are many moments when perceived divisions can fade into the green distance, like a man from Offaly being cheered on at a course in Northern Ireland, about to win the Open. Tricolours being waved at Royal Portrush, a chorus of “olés ?, videos of Shane Lowry grinning as the Fields of Athenry is sung. Meanwhile, Lowry’s grandmother Emily Scanlon offered the most Irish of all anecdotes regarding sports nutrition on the Irish station RTÉ. “I remember I minded him while the mother was working, ? she said. “I had a turf box in the corner beside the range, and when I’d go up to the clothesline I’d put him into it, and he’d have all the turf mould ate ... whether it worked his immune system or what, I don’t know. He got there anyway. Great gossoon [young boy] he was. ? Turf mould may not be the next carrageen moss, but the moments sport can offer up, on their day, are some tonic.
JUL24	How social media echo chambers fuelled the rise of Boris Johnson	Lots of people tell me they don’t read the news any more. Lots of people tell me they can’t believe what is happening: that Donald Trump may get another term, that Boris Johnson will almost certainly soon be prime minister, that we may crash out of Europe. They tell me earnestly that someone they know who voted leave now wishes they hadn’t, so a second referendum will be a remain landslide. Or they tell me Jeremy Corbyn will make it all better. Or that they have never met an antisemite. Or that white, working-class people (who all live up north) are to blame for everything. Or that it is the fault of Eton’s spawn, or the mainstream media, which of course is me. I am actually related to some of the people telling me these things. Often, I suck it up. After all, journalism is 90% listening – the rest is just showing off. Then, gratefully, I return to my bubble and wonder what it will take to burst theirs.
JUL24	The world is literally on fire – so why is it business as usual for politicians?	Do you remember when the weather was a reliable source of innocuous small talk? “Hot today, isn’t it?” you would observe to a colleague as you stood awkwardly in the lift together. They would reply with something about the garden needing rain, then you would go back to ignoring each other. Talking about the weather was uncontroversial. It was safe. It was oddly soothing. Sadly, there is nothing soothing about the weather any more; every day seems to bring new record-breaking temperatures or extreme conditions. June was the hottest month recorded on Earth; July is on course to break that record. The Arctic is having a sweltering summer that has sparked unprecedented wildfires. According to the World Meteorological Organization, these fires emitted as much carbon dioxide in one month as the whole of Sweden does in a year.
JUL24	The government wants to deport rough sleepers. We must resist this immoral act	In the diocese of Liverpool we see the struggle for a just society as a direct outworking of our faith in Jesus Christ – who fed the hungry and cared for the poor. That’s why we say we’re asking God for a bigger church so we can make a bigger difference. For me, then, the health of a just society is measured by the way it treats the poorest, those on the edge of things. That’s why I support the mayor of Liverpool, his colleagues and 10 other councils across the country who are refusing to share sensitive personal data on non-UK rough sleepers with the Home Office.
JUL24	The fightback for liberal Britain begins here. Jo Swinson can lead it	While we all obsess about Britain’s new Brexiteer Conservative government, don’t lose sight of this: under Jo Swinson, the new leader they have just elected by a clear majority, the Liberal Democrats have a chance of leading a fightback for liberal Britain. The great unrepresented liberal Britain, that is, that people around the world admire and miss. To achieve this, the Lib Dems must dramatically raise their game, reaching parts of a troubled country that they have not touched for a century. “The Strange Death of Liberal England” is one of the most memorable book titles in British political history, so I am tempted to conjure up The Strange Rebirth of Liberal England. But liberal England never died, and nor did liberal Scotland – whence Swinson comes – and liberal Wales. Indeed, the British Social Attitudes survey shows that, in attitudes to sexual orientation and ethnicity, British society has become more liberal in recent decades.
JUL25	Think Johnson's 'blue terror' reshuffle means a no-deal exit? Think again	With the number of cabinet sackings far exceeding the Tory majority in the Commons, Boris Johnson has started his reign as prime minister by unleashing a blue terror. With Dominic Raab as his deputy and foreign secretary and Priti Patel as home secretary, Johnson’s cabinet is the quintessence of remainer nightmares. Some will say this means an immediate general election is likely, interpreting a sharp pivot to the right as an attempt to outflank Nigel Farage and his Brexit party. These appointments sound the no-deal klaxon so loudly that it will be heard unequivocally in Brussels.
JUL25	This is a Vote Leave government now. There will be no one else to blame	The Queen’s first prime minister was Winston Churchill. Her 14th is a Winston Churchill tribute act. So perhaps it’s no surprise that Boris Johnson’s debut performance as prime minister included a sub-Churchillian riff, extolling Britain’s readiness not to fight the Nazi menace but to cope with a no-deal exit from the European Union. “The ports will be ready and the banks will be ready and the factories will be ready and business will be ready and the hospitals will be ready,” he said, until one half-expected him to declare that we shall be ready on the beaches, we shall be ready on the landing grounds, we shall be ready in the fields and in the streets and in the hills. But if Johnson has always wanted to be Churchill, the address he delivered on the steps of Downing Street and his first exercise of raw prime ministerial power suggest he wants to be two other people too. Throughout his six-week campaign for the Conservative leadership, friends and enemies alike wondered which Johnson would prevail: would it be the twice-elected mayor of London, who won over a Labour-voting, progressive city, or would it be the leader of the Vote Leave campaign, whose lies and insults have led the US president himself to hail him as the British Trump? The complexion of his first cabinet suggests victory for the latter. But there are also signs that he wants to be both, that – not for the first time – he wants to have his cake and eat it.
JUL25	Boris Johnson’s optimism is a sales pitch that can only disappoint	It is clear now that Boris Johnson has a straightforward and easily understood plan to solve the hitherto intractable problem of Brexit. In fact he has the same solution for most if not all of the problems that assail this country. The answer is optimism – or “optimism on steroids”, the medicine his colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg recently prescribed for his soon-to-be leader. This is a peculiarly American solution to a very British problem, and raises yet another parallel between Johnson and his American partner in coiffure, rhetoric and political style, Donald Trump. Much has been written about the similarities between the two leaders – the trimming of reality to convenience, the highly malleable (indeed reversible) points of principle, the charisma and appeal to the mob. But somehow it is the repeated sanctifying of optimism I find most disturbing.
JUL25	Britain is boiling, and ditching the duvet won't solve the problem	Buckle in, Britain: it might have been late getting started, but it looks like we’re set for another sweltering summer, with record-breaking highs of 37C forecast for Thursday. By this point, you know the drill: swap the duvet for a sheet (and a shared bed for a single), wear shorts if your employer allows, carry water with you on the train, and get off at the next stop if you’re feeling unwell. The temperature will drop eventually; in the meantime, the spirit is broadly one of keep calm and carry on. We’ve been here before. Last year was marked not just by England’s rocket-fuelled run through the football World Cup, but the concurrent six-week spell from late June to mid-August, when daytime temperatures in parts of Britain consistently topped 30C (86F). Even climate deniers were perturbed. That summer was  the joint hottest on record. But then the mercury dropped, bringing with it relief – from the discomfort of the sweltering heat, yes, but also having to confront the visceral threat of climate crisis.
JUL25	As co-working spaces colonise cities, are workers paying the price?	Co-working isn’t just booming – it’s taking over our cities. The co-working space provider WeWork is the biggest occupier of office space in London after the government. It has surpassed JP Morgan as the top commercial real estate holder in New York. This week we learned it is being paid £55m in “inducements” to fill Brexit-related office vacancies in Canary Wharf. It’s not just WeWork. Amsterdam-based Spaces (Regus’s answer to WeWork) just unveiled 9,000 sq ft of co-working spaces in New York’s Chrysler building and is speedily adding new locations across Eastern Europe and Asia and the Pacific to its already impressive arsenal.
JUL25	Looking at naturists can be life threatening – as I found out to my cost	Parisian naturists in the Bois de Vincennes have complained about voyeurs ruining things for them. Nudists have been allowed to do their thing in the park for two years, but it seems they are being spied upon. I sympathise, but also wonder – in the spirit of an age-old conundrum – if nudists in a forest are actually nudists at all if no one is watching them. If you are hidden away, in your own special area, you kind of invite fascination. How much better if there were nudists everywhere. In 1992, I cycled from Hamburg to Zagreb, passing through both Germanys (though united by then, they felt very different), the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary. I saw many wondrous things along the way, none more so than a small urban park I pedalled past in the middle of Berlin. It was a sunny autumn lunchtime and the park was busy with office workers taking a break. Doing a comedy double-take, I saw that many of these people had removed all their clothes and were sunbathing quite naked. All sizes and shapes of birthday suits were on display.
JUL25	Boris Johnson can use his affinity with Trump to calm the crisis over Iran	Boris Johnson is taking the helm with an urgent crisis brewing in the Gulf, where Iran’s seizure of a British oil tanker threatens to pull the UK and the international community into the escalating friction between Washington and Tehran. But in crisis there is opportunity, and the new prime minister should use his affinity with Donald Trump to de-escalate responsibly while reinforcing the battered transatlantic relationship around Iran. Tehran has accused the tanker, the Stena Impero, of colliding with a fishing boat and violating international regulations. However, the seizure came shortly after Iranian leaders threatened to retaliate for the British seizure of an Iranian-flagged vessel in Gibraltar over suspicions that the ship had violated European Union sanctions on Syria.
JUL25	Boris Johnson: the clown is crowned as the country burns in hell	Well, here we are then. Someone who could easily be rejected as a Guess Who character for looking too ridiculous is now to lead the country. A man whose DNA profile is the exact same as a Bernard Manning joke. A man who mentioned the 20 hustings he had taken part in, approximately 30 seconds after Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis talked of the 16 hustings held. With 8,000 members of the Johnson family watching on – and Jeremy Hunt, looking for all the world like a sub who’s never gonna get off the bench and knows it – Boris Johnson was announced as the new leader of the Conservative party, and, in short order, the new prime minister. Elected by a staggering 0.2% of the nation, we can’t say it isn’t the will of the people.
JUL25	Who’s Matt Hancock? The health secretary’s only legacy will be how quickly he’s forgotten	I have never seen such an empty vessel as a cabinet minister”. This is one NHS chief executive’s verdict on Matt Hancock’s stint as health and social care secretary. It is a harsh judgment, but it reflects a widespread view among NHS bosses that if Boris Johnson’s imminent formation of his first government leads to Hancock leaving for another job, few will miss him. Whether he stays or leaves, history will judge his first, possibly only, year running the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) as something odd in ministerial tenures – an irrelevance. Hancock is neither liked nor respected by those running NHS trusts. They disliked Andrew Lansley and hated his health and social care bill, but acknowledged his deep thinking about the health service and intense preparation for being the health secretary. They had misgivings about Jeremy Hunt for his alienation of staff in pursuit of the government’s ambition of a “seven-day NHS”, but belatedly respected him for him getting to grips with diffcult issues and ending the NHS’s austerity funding.
JUL25	Only when we laugh: now even dad jokes can be funny	There are few things more likely to raise the hackles of a comedy snob than the notion of “canned laughter”. A sitcom with a laugh track – not so much canned, these days, as a recorded live audience reaction – implies that it will be an old-fashioned sort of comedy. We are living in an era that rewards a more naturalistic approach. Gag-soaked sitcoms such as 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which barely give you time to honk before moving on to the next one-liner, do not feel the need to guide you to the punchline.
JUL26	This is no normal transition of power. It’s a hard Brexit coup	The passing of Theresa May and the ascension of Boris Johnson may have appeared to the casual observer as a colourful but nevertheless essentially conventional piece of British political continuity. The public decencies, insofar as such words can ever be used in connection with Johnson, were in place. The dignified but hapless former prime minister departed to the echo of the now traditional round of applause from MPs. The outgoing leader’s car entered Buckingham Palace to the solemn lilt of Huw Edwards’s commentary as her successor waited in the wings to kiss hands. On the face of things, these were the familiar rituals of peaceful transition in British politics. Yet no one should have been taken in by the show this time. For this is a political transition unlike any other. It is a massive rupture, not a seamless progression. Its outcome is dark-clouded in uncertainty. Any idea that the events of 24 July 2019 embody the same timeless magic of the peaceful passing of parliamentary power that constitutional experts like to celebrate is for the birds. For this is an unprecedented partisan seizure of power by the radical part of the Conservative party that seeks Brexit whatever the cost. It is a hard Brexit coup dressed up as politics as usual.
JUL26	Snakes, stupidity and sycophants: the horror of the Johnson cabinet	Another day, another horror. The new cabinet has met for the first time. Oh, and Boris Johnson has made his Commons debut as prime minister. Horrors plural, then. We’re living in a Hammer film, my friends, but one looped over and over, where the protagonist enunciates only using vowel sounds and stuttering, and the plot is him wreaking revenge on a nation because he once lost a game of fives and has never gotten over it. Here is all the action from the day. I am so, so sorry.
JUL26	We’ve yet to work out how to oppose Boris Johnson. It won’t be easy	Who wants to be a doomster? Or a gloomster? Get some pluck. Get in a spitfire. Be a king. Buck up. Make Britain Great Again. Boris Johnson’s stream of consciousness speech outside No 10, followed by the night of the long knives, was actually a manifesto, followed by some swift stabs to the heart of those who possibly possess a modicum of talent. I have read the character assassinations – God knows I have written many myself, but they never really do the trick, as character implies something solid and this prime minister is a shapeshifter. His personality is whatever it needs to be. I christened him “Borisconi” years ago for his absolute grip on both politics and the media, and the endless affairs. Of course he recognised in Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi what he himself would ape. Raw power. He once wrote of Berlusconi’s “fantastic, volcanic, American self-propulsion”, and of how he stands for “optimism and confidence”. How is that in itself a political position? Somehow it now is. There is no point in denying it.
JUL26	This is a Vote Leave government now. There will be no one else to blame	The Queen’s first prime minister was Winston Churchill. Her 14th is a Winston Churchill tribute act. So perhaps it’s no surprise that Boris Johnson’s debut performance as prime minister included a sub-Churchillian riff, extolling Britain’s readiness not to fight the Nazi menace but to cope with a no-deal exit from the European Union. “The ports will be ready and the banks will be ready and the factories will be ready and business will be ready and the hospitals will be ready,” he said, until one half-expected him to declare that we shall be ready on the beaches, we shall be ready on the landing grounds, we shall be ready in the fields and in the streets and in the hills. But if Johnson has always wanted to be Churchill, the address he delivered on the steps of Downing Street and his first exercise of raw prime ministerial power suggest he wants to be two other people too. Throughout his six-week campaign for the Conservative leadership, friends and enemies alike wondered which Johnson would prevail: would it be the twice-elected mayor of London, who won over a Labour-voting, progressive city, or would it be the leader of the Vote Leave campaign, whose lies and insults have led the US president himself to hail him as the British Trump? The complexion of his first cabinet suggests victory for the latter. But there are also signs that he wants to be both, that – not for the first time – he wants to have his cake and eat it.
JUL26	Don’t be fooled by Johnson’s ‘diverse’ cabinet. Tory racism hasn’t changed	Boris Johnson’s new team has been labelled a “cabinet for modern Britain” – a euphemism for non-white, with figures such as Priti Patel, Sajid Javid, James Cleverly and Alok Sharma appointed, and Munira Mirza made head of the No 10 policy unit. While all this diversity may well make cabinet look more representative of the UK population, it should not divert attention from the serious issues of racism within the party and with Johnson himself. Lest we forget, the new prime minister has described African people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles” and compared Muslim women wearing the burqa to “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”. Surrounding himself with a few black and brown cabinet ministers may be good for optics, but it should be easy enough to see through the mirage.
JUL26	Boris Johnson is mere bluster. It’s Labour that is offering real optimism for the UK	It was a typical Boris Johnson performance in the Commons today, all waving arms and blustering rhetoric. It’s nothing new – we’re used to him offering us dead cats, or even kippers. But it shouldn’t disguise the fact that he is committed to a dangerous, hard-right agenda.
JUL26	Our writers give their verdict on Boris Johnson’s new cabinet	Is he serious? You could almost hear the country asking the question as Boris Johnson doled out his big cabinet jobs. As home secretary, we now have Priti Patel, who broadcast her logic-free support for the death penalty on primetime TV. Our new foreign secretary is Dominic Raab, the intrepid soul who apparently only recently discovered the existence of Calais. In charge of the Treasury is Sajid Javid, the ex-investment banker who went off on a jolly to Australia while steelworkers at Port Talbot were facing the dole. In this government of none of the talents, these gaffe-prone, substance-free caricatures will have free rein. As trade secretary, Liz Truss will finally be able to introduce import substitution for British cheese. Priti will doubtless cover Dominic’s job in her family holidays.
JUL26	Will Dominic Cummings turn No 10 into a Nasa-style control centre?	Might one of Boris Johnson’s first acts as prime minister be to renovate the offices in No 10? According to his new senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, one simple way to improve the UK government is changing the spaces where decisions are made. If Cummings gets his way, out would go the polished wood tables, fireplace and ticking antique clocks. In would come banks of screens, predictive computer models and untested cognitive tools. Downing Street could look like more like a Nasa control centre than a stately home. And that’s not all he would change. Cummings has gone so far as to suggest one of his primary motivations for involving himself in Brexit was the once-in-a-half-century opportunity it would allow to fundamentally reform the British state. Over the years, he has repeatedly criticised Whitehall as achingly slow, blindly driven by the news cycle, staffed by ineffective conformists, oblivious to evidence, and out of touch with advances in technology. He thinks the civil service is staffed by “hollow men” who are incapable of thinking wisely about big problems and acting on them.
JUL26	I flipped burgers at McDonald’s – and discovered the joys of insubordination	There was, I discovered on obtaining a holiday job at McDonald’s before embarking on A-levels, an immediate benefit and a simultaneous disbenefit. The benefit was that on joining and becoming a “crew member” you were given – free of charge – a uniform. The disbenefit was that, on each shift, you had to wear it. The trousers were capacious, the top deep blue and white with a stripy pattern. This, according to HR magazine , was Ronald McD’s attempt to utilise “primary colours and pin stripes, in line with the tailored feel of the power-suit.” But even with the boat-shaped hat that made you look like one of the Tracy family in Thunderbirds, there really wasn’t much power in that outfit. And it wasn’t much of a suit. No wonder people dressed at work or arrived in outsized overcoats. I did hot and gruelling shifts cooking the burgers required for hamburgers, cheeseburgers and Big Macs
JUL26	Don't despair over Boris Johnson – it's time for hope	Sterling slipped just a little on confirmation of Boris Johnson’s ascent, but another currency plunged: optimism. His was a triumph of self-belief, buoyed by privilege and untethered to ability or vision, magical thinking without any magic or any thinking. “We are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self-doubt and negativity,” he declared in his victory speech, “with better education, better infrastructure, more police, fantastic full-fibre broadband sprouting in every household.” It’s hard to say which aspect of this list was more revealing – its lack of ambition or the scepticism it prompted over his capacity to deliver even minor improvements to the nation’s broadband. Who even among his newly minted cabinet truly believes the central pledge of his premiership: a Brexit, deal or no deal, that boosts anything apart from the Conservative party or its new leader? In peddling Brexit lies in place of genuine aspiration, Johnson has devalued hope itself. Enthusiasm among a rump of musty old Marxists for a no-deal Brexit to speed the revolution amplifies this effect by ignoring the inevitable toll it would exact on everyone, especially the most vulnerable. Yet hope – grounded in reality – remains the best and only antidote to the regressive rightwing populism now flourishing on both sides of the Atlantic. Switching off the news may feel like self-care, but the surest way to feel better is to make things better. Optimism is a political choice that anyone with the time and resources to be active must take – right now. You’ll find this surprisingly easy once you stop thinking in terms of what can’t be done and focus on what you can do.
JUL27	Boris Johnson is uniting leave. Labour must do the same for remain	Take 10 paces back and ask yourself, what just happened? Only when you appreciate what the Conservative party has just done can you begin to consider how Labour, and the other opposition parties, should respond. Indeed, the clearer the Tory move becomes, the more obvious the duty of the opposition. Two months ago, the Tories were crushed in the European elections, their vote share reduced to just 9%. Their problem was that a rival had emerged, making a much clearer pitch on the great question of the age, namely Brexit. Beaten by Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, the Conservatives reacted swiftly. They dumped a leader deemed insufficiently full-throated on Brexit, replacing her with one whose message is unambiguous. Boris Johnson has now taken office and appointed a new cabinet that leaves no doubt on Brexit: the new government is fully committed not only to leaving the European Union, but to leaving on 31 October with or without a deal “do or die”.
JUL27	An election looms – and Labour must act now to puncture Johnson’s hubris	A general election is coming, and Boris Johnson’s ruthlessness in preparing for it has provoked private pangs of jealous admiration among prominent leftwingers. There’s no messing around here: opponents and critics have been purged and an unapologetic hard-right, ultra-Brexit administration has been formed. Where Jeremy Corbyn would be denounced for Stalinist authoritarianism, Johnson is applauded for strong decisive leadership. Life is easier, I suppose, when you have most of the press and your own MPs enthusiastically on side. Today’s Sun newspaper splashes with Johnson’s face superimposed on an image of the sun, with the headline “JOHNSUN”: Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea’s ruling party, would have been too embarrassed to print something so fawning. The funeral rites for Corbynism are being read by those who seem to have forgotten that, just over two years ago, the election campaign began with Theresa May enjoying higher approval ratings than Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher at their peak, and with Labour 24 points behind the Tories. In some current polls, Labour is still ahead. 
JUL27	Inside and outside cabinet, there are Tories worrying if they’ve done the right thing	Who is in the most turmoil in the Tory party? Is it the moderate Tory MPs who decided to leave government this week in protest at Boris Johnson’s policies; or their colleagues who thought it better to accept a ministerial job? Talking privately to both groups, it’s clear that neither side really knows who made the right decision. “I’m so up and down at the moment,” says one former minister. “I’m not sure if I’ve done the right thing. But I’ve done something and I suppose I had better live with it.” Others are celebrating publicly by going to the cricket, while another has been joking that they now have the “freedom to spend all weekend having sex” – though it’s not clear whether this would have been prohibited in a Johnson government.
JUL27	The Spice Girls really do have a positive message. It just took me 20 years to get it	I was 19 when the Spice Girls’ first single came out and already outside the upper age limit of their target market. I remember seeing the video for Wannabe, and being a bit sniffy about it. “Girl power” was a bogus PR ploy, Geri’s espousal of Thatcherism was absurd, and all that cavorting with Nelson Mandela at the famous 1997 press call was just the bloody end. The push-up bras and belly rings are as cartoonish in their way as any made-for-kids’ TV
JUL27	How Russia spreads disinformation via RT is more nuanced than we realise	The £200,000 fine handed out by Ofcom to the TV network RT (formerly Russia Today) for repeatedly breaching impartiality rules over its coverage of the Skripal poisoning is a powerful reminder of the tactics Russia employs to manipulate public opinion in the west. The daily deluge of disinformation produced by RT and Sputnik is a vital component of the tactics that other authoritarian regimes are seeking to replicate. Monitoring and measuring the output of these state-controlled broadcasters is vital to understand how hostile nations are attempting to influence audiences around the world by utilising fake news, disinformation and propaganda. A detailed analysis of the output of state-controlled media often reveals a fundamental disparity between Russian-owned outlets in the UK and the rest of Europe when comparing them to established news organisations. The volume of coverage, framing of coverage, and average engagement with that coverage is, at times, widely disparate.
JUL27	This hard-Brexit cabinet could spell disaster for British farmers	As Boris Johnson takes the spotlight in the umpteenth act of the tragicomic farce that is Brexit, one its most important plot lines remains dangerously offstage. None of the protagonists have articulated a compelling narrative about how we are going to feed ourselves in the future. Unnoticed, however, Johnson’s reshuffle has manoeuvred those with the most destructive, pernicious vision into the strongest positions. Should they make their move, it could soon be checkmate for British agriculture. Ever since Britain voted to leave the EU three long ago, those involved in farming have been aware that we are facing a fork in the road. One path offers the opportunity to build on our country’s comparatively high standards and compete on quality, sustainability and animal welfare. The other road requires us to sign up to free trade agreements on terms that suit our competitors, opening our borders to the worst horrors of industrial farming, symbolised (perhaps unfairly) by the spectre of chlorine-washed chicken. This would push British farmers either to lower their standards to compete or drive them out of business altogether.
JUL27	If you can’t stand the heat … stop being a climate emergency denier	Since Monday, Britain has felt like a sun-bloated packet of supermarket pasta salad: sweating and smelly, abandoned at the bottom of a dog-waste bin, by turns greasy, hot, unpleasant, swollen and revolting. I have seen topless men resting beaded armpits on bus poles, teenagers dipping their feet in bright-green canals that are so choked with weed they seem hardly wet, parks turned to hay, parents wiping screaming and heat-exhausted children with flannels outside long queues for swimming pools, and car parks littered with ice-cube bags and fizzy drink cans. I have smelled other people’s arse cracks and seen carrier bags of used cat litter create a fiesta of bluebottles around our communal bins. I have left imprints on other people’s furniture. In the words of my mother – who lived through the 1976 heatwave with my newborn sister – “It’s pretty hard to deny climate change in this.” But, my friends, if this week has taught us anything at all – other than that strange, slippery, silvery feel of under-breast condensation – it is that Britain is not ready to live at 38C; we are ill-prepared for our changing climate.
JUL27	This cabinet signals the death of David Cameron’s Tory modernisation project	When David Cameron took over as Tory leader in 2005, he inherited a party that was downhearted after three electoral defeats. It looked and felt out of touch with the nation, symbolised by having just 17 female MPs and two from ethnic minorities backgrounds. He proclaimed the need for modernisation of both party and policies, pledging to move back to the centre and give the parliamentary group a makeover. This was resisted by his foes on the hard right, some of whom even attacked the proclaimed pursuit of environmental reform. Cameron’s modernisation worked on one level. Look at Boris Johnson’s cabinet and it is heartening to see four cabinet ministers from ethnic minorities sitting round the table. He succeeds the second female prime minister, a politician who once rightly questioned if her party was really “at ease with 21st-century Britain”, while women hold several key posts in the new government. More than one in five Tory MPs are now female – still far too few but a big advance – along with 19 from ethnic minorities and the same number saying they are gay or lesbian.
JUL27	Classical music is overwhelmingly white and male. My orchestra shows that can change	Across the cultural landscape, the light of truth is working its way through the past. Historical inaccuracies, unattributed contributions and long-lost gems – all victims of male whitewashing – are being restored and reinstated. Hidden Figures, an Oscar-nominated film of 2016, shows the incredible contribution of three pioneering black women. Rosalind Franklin’s work, which enabled James Watson and Francis Crick to uncover DNA and claim a Nobel prize, has only recently been fully recognised, many years after her death. From art to science and beyond, the work of historically marginalised groups is being gloriously shared. Except within classical music, that is. And to compound matters, the errors of the past are being repeated today.
JUL27	Boris Johnson, tough on the economic causes of Brexit? Not likely	So farewell then, Project Fear. Out go the predictions of imminent economic catastrophe, in comes Mr Brightside and his vision of the sunny uplands that lie ahead. Before he became prime minister, Harold Wilson talked of how the Britain of the future would be forged in the white heat of the technological revolution. For Boris Johnson, it is full-fibre broadband. Little has changed since 1963. Then, as now, Britain was strong in science and rich in new ideas. Then, as now, it was less good than other countries at exploiting them. Wilson’s optimism drained away after he arrived in office, as Johnson’s may well also, and for the same reason: a sterling crisis. But for now the country will be love-bombed with the new prime minister’s can-do spirit.
JUL28	Europe’s Greens are on fire... and it’s not just because of the sweltering heat	As Europe suffers another summer of record-breaking heatwaves, it is worth reflecting on the group perhaps least happy to benefit from the soaring temperatures – Green parties across the continent, which are, however, in a better electoral position than ever. In May’s European parliament elections, the Greens won 22 more seats and 4.4% more of the vote than in 2014. Domestically, the German Greens participate in a majority of state governments and top national polling; the president of Austria is a Green-Independent and Greens have secured record vote shares in recent elections in Finland, Belgium and the Netherlands. They are also poised to pick up votes in forthcoming Swiss and Austrian elections. Although setbacks in Denmark and Sweden highlight the importance of national context, Greens have been gaining footholds outside their historical strongholds and are surging in polls in Ireland and the UK.
JUL28	Nigel Farage is the malign spectre haunting Boris Johnson’s new government	 ?We in this government will work flat out to give this country the leadership it deserves,” announced Boris Johnson in Downing Street. His would be a government of “pluck and nerve”. An authentically Conservative government whose “powers of organisation and determination” no one should underestimate. His government certainly should not be underestimated, but not for reasons Johnson can ever admit. It has no pluck, but what a nerve.
JUL28	Twitter won’t ruin the world. But constraining democracy would	Has the retweet ruined the world? Chris Wetherell, the software developer who built Twitter’s retweet button, thinks so. Introduced in 2009, retweeting transformed the social media landscape, he suggests, by allowing people to pass on information without having bothered to digest it. The result has been “the incentivising of extreme, polarising and outrage-inducing content”. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, is considering adopting “incentives” to “encourage more consideration before spread”. The debate over the retweet button may seem arcane and geeky. It is, though, a fascinating lens through which to understand many contemporary social issues. It reveals how social anxieties are often played out in debates about technology and how such debates reflect, and exacerbate, broader social prejudices.
JUL28	Is Boris Johnson really ready to take an enormous electoral gamble?	Boris Johnson’s appointment of a cabinet dominated by hardline Brexiters suggests he will adopt an uncompromising approach to Brexit, one that will be hard to deliver given the current composition of the House of Commons. But what if the goal is to change the Commons arithmetic via an early election? Could a “delivering Brexit” campaign win him a parliamentary majority and, if so, where would he need to win and what would the risks be? The balance of power in the polls is far more fragmented now than when Theresa May called an early election in June 2017. Both the Conservatives and Labour have fallen sharply and now find themselves in a four-way competition with the Brexit party, which rose to 20% support within months of its foundation, and the Liberal Democrats, whose anti-Brexit stance has become more popular as opinion has polarised. The Greens, another strongly anti-Brexit party, have also gained substantial ground.
JUL28	Carl Beech – the plausibility of liars and the paucity of proof	Carl Beech’s QC, Collingwood Thompson, was faced with a monumentally difficult task when, just before lunch on Friday, he rose to mitigate for the recently convicted serial child abuse accuser. One point he made was that the Metropolitan police policy that “complainants will be believed has had an influence on this whole case. With another approach, Mr Beech’s allegations would have been dismissed.” There is no harder task in advocacy than mitigating after a jury has convicted your client of every count on the indictment, and I am reluctant to criticise Mr Thompson, but the argument that the police should not have been so stupid as to take Beech seriously was probably best left to others.
JUL28	Female desire is all the rage. But are the stories still too driven by men?	What women want is a supposedly elusive mystery that has preoccupied writers for centuries. It’s the question posed to the rapist knight in Chaucer’s The Wife of Bath’s Tale, whose life depends on finding the “correct” answer. In the 2000 film What Women Want, knowing that was a telepathic gift magically bestowed on Mel Gibson’s sleazy ad executive by a freak accident, a sly suggestion that this is the only way a man could hope to understand the complexity of a woman’s desires. Nancy Friday’s 1970s books, My Secret Garden and its successors, supposedly lifted the lid on women’s fantasies, sold millions of copies and were received as either groundbreakingly feminist or damagingly anti-feminist, depending on who you asked. EL James’s astronomically successful Fifty Shades trilogy was credited with opening up a conversation about sexual power dynamics while reinforcing the most depressingly traditional and reactionary of them.
JUL28	It’s as if Hong Kong is now unmoored, so fast have the old ways unravelled	Recent scenes from Hong Kong might have come from an 1980s gangster film, with hundreds of white-shirted triad members rampaging through subway trains brutally beating all in their path with bamboo poles and metal rods. Yet this was no movie. The police were mysteriously absent and emergency services didn’t answer the 24,000 phone calls seeking help. By the end of last Sunday night, 45 people were in hospital.
JUL28	Rape victims deserve more support every step of their way to court	Pondering the continuing failure to bring rape cases to court, one can no longer ignore the issue of victim withdrawal. This is when, after taking the first daunting step of reporting rape, victims become so overwhelmed by the system that a significant number give up. What’s happening to rape’s “disappeared”? Why do they feel unable to continue with the process? According to Home Office figures, only one in 65 rape cases (less than 1.5%) reported to the police in England and Wales results in a summons or charge (down from one in seven in 2015). At the same time, significantly more people, many inspired by the likes of #MeToo, are reporting attacks – a rise of 61% between 2015 and 2019. So, while more possible rapes are reported, many cases are dropped or stopped by the police or the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), or victims themselves are withdrawing.
JUL28	Tessa Thompson: Valkyrie’s real superpower is coming out on screen	For the past couple of years, Tessa Thompson has been explaining that, as she is in the comic books, her Marvel Cinematic Universe character Valkyrie is a bisexual woman. “She’s bi. And yes, she cares very little about what men think of her. What a joy to play!” Thompson tweeted in 2017. In Thor: Ragnarok, arguably the best Marvel movie, especially if you enjoy Evil Cate Blanchett and humour. They even shot a scene that showed a woman leaving Valkyrie’s bedroom – Watch out, censors! Cover your eyes, prudes! – though it was cut from the final edit. When Marvel rolled out its fourth phase of superhero movies at San Diego Comic-Con last weekend, Thor: Love and Thunder sounded like an embarrassment of riches. Ragnarok director Taika Waititi remains at the helm, which is promising enough. Natalie Portman’s character, Dr Jane Foster, ends up with Thor’s powers, becoming Mighty Thor. And Valkyrie is back, as King of Asgard.
JUL28	SNP take note: the way to protect jobs is to look closer to home	Scotland’s first minister might be deploying Napoleon’s battlefield maxim in her approach to Boris Johnson: “Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.” You formed an impression of this with the letter she sent to Johnson after his coronation. “Scottish government analysis shows that a no-deal outcome could cost 100,000 Scottish jobs,” Nicola Sturgeon told him. “Even a free trade agreement could see a fall in Scottish national income of around £1,600 per person compared with continuing EU membership.” It remains to be seen how the new prime minister will respond, but Sturgeon will have predicted every word of it down to the Latin phraseology. She knows that jobs and the economy will once more be the main battleground on which the next independence referendum will be fought. Johnson will sound warnings about sowing further division during the period of post-Brexit uncertainty, while Sturgeon will say that an independent Scotland within the EU will be the basis of future prosperity.
JUL29	Boris Johnson’s crew will repel voters – there’s no need to fear him	He goes nuclear. Standing in Faslane Trident submarine base, finger on the button, our prime minister’s Brexit strategy is MAD, mutually assured destruction. His preposterously nicknamed “Brexit war cabinet” met for the first time on Monday. Every minister has been “turbocharged” to prepare for the great no-deal blitz in three months’ time. The idea is to terrify the enemy: the effect will be to petrify ourselves, shocking and awing us into understanding the full implications of no deal. “There are no areas of relevance to the economy where the UK, EU and the business community are prepared well enough for no deal,” a CBI report said on Monday. “No one is ready,” nor can they ever be, was the warning. A few sandbags will only hold back the flood waters briefly. In response, the government announced a £100m public awareness information bombardment: nine out 10 businesses and exporters are unprepared for no-deal obstacles – the road haulage licences, phyto-sanitary vet checks, pages of manifests and customs dockets to be stamped and authorised, delaying them at borders.
JUL29	Boris Johnson doesn’t really care about Scotland – he’s pushing it away	Like Theresa May before him in 2016, Boris Johnson has made the journey to Scotland very early in his prime ministership. Johnson went north this week to try to show how much he cares about what May called “our beloved union” and what he characteristically calls the “awesome foursome”. Like May, Johnson did this not because Scotland is inscribed on his heart, but because Brexit is threatening to revive the clamour for Scottish independence. If ever there was a case of trying to shut the political stable door after the horse has bolted, this is it. It is conceivable that, in 2016, a more flexible politician than May might have managed to reach some kind of accommodation with the Scottish parliament in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. It would, of course, have been a very tall order to persuade the nationalist-led government of a country that had voted strongly to remain to weaken its commitment to the EU. But if May had offered to devolve some powers direct from Brussels to Holyrood, had pursued a soft Brexit that kept Britain in the EU single market, and had not made an end to free movement a non-negotiable part of her stance, it is possible – no more than that – that the mood in Scotland might not have shifted towards independence in the way it has now begun to do.
JUL29	The Vote Leave gang now running Britain do not want to govern. They want to win	Life moves pretty fast, as the philosopher Ferris Bueller observed. A week ago, the question was: how come 160,000 Tory members were about to choose the next prime minister? Today, the question is: how come we are suddenly being governed by a rightwing populist single-issue campaign group? In the past few days it has become quite clear that, at heart, Boris Johnson’s new government is essentially a reunion party for the Vote Leave gang that triumphed in the 2016 EU referendum.
JUL29	Putin’s treatment of protesters and rivals shows weakness, not strength	Vladimir Putin is no ordinary two-faced politician. For Russia’s Janus-like president, double-speak, disingenuousness and duplicity are a way of life. For 20 years, he has shown himself the master of having it both ways. But is he about to be found out? As riots shake Moscow, with the promise of more to come, is an end to the long, dark night of the Putin supremacy a dawning possibility? On the infrequent occasions when Putin openly presents himself to the Russian public, he cultivates the persona of a caring, fatherly figure, not unlike a tsar, valiant in the cause of people and nation. Kremlin publicists project images of a bare-chested, no-nonsense tough guy and stern, stalwart patriot, as was the case on Sunday when he was pictured reviewing a St Petersburg naval parade.
JUL29	From Brexit hoarding to Iran’s uranium stores: why stockpiling is a heap of trouble	These days our fears, being spoilt for choice, can take many shapes and sizes. Mine have settled on a vague image of an ill-fated stash – a giant heap of trouble. Is the age of the terrible stockpile upon us? The stockpile exudes foreboding. Recently Iran confirmed that its uranium stockpile had exceeded the limit originally set by the 2015 nuclear deal. You’ll also remember this concept – as mundane as a store cupboard, as frightening as a cache of semi-automatics – from the many news stories about Brexit no-deal “preparations”: carmakers gathering parts; supermarkets amassing nonperishable goods.
JUL29	How can the Tories' moralising report on prostitution completely ignore austerity?	When Conservative MP Fiona Bruce chairs an inquiry into sex work, you don’t hold your breath for a triumph of progressiveness. This is a politician who is anti-abortion and has repeatedly voted against equal marriage. And yet the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission report, The Limits of Consent: Prostitution in the UK, published last week, still shocked in its lack of impartiality. At least the authors were upfront about their commitment to ideology over evidence, claiming decisions around public policy “cannot be resolved with reference to evidence alone” and instead undertaking a deep-dive into “the ethical questions around prostitution”.
JUL29	What Jacob Rees-Mogg's language rules reveal about him	Jacob Rees-Mogg must be in seventh heaven right now. His obsession with anachronistic rules and rituals finally has a professional justification. Boris Johnson has made him leader of the House of Commons, a British institution more steeped in arcane ritual than almost any other. He even has a bonus title, Lord President of the Council, complete, no doubt, with complicated modes of address. I’m sure he’s checked the entry in Debrett’s and will be correcting anyone who gets it wrong. Because he’s a stickler for that kind of thing: it emerged at the end of last week that he has a list of banned words and style rules that he asks members of staff to apply in written communication. (How he polices oral communication is unknown. One thing I would say: it’s probably best to avoid asking him where the toilet is.)
JUL29	Not one of the Fortnite World Cup's 100 finalists was a woman. Why?	This weekend the best Fortnite players in the world gathered at Flushing Meadows in New York to compete in the game’s first ever World Cup Finals for $30m (£24m) in prize money. Tens of thousands of spectators packed the famed Arthur Ashe stadium to watch the action live, and many millions more viewed on Twitch and YouTube. Fortnite is, after all, one of the biggest entertainment brands on the planet, played by hundreds of millions. Amid all the hype and fanfare around the finals, however, one depressing fact remained unavoidable: not a single one of the 100 finalists was female. Despite the growing popularity of professional gaming throughout the world – the audience figures for competitive gaming have reached 450m this year – female competitors remain scarce. There certainly are high-profile examples of female pros – trans woman Sasha “Scarlett” Hostyn is one of the most successful Starcraft II players in the world; Katherine “Mystik” Gunn is the industry’s highest-paid female pro gamer and won the SyFy channel’s reality TV show WCG Ultimate Gamer; and Fortnite has stars such as One_Shot_Gurl and Loeya. But you could watch a year of big tournaments, whether it’s Call of Duty, League of Legends or Hearthstone, and count the number of female competitors on the fingers of one hand.
JUL29	It’s time for business to show some spine and come out against a no-deal Brexit	Boris Johnson, Brexit and no deal are now ingrained in the national psyche. The government is to launch a mass advertising campaign aiming to “prepare” us for crashing out of Europe. Blitz spirit. Tin hats. Nothing that a bit of optimism won’t solve. In 2016, the EU referendum result was seen by many as the worst UK foreign policy calamity since Suez, an egregious act of economic self-harm. It would cause irreparable damage to Britain’s place in the world. Business groups went into emergency session, expressing their dismay and trying to work out what to do for their members. I was then running the UK’s creative industries body, 96% of which had backed remain. What would happen to Britain’s much vaunted openness? How would we continue to attract global talent?
JUL29	I've seen how cannabis legalisation works in Canada. Britain could do it better	Picture two 19-year-old men living in the same country, but in different worlds. One is in his second year at Oxford University, smoking cannabis in the garden of a house he shares with friends. The other is smoking in a side-street, away from the sixth-floor flat in Tottenham’s Broadwater Farm Estate, north London, he shares with his mum. The student’s night will end with a film and bag of Doritos, his dreams of becoming a Tory leadership candidate in 20 years intact. The second young man faces the very real possibility of a formal caution that could affect future employment and travel. In the worst case, he could get up to five years in prison for possession of a class B drug.
JUL30	Boris Johnson’s crew will repel voters – there’s no need to fear him	He goes nuclear. Standing in Faslane Trident submarine base, finger on the button, our prime minister’s Brexit strategy is MAD, mutually assured destruction.

In response, the government announced a £100m public awareness information bombardment: nine out 10 businesses and exporters are unprepared for no-deal obstacles – the road haulage licences, phyto-sanitary vet checks, pages of manifests and customs dockets to be stamped and authorised, delaying them at borders.
JUL30	Jeremy Corbyn, I no longer want to be a member of your Labour party	Dear Jeremy, Britain is in a moment of peril, the UK facing an existential crisis, a combination of Brexit and Boris Johnson reducing our country to a global laughing stock. I see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening, let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it. Whatever the denials, Johnson has embarked on a crash and burn strategy deliberately aimed at creating the circumstances for a general election – setting up the EU, parliament and the civil service, in a grotesque perversion of the truth, as the reasons he has no option but to call one.
JUL30	Boris Johnson doesn’t really care about Scotland – he’s pushing it away	Like Theresa May before him in 2016, Boris Johnson has made the journey to Scotland very early in his prime ministership. Johnson went north this week to try to show how much he cares about what May called “our beloved union” and what he characteristically calls the “awesome foursome”. Like May, Johnson did this not because Scotland is inscribed on his heart, but because Brexit is threatening to revive the clamour for Scottish independence. If ever there was a case of trying to shut the political stable door after the horse has bolted, this is it. It is conceivable that, in 2016, a more flexible politician than May might have managed to reach some kind of accommodation with the Scottish parliament in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. It would, of course, have been a very tall order to persuade the nationalist-led government of a country that had voted strongly to remain to weaken its commitment to the EU. But if May had offered to devolve some powers direct from Brussels to Holyrood, had pursued a soft Brexit that kept Britain in the EU single market, and had not made an end to free movement a non-negotiable part of her stance, it is possible – no more than that – that the mood in Scotland might not have shifted towards independence in the way it has now begun to do.
JUL30	The Vote Leave gang now running Britain do not want to govern. They want to win	Life moves pretty fast, as the philosopher Ferris Bueller observed. A week ago, the question was: how come 160,000 Tory members were about to choose the next prime minister? Today, the question is: how come we are suddenly being governed by a rightwing populist single-issue campaign group? In the past few days it has become quite clear that, at heart, Boris Johnson’s new government is essentially a reunion party for the Vote Leave gang that triumphed in the 2016 EU referendum.
JUL30	Putin’s treatment of protesters and rivals shows weakness, not strength	Vladimir Putin is no ordinary two-faced politician. For Russia’s Janus-like president, double-speak, disingenuousness and duplicity are a way of life. For 20 years, he has shown himself the master of having it both ways. But is he about to be found out? As riots shake Moscow, with the promise of more to come, is an end to the long, dark night of the Putin supremacy a dawning possibility? On the infrequent occasions when Putin openly presents himself to the Russian public, he cultivates the persona of a caring, fatherly figure, not unlike a tsar, valiant in the cause of people and nation. Kremlin publicists project images of a bare-chested, no-nonsense tough guy and stern, stalwart patriot, as was the case on Sunday when he was pictured reviewing a St Petersburg naval parade.
JUL30	From Brexit hoarding to Iran’s uranium stores: why stockpiling is a heap of trouble	These days our fears, being spoilt for choice, can take many shapes and sizes. Mine have settled on a vague image of an ill-fated stash – a giant heap of trouble. Is the age of the terrible stockpile upon us? The stockpile exudes foreboding. Recently Iran confirmed that its uranium stockpile had exceeded the limit originally set by the 2015 nuclear deal. You’ll also remember this concept – as mundane as a store cupboard, as frightening as a cache of semi-automatics – from the many news stories about Brexit no-deal “preparations”: carmakers gathering parts; supermarkets amassing nonperishable goods.
JUL30	How can the Tories' moralising report on prostitution completely ignore austerity?	When Conservative MP Fiona Bruce chairs an inquiry into sex work, you don’t hold your breath for a triumph of progressiveness. This is a politician who is anti-abortion and has repeatedly voted against equal marriage. And yet the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission report, The Limits of Consent: Prostitution in the UK, published last week, still shocked in its lack of impartiality. At least the authors were upfront about their commitment to ideology over evidence, claiming decisions around public policy “cannot be resolved with reference to evidence alone” and instead undertaking a deep-dive into “the ethical questions around prostitution”.
JUL30	What Jacob Rees-Mogg's language rules reveal about him	Jacob Rees-Mogg must be in seventh heaven right now. His obsession with anachronistic rules and rituals finally has a professional justification. Boris Johnson has made him leader of the House of Commons, a British institution more steeped in arcane ritual than almost any other. He even has a bonus title, Lord President of the Council, complete, no doubt, with complicated modes of address. I’m sure he’s checked the entry in Debrett’s and will be correcting anyone who gets it wrong. Because he’s a stickler for that kind of thing: it emerged at the end of last week that he has a list of banned words and style rules that he asks members of staff to apply in written communication. (How he polices oral communication is unknown. One thing I would say: it’s probably best to avoid asking him where the toilet is.)
JUL30	Not one of the Fortnite World Cup's 100 finalists was a woman. Why?	This weekend the best Fortnite players in the world gathered at Flushing Meadows in New York to compete in the game’s first ever World Cup Finals for $30m (£24m) in prize money. Tens of thousands of spectators packed the famed Arthur Ashe stadium to watch the action live, and many millions more viewed on Twitch and YouTube. Fortnite is, after all, one of the biggest entertainment brands on the planet, played by hundreds of millions. Amid all the hype and fanfare around the finals, however, one depressing fact remained unavoidable: not a single one of the 100 finalists was female. Despite the growing popularity of professional gaming throughout the world – the audience figures for competitive gaming have reached 450m this year – female competitors remain scarce. There certainly are high-profile examples of female pros – trans woman Sasha “Scarlett” Hostyn is one of the most successful Starcraft II players in the world; Katherine “Mystik” Gunn is the industry’s highest-paid female pro gamer and won the SyFy channel’s reality TV show WCG Ultimate Gamer; and Fortnite has stars such as One_Shot_Gurl and Loeya. But you could watch a year of big tournaments, whether it’s Call of Duty, League of Legends or Hearthstone, and count the number of female competitors on the fingers of one hand.
JUL30	It’s time for business to show some spine and come out against a no-deal Brexit	Boris Johnson, Brexit and no deal are now ingrained in the national psyche. The government is to launch a mass advertising campaign aiming to “prepare” us for crashing out of Europe. Blitz spirit. Tin hats. Nothing that a bit of optimism won’t solve. In 2016, the EU referendum result was seen by many as the worst UK foreign policy calamity since Suez, an egregious act of economic self-harm. It would cause irreparable damage to Britain’s place in the world. Business groups went into emergency session, expressing their dismay and trying to work out what to do for their members. I was then running the UK’s creative industries body, 96% of which had backed remain. What would happen to Britain’s much vaunted openness? How would we continue to attract global talent?
JUL31	Whenever Trump says ‘infested’, we know he’s talking about people of colour	I’ve never accused anyone of being prone to infestations. But if I were inclined to sink that low, I suspect my attention would be directed towards the 45th president of the United States. It’s not all Donald Trump’s fault. Who can blame anyone for spending most of their life in New York – a city I love, despite the fact that it harbours one rodent for every four people? Trump hardly had a choice about moving to the White House in 2017, home for two centuries, reportedly, to an unwanted population of rats, ants and even raccoons. Yet it’s hard to avoid holding Trump directly responsible for the wider range of public health hazards reported at his luxury Mar-a-Lago resort – 78 were reported in the three years to 2017, including soiled kitchen utensils and potentially parasite-affected smoked salmon. Hard, too, to ignore the fact that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been described as a “slum landlord” for the multiple health and safety violations reported in his family firm’s 9,000 Baltimore properties, including mice, maggots and mould.
JUL31	Boris Johnson dropping the Mark Field investigation is an insult to women	When I watched the video of Mark Field’s actions against the Greenpeace protester Janet Barker, I had a visceral reaction. Tears rushed into my eyes when confronted with the rage in his expression, the shock on her face. I wasn’t alone. Many women I spoke to saw the assertion of a brutal kind of male dominance. Some knew all too well the moment when a man aggressively decides that an outspoken woman must be put in her place. For those of us who know the reality of male violence against women, this looked like a moment when a pervasive culture of male entitlement escaped into the open.
JUL31	I could not be in a government that advocated a no-deal Brexit	A new prime minister enters Downing Street promising to help the less advantaged, bring prosperity and opportunity to every area of the country, and make a success of Brexit. Conservative MPs cheer, a new era begins and there is a bounce in the polls. Three years ago that was Theresa May, and the rest, as they say, is history. Our new prime minister is well versed in history, so undoubtedly he will know the famous quote that history repeats itself first as tragedy, then as farce. Last week I left the government. I would not have signed up to Boris Johnson’s pledge to leave the European Union on 31 October with no deal if necessary. Initially he said leaving without a deal was a “million-to-one” possibility. However, the rhetoric soon changed to the more confrontational tone of “do or die”. He has even rejected negotiations over a time limit to the Irish backstop. Now only a completely new withdrawal agreement would be acceptable. New red lines have been introduced for the political declaration that will shape our ongoing relationship with our former partners. There is talk of no-deal preparations being ramped up, but in reality these are mitigations.
JUL31	When I joined my father on the building site, I saw a different side to him	Sitting on a bag of sharp sand, I watched a group of three men pull out plastic boxes of sandwiches, packets of rolling tobacco, small newspapers and bars of chocolate. This was years before smartphones and so, during our mid-morning tea break, as my father squeezed the lukewarm bag of PG Tips between fat, dust-encrusted fingers, wringing out the last drops of caffeine, the group of builders around me chatted idly about traffic, the cost of petrol, a new one-way system, pubs, music, trips to the woodyard and their morning’s work. During my school holidays, or if I ever wanted some quick money for a haircut, holiday or new dress, I would spend a day or two working on a building site with my father. As a former labourer turned surveyor, he had been made redundant during the 90s recession and gone back to labouring. His jobs tended to be small, local and fairly eclectic - putting in a new fireplace, laying a floor, building a kitchen extension, converting an attic. From about April to September he worked in bare feet as much as he could; he listened to Radio 4 or compilation tapes of west African, blues, Pacific guitar, reggae, rock and roots music; he would take on several jobs at once and never once wore a hi-vis shirt.
JUL31	Leo Varadkar looks like an adult because the UK is acting like a spoilt toddler	In June, Leo Varadkar entered his third year as taoiseach: he’s now on his second British prime minister – and seemingly his 856th border impasse. Boris Johnson says the backstop Theresa May negotiated with the EU has to go, while the pro-Brexit ranks of ministers, backbenchers and press can’t decide whether Ireland’s leader is a bluffer, an EU stooge, or a tin-pot hardman drunk on power. What none of them has considered is the obvious truth: in a time when faith in politicians is collapsing in the UK, the rumblings, mumblings and bumblings of Brexit have strengthened Varadkar’s political position to a degree they can’t comprehend.
JUL31	#UnfollowTrump: why we should stop engaging with the US president on Twitter	Ohmygod, you are never going to believe what Donald Trump said on Twitter this morning! It sounded like it was written by an extremely racist and unusually stupid seven-year-old; nevertheless, it has already had a million retweets and 15 gazillion replies, and inspired approximately 10bn thinkpieces. That, my friends, is what you call an evergreen story. Every single day, the president of the US tweets bigoted and factually incorrect nonsense, and every single day, his tweets seem to constitute 50% of the news; we are stuck in a hellish groundhog day that rotates around Trump’s verbal diarrhoea. Important issues get shoved to the sidelines as we argue about whether Trump’s latest racist comment means he is a racist (spoiler: yes), hypothesise about what “covfefe” signifies or cackle over typos such as “Prince of Whales”.
JUL31	What’s in Boris Johnson’s £100m no-deal preparation leaflets? Here’s a taster	A few weeks ago, Boris Johnson insisted in one of the Conservative leadership hustings that the chances of o deal were a million to one against. Smash cut to him assembling a “war cabinet” to step up no-deal Brexit plans and work round the clock under the assumption that no deal is definitely going to happen. At this news the pound fell at an alarming rate, pretty much acting in the opposite manner to Johnson on a zipline, and hit a new 28-month low. On the bright side, we will soon hit parity with the euro, essentially finally joining to the currency by the back door, and it’s all thanks to Brexiteers.
JUL31	Hey Siri! Stop recording and sharing my private conversations	A news story in the Guardian last week confirmed what many Apple users likely already suspected: Siri, Apple’s voice assistant, has the power to record private conversations, and these audio clips aren’t always just stored on a server – a number of samples are passed along to third-party, human contractors who are paid to listen to them. This isn’t as simple as a voice assistant “spying” on its users: the report revealed that Apple’s contractors listen to the clips as part of the company’s quality control measures, working out whether Siri was triggered accidentally or on purpose, and whether its response was entirely correct. This practice is not explicit in Apple’s customer-facing privacy documentation, and due to errors in triggering Siri – “the sound of a zip”, the whistleblower said, can often set Siri off – contractors end up overhearing private conversations including drug deals, business meetings, sex and private medical appointments.
JUL31	Boris Johnson’s crew will repel voters – there’s no need to fear him	He goes nuclear. Standing in Faslane Trident submarine base, finger on the button, our prime minister’s Brexit strategy is MAD, mutually assured destruction. His preposterously nicknamed “Brexit war cabinet” met for the first time on Monday. Every minister has been “turbocharged” to prepare for the great no-deal blitz in three months’ time. The idea is to terrify the enemy: the effect will be to petrify ourselves, shocking and awing us into understanding the full implications of no deal. “There are no areas of relevance to the economy where the UK, EU and the business community are prepared well enough for no deal,” a CBI report said on Monday. “No one is ready,” nor can they ever be, was the warning. A few sandbags will only hold back the flood waters briefly. In response, the government announced a £100m public awareness information bombardment: nine out 10 businesses and exporters are unprepared for no-deal obstacles – the road haulage licences, phyto-sanitary vet checks, pages of manifests and customs dockets to be stamped and authorised, delaying them at borders.

I see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening, let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it. Whatever the denials, Johnson has embarked on a crash and burn strategy deliberately aimed at creating the circumstances for a general election – setting up the EU, parliament and the civil service, in a grotesque perversion of the truth, as the reasons he has no option but to call one.
AUG1	Boris Johnson’s threat of a no-deal Brexit will not break EU unity	No matter what Boris Johnson or his new Vote Leave cabinet threaten – and the expectation in Brussels is that no-deal planning will be ramped up in an attempt to intimidate other EU countries – be in no doubt: there isn’t time to limit the damage of a sudden severance from the world’s largest trading bloc this Halloween. Unless a further extension is requested, or article 50 is revoked by 31 October, when the current extension of UK membership expires, a dramatic shock awaits the global economy, and we all stand to lose. The few who may prosper are the wealthy bankers and hedge fund managers who have already bet on chaos.
AUG1	My sexual assault case was dropped because I wouldn’t hand over my phone	Vera Baird QC, the newly appointed victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, has been making headlines for her support of a civil liberties campaign which argues that rape case phone search requests amount to an “illegal digital strip search”. Police and prosecutors have warned that, in some cases, if victims do not allow the contents of their phones to be downloaded, their investigations may be abandoned. Just 1.5% of rape cases lead to a charge or summons. Today, the London rape review has said more must be done to end the excessive intrusion into personal data through the criminal justice service in rape cases. I reported my own sexual assault to the police with the intention of stopping a dangerous and sadistic predator from ever hurting another woman again. As part of my healing process I needed to take power back, but I ended up feeling more powerless after a two-and-a-half-year investigation that I can only describe as torture. The crown would make requests for deeply personal information, such as counselling notes, with the ultimatum that if I refused they wouldn’t pursue my case any more. This caused panic attacks and crippling anxiety, and my previously successful career began to suffer. Eventually my case was dropped because I refused to give the government access to the entire contents of my mobile phone. Many victims talk about their experiences with the criminal justice system being more traumatic than the assault itself. I share those sentiments because I was left feeling I could be raped with impunity.
AUG1	Blaming Leo Varadkar for no deal is bizarre – even for Britain’s media	Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, is being demonised by the Brexit-supporting section of the British press. His determination to stick by the backstop provision in the EU withdrawal agreement has particularly outraged the Daily Telegraph and the Sun. Both papers, with tacit support from the Daily Express, are engaged in a tactic familiar to those who, down the years, witnessed the treatment that has been handed out to homegrown politicians such as Tony Benn, Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock and, of course, Jeremy Corbyn.
AUG1	Should people without children be banned from Disney World?	If you’re not a fan of unbridled capitalism, please brace yourself: I am sorry to report that an EXTREMELY EMPHATIC Facebook post is going viral. The post in question is from an anonymous mother who is outraged people without kids have the temerity to holiday at Disney World. “It pisses me off TO NO END!!!!! When I see CHILDLESS COUPLES AT DISNEY WORLD,” she explains. “DW is a FAMILY amusement park!!!! Yet these IMMATURE millennials THROW AWAY THEIR MONEY ON USELESS CRAP!!!!!” The outburst appears to have been prompted by a woman “in some very SLUTTY shorts” buying a pretzel. This contributed to a very long pretzel queue, meaning our protagonist’s kid could not get their hands on a salty snack. “I fucking hate childless women with a BURNING PASSION!!!” the post ends. There are several angry emoji faces for emphasis. Just in case, you know, the exclamation marks didn’t do the trick.
AUG1	Whenever Trump says ‘infested’, we know he’s talking about people of colour	I’ve never accused anyone of being prone to infestations. But if I were inclined to sink that low, I suspect my attention would be directed towards the 45th president of the United States. It’s not all Donald Trump’s fault.

AUG1	I was only going to give up alcohol for a month but I wasn’t prepared for the impact it had	Now what? I have given up alcohol for a month. That’s nothing special. Thousands of people do Dry July or Feb Fast or some random month. But it is a big thing. I hadn’t had 30 days off alcohol my entire adult life. The reason I thought it was a good idea isn’t unique either. It’s boringly familiar. I’m middle aged and, after drinking modestly for decades, it had crept up. One glass of wine a night became two, and then three and – no point in skirting around the facts here – too often it was a bottle, sometimes more. Occasionally, if I was particularly anxious, I’d buy a bottle of wine during the day and drink the lot.
AUG1	Is this fascism? No. Could it become fascism? Yes	Amid the global rise of rightwing populism, “fascist” has become a common – indeed over-used – epithet. The F-word is convenient for critics of the new wave of populism, seeking as it does to tie their opponents to historical movements which nearly all of mainstream society regards as deplorable. But the word is convenient for the right too, allowing them to wave away their critics as overwrought and deranged while avoiding serious discussion of the substance of their policies and rhetoric. Even the Trumpified Republican party is not a fascist movement and Trump is certainly no Hitler. Full-blown fascism usually emerges under the pressure of economic collapse or existential war, but it is constructed from pre-existing social and political raw materials. But while the Trump era hasn’t seen the rise of a true fascism in the United States, it has given us sharp and painful insights into the raw materials out of which a future American fascism might be constructed.
AUG1	Police and the private security industry are too cosy for comfort	Two recent news stories have shone a light on the revolving door between the police and the security industry. The Guardian has revealed that Crossrail employed the security company Control Risks to keep tabs on union members who were campaigning to reinstate a sacked colleague. Emails released to the electrician Frank Morris show that this monitoring involved weekly briefings on the efforts by the Blacklist Support Group and Unite the union to win Morris his job back. Both Control Risks and Crossrail have denied this was anything more than using publicly available information from social media accounts.
AUG1	I could not be in a government that advocated a no-deal Brexit	A new prime minister enters Downing Street promising to help the less advantaged, bring prosperity and opportunity to every area of the country, and make a success of Brexit.

This was years before smartphones and so, during our mid-morning tea break, as my father squeezed the lukewarm bag of PG Tips between fat, dust-encrusted fingers, wringing out the last drops of caffeine, the group of builders around me chatted idly about traffic, the cost of petrol, a new one-way system, pubs, music, trips to the woodyard and their morning’s work. During my school holidays, or if I ever wanted some quick money for a haircut, holiday or new dress, I would spend a day or two working on a building site with my father. As a former labourer turned surveyor, he had been made redundant during the 90s recession and gone back to labouring. His jobs tended to be small, local and fairly eclectic - putting in a new fireplace, laying a floor, building a kitchen extension, converting an attic. From about April to September he worked in bare feet as much as he could; he listened to Radio 4 or compilation tapes of west African, blues, Pacific guitar, reggae, rock and roots music; he would take on several jobs at once and never once wore a hi-vis shirt.
AUG2	£2.1bn on no-deal preparations? It will seem like peanuts if Britain crashes out	The £2.1bn for no-deal planning announced by the government this morning is at once a sum that is obscenely big, and hopelessly small. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, was right to label it “an appalling waste of taxpayers’ cash”. It beggars belief that the government is spending billions – £6.3bn so far this year – on contingency planning in case it decides to take us into a self-imposed economic disaster that is entirely avoidable. On the other hand, if Boris Johnson is deluded enough to proceed with crashing Britain out of the EU without a deal – and many of his actions as prime minister suggest that he is – the couple of billion announced this morning will feel like small change compared with what the government and businesses will have to spend to mitigate the long-term economic pain of no deal.
AUG2	A Brighton drag artist in Bayreuth would not have fazed Wagner	Picture this. A black British drag artist, all decked out in a blond wig, high heels, pink tights and a tutu, takes a curtain call at the Bayreuth festival and is vigorously booed – and later horribly trolled – by the so-called Wagnerian ultras in an exclusive black-tie audience that includes the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, herself. This is not fake news or some invented nightmare hallucination. On the contrary, such an event actually took place last week at Richard Wagner’s own theatre in Bavaria, where lovers of the composer flock each summer to hear his works at what is without question the most written about opera festival of them all.
AUG2	No one should have to pay to pee: it’s time for a toilet fightback	You’re running late, you need to pee, but arriving at the toilet turnstiles, you realise that the lack of a shiny 50p piece prevents you from carrying out a basic bodily function. You join the cash machine queue, staring daggers at the guy who is in no rush to find his bank card. With a £10 note finally in the palm of your hand, you join another queue – to buy a KitKat, a Mars bar, whatever. After minutes of this palaver, you’re through the barrier, finally able to find relief. Annoying, sure: but what if you were a pensioner or disabled, and caught short? According to a report by the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) – appropriately titled Taking the P*** – a fifth of Britons don’t leave their home as often as they’d like because they know they’ll struggle to find facilities, a phenomenon known as “loo leash”. For those with medical conditions, this affects more than four in 10. Ever found yourself deliberately not drinking in case you get caught short? Over half the public intentionally dehydrate themselves for fear of not finding a loo, according to the report. By next year, 60% of government funding for local authority services will have vanished compared with 2010
AUG2	How antisemites hijacked my work with vulnerable Palestinian children	Earlier this year, I travelled to Palestine, working as a doctor, to investigate access to healthcare for Palestinians. While there, I was struck by the number of children undergoing some of the most invasive, difficult and painful procedures without their parents. I met a little girl having to undergo chemotherapy for months while her parents were left behind in Gaza – the only way to communicate with them via tablets, which have been put on the ward there specifically to deal with this widespread problem. There are premature babies in neonatal units who have never been held by their mothers, as they had to return to Gaza because their permits did not allow them to stay. When the worst happens, parents have to be told over the phone that their children have taken their last breath without them present. We must not abandon diplomacy at a time when Donald Trump is in the White House and Boris Johnson resides in No 10
AUG2	To understand violent men, talk to the women who know them	So what’s the plan? Has rape effectively been decriminalised in Britain? I think we should be told, because that’s what it looks like to me – and no one in authority is prepared to do anything except order another bloody review. How many reviews do we need? We all know the chances of any rapist being sent to prison are now vanishingly small. The mayor of London’s victims’ commissioner, Claire Waxman, has just published a report on the rapes reported to the Metropolitan police during a single month, April 2016. There were 501 in all, and only 3% led to a conviction – and even they, on average, took 18 months.
AUG2	Here's how Britain's broken housing system can be fixed in a decade	New figures released on Wednesday confirmed what we already knew: homeownership is becoming increasingly out of reach for young people. A survey by Santander found 70% of 18- to 34-year-olds now believe that homeownership is over for their generation. Our housing system has been allowed to degenerate to such an extent that secure and affordable housing is increasingly unavailable to working-class people, and in many places middle-class people too. But it’s not for a lack of ideas that this has happened. What we are lacking is the political will. Fifty years ago the country had a fairly stable housing system. The need for secure, affordable housing of the middle class was largely met through homeownership, and that of the working class through widely available social housing. But a reliance on the private market to deliver homes since the 1980s, and the loss of millions of social homes over recent decades, has destroyed this system.
AUG2	Dominic Cummings' war on the British civil service will undermine democracy	I’ve worked in the civil service for most of my adult life, including a stint working in the no-deal Brexit planning bunker Operation Yellowhammer back when we thought we’d crash out of the EU in March. But with a so-called war cabinet “turbo-charging” preparations in the 90 days before we all lurch into a Halloween no-deal meltdown, the UK body politic is in something of a state of shock. And there are no grownups in sight. After the night of the blond knives, “funereal” is the best word to describe the atmosphere in my patch of Whitehall. Boris Johnson has constructed his cabinet out of the most radioactive remnants of the leave campaign, starting with the installation of the leave campaign witch doctor, Dominic Cummings, at the heart of the No 10 policy machine. What happened? Was Moriarty unavailable? Had the burning Eye of Sauron already turned down the job because it wanted to “spend more time with the family”? It’s difficult to imagine a more alarming appointment – but it shouldn’t have been a surprise. 
AUG2	Expecting Ireland to be servile is part of a long British tradition	Boris Johnson’s approach to Ireland is part of an ignoble tradition in British politics. At its heart is the false assumption that superiority in resources and military prowess equates to a superiority in intellectual power and moral rectitude. In short, the idea that might is right and that, ultimately, Paddy should know his place. This assumption shaped and even, at times, dominated, policy on Ireland for centuries before independence. It runs through 19th-century British depictions of the Irish as incapable of self-government, unreliable, lazy and inferior. For Benjamin Disraeli, a British prime minister who shares some personal characteristics with the current incumbent, the Irish were “wild, reckless, indolent, uncertain and superstitious”. Most obviously, this sense of superiority and a refined “moral” stance was clearly manifest in government policy during the Great Famine of 1845-49, which caused the deaths of more than one million people on the island of Ireland.
AUG2	Millions are in deep poverty. Meanwhile, Johnson splurges £100m on advertising	You can tell a lot about a person by their priorities. It’s true with friends – say, the mate who ditches your birthday drinks for a date – but take a look at British politics, and it’s increasingly the case with ministers, or even the country. This week, the Social Metrics Commission released findings that reveal a national poverty crisis. More than 4 million people in the UK are trapped in what the researchers describe as “deep poverty”, meaning their income is at least 50% below the official breadline, locking them into a weekly struggle to afford the basics of life. Seven million people, including 2.3 million children, are affected by what it termed “persistent poverty” – people who are not only enduring poverty now, but who have lived in poverty for at least two of the previous three years.
AUG2	Should we worry about the robots and mind-reading apps remaking our world?	Technology changes so fast that our lives are radically different from even a decade ago, yet slowly enough that sometimes we don’t even notice the changes. We live in the future, in other words, and sometimes it takes a moment to realise what an odd, and perhaps unsettling, future it is. So I’m going to try laying it out for you in plain English.
AUG3	Labour’s best tactic to beat Boris Johnson? A popular front	Britain’s current political dynamics have been made crystal clear by the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection result. The Liberal Democrats won because Plaid Cymru and the Greens stood down, in an explicit electoral pact. The Tories could have inched it had the Brexit party also stood down. Labour, which never had a chance in this rural constituency, saw its vote share slump from 17% two years ago to just over 5%. With a majority of just one, it is now inevitable that Britain faces a snap general election – either because Boris Johnson’s government is defeated in the Commons or because, having achieved some shabby Brexit deal, he will seize the moment to look for an electoral mandate.
AUG3	This byelection result has narrowed the Tories’ route to election victory	The Brecon and Radnorshire byelection result was a surprise for many Tory MPs – but not because they lost. Instead, it’s because of how close they came to holding on to the seat. Ahead of the vote, the Conservatives had appeared to be following a beginner’s guide on how to lose byelections and alienate voters. The vote had been triggered by a recall petition after the incumbent Tory MP, Chris Davies, was found guilty of submitting fake expenses claims. The Conservative response? To reselect him as a candidate – rather than opt for a baggage-free contender. As for the campaign, it’s not as though the Tories went all out. MPs complain of a “defeatist” attitude in Conservative campaign headquarters. Boris Johnson made a perfunctory visit to the seat on his first trip to Wales as prime minister. A handful of Tory MPs tweeted that they would be out campaigning. The general mood was that the Liberal Democrats were on an unstoppable path to victory and the Tory working majority in parliament would be reduced to one. It followed that it was beneficial to have a candidate they could blame the loss on rather than a defeat that could be cast as the new leader falling short.
AUG3	Yes, a no-deal Brexit will hurt the economy. But nobody knows just how much	Predictions matter, not least because they feed directly into the political debate. We saw this all too clearly in 2016. And apocalyptic predictions matter even more when they don’t come true. The Treasury’s gloom-ridden short-term forecast in May 2016 of the impact of Brexit – not to mention its hysterical portrayal by the Treasury website – became the Brexiters’ best friend. And George Osborne’s promised “punishment budget” was rightly derided for being both bad economics and bad politics. Dire predictions of immediate job losses and indeed recession proved simply to be false. Even when the pound fell precipitately immediately after the referendum, it was easy for proponents of Brexit to point out that things were nowhere near as bad as some had predicted.
AUG3	As a 14-year-old chambermaid apart from my family, I had to grow up fast	I was 14 years old and had just received a long letter from my mother 3,000 miles away, saying that our authoritarian president back in Guyana had introduced stricter currency controls. This meant the family would not be able to get any money out to my elder brother and I for a while. I knew my parents had sacrificed and saved so much to give us the opportunity of safety and a good education in Britain, so I had to help. Along the seafront in Eastbourne, East Sussex, stood hotel after hotel. I was determined to get whatever job I could, but being only 14 I had to make myself look at least 16. I planned the job mission with precision. First, I went to a second-hand shop to buy more adult, smart-looking clothes – the choice was a white, lacy blouse and a black and white skirt. Shoes – smart black courts with a heel to make me look taller. I found a suitable pair but struggled to walk in them at all, so over the next few days I practised walking around the flat and down the road outside to get used to them. The result is that today I can practically run in high heels.
AUG3	The Lib Dems’ byelection victory offers a route to their resurgence	Over-interpreting byelection results is one of the things people in Westminster are best at. We know that these events exist in their own microclimate, where national issues often play second fiddle to local concerns and where voters feel free to act in a different way than at general elections, but still we can’t help ourselves. Liberal Democrats know this better than most: Paddy Ashdown’s byelection triumphs didn’t signal his inevitable rise to prime minister, and the Lib Dem victory in Eastleigh in 2013 was not an omen that the general election two years later wouldn’t be that bad for the party after all. In Brecon and Radnorshire there needs to be an extra note of caution added. I don’t know what god Lib Dem HQ was praying to in order to get a contest against a Conservative candidate who had just lost a recall petition after admitting fiddling his expenses, but I’d suggest they build it a bigger shrine. Throw in other remain parties not standing and we shouldn’t pretend that anything other than a Lib Dem victory here would have been a shock.
AUG3	Saudi women can now travel without consent – but this progress is fragile	After the lifting of the ban on women driving last year, the Saudi feminist movement can now celebrate its second victory: the authorities have announced that women can be granted passports and travel abroad without the consent of their male guardians. They can also register a birth, marriage or divorce. But they still cannot marry, or leave prison or a domestic violence shelter without the consent of their male guardians – often a father, brother, or other male relative. The bizarre guardianship system is pervasive in Saudi Arabia. It stipulates that women are not legal persons, and consequently, they have to be represented by male relatives to work, marry, study, travel, and seek medical care.
AUG3	Victoria’s Secret was never female-friendly – its shtick was about pleasing men	Lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret seems to be having an identity crisis. For the first time since its launch in 1995, its runway show has been cancelled, with model Shanina Shaik telling reporters that the company is trying to work on its branding. This comes in the wake of falling sales and controversy surrounding the show’s lack of diversity. Furthermore, the show’s whole shtick – a parade of almost naked models, each a perfect mix of skinny-curvy, decked in angel wings (an accessory the historians of the future will undoubtedly view with bafflement, if not complete derision) being ogled by men – looks dated after #MeToo. Donald Trump used to be a frequent guest at the shows; Les Wexner, CEO of Victoria’s Secret’s parent brand, L Brands, owned Jeffrey Epstein’s New York mansion and was one of his former financial clients (the brand has distanced itself from Epstein).
AUG3	Irish peace is too precious to be squandered by the Brexit ultras	In The Ultras, the brutal, brilliant novel by Eoin McNamee set during the Troubles, the protagonist (based on the real-life undercover British intelligence officer Robert Nairac) finds himself in the company of dangerous men like himself. The Ultras plot terrible events and create dark polities while forcing everyone else to live with their consequences. “Ultra meaning beyond,” wrote McNamee. “Ultra meaning extreme.” The so-called war cabinet formed by the new British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and whose course the maverick arch-Brexiteer Dominic Cummings now charts, of course bears no resemblance to the characters in the war of the Ultras imagined by McNamee. But the sheer velocity and ferocity of their opening salvoes about crashing out of the EU with no deal on October 31 unless the backstop – the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland – is abolished, raise the kind of alarm that we in Ireland have not felt since the dark years of the Troubles.
AUG3	Labour shouldn’t worry so much about the Lib Dems, they hurt the Tories more	No prime minister has lost a seat as swiftly as Boris Johnson in over a century. In 2017, the Tories won nearly half the vote in Brecon and Radnorshire and secured an 8,000 majority over the Liberal Democrats. To lose just two years later is very bad indeed. Labour slumped badly, leaving the party with a derisory vote share, but this is a seat the party hasn’t won since 1974, and in which it came third even in the 1997 landslide. In any case, whether Labour is polling well or badly nationally, it often performs poorly in byelections which are straight fights between the Lib Dems and Tories. In 2000 – when Tony Blair was enjoying a seemingly never-ending honeymoon – Labour’s vote plummeted by 15 points in the Romsey byelection because of tactical voting which enabled the Lib Dems to wrest the seat from the Tories. It feels a bit unseemly to watch Lib Dems – who appealed for the votes of Labour supporters to stop the Tories – now crowing about Labour’s collapsed support.
AUG3	Britain’s towns and cities will never flourish if ‘local’ is a dirty word	Some people think Britain’s greatest challenge is the impending Brexit. They are wrong. Britain’s greatest challenge is the impending collapse in its local public services. I recently travelled to cities in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The contrast to Britain was stark. Of course surface impressions can be deceptive, but I was struck by the absence of piles of litter, potholed streets, screaming police cars, tacky ads on roundabouts and graffiti. There were also fewer desperate people pleading for money. I felt I was briefly in a civilised continent. The difference is that in continental Europe, these matters are at the discretion of local people, the mayor and electors. As they get richer, they reasonably expect, vote for and pay locally for better services. In Britain they are not allowed to do this. So they get worse. Over the “austerity” decade since 2010, British government has stripped localities of a great chunk of their centrally supplied resources. What is left is spent on statutory services such as social care, schools and roads. Local government has become an instrument of the centre. Money has steadily dried up for discretionary activities, such as youth clubs, old people’s homes, children’s agencies, drug treatment centres, homeless shelters, libraries, cleaner streets and public gardens. Successive chancellors have treated impoverished councils’ pleas with contempt and cavalier disregard.
AUG4	Behind the Tory claims of bold Brexit action is nothing but empty bravado	Like an enraged bull charging a matador, the British right is putting its head down and stampeding towards a no-deal Brexit. It has to keep moving. Were it to stop and consider where it was heading, it would never take the risks it is taking with Britain’s future. The left fails so often because it thinks it is enough to hate Conservatives and say they are wicked, rather than understand Conservatives and show them to be dangerous. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that on its own terms the right ought to know that a no-deal Brexit is an act of epic folly and that Boris Johnson’s talk of a new golden age for merrie England is as much bullshit as bullish: the drivel of a man and a movement that have nothing but empty bravado to sustain them.
AUG4	It’s easy to mock eco-celebs. Better to give them the benefit of the doubt	It’s turning into the greatest environmental challenge of our age – how do we transport celebrities safely and responsibly to global eco-summits, so that they can do a better job of lecturing the rest of us about carbon emissions? The world has been agog at Camp Google, the three-day mass gathering at the luxury Verdura resort in Sicily, of 300 or so celebrity environmental activists, including Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bradley Cooper, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Bono, Chris Martin and more – too many to list, even a rumoured (but unseen) Barack Obama. Not forgetting Prince Harry, who reportedly gave a stirring speech about the environment – barefoot! A startling image springs to mind of a Google aide shrugging off the carbon footprint of Harry’s journey (private jet and helicopter), but saying: “Uh, prince-dude, you need to lose the offensive shoes.”
AUG4	Vox pop superstar is a social media darling decades on	Unexpectedly last week, a 42-year-old BBC Two vox pop featuring an East End woman in a red raincoat broke the internet. We don’t know her name, but this unassuming star has been watched by millions, decades after stopping to talk to a reporter on a London street. She trounced all the social media competition, including Kylie Minogue performing Do The Locomotion on a miniature railway in Scarborough. The clip was filmed for a 1977 BBC Two series of 28 programmes marking the Queen’s silver jubilee. It was intended for a show called Thanks for the Memory, then billed as the BBC’s biggest vox pop to date, that would ask citizens, “from crofters to judges”, for their views on TV of the previous 25 years. Tweeted by the BBC Archive last week for a contemporary audience, there was one standout star.
AUG4	It’s a woman’s choice: falling fertility rates are not the business of government	How many children should a woman have, and when? It’s a trick question, of course, because the answer is nearly always “none of your damn business”. There is no one perfect solution to this most personal and intimate of dilemmas, no iron rule for getting it right, and yet that doesn’t stop the world and its aunt seemingly having an opinion. Young women who steadfastly insist they don’t want children are knowingly told that they’ll change their minds when they’re older, even as they’re begging doctors for sterilisations. Mothers of only-children can look forward to years of nosy questions about when they plan to try for another, to the eternal distress of those who for whatever reason can’t or won’t get pregnant again. Even sticking to the conventional two children doesn’t make you immune to criticism, judging by the reaction when Prince Harry let it slip that baby Archie might only be getting one sibling; although the Duchess of Sussex clearly can’t win with some people no matter what she does, the idea of a couple deliberately holding back for the sake of the planet seems to trigger some kind of broader kneejerk hostility.
AUG4	Jeremy Corbyn’s stance on Brexit could yet pay off, even for remainers. Here’s why	I’ve always hated “Irish jokes”. Having an Irish mother, I’ve always been aware how they were used to denigrate Irish people and undermine the cause of Irish nationalism. There’s one joke, though, I’ve always enjoyed. It’s the one where the guy asks the Irishman for directions, to which he replies: “Well, if I were you I wouldn’t be starting from here.” It’s stuck with me because it offers a real life lesson that I find myself regularly referring to. Back in the 1980s and 90s, it’s a lesson I should have heeded, as I argued and canvassed for a socialist Labour government when, in hindsight, it was clear that British voters had been wowed by Margaret Thatcher’s strong leadership and populist policies. For my arguments to get through, I shouldn’t have been starting from there. People such as Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell recognised this and modified Labour’s message to resonate with these same voters to spectacular effect.
AUG4	Labour’s best tactic to beat Boris Johnson? A popular front	Britain’s current political dynamics have been made crystal clear by the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection result. The Liberal Democrats won because Plaid Cymru and the Greens stood down, in an explicit electoral pact. The Tories could have inched it had the Brexit party also stood down.

AUG4	Economics is a failing discipline doing great harm – so let's rethink it	Something is killing conventional economics and it’s probably an inside job. Reliance on abstract mathematics and absurd assumptions has brought the discipline into disrepute, even if politics and policy are guided by the ghosts of its teaching. Nobody was surprised recently to learn that the price of the overdue and over-budget HS2 high-speed rail project could rise by another £30bn. People were surprised to learn, however, that in the cost-benefit analysis used to justify the original project, planners assumed that no passengers work while on a train. That made the times savings on the new line look more valuable than they really were.
AUG4	Boris Johnson is the last person young Brits would vote for	The Daily Express is calling it “the Boris effect”. Johnson’s election has reportedly caused a “record jump” in the polls for the Conservative party, with the Telegraph gleefully reporting that its prized former columnist has received the largest bounce of any Conservative leader in the past two decades. Though Tory hopes were dented by the party’s defeat in Thursday’s Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, supporters still believe Johnson is capable of winning a general election – which could happen within months.
AUG4	Karaoke inside Tina Turner’s giant head? Monstrous but brilliant	What I’d give to know what was said at the commissioning meeting that led to the new sculpture at the Dreamland theme park in Margate. The piece is planned as a tribute to the town’s autumn hosting of the Turner prize exhibition. Did a young creative, during a working breakfast, muse: “So the prize is named after Turner, the artist who did the landscapes. But that’s just boring, right? So how about we go with a different Turner instead? Kathleen? Lana? Anthea? Or how about a massive inflatable Tina Turner?” Too expensive? “If the budget won’t stretch to a whole body, let’s just go with her head. If we can raise a bit of extra cash, maybe we can throw in a hand, too.”
AUG4	This byelection result has narrowed the Tories’ route to election victory	The Brecon and Radnorshire byelection result was a surprise for many Tory MPs – but not because they lost. Instead, it’s because of how close they came to holding on to the seat. Ahead of the vote, the Conservatives had appeared to be following a beginner’s guide on how to lose byelections and alienate voters.

It followed that it was beneficial to have a candidate they could blame the loss on rather than a defeat that could be cast as the new leader falling short.
AUG5	A no-deal Brexit even after a no-confidence vote: how could it happen?	Do you remember when the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was supposedly so remote that it was scarcely worth discussing in advance of the referendum? “The day after we vote to leave,” Michael Gove said in April 2016, “we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want.” As Theresa May began her negotiations with the European Union, no deal next became a theoretical possibility that had to be “kept on the table” as part of the poker game. As Boris Johnson told the Commons in July 2017: “There is no plan for no deal, because we’re going to get a great deal.”
AUG5	Whatever they say about Brexit, sterling’s nosedive tells us the truth	If you are reading this and earn your living in UK currency, you are already poorer today than you were before June 2016. And you will be poorer by the end of the year if a no-deal EU exit comes to pass. If you have savings in sterling, then you’re in even more trouble. In the post-truth world we have been living in for the past three years, there’s one thing that cannot be blagged away, cannot be accused of bias, cannot be propped up by a gust of groundless optimism – the British pound. It is quite literally a sovereign, bowing to no ideology or political pressure. As elegantly and neutrally as a force of nature, it rises and falls as it divines the direction of the country’s economy. That direction, according to the pound’s nosedive over the past few weeks, is downwards.
AUG5	Jacob Rees-Mogg: tough on grammar, relaxed on social misery	What more can we ask of Jacob Rees-Mogg? I mean, bravo. His list of language rules was absolutely classic. In the soap opera of the news, he’s becoming as reliable a performer as the much-missed Silvio Berlusconi, who must surely be overdue a saucy Christmas special return. Maybe involving some of the newer characters. Perhaps Silvio starts stalking Meghan Markle and is discovered in a hedge in Windsor Great Park, binoculars held steadily in his non-masturbating hand. I’m just throwing ideas out there – it’s fan fiction really – because it’s been such a tempestuous patch for the soap opera of the news. What with Brexit and Trump and Boris, some people are saying that the soap opera of the news has jumped the shark. After all, it’s not a cliffhanger if the character always falls off the cliff. It’s no good if every new episode begins with plummeting and screaming and smashing and more screaming. As the literalist didn’t complain at the public hanging, where’s the suspense?
AUG5	Cherish those occasions when tribal division yields to collective joy	You don’t often hear booing in a cricket ground. But a wall of jeers greeted the Australian pantomime villain David Warner as he walked out to the crease in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston on Thursday. The reception for the opening batsman was even louder as he walked back to the pavilion a few short minutes later, the first of England bowler Stuart Broad’s five wickets. Warner, Aussie sporting belligerence personified, was never the most popular cricketer among rival nations’ supporters but, having masterminded last year’s “sandpapergate” ball-tampering scandal that saw him and teammates Cameron Bancroft and Steve Smith banned from the game in disgrace for 12 months, his reputation is lower than ever.
AUG5	Boris Johnson’s Armageddon Clock: what is it really counting down to?	Those familiar with 24, the jeopardy TV series in which Kiefer Sutherland as Agent Jack Bauer is tasked with saving the world by any means necessary, will have had flashbacks. An Armageddon Clock has been installed at Conservative campaign headquarters counting down the time to Brexit by day, hour, minute and second. Another digital timepiece is to be installed in the prime minister’s office. This is one of several theatrical props intended to supercharge the atmosphere. As if the stakes were not already vertiginous, they are being raised further as a conscious act of government policy. After a rummage down the back of the Treasury’s sofa, Sajid Javid declares that he has found another £2bn to add to the £4bn-plus already committed to contingency planning for a crash-out Brexit. It is very doubtful whether that extra money can be sensibly deployed in the short time left before the end of October. To the government, announcing the money was the most important thing, making it one of the most expensive press releases in the history of political propagandising. We are told that Michael Gove is chairing daily meetings of the XS committee, the “war cabinet”, to supposedly “turbocharge” preparations for no deal. And more than £100m will be consumed by one of the country’s “biggest ever public information campaigns” to warn everyone what they have to do to prepare for the worst.
AUG5	No longer does al-Qaida grab the headlines. That might be the plan	Do you remember al-Qaida? Not the al-Qaida of today that no one pays any attention to, but the one of a decade or so ago, with its sinister mastermind leader hidden in the deep cave complexes of the Hindu Kush; the “sleeper cells” all over North America; or, more realistically, its ideology that inspired young men in the UK to travel to Pakistan to be trained in the terrorist techniques used to kill more than 50 people on tube trains and a bus in London. Probably not. If you’ve given much thought to the organisation in the past year or so, you’re a member of a fairly select group.
AUG5	Meghan seems to mix with all the ‘wrong’ people. So unlike the other royals ...	Since it’s a good few weeks since Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has worn jeans to Wimbledon, carried her baby the wrong way or used a shawl made by impoverished workers, her mentors have been on the alert for further evidence that their continual inspection of this member of the royal family is not racist bullying but a series of pedagogic opportunities. They wish only to help her improve. But her worst enemies, with which the UK press is strangely well supplied, could not have anticipated that Meghan’s next gift to them would be something so lavish, so rich in opportunities for point-by-point demolition, as an entire edition of Vogue, guest-edited while she was on maternity leave. That’s around the same time, Piers Morgan has pointed out, as she was not meeting his racist and sexist friend Donald Trump. A learning moment, then: see how the other royals dressed up for Trump and what a boon that has proved for Anglo-US relations?
AUG5	Political ads are all over Facebook. But voters are in the dark about where they come from	On the day Boris Johnson took over as prime minister, hundreds of Facebook ads dropped like confetti into thousands of UK voters’ news feeds. Many were virtually identical, featuring a black-and-white photograph of Johnson gazing towards an unseen audience. “These are my priorities,” one version of the ad read. “What are yours?” Quickly, the ads were interpreted as the start of Johnson’s election campaign and the splurge drew immediate parallels with the Facebook-driven 2016 Vote Leave campaign, especially since the director of that campaign – the Svengali-like Dominic Cummings – walked into 10 Downing Street as Johnson’s most senior adviser on the same day. Then on Friday we learned, through reports in the Guardian, that the political campaigning firm CTF Partners, one of whose heads ran Johnson’s leadership campaign, was running a network of unbranded “news” pages on Facebook on behalf of its clients.
AUG5	Yes, children are great, but they can leave you skint	There is a point in parenting where you ask yourself whether it’s all worth it. In crude financial terms, the answer is probably no. The most well-paid of women aside, it’s routine for couples to find that a mother’s return to work costs almost as much in nursery fees as her wages are worth (and sometimes more). Childcare becomes a patchwork thing: as many sessions in the creche as you can stretch to, hasty parental handovers between shifts, a willing grandparent to pick up the slack if you’re lucky. Always, the low hum of panic that this is the day it all falls to pieces. When this was my choice to make, my partner and I stretched and strained to make it work, because hanging on until school started would have put a five-year hole in a career that I hadn’t even begun. But there was another option – or there would have been, if I’d weighed this all up pre-pregnancy. Like many of my friends, I could have just not. No babies. No payslip turning to dust in your hand. No begging your childminder for lates when your office needs you just a bit longer. No joy of parenting either, but how can you miss people who haven’t been born?
AUG5	Behind the Tory claims of bold Brexit action is nothing but empty bravado	Like an enraged bull charging a matador, the British right is putting its head down and stampeding towards a no-deal Brexit. It has to keep moving. Were it to stop and consider where it was heading, it would never take the risks it is taking with Britain’s future. The left fails so often because it thinks it is enough to hate Conservatives and say they are wicked, rather than understand Conservatives and show them to be dangerous.

AUG6	Only a government of national unity can deliver us from no deal	Be not afraid. There’s hope that the constitutional atrocities planned by the prime minister and Downing Street’s ‘dark lord’, Dominic Cummings, can and will be prevented by good MPs who will put saving the country ahead of their party. Most of these will be Labour, Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru, Green, Change UK and stray independents. But noblest of all will be Conservative MPs who, like the burghers of Calais (whose memorial they pass every day), will sacrifice their careers for the good of all. No “golden age” awaits Johnson: he will be hoist on his own outrageous hubris.
AUG6	It’s not a crisis of masculinity that’s responsible for mass shootings. It’s male power	You didn’t have to ask, did you, when you heard about the latest shootings in the US? You didn’t think: “Well, there are a hell of a lot of women out there who are utterly alienated, possibly with mental health issues, who have very screwed up attitudes about migrants in the US, so ‘the shooter’ in each case will clearly be one of them.” You just knew. Before you get into the “not all men” groove, let me just say, no, not all men are murderous, for which I suppose I must be thankful. But I am not actually. Not at all. Not all men rape either, but in this country we have watched rape become virtually decriminalised because the justice system is so poor.
AUG6	The Hong Kong protests are putting China on a collision course with the west	As pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong escalate, so does China’s fury. The unrest is now in its ninth week. It has evolved from limited, student-led opposition to a proposed extradition law into a broad-based, fully fledged challenge to Beijing’s rule. It is threatening to undermine China’s control of the former British colony and President Xi Jinping’s control of China. His quasi-dictatorial authority is on the line. A critical tipping point is in sight. How long before China’s tough-guy leader, accustomed to getting his way and not averse to using force, loses patience?
AUG6	We must call the El Paso shooting what it is: Trump-inspired terrorism	Last year, when a rabid, anti-immigrant antisemite murdered 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue, I called it an act of domestic terrorism inspired by the ideology of Trumpism. The shooting took place during the height of the 2018 midterm campaign when Trump was inciting fear of an immigrant “caravan” from Central America. The shooter got the message. Hours before his bloody rampage, he accused a Jewish refugee support agency of bringing “invaders in that kill our people”. Saturday in El Paso it was deja vu all over again.
AUG6	Boris Johnson’s £1.8bn for the NHS isn’t what it seems – just ask the trusts	Boris Johnson successfully captured the weekend headlines with his announcement of a £1.8bn “cash injection” for the NHS capital budget – which covers buildings and equipment. But the prime minister quickly became bogged down in allegations that the £1bn pledged upfront this year wasn’t quite the boost it appeared. The truth is that NHS leaders across the country won’t see this billion as extra funding, but rather the removal of a freeze on cash they already have. That’s because it matches a pot of cash that NHS trusts already earned last year, in return for stretching their efficiency to breaking point, on a subsequently broken promise that they could invest it.
AUG6	I love cheering on my team live, but being a disabled football fan can be nightmare	After the summer break, many football fans will be looking forward to the start of the new Premier League season. But for some disabled supporters like me it’s a reminder that there is still a long way to go towards making the sport inclusive. I love football and held a season ticket at West Ham United from 2016-18. But I didn’t renew it last season and I won’t this year because I don’t believe disabled football fans are treated as they deserve to be.
AUG6	We need a Brexit deal – so why is Johnson indulging in cynical electioneering?	There is only one place the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, should be right now. That is in Dublin, the city that holds the key to somehow resolving the Irish backstop and averting a no-deal Brexit. Instead, Johnson is blatantly campaigning in marginal seats and promising one-off election bribes to the NHS – in confident expectation of what he pledged to avoid, a no-deal Brexit and/or a general election. The bribes are trivial compared with what a no-deal Brexit would cost. This grotesque act of national self-harm was invented purely to win Johnson leadership of the Conservative party. He has won it. He has weasled out of pledges before. It is time he weasled out of this one.
AUG6	Centrist MPs cannot delay any longer – with an election likely, they must act now	Early election rumours are again rippling through Westminster. The truth is, of course, that no general election can be called during recess without a recall of parliament. There is no motivation for the prime minister to take such a step, not while the novelty of that title still chirrups in Boris Johnson’s own ears and tolls in those of his foes. But after recess, all bets are off. Johnson’s announcement on Sunday of a £1.8bn cash bonus for the NHS was a pre-election cookie if ever we saw one. Where Labour moderates lead, Tory waverers may take longer to follow
AUG6	The warnings about a no-deal Brexit aren’t being heard. This is what we need to do	According to a poll last week, 79% of respondents said the British public don’t know what will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. That is an abject failure of all those groups campaigning against no deal. Many of the same personalities involved also failed to win the referendum campaign itself and have now reassembled around a second referendum campaign, which has hitherto failed to take off. Yet still they persist. “What’s going on here?” they say. “Why don’t people know what no deal means?” they complain. “Aren’t they watching Newsnight? Are they stupid?”
AUG6	Blame the scroungers. Blame the migrants. How Britain fell for austerity	In January this year, I went on a Brexit trip to Dover. The main aim was to get a sense of what a no-deal exit from the EU would mean for the haulage trade, but while I was there I spent a long and cold afternoon wandering the seafront and town centre. Just near the white cliffs, on a jetty that seemed to form the last British land before the Channel, there was a dome tent, seemingly the property of someone who was homeless: an awful symbol of this country as a land of want and wilful neglect. Later, in the centre of town, I met a woman who had been living on the streets for four years, having been repeatedly “sanctioned” and had her benefits stopped. The last time this had happened, she had been in hospital and failed to make it to the jobcentre, which caused her payments to be suspended for three months.
AUG7	Humiliating Kashmir is part of Modi’s plan to remake India	On Valentine’s Day this year, Narendra Modi went on a date with Bear Grylls. As the two men set off on an “adventure of a lifetime” in India’s Corbett national park, 500 miles to the north in the valley of Kashmir a suicide bomber drove a truck laden with explosives into a convoy of vehicles carrying Indian paramilitary forces. Forty troops were blown to bits in the blast. It was the bloodiest single atrocity suffered by Indian security personnel in the savage history of the Kashmir conflict.  A trailer for Grylls’ programme Man vs Wild, released last week by Discovery, shows the duo wandering the wilderness that afternoon, sniffing animal excrement and sharing laughs and survival techniques. Opposition politicians have seized on the film to accuse the Indian prime minister of not interrupting his escapade with Grylls immediately on news of the atrocity – a charge the government has denied.
AUG7	Toni Morrison’s genius was the inspiration of my youth	Toni Morrison was part of an extraordinary generation of African American women writers. But she was the most special. She was the queen. To understand the impact she had on me you have to appreciate that I came of age in an era when there were very few black female role models. Prominent black women tended to be entertainers: British popular music pianist Winifred Atwell, British jazz singer Cleo Laine, or the host of American jazz singers such as Ella Fitzgerald. So Toni Morrison was a complete revelation. Black male writers were rare enough. But a black female writer was for me a genuine sensation. She and her peer group – Alice Walker, Gloria Naylor and Ntozake Shange – burned into my consciousness. Toni Morrison did so much to shape my understanding of life and politics, and my world as a black woman.
AUG7	The super-rich have made Britain into a nation of losers	Think of a football stadium. Not one of the vast caverns like Old Trafford or Wembley, but somewhere rather smaller and more bijou. Somewhere like Fulham’s Craven Cottage, which, once its new stand is completed, will pack in only about 30,000 fans. Now imagine this stadium of 30,000 souls rising up into the air and hovering unnoticed over central London. Thirty thousand men in late middle-age living the high life with the capital at their feet – and there, stuck way below on terra firma are their 66 million fellow Britons, tearing lumps out of each other. Congratulations: you’ve just pictured the central problem stalking the UK today. Not Brexit. Not the breakdown in civil debate. Not the dark money contaminating Westminster. These are urgent and vitally important, but there is one big factor that forms a large part of the backdrop to all of them. It can be summed up by that gulf between a mid-sized football stadium of super-rich men in their 50s, and the rest of us spread out across our suburbs, our towns, our unpretty stretches of urban sprawl.
AUG7	No deal may be a Boris Johnson bluff, but the consequences will be real	If you don’t like the way Britain is going, move to Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon’s advice might sound tongue in cheek but she is, she insists, “more than half serious”; after all, Scotland could use the population boost, and plenty of English remainers now find themselves looking for a lifeboat. The hint is that for those not lucky enough to have European-born parents capable of swinging them a second passport, moving north of the border and crossing your fingers for an independent (and pro-European) Scotland in the near future might be the next best option.
AUG7	I served pork rolls to horsey Tories and conquered the chip on my shoulder	A hot pork roll stand in Peterborough isn’t the most obvious place to find out you’re a natural despot, but it’s where my inner dictator first emerged in the working world. I was benevolent yet damning. I ruled with an iron fist (and fork). In essence, I was the Catherine the Great of country shows in the 90s. And I loved it. I didn’t start off that way. The world of work terrified me. I wasn’t remotely practical, I found other humans largely terrifying and an onslaught of hungry strangers pressed a lot of anxiety buttons in my brain. But in front of a spit I discovered the full force of my naturally loud voice, my instinctive girl-boss spirit and the fact I adored being in charge of just about anything.
AUG7	Why children born of rape must be recognised as victims	We have all heard the cliche that “whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”, but in the case of women and girls who survive male violence, nothing could be truer. In today’s climate where rape and sexual assault has almost been decriminalised, with only around 3% of those reported to police in London ending in a conviction, reporting rape takes stamina and courage. But what about those who are born of rape? What about justice for them? One woman who was conceived of rape is campaigning for a change in the law which would give those born as a result of rape victim status so they can prosecute the men who raped their mothers.
AUG7	If the El Paso shooter had been Muslim ...	If the El Paso shooter had been a Muslim, the entire Muslim American community would be blamed for the actions of this one person. If the El Paso shooter had been a Muslim, the president would be lobbing accusations such as “Islam hates us” in the direction of Muslims and not lecturing the public about video games.
AUG7	If trigger ballots are to work British democracy needs fundamental reform	It doesn’t take a seasoned political pundit to understand why MPs might be hostile to any change to our democratic process that puts their job security at risk. That’s not because taking a seat in parliament is an easy option: there’s the online abuse and late-night sessions, the regular cross-country travel and the responsibility inherent to the position. And, apart from the very safest of seats, you could be out of a job whenever the next election may come. Nonetheless, serving your country while attempting to put your beliefs into practice is a privilege. The pay, the perks and future job prospects are not to be sniffed at either. Since Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader back in 2015, few issues have caused as much division within the parliamentary party as the question of trigger ballots. Or is it deselections? Mandatory reselection? It’s impossible to keep up with the terminology. Whatever it’s called, the fundamental question remains the same: should local Labour party members be able to replace their current representative ahead of an election, if they believe there’s someone better for the job?
AUG7	The secret to being a good stepmother? Here’s my handy guide …	In New York, beleaguered stepmothers are paying $500 per hour to receive stepmother coaching. Presumably rich beleaguered stepmothers. As a stepmother I know from experience it’s a tough gig, but recent studies have also revealed that statistically stepmothers are the most vulnerable member of a “blended family”. The stepmother’s opinion is considered the least important. Which is why I love doing standup comedy because it’s all my opinion and it is VERY important. Important, but not expensive – an hour of my advice will set you back just £10 for my aptly titled show Mother – and here I offer the wisdom built up over 12 years to you for free. You should feel very privileged to read it as I’ve had to take time away from my castle, talking to my enchanted mirror.
AUG7	From Trump to Fox News to 8chan: the web of white supremacist rhetoric is wide	“How do you stop these people? You can’t,” Donald Trump said at a rally in Florida in May. The response from someone in the crowd came immediately: “Shoot them.” The audience laughed and cheered. Trump smirked and made a joke about it. “Them” meant Latino immigrants and refugees that day. “Them,” to those who take Trump’s permission to spread hatred boldly and openly, has at times in the past two years meant Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus and anyone who stands against the white nationalist agenda.
AUG8	Deal or no deal? It’s not really up to Dominic Cummings	Media obsession with powerful advisers is not new. The influence of Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson was the stuff of hysteria in the Tony Blair years. Bernard Ingham and Marcia Williams were accused of having undue power during the eras of Margaret Thatcher and Harold Wilson. Right back to the original éminence grise in 17th century France, Père Joseph, and probably beyond, the mystique of the all-seeing adviser behind the throne has been a constant theme. But how well grounded is this in reality? What we do know is that those who work in the shadows are catnip to journalists who know less than they pretend about the workings of government. This is especially true in an embittered political era with a taste for conspiracy theories that seem to offer partisan observers simple explanations of complicated events. Sometimes the credulity can be abject.
AUG8	How the world’s dirtiest industries have learned to pollute our politics	The tragedy of our times is that the gathering collapse of our life support systems has coincided with the age of public disservice. Just as we need to rise above self-interest and short-termism, governments around the world now represent the meanest and dirtiest of special interests. In the United Kingdom, the US, Brazil, Australia and many other nations, pollutocrats rule. The Earth’s systems are breaking down at astonishing speed. Wildfires roar across Siberia and Alaska – biting, in many places, deep into peat soils, releasing plumes of carbon dioxide and methane that cause more global heating. In July alone, Arctic wildfires are reckoned to have released as much carbon into the atmosphere as Austria does in a year: already the vicious twister of climate feedbacks has begun to turn.
AUG8	Michael Buerk's fat-shaming is 'weak' – not the obese people he targets	“Freedom to make bad choices is what personal autonomy, indeed democracy, is all about,” writes Michael Buerk in his latest column for the Radio Times. And, wow, has the former star of I’m a Celebrity made a bad choice this week. In a piece entitled “Leave couch potatoes alone!”, Buerk takes aim at people he deems to be “weak” – the obese. Picking apart the common argument that obesity is the biggest danger to the NHS in terms of cost appears to be the raison d’être of the piece, along with a plea to leave overweight people to make their own mistakes. It’s as cruel and vitriol-soaked as debates about obesity generally are – the joy Buerk takes in littering the column with pejoratives is obvious, if the results are not particularly creative. There’s the perennial “porky”, and references to “guzzling” and being “out-waddled”. There’s originality though in his choice to reframe the societal cost of obesity in a “positive” way – with a reminder that “the obese will die a decade earlier than the rest of us”.
AUG8	The only way to stop the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit? Revoke article 50	A run on the pound was once the kind of event that troubled a prime minister. If it was shown to be the direct result of a policy the prime minister refused to change, it might even have unseated them. No longer. Now a Conservative government’s central policy will not just crash the pound, but also end Britain’s manufacturing and agriculture overnight and block half the country’s transportation of food and medicines – and it shows no shame whatsoever. Extraordinary and radical times demand a similar response. It may no longer be sufficient for parliament to tinker around the edges with Brexit. Because the no-deal trajectory is both real and unthinkable, politicians may finally decide it is time to challenge key orthodoxies. Brexit, in its current form, is not the will of the people – and it can be stopped. The outright revocation of article 50 is looking more likely, and more justified, than ever.
AUG8	John McDonnell has offered the SNP more than he had to on independence	In politics, it’s possible to have logic, and even principle, on your side – and still get it badly wrong. John McDonnell’s change of Labour policy, declaring on Tuesday night that the party “would not block” a second referendum on independence for Scotland, is a case in point. McDonnell made the argument that any new vote should be for the people of Scotland and their parliament to determine. “We would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That’s democracy.” The notion of Holyrood voting for a referendum, only for a future Labour government in Westminster to stand in its way, is indeed hard, if not impossible, for any democrat to defend. Sure, some will argue that Scotland had its once-in-a-generation chance to decide in 2014. But that’s tricky to sustain when Labour is (sort of) committed to holding a second referendum on Brexit, even though that decision was supposedly settled just three years ago. Surely democratic consistency demands precisely the stance McDonnell has now taken.
AUG8	Toni Morrison’s stories shaped me, and made me tell my own	Just over a decade ago, Toni Morrison sat down on a steel bench in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. Her writing had inspired this simple memorial, at the waterway through which so many enslaved people were trafficked. One in two African Americans is descended from someone who passed through that harbour. As the end of the slave trade loomed and South Carolinians binge-imported black bodies, so many Africans died there that they were thrown into the water, their floating corpses markers of a mass grave. Morrison wanted people to remember. “It’s never too late to honour the dead,” she said. “It’s never too late to applaud the living who do them honour.” I realised parts of my emotional architecture that I thought innate had in fact been planted by Morrison’s words
AUG8	My wait for NHS surgery has caused me further pain	My weekend was spent at the Edinburgh fringe watching standup comedians that I love, while sitting curled up in my seat with heat pads stuck to my skin. This isn’t ideal in summer, but I needed the heat pressed against my left side to drown out the agonising pain I often experience. The only way I can describe it is that it feels like my organs are being squeezed as tightly as possible. In February, I learned that my left kidney is damaged. I have a pelvic ureteric junction obstruction, meaning that one kidney doesn’t filter properly. Instead, it fills up like a balloon ready to explode inside me. In some cases, this can be treated with a stent. Unfortunately for me, I’ve (unknowingly) had it for so long that it has caused the kidney to swell to the point where it is now badly damaged and needs surgery. I met my surgeon at the beginning of June and was put on the NHS surgery waiting list.
AUG8	Hard Brexiters’ stance on the Irish border is nonsense – I can tell you, I grew up there	One consequence of the brain’s incredible ability to make sense of the world is that it sometimes sees things that aren’t there. Most people have experienced pareidolia, that pleasing effect of interpreting a face from a random assortment of objects or shapes, so that a paperclip and two blobs of adhesive putty look like a happy little man, or the watermarks behind Auntie Maureen’s radiator strike her as a dead ringer for the Virgin Mary. Our brain has spent so many millions of years geared toward facial recognition, it takes even the most random nonsense and attempts to construct it into something meaningful. My brain, it turns out, does a similar thing when I read the tweets of Brexit MEP Ben Habib. “I am on the border between NI and ROI,” he tweeted last week, above a video that depicted him and some colleagues wisely playing in the middle of the road. “Travelling in a straight line, one enters and exits the ROI a number of times. There could never be a hard border here. The UK has declared it would never seek to impose one. The whole thing is a red herring.”
AUG8	I never thought I’d see the royal family as a beacon of hope	I’ve been asking strangers random questions for 20 years in the name of journalism, but I’d never been vox-popped myself until last Friday, when I was approached on Oxford Street by someone from a Japanese television station. What did I think of Meghan Markle? I said I thought she was great. Furthermore (warming to my theme), I thought the reaction against her in the British media was symptomatic of a deeply disturbing moment of racist hegemony that has crashed over us like sewage, following the dam burst of Brexit.
AUG8	How do we beat 8chan and other far-right sites? The same way we beat Isis	Copycat terrorism is on the rise again, this time from the far right. Over the past few months, we have witnessed a series of lethal terrorist attacks against minorities in places of worship and other public spaces that are said to have been carried out by white supremacists. There was the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October 2018, then two mosque attacks in New Zealand in March 2019, another synagogue assault in California a month later and an attack at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, on Saturday.
AUG9	The dramatic drop in sterling is only a taste of what is to come	As our currency plummeted last week, politicians were remarkably quiet. In normal times, a catastrophic slide in the pound would send a shockwave through Westminster. An emergency cabinet meeting might have been called. The chancellor might have made an announcement, calming markets and reassuring the public. But these aren’t normal times. Over the past three years, politics has been increasingly blind to the concerns of ordinary people. The Brexit debate is stuck on abstract constitutional issues such as the backstop. While they are important matters, the relentless focus of public discourse on them means that we are in danger of forgetting about the lives of real people. Westminster is gripped by a fanatical race towards a cliff-edge Brexit and nobody is stopping to think about the impact it would have on the everyday lives of the people we serve as politicians.
AUG9	We can’t keep eating as we are – why isn’t the IPCC shouting this from the rooftops?	It’s a tragic missed opportunity. The new report on land by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shies away from the big issues and fails to properly represent the science. As a result, it gives us few clues about how we might survive the century. Has it been nobbled? Was the fear of taking on the farming industry – alongside the oil and coal companies whose paid shills have attacked it so fiercely – too much to bear? At the moment, I have no idea. But what the panel has produced is pathetic. The problem is that it concentrates on just one of the two ways of counting the carbon costs of farming. The first way – the IPCC’s approach – could be described as farming’s current account. How much greenhouse gas does driving tractors, spreading fertiliser and raising livestock produce every year? According to the panel’s report, the answer is around 23% of the planet-heating gases we currently produce. But this fails miserably to capture the overall impact of food production.
AUG9	After El Paso and Dayton, the left needs to reach out to men, not condemn them	A horrific act of violence takes several innocent lives, a frantic live-stream details the events, terrifying mobile footage spreads rapidly online. Then come the tweets of condemnation from world leaders, followed by an onslaught of outrage split down partisan lines. The way that shootings, or suicide bombings, or knife attacks are politicised depending on the backgrounds of the perpetrators and the victims shows how successful these acts are in deepening the divisions in society. And that is one of the intentions that the perpetrators share, no matter their race or politics.
AUG9	Globalisation as we know it will not survive Trump. And that’s a good thing	The significance of the trade war between China and the US goes well beyond the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs, or which of two self-styled strongmen wins the bragging rights. As was the case in the 1930s, the seemingly inexorable drift towards protectionism is part of a deeper crisis of the international status quo. When Beijing this week accused the US of “deliberately destroying the international order”, it was really saying that US hegemony will no longer go unchallenged. Globalisation as we have known it is coming to an end and that’s by no means unwelcome. Hailed as the ultimate in human progress, a model based on loosening the controls on capital and the construction of global supply chains has spawned recurrent financial crises, fostered corrosive inequality and worsened the climate emergency. True, millions of people have been lifted out of poverty in the past 25 years, but most of them live in a country – China – that has kept the market at arm’s-length.
AUG9	Good for you, Monica Lewinsky, for finally taking control of your story	We thought we knew Monica Lewinsky, didn’t we, back in the late 90s? But all we knew was who the press told us she was. With headlines blaring about scandal and seduction and sex, the news media rolled out all of their best misogynist tropes to make us believe that Lewinsky was a calculating seductress, a hilarious punchline, or maybe even an evil co-conspirator within a grand Republican conspiracy to bring down the then-president.
AUG9	It’s last orders for sexist beer names. We can all drink to that	It takes a certain kind of person to walk up to a bar and order a pint of Old Legover, a bottle of Piddle in the Hole and half an Old Growler. We all know the sort of person: tweed jacket worn over a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, combat shorts all year round, the sort of beard that’s stiff with flecks of sausage roll and stained at the corners with nicotine. Scratches their belly button while trying to do any sort of mental arithmetic. Reads books about netherworlds and supernatural portals and giant battles. Goes home after one too many Bushy Beaver beers or pints of Leg Warmer and watches The World at War on DVD as they fall asleep on the sofa, farting like the Large Hadron Collider. Or so the stereotype goes.
AUG9	Ignore Boris Johnson’s empty ‘optimism’. The real cheer lies on the left	Last Saturday afternoon, in a union office in central London, I got thinking about optimism. I was speaking at an event put on by disabled activists to discuss the impact of a decade of disability cuts. I spent an hour listening to people who in recent years have, by any definition, been wilfully neglected: one disabled man sleeping rough and battling with the broken benefits system; another, an unpaid carer, trying to keep her head above water and help others as social care packages around the country are gutted. You wouldn’t typically think this was a recipe for optimism. But I came out feeling more hopeful than I had in weeks.
AUG9	So what if more young British people are living at home into their 30s?	The self-styled “jilted generation” have a new argument to boost their case against their elders. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, a quarter of those between the ages of 20 and 34 were still living in the family home in 2018. That is 1 million more than 15 years ago; 3.4 million people, compared with 2.4 million in 2003. And the reason is obvious, is it not? Soaring prices and an acute housing shortage (factors not unconnected) have locked young people out of the housing market, leaving high-priced private renting or the parental home as the unpalatable only options. A whole generation is being “infantilised” by the failure of successive governments to build enough homes.
AUG9	Makeup for children isn’t harmful – but the assumptions adults make about it can be	John Lewis and Mac Cosmetics have come under fire for advertising a “back to school” makeup masterclass on Facebook, in which school-age pupils were promised tips on achieving good-looking skin, and eyebrows “on fleek”, at the Mac counter in John Lewis’s Bluewater branch. Both the brand, which asserts that staff were acting independently, and the store, which says it knew nothing of the event, apologised and quickly cancelled the workshop after parents complained. Few would disagree with the decision. An eyebrow pencil or foundation is incongruous and inappropriate in this context, and should not be billed as essential back-to-school kit, like some new lunchbox or protractor. Makeup is against uniform code in most schools and even where it’s not it’s very dubious to suggest that pupils should aspire to look a certain way on their return to an environment that should be about learning, and away from the real and escalating pressures to look good.
AUG9	How can a man be too straight to recycle?	So that’s how the world’s going to die, is it, because straight men are scared people might think they are gay? According to new research by Penn State University, men may be avoiding environmentally friendly activities because they fear that anyone who catches them recycling or carrying a reusable shopping bag may think they’re seeking romantic trysts with other guys. So when men are scrabbling around in the sun-scorched dirt for food, or swimming their way through Covent Garden, or sheltering their family from Mad Max-style societal breakdown, they can at least comfort themselves that their precious heterosexuality remains intact. Of course, climate emergency won’t be solved purely by more recycling or fewer plastic bags – but the study is revealing. Both men and women see caring about the environment as “feminine”; and men associate feminine behaviour by men with being gay.
AUG10	Cummings the new Rasputin is outshining Johnson as antihero-in-chief	How did you enjoy Thursday night’s Downing Street address by Prime Minister Smirky McSmirkface? Boris Johnson began by describing his morning: “I was at the nuclear fusion labs in Culham.” Please say a freak accident befell you there, causing you to emerge, if not with superpowers, then at least as tenuously adequate. Alas not. Johnson’s tight-framed, air-jabbing, fist-banging, weirdly emphasised delivery is still like that of a Bloomberg pundit trying to make the currency markets sound scandalously interesting. Soon, he won’t have to.
AUG10	A no-deal Brexit won’t be a clean break: this nightmare will go on for ever	The myths of a no-deal Brexit are about to collide with reality. Those myths are many, and they flourish on both sides of the great divide. For remainers, the greatest is that no deal could never happen. They look at the polls that show far more Britons oppose a crash-out from the EU than support it – 50% to 38%, according to Ipsos Mori – and they can’t quite believe that any government would defy the public will on so grave a matter. They look at the sensible majority of MPs who have voted to thwart it and they assume that, for all the bluster from Boris Johnson and his team, when it comes to the crunch, reason will prevail. That, in the ultimate battle of the Dominics, Grieve will triumph over Cummings.
AUG10	Boris Johnson’s no-deal election plot is an assault on democracy	The Conservatives are plotting to overturn Britain’s constitutional order to stop them haemorrhaging votes to the Brexit party in key marginal seats. The most absurd aspect about this sentence is that it’s entirely true. The country’s current turmoil has two proximate causes: the Tories’ decision to make the majority pay for a crisis caused by their donors – the financial sector – breeding mass disillusionment and anger; and the Tory addiction to making calamitous decisions driven by their own perceived partisan interests. That’s why David Cameron called the Brexit referendum; why Theresa May bungled the negotiations, polarised the nation and mainstreamed the idea of no deal; and it is why Boris Johnson intends to engineer a disorderly Brexit during an election campaign.
AUG10	Despite Brexit, my trip back to Britain filled me with pride	August is a dangerous time to be back in London, when the city smells so much better than New York. For the past week my children and I have been enjoying the 20F drop in temperature with zero humidity, while playing a game of Better in England. The bread is better. Ditto the cheese. Clearly the weather is better and, since a version of Paw Patrol has been dubbed by English-accented children, everyone’s interest in the show has revived. The only hard call is the news: Brexit v Trump, which is the more depressing background condition? It was hard to watch the rusty carousel go round and stop oneself muttering about EU safety regulations
AUG10	To stop women and girls carrying knives, tackle the abuse and violence they face	Figures released this week reported a 73% increase in the number of knife possession cases involving women and girls in England. This was accompanied by commentary about how the police and Home Office are responding to this “hidden” issue. To say I was frustrated would be an understatement. First, the problem isn’t as hidden as it used to be. Women and girls are being arrested for these offences at increasing rates – so clearly they are being identified. Back in 2008 when I first started to interview women and girls about their experiences of serious violence, various services struggled to find people for me to interview. On some occasions I was simply told that girls weren’t affected by these issues and I was wasting my time. More than 10 years on, most local authorities, police forces, youth offending teams and community organisations can identify women and girls affected by or involved in weapon-enabled crime and violence. We really have no idea if more women and girls are carrying knives than they used to – we just know that more are being apprehended for such offences.
AUG10	My disabilities are invisible. I shouldn’t have to prove them to strangers	I was recently on a packed Central line train into London. Luckily, I managed to take the last priority disabled seat. My osteoporosis and the fatigue I experience meant it would be hard for me to stand for the 40-minute journey to Oxford Circus. I felt a sense of relief that I had managed to find a space. That was until I was approached by a middle-aged woman, who quite confidently asked me to move in order to give up my seat for an elderly passenger. Of course, I thought, the elderly passenger deserves a seat. But I do too, although it’s not immediately obvious why. With other passengers shaking their heads and murmuring comments of disapproval, and me too embarrassed to make a claim for the seat, I moved. It’s true that I appear well, but standing for a prolonged period of time left me feeling weak and in pain. That said, I am used to keeping quiet.
AUG10	Pop reggae and racism: what failing on a factory floor taught me about life	Here’s how bad it was: even the jobcentre told me not to do it. The woman on the other side of the desk looked at my résumé, paused for what felt an age and made clear the position I wanted was not a good match. It was in a factory; I was at university. It was hard, dirty work; didn’t I want something better? It would be, well, “a waste”.
AUG10	Independence for Scotland is inevitable – we need a plan for it	I hope Scotland and Nicola Sturgeon realise how much they may yet owe Boris Johnson. If I were a Scot, I would vote for independence tomorrow. I would want nothing more to do with the shambles of today’s Westminster parliament, which goes on holiday for a month during the worst political crisis in a generation. Labour’s John McDonnell is entirely correct to reassure the Scots of their right to secede from the United Kingdom. The supreme civil right is that to self-government, and the inferior tier of a federation is entitled to claim it, not the superior one to permit. Scotland has now voted itself a separatist Scottish National party local government unchallenged for 12 years. The party is 20 points ahead in the polls, while support for independence has topped 52%, the same percentage that voted for Brexit across the UK in 2016.
AUG10	Racism harms black people most. It’s time to recognise ‘anti-blackness’	There is a tendency to classify all victims of racism under the label “people of colour” or “black, Asian and minority ethnic” people (shortened to BAME). However, this generalist approach fails to account for the varied ways that racism affects different races. There is anti-black racism, anti-Asian racism (which affects east Asians and south Asians differently), anti-Arab racism, even sometimes anti-white racism. To be clear, all these strands of racism are significant, and we need to work to eradicate them all. Yet, historically, it’s black people who have most often found themselves at the bottom of the pile. In Brazil, black people are still treated as second class citizens; in India, students of African origin are persecuted
AUG10	Does Mark Zuckerberg’s summer reading betray his desire for world domination?	Who would imagine that Mark Zuckerberg’s recommendation for a book to take on holiday might plunge the reader into a world of cut-throat technological competition and the pursuit of monopoly? Apparently not those who have seized on the Facebook co-founder’s choice of The Last Days of Night by Graham Moore, which describes the race to bring electricity to the US and the consequent riches up for grabs. Indeed, it has been taken as a manifestation of Zuckerberg’s inability to conceal his true drive to world domination, an inadvertent drop of the mask. To which one might reply: did you think he was sitting on his sunlounger reading through the works of Barbara Pym?
AUG11	The very idea of a united kingdom is being torn apart by toxic nationalism	The first step to solving a problem is to see it clearly. And if we are to understand why we are facing not only our most serious constitutional crisis since the 17th century but an unprecedented economic calamity precipitated by a no-deal exit from the EU, we must recognise that nationalism is now driving British politics. Having set almost impossible terms for any negotiation with Europe and preparing to renege on legal obligations to pay our debts to the EU – the economic equivalent of a declaration of war – Boris Johnson’s government is hell-bent on conjuring up the absurd and mendacious image of the patriotic British valiantly defying an intransigent Europe determined to turn us into a vassal state.
AUG11	The system lifted me from poverty. Today, Danielle John is not so lucky	Last week, a woman’s sanction letter from the Department for Work and Pensions went viral on Twitter. Danielle John, from Cardiff, simply wrote: “Was told to put this up on Twitter… this was because I had a miscarriage and missed appointment.” These stories are fairly common now. We are used to seeing reports about people being sanctioned because of attending a funeral/cancer treatment/their child being in hospital. But this one struck me in particular because the language was so coldly efficient. Brief to the point of cruelty. I didn’t know it was possible, even in a business letter, to say: “We’re about to ruin your whole life” without a shred of empathy.
AUG11	Toni Morrison’s gift was to make black people feel seen	It is impossible to fully encapsulate the magnitude and influence of Toni Morrison, a writer of such power, gravitas and ingenuity, the rhapsodic praise almost seems inadequate, anti-climactic. But we must do so. We must celebrate her. If the act of writing makes the human experience that much more knowable then we must mark this moment. Morrison’s greatest gifts – a virtuosic feel for language and an eye for bringing the lived experiences of black Americans to the centre – to me seem inextricably linked. Never has a writer been so clear about her intention. These are lives that matter. Here are worlds possessing a will of their own. Hers are characters facing structural inequalities but they have agency, a mesmerising pull beyond the page.
AUG11	Jeremy Corbyn should be pressing for a referendum, not an election	Jeremy Corbyn shouldn’t fall into the trap of giving Boris Johnson an election. Unless, that is, he is pretty confident of winning it and, on the basis of the latest polls, Labour needs an election like a hole in the head. Instead, the leader of the opposition should try everything else to foil the prime minister’s devilish plot to crash out of the EU without a deal. With the help of a cross-party group of MPs, he can probably succeed.
AUG11	Angela Merkel: you’re on hols, so less of the despotism please	One of the reasons I tend not to mind the tinny hiss of other people’s headphones on public transport is that I am a horribly nosey person. Recently, I sat next to a middle-aged man in a work suit who played that ubiquitous Lewis Capaldi got-dumped song not once, not twice, but on a loop that lasted as long as my train journey. I should have asked him if he was OK. The same nosiness applies to what people are reading. Getting lost in a good book should never be a self-conscious act, but it is hard not to wonder what brought that particular person to The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck.
AUG11	Cummings the new Rasputin is outshining Johnson as antihero-in-chief	How did you enjoy Thursday night’s Downing Street address by Prime Minister Smirky McSmirkface? Boris Johnson began by describing his morning: “I was at the nuclear fusion labs in Culham.” Please say a freak accident befell you there, causing you to emerge, if not with superpowers, then at least as tenuously adequate. Alas not. Johnson’s tight-framed, air-jabbing, fist-banging, weirdly emphasised delivery is still like that of a Bloomberg pundit trying to make the currency markets sound scandalously interesting. Soon, he won’t have to.
AUG11	A no-deal Brexit won’t be a clean break: this nightmare will go on for ever	The myths of a no-deal Brexit are about to collide with reality. Those myths are many, and they flourish on both sides of the great divide. For remainers, the greatest is that no deal could never happen. They look at the polls that show far more Britons oppose a crash-out from the EU than support it – 50% to 38%, according to Ipsos Mori – and they can’t quite believe that any government would defy the public will on so grave a matter. They look at the sensible majority of MPs who have voted to thwart it and they assume that, for all the bluster from Boris Johnson and his team, when it comes to the crunch, reason will prevail. That, in the ultimate battle of the Dominics, Grieve will triumph over Cummings.
AUG11	Boris Johnson’s no-deal election plot is an assault on democracy	The Conservatives are plotting to overturn Britain’s constitutional order to stop them haemorrhaging votes to the Brexit party in key marginal seats. The most absurd aspect about this sentence is that it’s entirely true. The country’s current turmoil has two proximate causes: the Tories’ decision to make the majority pay for a crisis caused by their donors – the financial sector – breeding mass disillusionment and anger; and the Tory addiction to making calamitous decisions driven by their own perceived partisan interests. That’s why David Cameron called the Brexit referendum; why Theresa May bungled the negotiations, polarised the nation and mainstreamed the idea of no deal; and it is why Boris Johnson intends to engineer a disorderly Brexit during an election campaign.
AUG11	Despite Brexit, my trip back to Britain filled me with pride	August is a dangerous time to be back in London, when the city smells so much better than New York. For the past week my children and I have been enjoying the 20F drop in temperature with zero humidity, while playing a game of Better in England. The bread is better. Ditto the cheese. Clearly the weather is better and, since a version of Paw Patrol has been dubbed by English-accented children, everyone’s interest in the show has revived. The only hard call is the news: Brexit v Trump, which is the more depressing background condition? It was hard to watch the rusty carousel go round and stop oneself muttering about EU safety regulations
AUG11	To stop women and girls carrying knives, tackle the abuse and violence they face	Figures released this week reported a 73% increase in the number of knife possession cases involving women and girls in England. This was accompanied by commentary about how the police and Home Office are responding to this “hidden” issue. To say I was frustrated would be an understatement. First, the problem isn’t as hidden as it used to be. Women and girls are being arrested for these offences at increasing rates – so clearly they are being identified. Back in 2008 when I first started to interview women and girls about their experiences of serious violence, various services struggled to find people for me to interview. On some occasions I was simply told that girls weren’t affected by these issues and I was wasting my time. More than 10 years on, most local authorities, police forces, youth offending teams and community organisations can identify women and girls affected by or involved in weapon-enabled crime and violence. We really have no idea if more women and girls are carrying knives than they used to – we just know that more are being apprehended for such offences.
AUG12	Is the Queen remainers’ secret weapon? Don’t bet on it	In the preface to The Audience, his play about the Queen’s meetings with her many prime ministers, Peter Morgan reflects that these encounters lie at the very heart of “the British constitution, the bone structure of our establishment in its most elemental form”. As apposite as this metaphor is, it should also remind us that even the strongest bones can be bruised or fractured. And, according to reports in the Sunday Times, Her Majesty has indeed had it up to here with our politicians. According to one source: “I think she’s really dismayed. I’ve heard her talking about her disappointment in the current political class and its inability to govern correctly.” At a private event held shortly after David Cameron’s resignation in 2016, she reportedly “expressed her resignation and frustration about the quality of our political leadership, and that frustration will only have grown”.
AUG12	I’m calling for a cabinet of women to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit	It is hard to remember a moment in my lifetime when Britain faced a greater crisis. A coup led by a small group of rightwing libertarians is all but complete, as the Vote Leave team has been reassembled and taken control of 10 Downing Street. They are set upon implementing the most extreme no-deal version of Brexit – and, most terrifyingly, we are running out of time to stop them. At times of national crises political leaders need to bring a country together. But that is not happening. The government is hellbent on creating more divisions, scapegoating our friends and neighbours, and ignoring the inequality and democratic deficit that fuelled the Brexit vote.
AUG12	For a clear view of Trumpism, step outside the news cycle	In journalism, you can sometimes feel trapped in one of the smaller faster-spinning cogs of an information machine that never slows. Readers might experience this phenomenon through its palliatives – as, for example, a book by a leader writer or political editor who steps from frenetic years in the inner wheels on to a larger slower-moving part of the contraption and tries to make sense of its cycles. Or through a foreign correspondent who, after a long posting in which he or she has witnessed intensively the daily life of a country or region, offers a spacious survey of the people and place across time, trying to put recent events into history’s weave. The little agile cogs are necessary to the machine, but unless journalists seek out, and point the rest of us towards, those who labour on the bigger belts with less speed but often richer findings – the academics, the scientists, the public sector planners – we miss much.
AUG12	The very idea of a united kingdom is being torn apart by toxic nationalism	The first step to solving a problem is to see it clearly. And if we are to understand why we are facing not only our most serious constitutional crisis since the 17th century but an unprecedented economic calamity precipitated by a no-deal exit from the EU, we must recognise that nationalism is now driving British politics. Having set almost impossible terms for any negotiation with Europe and preparing to renege on legal obligations to pay our debts to the EU – the economic equivalent of a declaration of war – Boris Johnson’s government is hell-bent on conjuring up the absurd and mendacious image of the patriotic British valiantly defying an intransigent Europe determined to turn us into a vassal state.
AUG12	It’s not extreme to want to leave the EU on 31 October, come what may	The paths we have chosen in the past three years are ones no one would have anticipated. Neither, quite frankly, are they ones anyone would have wished for. Mistakes were made. But let’s be clear about one thing: the voters’ decision to leave the European Union and how politicians have gone about implementing the result are two distinct issues. Criticising the process of leaving is not the same as questioning the referendum outcome. Leave had a clear majority on a high turnout. Whichever way anyone voted, we can probably agree that the paralysis of indecision of this period has been corrosive and damaging. It has entrenched divisions and undermined confidence.
AUG12	It’s no time to play parliamentary poker. Let the people decide on Brexit	When he became prime minister, Boris Johnson had a huge opportunity, and responsibility, to reunite our divided country. As the figurehead of the Leave campaign in the Brexit referendum, he was uniquely positioned to reach out to the 48% of us who voted to remain in the European Union and who have been ignored by the government ever since. Johnson could have persuaded the most extreme Brexiters in his party that they should compromise with those who voted to remain. There are many young, urban and ethnic minority communities across Britain who are terrified about the future. Johnson could have chosen to use his position as the new prime minister to heal the divisions that have gripped us rather than widen them.
AUG12	I’ll crack black jokes about my own ills, but when it comes to my daughter…	When faced with tribulation, Glaswegian males often feel compelled to reach for humour. This can seem inappropriate, brutal even, but it’s not intended as such. It’s a psychological reflex and one to which we have become genetically predisposed. I feel that much of this stems from decades of fighting adversity when death and sickness were the most persistent neighbourhood pests. To make light of them was to make a statement to your community that you wouldn’t be defeated by them. Besides, if these twin impostors were intent on becoming a part of the local fabric for a while, then best to apply some emotional cosmetics rather than make everyone else miserable. In time, all of them would be expected to take their turn.
AUG12	Mr Johnson’s plot to subvert democracy is more dangerous than Brexit itself	Only once since 1945 has a British prime minister been evicted as a result of a successful no-confidence vote in parliament. That was on 28 March 1979, one of the most dramatic nights in modern parliamentary history. After many months of struggling for its life, Jim Callaghan’s battered minority Labour government faced a confidence vote brought by the Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher. It was nerve-shreddingly close. The Callaghan government lost by just one vote. Once the tellers for each side had marched up in front of the Speaker and read the result, there was uproar, during which Tories cheered with delight and some Labour leftwingers sang The Red Flag. Callaghan then got up to the dispatch box to make a brief and dignified statement in which he declared “we shall take our case to the country” at an election that he promised to hold “as soon as possible”. This would be an election that Callaghan had concluded, rightly, that he was going to lose. In strict law, he didn’t have to do that. The requirement that an election must be called by a government that has lost a confidence vote was “a firm convention” rather than solid legislation, as are the understandings that a government won’t unreasonably delay an election and will not do anything contentious once a campaign is under way. When people refer to the British constitution, they are talking about a hotch-potch of such conventions, combined with ancient charters, precedents, international agreements, legislative bolt-ons and unwritten understandings. The fabric of this messy tapestry is held together by a crucial thread. That is an underlying assumption that everyone can be trusted to behave in a proper way. In the absence of a formal constitution, British democracy is heavily reliant on politicians acting with honour and playing fair.
AUG12	Boris Johnson has a problem with women… and it’s not the one you think	Boris Johnson has a woman problem. No, not the rascally lady-killer stuff he probably loves people talking about. This problem is that female voters don’t like him. A YouGov poll shows that, while men give him a net favourability of -17, with women he scores lower with -25. Even Tory female Leavers aren’t as keen on Johnson as the Conservative Leave men. This isn’t about women disapproving of Johnson’s personal life. A 2018 Survation poll revealed that people didn’t care that Johnson was getting divorced, but they would still be less likely to vote for the Conservatives if he were leader, debunking the myth that only prudes and killjoys object to him. Similarly, the new poll doesn’t mean that women are having a fit of the vapours over Johnson’s personal life, however revealing it is for a grown man to drunkenly shout and swear at his much younger partner.
AUG12	The good old days? Look deeper and the myth of ideal communities fades	In the countdown to a possible no-deal exit from the EU, there are some who cling to an optimistic narrative that our community spirit will get us through. Indeed, recent experiences in Whaley Bridge lend some support to the idea that in a crisis community is revealed. The irony is that, in part, the whole Brexit project has been fed by an inchoate, but powerful, sense of nostalgia for community lost. There is nothing new about this longing for a past “golden age” of community. For at least two centuries, writers such as Coleridge, Ruskin and TS Eliot have compared their own fragmented, hedonistic and selfish times with an imagined earlier age of social harmony and “community” (indeed, a medievalist colleague assures me that, in the early eighth century, the ageing Bede took a similar view of developments in Anglo-Saxon England).
AUG13	Nationalism in England is not just a rightwing nostalgia trip	Over the past three years the spectre of a rampant English nationalism has gripped the imagination of the liberal left. The rise of a racist, backward-looking, imperialistic and xenophobic political force has been conjured up by politicians and commentators alike, serving as a convenient whipping boy for Brexit chaos and other travails. English discontent certainly does lie at the root of much recent turmoil. In 2015 fears that the SNP would dominate a weak minority Labour government helped give David Cameron his surprise majority (John McDonnell’s courting of the SNP on the subject of a second independence vote suggests that Jeremy Corbyn may face the same “Scottish question” very soon). In 2016 the bulk of the leave vote was provided by voters more likely to emphasise their English rather than their British identity. And it was Conservatism’s appeal to working-class English voters with a similar profile that denied Labour a majority in 2017.
AUG13	Brexit has turned our government into an Orwellian Ministry of Truth	Britain is battle-ready for no-deal Brexit, that’s the message. Downing Street gave every department 72 hours last week to present watertight crash-out plans and woe betide any whose ideas blow up later, Dominic Cummings menaced. “Task and finish units” will stress-test each one: tremble at the military-style management speak. In case anyone dares express a doubt that the nation is 100% ready, a rapid rebuttal unit was launched yesterday by Michael Gove to kill off any “media myths and half-truths”, reports the Sunday Telegraph. It will stamp on such “myths” as the BBC’s report that dairy cows will need to be culled if produce can’t be exported. Or similar warnings that unsalable sheep will be slaughtered when the door to 90% of the UK market slams shut on 1 November. The Cabinet Office, sounding like a Ministry of Truth, will “ensure the public and business is not being alarmed by scare stories or falsehoods”.
AUG13	Epstein’s death is a victory for misogyny: it denies accusers the justice they deserve	Jeffrey Epstein is dead. The accused sex trafficker was found unconscious in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in lower Manhattan on Saturday, where he was being held while he awaited trail on federal sex trafficking charges. Officials declared his death a suicide. After an incident in late July in which Epstein was found on the floor of his cell with marks around his neck, the former financier had been on suicide watch, but according to NBC News, he was not being monitored at the time of his death. Epstein’s death comes a day after records were unsealed from a civil suit brought by one of his alleged victims against Ghislaine Maxwell, the British publishing heiress and socialite who was Epstein’s longtime lover, employee and alleged co-conspirator in his abuse ring. Those records alleged that Epstein was at the center of an international web of sex trafficking, which according to the victim’s claims supplied young women and girls to powerful men including former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, former Maine senator George Mitchell, the hotel scion Thomas Pritzker, the hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin, the scientist Marvin Minsky, the lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Britain’s Prince Andrew. The accused men deny the allegations. The allegations swirling around Epstein have already led to the resignation of labor secretary Alex Acosta, who as US attorney had brokered an uncommonly lenient plea deal for Epstein when the millionaire was first charged with prostituting children in 2008.
AUG13	Boris Johnson talks tough but still hasn’t said what he’s doing to get a Brexit deal	When our nation’s economic performance slumps, our politicians should dig deep to deliver real answers to the problems at hand and make a superhuman effort to bring everyone on side. But under our new prime minister the administration has mistaken posturing and trash talk for compromise and hard work. There appear to be two camps under Boris Johnson’s command: those who definitely don’t want a withdrawal deal with the European Union and are working to avoid one; and those who do but aren’t working to secure one. Either way, the prospect of no deal looms larger than ever, at a time when we can least afford it.
AUG13	Labour politicians should know better than to buy into Johnson’s ‘Boris’ shtick	Is Labour really prepared for government? I ask not because the party seems more concerned about grouse hunting and the glorious 12th than a no-deal Brexit and an impending election. No, what really disturbs me is that the shadow cabinet is not showing sufficient animosity towards Boris Johnson. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott was interviewed this morning on the Today programme. It may be the silly season, but she was there talking about serious issues – Johnson’s promised 20,000 extra police officers and the effect increased stop-and-search would have on community relations. When asked by Sarah Smith about Johnson’s latest populist policing stunt, she replied: “Boris doesn’t quite explain how he will pay for it.”
AUG13	Nigel Farage attacking Prince Harry is like the angry man ranting on a bus	The sociologist Will Davies, describing the lesser-remarked conundrum of the Boris Johnson prime ministership (would the hardliners who anointed him ever be satisfied with any Brexit?), borrowed a phrase from American politics: asymmetric polarisation. It is an elegant, economical way of saying “the other side has gone bananas”, which is funny because it’s true. Let’s park the litany of examples for a second to concentrate on Nigel Farage. He appeared at a rightwing gathering in Australia on Saturday night – you could tell it was “alternative” because journalists were barred – and laid into Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a way that was somewhat astonishing, but mainly completely bats.
AUG13	Boris Johnson’s ‘crime fighting’ crusade is mere posturing	The most pressing issue facing Britain this month is not its falling crime rate. Yes, that reads falling crime rate – it has, indeed, been falling since 1995. The trouble is that it is not falling faster than Boris Johnson’s electoral prospects. Hence a month-long blitz of headline-seeking announcements on “fighting crime”. We have had 20,000 more police, 10,000 more prison places, enhanced powers of stop-and-search and convicts to get “the sentences they deserve” – a concept of Trumpian fatuity. The much-trumpeted idea that Johnson is some sort of Tory liberal in disguise is ridiculous.
AUG13	With prospects in the gutter, who can blame millennials for turning to the stars?	Like many people with Indian family, or white people with hippy parents, I had my Jyotish chart drawn up when I was still in nappies. I can therefore tell you that I was born into Venus, making me a lustful, infatuated child (albeit one with Meatloaf’s old hairline and a surprisingly large collection of hamsters). I can also tell you that I spent my 20s in Moon, susceptible to illusion, depression and deception (while living in a red-brick back-to-back in Leeds and listening to an unhealthy amount of Leonard Cohen). For many years, horoscopes held a place in my heart that was part secrecy, part shame, part hope and part entertainment
AUG13	Police in Hong Kong are brutally repressing democracy – and Britain is arming them	This weekend there was a further intensification of police violence against campaigners in Hong Kong. Over the past two months, police officers have attacked pro-democracy protesters using teargas, CS grenades, batons and small arms. More than 1,000 rounds of tear gas and 160 rubber bullets have been used since June, with human rights monitors accusing the authorities of beating protesters and applying “excessive and unnecessary force”. It is likely that many of the weapons being used were made in the UK: the Omega Research Foundation has published photos of UK-made CS grenades deployed by Hong Kong police against crowds. Since 2015, the UK government has licensed £8.6m worth of arms to the Hong Kong administration. This includes licences for teargas, anti-riot shields, pyrotechnic ammunition, spying technology and other equipment that could be used in the crackdown.
AUG13	A rock, the sea and a battle for meaning	The rock rises out of the water about a kilometre from Tel Aviv beach. It is sharp and serrated, and only desperate hands – the hands of a drowning man – would dare to grasp it. From an outsider’s perspective, my perspective, the perspective of a woman standing on dry land, what happened on this rock is simply impossible. How on earth could it have supported not one but two men, for long, endless minutes, in a life or death battle? The year is 1939. The Mediterranean is deep and blue. Tel Aviv’s shores are under the control of the British mandate and British law has forbidden Jews from entering the country. Those who manage to escape Europe find Palestine’s borders closed to them. Ships are sent back to the continent – only for some of their passengers to find themselves in the Nazi death camps.
AUG14	The glaciers of Iceland seemed eternal. Now a country mourns their loss	How do you write a eulogy for a glacier? Think about it. How would you go about that, having grown up with glaciers as a geological given, a symbol of eternity? How do you say goodbye? When academics at Rice University in Houston, Texas called and asked me to write the text for a plaque to commemorate the first dead glacier in Iceland, I found myself confronted with this problem. I was reminded of one of my favourite passages from Kurt Vonnegut in Slaughterhouse-Five:
AUG14	Britain’s infrastructure is breaking down. And here’s why no one’s fixing it	Whole swaths of Britain experience a blackout and the country lights up with fury. Cabinet minsters, the press, members of the public rightly demand answers: why was Newcastle airport plunged into darkness? Who is responsible for rail services being halted for hours? Threats are issued of a whopping fine, an official inquiry, heads rolling. Days of rage for a power cut of less than an hour. When it works, infrastructure is invisible. Point out the crumbliness, by all means, and lament the dangerous compromises – but as long as the wretched system judders on, voters shrug and politicians look the other way. Until the day the bridges collapse, the trains seize up and the lights no longer come on. By which time it is too late for anything but blame in 24-point headlines.
AUG14	Art needs protection: it belongs in public galleries, not private vaults	I fell in love with a picture at the Royal Academy summer exhibition. I’ve long been fascinated by the Tom Phillips project A Humument, which began in 1966 when he bought an obscure Victorian novel for threepence in a junk shop and began painting on the pages. The picture was a page from that, painted in blues, alongside text that speaks of windows and dreams. I gasped when I saw it. Although I cannot afford this piece of art (it’s £425), at least I got to go to a gallery and look at it, and that was a privilege. Art belongs to us all. Not literally; more often than not, it belongs to some billionaire, but philosophically and spiritually. The Isleworth Mona Lisa, a painting of the same woman, Lisa Gherardini, as its namesake, is purportedly by Leonardo da Vinci. It is majority owned by an anonymous consortium, and spends most of its time in their Swiss bank vault. Recently, it was allowed out briefly for a public exhibition in Florence, and a custody battle has ensued – with a lawyer, Giovanni Battista Protti, arguing on behalf of its other part-owners that it should not be returned to the vault. “Whoever owns it has a responsibility towards humanity. It’s important it should travel the world, for the benefit of everyone,” he said.
AUG14	Labour will scrap predicted grades to make university admissions fairer	Hundreds of thousands of students will receive their A-level results on Thursday. It is the end product of two years of hard work, and many will be hoping it is also the start of their next educational journey. Unfortunately, not all of them will have a fair chance to take that next step. Our higher education admissions process is neither fair nor effective.
AUG14	After the Brexit storm, a new political alliance could emerge	When boxers go into a clinch it looks more like a tender embrace than a fight. The same is true of the clash between Labour and the Tories. There is no affection between England’s heavyweight parties, but there is a kind of intimacy about the way they lean into their antagonism for tactical comfort. Boris Johnson is glad to have Jeremy Corbyn to campaign against, and the feeling is mutual. Fear of installing a radical socialist in Downing Street imposes discipline on Tory ranks, while the Conservative leader presents Labour with a caricature of its arch enemy – careless, heartless and posh.
AUG14	John Bolton doesn’t want a trade deal with the UK – he wants to colonise us	John Bolton doesn’t do free trade. He does regime change in countries such as North Korea, Venezuela and Cuba. He does military interventions, notoriously in Afghanistan in 2001, Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011. He does punitive sanctions and embargoes. He does spite. Bolton’s speciality is tearing up multilateral agreements, such as the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, which he claims undermine US national sovereignty. For the same reason, he reviles the very idea of the UN, international law and the international criminal court (ICC).
AUG14	How do you know whether you can trust poll results? Here’s what to watch out for	With the science of opinion polling under greater scrutiny than ever, and a somewhat misleading headline spreading in an instant, how can you know which insights count? Perhaps counter-intuitively, it’s less about sample size (let’s avoid a poor joke) than about quality. You will rarely get less than 1,000 interviews reported in the UK media, but twice the sample size does not mean double the quality. If there are issues with your sample then making it bigger doesn’t necessarily improve it. You should probably dismiss anything from social media (retweet for larger sample!) or a website (which can be gamed)
AUG14	Pulling out of EU meetings is a reckless PR stunt that will backfire on Britain	News that the British government is planning to withdraw from participation in EU meetings in the coming days is another ruse by Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson to “send a message to Europe” that the UK is leaving with or without a deal. Pulling out from day-to-day EU business in this way only serves to further diminish what remains of British influence. But such a reckless PR stunt will have minimal impact on the Brexit outcome. Brussels negotiators are waiting instead to see if members of the UK parliament can get their act together and stop a no-deal exit in September. Meanwhile, however, I can see at first-hand how, step by step, Johnson is reducing the UK’s influence, making us less able to shape the policies that affect British people, from fisheries policies to the climate crisis.
AUG14	A new slavery museum will have no impact on racism in Britain	Sadiq Khan has given his backing to a proposal from the Fabian Society to establish a British slavery museum in London in order “to deepen our understanding of the past and strengthen our commitment to fight racism and hatred in all its forms”. Britain’s role in transatlantic slavery is one of the most misrepresented in the national memory – a tale littered with lies told to hide the dark side of the island’s story. When David Cameron declared Britain should be proud to be the country “that abolished slavery”, he was merely indulging the national myth. As the 2007 celebrations of the act that abolished the slave trade demonstrated, little attention is paid to much other than white saviours such as William Wilberforce. Truly understanding how Britain’s dominant role in slavery built the nation is essential for any progressive understanding of the present.
AUG14	Of course the US supports a no deal – it makes a minnow out of Britain	If you thought it was bad enough when Donald Trump held a reluctant Theresa May’s hand, then look away now. For things are about to get sweatier. The president’s clammy embrace of the British right continued this week with the arrival of his national security adviser John Bolton in London, to declare the most isolationist US regime in living memory would “enthusiastically” support a no-deal Brexit.
AUG15	The UK faces a nation-defining battle that will split the Tory party	Throughout his nine years in Conservative-led British cabinets, Philip Hammond was regularly compared to AA Milne’s Eeyore. But what the lugubrious former chancellor did today was almost Tiggerish. By warning that Boris Johnson’s government is set on driving through a no-deal Brexit that parliament will oppose he gave the UK’s indolent August politics a much-needed wake-up call. In the three weeks since a hard-Brexit Tory coup put Johnson into Downing Street, politics has drifted into La-La land. An accumulated combination of long parliamentary stalemate, public weariness, an ineffectual Labour opposition, a compliant press and the well-executed strategy of the new Tory leader has made the Johnson government’s Brexit policy seem more inevitable than it actually is. By breaking cover, Hammond has provided an overdue reminder that the facts are still the facts.
AUG15	India’s illegal power grab is turning Kashmir into a colony	I haven’t been able to hear the voices of my parents for more than a week now. We usually talk or exchange messages a few times during the day, mostly about their creeping health issues or about my children’s latest antics here in London. But now, not a peep. It’s because, like all Kashmiris, they’re under siege, experiencing the worst crackdown in three decades, imposed by the Indian government as it revoked the region’s autonomy by abrogating article 370 of the constitution. The article, dating back to 1949, guaranteed Kashmir’s special status within the larger Indian union and enshrined the conditions of the state’s accession to India soon after partition in 1947. The newly created states of India and Pakistan had gone to war over Muslim-majority Kashmir, an independent kingdom at the time. After mediation from the United Nations, all parties agreed that the future of Kashmir was to be decided later via a referendum – something India and Pakistan have failed to honour. The provisions of the article meant that, pending the final resolution via a plebiscite, the state had its own constitution, its own national flag, a prime minister and a president, even as successive Indian regimes, starting in the early 1950s, diluted the article in order to diminish Kashmir’s autonomy.
AUG15	Johnson’s government doesn’t care about no-deal sceptics like Philip Hammond	Well, that didn’t last long. When Boris Johnson entered Downing Street last month, there had been a hope among his supporters that internal Tory critics would give him the summer to get settled in, before airing any differences when parliament returns in September. That was not to be. Philip Hammond has today concluded that three weeks was plenty of time for the summer Brexit truce. The former chancellor has used an op-ed in the Times to voice his concerns about the new prime minister’s strategy, arguing that a no-deal Brexit would be “as much of a betrayal” as remaining in the EU. If an election does occur, Hammond and other anti-no-deal MPs will need to consider how they plan to position themselves
AUG15	Britain’s infrastructure is breaking down. And here’s why no one’s fixing it	Whole swaths of Britain experience a blackout and the country lights up with fury. Cabinet minsters, the press, members of the public rightly demand answers: why was Newcastle airport plunged into darkness? Who is responsible for rail services being halted for hours? Threats are issued of a whopping fine, an official inquiry, heads rolling. Days of rage for a power cut of less than an hour. When it works, infrastructure is invisible. Point out the crumbliness, by all means, and lament the dangerous compromises – but as long as the wretched system judders on, voters shrug and politicians look the other way. Until the day the bridges collapse, the trains seize up and the lights no longer come on. By which time it is too late for anything but blame in 24-point headlines.
AUG15	Ex-porn star Mia Khalifa wants to move on with her life. Why won't we let her?	It’s hard to get a clear picture of how many adults are watching porn on the internet. A study by the Observer back in 2014 suggested 56% of us had done so; in 2018, American researchers found 73% of women and 98% of men had done so in the last six months. I would put money on the real numbers being even higher. That’s what makes listening to social media personality Mia Khalifa talk about her struggle to move on from her time in the porn industry so uncomfortable. Speaking in an interview published on YouTube, the 26-year-old opens up about how appearing in porn over a period of just three months in 2015 continues to affect her life today. “People think I’m racking in millions from porn. Completely untrue,” she tweeted, alongside a clip of the video. “I made a TOTAL of around $12,000 in the industry and never saw a penny again after that. Difficulty finding a normal job after quitting porn was … scary.”
AUG15	How the far right in Spain has seized on bullfighting to make its point	Last Friday, after a brief prohibition, bullfighting returned to Mallorca. The bullfight was well attended and it was met with a demonstration by a large group of animal rights protesters. To drown out the demonstrators, Cara al Sol (Facing the Sun) – the anthem of the Spanish fascist party, the Falange – was played over the loudspeakers. What exactly is going on here? The cult of the bull on the Iberian peninsula goes back millennia, but bullfights are a more recent phenomenon. They date to the 18th century when Felipe V, the first of the Bourbon kings, banned and disparaged bullfighting by the aristocracy. Old-style bullfighting – nobles on horseback fighting bulls with lances – died out, giving rise to a new type of bullfighting, on foot and practised by the common people.
AUG15	The glaciers of Iceland seemed eternal. Now a country mourns their loss	How do you write a eulogy for a glacier? Think about it. How would you go about that, having grown up with glaciers as a geological given, a symbol of eternity? How do you say goodbye? When academics at Rice University in Houston, Texas called and asked me to write the text for a plaque to commemorate the first dead glacier in Iceland, I found myself confronted with this problem. I was reminded of one of my favourite passages from Kurt Vonnegut in Slaughterhouse-Five:
AUG15	Invisibility cloaks and 3D masks: how to thwart the facial recognition cameras	Picture the scene. You and your kids are sporting in the fountains in the square behind London’s King’s Cross station. Your phone beeps. A news alert tells you that the owners of this (pseudo-) public space, Argent, are using facial recognition software in security cameras. You look up from your phone and see a camera pointed right at you. It’s not just the police who are photographing and identifying you on the street now, but private security operatives too. Not only do you worry that your boss might thereby acquire data to undermine your claim to be “working from home”, but you are furious at this violation of your privacy, not to mention feeling quite stupid for forgetting a towel. Your fears are not allayed by this statement from Argent: “These cameras use a number of detection and tracking methods, including facial recognition, but also have sophisticated systems in place to protect the privacy of the general public,” particularly when they didn’t disclose what these systems are. 
AUG15	Drug companies are putting a price on the lives of those with cystic fibrosis	At 7am, I wake up and, while most people are starting their days, having breakfast and making their way to work, I – like the 10,400 people in the UK with cystic fibrosis – am beginning my daily treatment regime. For me, this involves a concoction of 30 tablets to fuel my morning, each with their own variety of debilitating side-effects, from sickness to dizziness and fatigue. The morning calm is disturbed by my noisy inhalation machine as I breathe in medications, while a positive pressure machine helps me cough up thick, sticky mucus from my lungs, which takes another hour. All in all, it’s a glamorous way to start the day. And it doesn’t stop there. Every time I eat, I have to take enzymes to help me digest my food, and I take a regular dose of painkillers to help me get through the aches and pains. It’s a constant reminder of my disability and all the limitations it has on me living a “normal” life. After a long and exhausting day, my medication routine is repeated in the evening, with more oral antibiotics and the same gruelling therapy process. I do this every day, morning and evening, in order to try to stay as healthy as possible and in an attempt to maintain my lung function.
AUG15	Art needs protection: it belongs in public galleries, not private vaults	I fell in love with a picture at the Royal Academy summer exhibition. I’ve long been fascinated by the Tom Phillips project A Humument, which began in 1966 when he bought an obscure Victorian novel for threepence in a junk shop and began painting on the pages. The picture was a page from that, painted in blues, alongside text that speaks of windows and dreams. I gasped when I saw it. Although I cannot afford this piece of art (it’s £425), at least I got to go to a gallery and look at it, and that was a privilege. Art belongs to us all. Not literally; more often than not, it belongs to some billionaire, but philosophically and spiritually. The Isleworth Mona Lisa, a painting of the same woman, Lisa Gherardini, as its namesake, is purportedly by Leonardo da Vinci. It is majority owned by an anonymous consortium, and spends most of its time in their Swiss bank vault. Recently, it was allowed out briefly for a public exhibition in Florence, and a custody battle has ensued – with a lawyer, Giovanni Battista Protti, arguing on behalf of its other part-owners that it should not be returned to the vault. “Whoever owns it has a responsibility towards humanity. It’s important it should travel the world, for the benefit of everyone,” he said.
AUG16	If Jo Swinson is serious about stopping a no-deal Brexit, she must support Corbyn	Jeremy Corbyn has always been more of a politician than either his most fervent supporters or detractors have wanted to admit. Last night he again demonstrated why. In a move unprecedented in modern times, the leader of the opposition has offered to form a government with the express proviso of not implementing any of his party’s policies. Corbyn’s offer, in a letter to other party leaders and moderate Tories, involves setting up a “strictly time-limited temporary government ? with the sole intention of extending article 50 and holding a general election. In that election, Corbyn will commit to a new referendum with the option of remaining in the EU. 
AUG16	Boris Johnson’s crackdown on crime is just the latest ruse in the Tories’ class war	Our so-called justice system exists to crack down on the misdemeanours of the poor, while ignoring the crimes committed by the rich. When Boris Johnson proposes a law-and-order clampdown – driven by cynical electioneering, rather than actual evidence – he’s talking about locking up the “people you step over in the street”, as Frances Crook, the CEO of the Howard League for Penal Reform, puts it, not reckless bankers or white-collar fraudsters. Lock ’em up, throw away the key: such demagoguery always has an innate emotional appeal, not least among a public enraged by increased violent crime, which is itself fuelled by a decade of slash-and-burn Tory economic policies. But further brutalising those already roughed up by a social order rigged in favour of yacht owners, financiers and the residents of Mayfair will satisfy the bloodlust of the Daily Mail and achieve little else.
AUG16	Corbyn has taken a brave step. Now he must rule out any ‘Labour Brexit’	Jeremy Corbyn just got inside everyone else’s decision cycles. The Labour leader’s offer to lead a “strictly time-limited” government, to prevent a no-deal Brexit and to call a general election, has forced all political factions to react and led the news bulletins. Amid the initial responses – which ranged from cautious to churlish – the bigger point has been missed. Corbyn’s gambit crossed numerous significant lines, both political and psychological.
AUG16	Remainers will do anything to stop Brexit, except install Corbyn as PM. Why?	Brexiters stop at nothing to get what they want and remainers stop at everything. The laws of political motion then dictate which direction things move. Jeremy Corbyn has written to MPs inviting them to install him in Downing Street, having deposed Boris Johnson with a vote of no confidence. His tenure would, he promises, be “strictly time-limited” – long enough to call a general election and seek the necessary article 50 extension to conduct a ballot.
AUG16	Social class still stops too many pupils from fulfilling their A-level potential	As A-level students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland open their results today it is fascinating to see how the public broadcasting of success is reaching ever wider audiences through news streaming and social media, where constant posting and comments will dominate news for the next few days. Images of young people literally jumping for joy dominate the headlines and the exam results data is closely interrogated. Data analysis usually rests on pass rates and concern about whether these have risen or fallen; each year there are questions that challenge our trust in the so-called gold standard examination, because A-levels have the potential to open doors for (some) young people.
AUG16	In Reykjavik I found I couldn’t write. But then I started to notice small things	In the summer of 2009 I moved to Reykjavik with my young family. I stopped writing. Not writing didn’t matter – phases of silence are good for writers the way winter is good for trees – but it was uncomfortable. Iceland is a deeply literary country, its national identity founded in the sagas, which recount the first centuries of settlement beginning a thousand years ago. Icelanders read more books than anyone else, and writing and storytelling are highly valued. Writers with no particular connection to Iceland often feel called to visit in order to research and write novels set there, and before we moved I imagined that I might, too. A family of medieval outlaws, I thought, or something experimental about extreme weather and the human condition, or maybe just a novel about a family who move to Iceland. How could a story fail to turn up? Courtesy here is like the plants – everything is close to the ground and slow-growing
AUG16	Brexiteers promised a new dawn for UK farming, not agricultural Armageddon	A small flock of sheep is trotting down Whitehall today to join a meeting of farmers who are coming together to mark the launch of a devastating report on the impact of a no-deal Brexit. The report rings the death knell for upland hill farming, but sheep are only the first in the line of fire: it also warns that half of Britain’s farms would go out of business and calls for a public vote before any Brexit. Today’s report, written by Séan Rickard, the former chief economist of the National Farmers’ Union – and launched by Farmers for a People’s Vote – is a forensic analysis of the effect of a crash-out Brexit, which the government will struggle to refute. The high proportion of UK farm exports to the EU would stop, barred by regulatory barriers and deterred by tariffs: 27% on chickens, 46% on lamb and 65% on beef. Cereals would be hit too. The government says it will remove or sharply lower all tariffs on imported food to keep prices down as the pound plunges. But this report shows how that import surge would wreck British farming.
AUG16	The UK faces a nation-defining battle that will split the Tory party	Throughout his nine years in Conservative-led British cabinets, Philip Hammond was regularly compared to AA Milne’s Eeyore. But what the lugubrious former chancellor did today was almost Tiggerish. By warning that Boris Johnson’s government is set on driving through a no-deal Brexit that parliament will oppose he gave the UK’s indolent August politics a much-needed wake-up call. In the three weeks since a hard-Brexit Tory coup put Johnson into Downing Street, politics has drifted into La-La land. An accumulated combination of long parliamentary stalemate, public weariness, an ineffectual Labour opposition, a compliant press and the well-executed strategy of the new Tory leader has made the Johnson government’s Brexit policy seem more inevitable than it actually is. By breaking cover, Hammond has provided an overdue reminder that the facts are still the facts.
AUG16	Dementia is our collective responsibility. We can’t ignore it any longer	There’s a silent crisis in our midst. Often cunning and stealthy like Grandmother’s Footsteps, sometimes swift and brutal, dementia is all around us. One in eight people die of it. In the UK, a person is diagnosed with it every three minutes. Yet we are still collectively failing to acknowledge this self-demolishing illness, which is now the largest cause of death in England and Wales and the one we most fear. Why? I’ve recently been doing talks around the country as part of John’s Campaign (named after my late father, who lived for 10 years with the disease), which I co-founded to encourage the NHS to collaborate more with families in the care of dementia patients. There is always time given to questions from the audience at the end. Often these turn out not to be questions at all, but confessions, or acts of bearing witness, or simply pleas to be heard, understood, recognised. In a hall in London, a young woman puts up her hand, stands, opens her mouth, then instead of asking a question she bursts into tears. In a church in the north of England, an old woman speaks of how for 15 years she cared for her husband with a particularly savage form of early-onset dementia until he died and how she was now the sole carer for her son, who has the same illness. She speaks with a terrifying calmness; it’s only when those around her offer help that her face crumples in grief. A man with white hair asks, “What shall I do? What?” A daughter asks, “How do we tell him what is wrong with him?” A son asks, “How long can it last?” He also means, “How long can I bear it?”
AUG16	What Dominic Cummings said is true – the Tories don’t care about the NHS	Dominic Cummings, the “mastermind” behind the Vote Leave campaign, and now the prime minister’s top political adviser, wrote after the referendum: “Would we have won without £350m/NHS? All our research and the close result strongly suggests no.” Cummings also said in 2017 that Tory MPs “don’t care about the NHS”. Cummings, who was found to be in contempt of parliament earlier this year, is now leading the prime minister’s attempts to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. So, with the leavers now in charge will their infamous £350m a week cash injection for the NHS come to fruition? Of course not – we are instead looking at a potential crisis that could cost lives. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, refuses to rule out deaths from medicine shortages if the UK crashes out, saying: “‘No deal’ is not pretty. It’s very difficult for the economy and for lots of other areas like healthcare.” But still he serves in the government. And his department is even trying to stop the truth from getting out. Through freedom of information requests to all NHS trusts in England and Wales I have learned that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has essentially imposed a gagging order to prevent trusts from publishing their own impact studies about what a no-deal Brexit would mean for hospitals, staff and patients. Hospital chiefs have been told that releasing the information could cause trusts “premature financial harm, and so possibly put public wellbeing at risk”. 
AUG17	‘National Unity’: the fantasy flick that will never make it out of development	Three years on from the Brexit vote, what best crystallises where we are? Perhaps that nowhere even close to 326 politicians can unify on what would constitute a government of national unity. The Liberal Democrats will do anything to stop Brexit, except for the things they won’t; Labour would love to stop the Tories’ version of Brexit, but first they just want to look busy and set this quick trap for the Lib Dems; the Greens want the headlines for a day and they’ve got a plan just batshit enough to secure them; and so on. Dominic Cummings must be cackling. The only worse form of unity was a Mitford. So while it’s positive to have had leadership of the prospective government of national unity whittled down to just under 16 million candidates, it does feel a little bit near the business end of things for politicians to be indulging in the weapons-grade wankery we’ve seen this week.
AUG17	There’s an idea that could transform Britain – but Brexit won’t let it be heard	Against some stiff competition, one of the worst things about Brexit is the way it sucks up all the oxygen, consuming whatever political energy is available, until there’s none left for anything else. Just think what we might have achieved these past three years if the bureaucratic and intellectual resources we’ve devoted to the business of leaving the European Union had been directed elsewhere. Instead, there’s barely been time to think about, let alone deal with, the climate crisis or even some of the issues that led to the Brexit vote, from precarious work to the shortage of affordable housing. There is, perhaps, no more concrete example of this attention squeeze than in relation to an idea that would utterly transform the public services we rely on from cradle to grave: an idea so bold and innovative it is winning admirers all over the world, its author summoned to address governments from Scandinavia to Latin America, its approach hailed on the opinion page of the New York Times as the “fix” for a broken welfare state – and yet all but ignored by the national government of the author’s home country, whose bandwidth is consumed entirely by Brexit.
AUG17	By dismissing Corbyn’s overtures, the Lib Dems are showing their true colours	If your signature policy – indeed, only visible political position – is to stop Brexit, and you claim that you will do absolutely everything within your power to prevent no deal, then it’s something of an error to suddenly introduce an exception. And yet this is the fatal mistake the Liberal Democrats have made. When Jeremy Corbyn wrote a letter putting himself forward as a transitional prime minister purely to block no deal, extend article 50 and call an election, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson could have welcomed the move as constructive, as the SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru have done, with several Tory backbenchers prepared to talk, too. Instead, Swinson revealed that while the Lib Dems had been willing to prop David Cameron up for five years, implementing massive cuts and trebling tuition fees, she’s not prepared to countenance supporting Corbyn for five weeks solely to stop a disorderly exit from the EU. Her plan to do a backroom deal to put Harriet Harman or Ken Clarke in No 10 smacks not only of establishment stitch-up – it is also a constitutional nonsense, given it falls to the leader of the opposition, who has twice won a democratic mandate from his party membership and whose party won 40% of the vote just two years ago, to construct an alternative government. But constitutional nonsense, otherwise known as the Fixed-term Parliaments Act – which is itself another Lib Dem gift to the nation – is why we’re in this mess in the first place.
AUG17	Of course millennials are saying ‘I don’t’ to wedding invites. We’re completely broke	I adore being a wedding guest. In fairness, I realise we’re not allowed to admit otherwise. If you don’t toe the party line, you don’t get to go to the buffet. Claiming that you don’t like attending weddings is worse than saying that you hate Christmas, or that the sound of children laughing and playing makes you want to remove your own ears with nail scissors. Weddings can be challenging if you don’t like bunting, or you wish to have full jurisdiction over your bank holidays. But every single person who attends a wedding has the chance to appear in the final scenes of a romantic comedy. You can write your own silly jokes, choose your own special headgear and escape from reality with the help of lukewarm white wine and overcooked chicken. In 2019, wedding venues are the only places left in the UK where you know that you can turn up and most people will be in a good mood.
AUG17	Forget a 2008 Lehman Bros-style crash – this is how a ‘normal’ recession could start	There’s a hoary old proverb in the financial markets that a crisis happens precisely when the institutional memory of the last crisis has faded: when all the key chairs are occupied by people who aren’t scared any more, the same mistakes get repeated. On that basis, in the face of grim economic news around the world, we ought to be reasonably safe from another Lehman Brothers-type meltdown, or even a repeat of the eurozone crisis. But what might be a little bit more worrying is that there are surprisingly few people left who remember how the normal kind of recession happens.
AUG17	Peterloo was the massacre that led to a new democratic era	Two hundred years ago, on 16 August 1819, the event we’ve come to know as the Peterloo massacre took place, as a public meeting on St Peter’s Fields in Manchester was violently broken up by troops acting on the orders of the local magistrates. The meeting had been called as part of a wider movement to demand parliamentary representation for the rapidly growing industrial city of Manchester, which had no MP at the time. The economic depression that followed the end of the Napoleonic wars, made worse by a series of poor harvests, had led to widespread unemployment, wage cuts and desperate poverty in the area, and people had no means of making their wishes known to parliament except by extra-parliamentary means.
AUG17	Social media must not rob us of the right to change our minds	It could all have been so different. In some parallel dimension, social media is being used to shape our political discourse for the better: as an arena where views and beliefs are expressed generously and listened to eagerly, where we allow our prejudices to be challenged, where we welcome opposing opinions, where we learn from those who see the world differently from us. Alas, we are in this dimension, and we are human beings, so what could have had a beneficial effect on public life instead threatens its viability. And at a time when compromise is needed more than ever – not least to help ease a political impasse that endangers the social fabric of Britain – social media gives every appearance of having been devised solely to guarantee tribalism and intransigence. It is time for us first to acknowledge and then to resist its calculated manipulation of our psychological weaknesses, and assert afresh one of our greatest freedoms: the freedom to change our minds.
AUG17	Packing Christmas cards knocked the pseudo-intellectual snob out of me	I finished my A-levels in July of 1999, the summer of the eclipse, the Matrix and, legally, the start of my adult life. The one thing these things had in common was that none of them was visible from the Leicestershire village of Earl Shilton. It’s a place you might describe as “picturesque” or “rural”, as long as you were standing on the outskirts and facing the surrounding countryside. At the time I was more likely to use words like “bleak”, “small” and “decaying, isolated shithole”, but that’s because I was a teenage Manic Street Preachers fan, and we said that sort of thing a lot. Going to university was something of an unknown quantity in my family, but my parents – unbelievably proud of my offer to study sociology at Loughborough – knew one thing for sure and hammered it home: you got a job in the holidays. It’s just what you did. And I was going to need the money. For the first time since 1962, there was to be no mandatory grant for students (thanks, New Labour!), and though I qualified for support to cover my tuition fees, and a student loan would just about cover the rent for my self-catered, shared room in halls, if I didn’t save any cash I wasn’t going to have any. I knew the student union did pound-a-pint nights, but I’d probably have to eat too.
AUG17	Omar al-Bashir’s trial will be a sham, but Sudan’s revolution is alive and well	For such a young revolution, the Sudanese uprising already has many potential anniversaries. On 11 April, it deposed the Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir after almost 30 years of rule. Twenty-four hours later, on the 12th, it dispatched his successor, Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf. And then came 3 June, a day marked in blood on the uprising’s calendar, when the army and the Janjaweed militia launched a dawn massacre across the country targeting peaceful protesters. Bashir is not really gone. He has only been replaced by those who stood in the shadows behind him
AUG17	The chicken shop knife-crime campaign would be funny if it wasn’t so tragic	After their 2013 “Go Home” vans, a campaign so ill-conceived and prejudicial it had to be withdrawn after public outcry, you’d think the Home Office would have learned its lesson. But alas! This is a “stand back, chaps, and hold my drink” kind of government; its spirit animal is a bull in a china shop, and, like a demented Tinkerbell, it truly believes that anything is possible with a little faith, trust, and pixie dust (sorry, I mean racism). The latest debacle unfurled on Wednesday when the Home Office proudly tweeted about the launch of its chicken shop-focused anti-knife initiative, in which thousands of takeaway boxes will be repackaged with the stories of young people who successfully went #knifefree.
AUG18	The Philadelphia story couldn’t be told today…	Many years ago, a friend’s mother asked her if her husband was going to accompany them to the playground. “No, Mum,” my pal replied, with what the cynical might assume was false brightness. “He’s seen the kids go down a slide before.” Now, in these times when, as enraged libertarians like to point out, one can hardly crack a common-or-garden joke without being sent to the stocks, she’d probably be fined for perpetuating a negative gender stereotype.
AUG18	Last week, I gazed on a truly wild land... and saw art reflected back	Achmore is a nondescript hamlet on the A858 that cuts across the isle of Lewis and Harris in the Outer Hebrides. This is a gnarled, fractured landscape, swaddled in wind and rain, and built out of some of the oldest rocks on Earth – Lewisian gneiss, the bedrock of the island, is some 3bn years old, two-thirds the age of Earth itself. We had gone to Achmore to search out an ancient stone circle. There are dozens of these, including the most famous one at Calanais, scattered across Lewis’s melancholic moorland. The Achmore stone circle was disappointing, with little to catch the eye. But then we turned to look south. And almost gasped. For Lewis’s forbidding landscape, caught in a delicate light suffused through the late-afternoon cloud, had been transformed, becoming draped in an ethereal, almost unreal, beauty. Dozens of lochans – small lochs – dappled the foreground. Behind them, where the hills of Harris rose, were layer upon soft layer of pastel colours, from gold through green to blue, laid like chiffon scarves across the horizon.
AUG18	Oh I do like to be beside the seaside, but many of our coastal towns need more love	My summer holiday of choice involves no passport, minimal cultural outings and as much time as possible spent immersed in 15C water. When I tell people that I am spending my break swimming in the North Sea off Yorkshire, reactions tend to run from “you’re brave” to “why would you do that?”. Which I imagine is similar to the comments I’d get if I announced I was taking a week to visit prisoners with whole-life orders. But I maintain that true pleasure requires not much more than an RNLI-supervised beach, a tide table and a novel to read between dips. The British seaside is tragically underappreciated and disastrously underfunded. A lack of year-round jobs and lousy transport links are driving its residents away: four in 10 coastal towns are forecast to suffer a decline in their population of under-30s, with those in the north worst affected. Even the south-west, which attracts nearly half of the visitors to Britain’s coast, is struggling. Places that are a hive of cute tearooms and sun-dappled tourists in the summer pull down their shutters at the end of the season; the holidaymakers leave and a bleak and empty winter sets in.
AUG18	Greta Gerwig: why Little Women still generates a big buzz	You have to be super-confident to release a film without Will Ferrell at Christmas. But then “eagerly anticipated ? doesn’t quite cover the release of Greta Gerwig’s Little Women. In case you haven’t been ticking off the days in an analogue, fabric-covered diary (with lock) like a genuine Louisa May Alcott nut, the release date is Christmas Day (Boxing Day in the UK). And on the basis of just a trailer, Little Women has been tipped for all Oscars by everyone. Overhyped? Absolutely not. This confidence is correctly placed. Despite the diminutive title, Little Women is a ratings behemoth. It always has been. Written in the midst of the American civil war, the novel has spent the intervening 150 years as the stand-out star of novels for young women. The saga of the four sisters of the March family of Massachusetts, their conflicting ambitions and achievements, has proved to be intergenerational catnip. It is also one of those library A-listers that works super well on screen. There have been at least eight TV versions, a silent 1918 film, a 1933 version, 1949 in Technicolor and the 1994 version starring Susan Sarandon and Winona Ryder. 
AUG18	How Greta Thunberg became the new front in the Brexit culture war	She looks both younger than her age and old enough to have the cares of the world on her shoulders. Face scrubbed clean, dressed in a severe black jacket, Greta Thunberg stares unsmiling from the cover of this month’s GQ magazine. It’s an arresting, even unsettling, image: her outstretched finger points accusingly at the reader, in the manner of a wartime recruitment poster. Your planet needs you, millennials. Back in the 1990s, posing for men’s magazines in your knickers was a rite of passage for young actors and pop stars not so much older than Greta, but that feels a very long time ago now. Here is a cover girl designed not to titillate male readers but to nudge their consciences, and very successfully, too. Successfully enough to make her some powerful enemies.
AUG18	‘Do black people read?’ What my years in publishing have taught me about diversity in books	My daughter, like me, is of mixed heritage. She has wildly curly hair, as have I. When she was born four years ago I was given five copies of the same kids’ picture book by well-meaning friends and relatives. It was called Guess How Much I Love You. This book, whose lead characters are rabbits, was a bestseller in the 1990s. Back then it flew off the shelves. What I did not expect when I was pregnant with my daughter was that it would be far easier to find her a rabbit picture book than one featuring a child like her with brown skin and curls. This week Malorie Blackman, author of Noughts and Crosses, told Channel 4 News that of the many books she read as a child “not one of them featured a black child like me”, adding that “it made me feel invisible in the world of literature”. And when, in her mid-20s, she noticed in a children’s bookshop that little had changed, “that’s when I decided that I wanted to write for children ... for the child in me, really, for all the books I wish I could have read as a child”.
AUG18	‘National Unity’: the fantasy flick that will never make it out of development	Three years on from the Brexit vote, what best crystallises where we are? Perhaps that nowhere even close to 326 politicians can unify on what would constitute a government of national unity. The Liberal Democrats will do anything to stop Brexit, except for the things they won’t; Labour would love to stop the Tories’ version of Brexit, but first they just want to look busy and set this quick trap for the Lib Dems; the Greens want the headlines for a day and they’ve got a plan just batshit enough to secure them; and so on. Dominic Cummings must be cackling. The only worse form of unity was a Mitford. So while it’s positive to have had leadership of the prospective government of national unity whittled down to just under 16 million candidates, it does feel a little bit near the business end of things for politicians to be indulging in the weapons-grade wankery we’ve seen this week.
AUG18	Switch off the phone, turn on the radio and tune into Proust	Might Marcel Proust, on finding that BBC Radio 4 is to broadcast a 10-hour adaptation of In Search of Lost Time across the August bank holiday weekend, stretch his dictum that “the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes”, so that it also includes ears? Or might a 21st-century version of him simply mutter “meh” and start streaming episodes of Euphoria or Glow, while tweeting about something completely different? I’d like to think the former, though Proust, like Isaac Hayes’s Shaft, was a complicated man, and not amenable to second-guessing. Either way, though, the broadcast is good news for devotees of the author and of French literature, and to anyone wary of the often toxic brew of over-excitement, overindulgence and ennui that a long weekend brings. Under a Labour government, which would be committed to even more of the damn things, let’s hope for lengthy adaptations of The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists and Germinal.
AUG18	There’s an idea that could transform Britain – but Brexit won’t let it be heard	Against some stiff competition, one of the worst things about Brexit is the way it sucks up all the oxygen, consuming whatever political energy is available, until there’s none left for anything else. Just think what we might have achieved these past three years if the bureaucratic and intellectual resources we’ve devoted to the business of leaving the European Union had been directed elsewhere. Instead, there’s barely been time to think about, let alone deal with, the climate crisis or even some of the issues that led to the Brexit vote, from precarious work to the shortage of affordable housing. There is, perhaps, no more concrete example of this attention squeeze than in relation to an idea that would utterly transform the public services we rely on from cradle to grave: an idea so bold and innovative it is winning admirers all over the world, its author summoned to address governments from Scandinavia to Latin America, its approach hailed on the opinion page of the New York Times as the “fix” for a broken welfare state – and yet all but ignored by the national government of the author’s home country, whose bandwidth is consumed entirely by Brexit.
AUG18	By dismissing Corbyn’s overtures, the Lib Dems are showing their true colours	If your signature policy – indeed, only visible political position – is to stop Brexit, and you claim that you will do absolutely everything within your power to prevent no deal, then it’s something of an error to suddenly introduce an exception. And yet this is the fatal mistake the Liberal Democrats have made. When Jeremy Corbyn wrote a letter putting himself forward as a transitional prime minister purely to block no deal, extend article 50 and call an election, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson could have welcomed the move as constructive, as the SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru have done, with several Tory backbenchers prepared to talk, too. Instead, Swinson revealed that while the Lib Dems had been willing to prop David Cameron up for five years, implementing massive cuts and trebling tuition fees, she’s not prepared to countenance supporting Corbyn for five weeks solely to stop a disorderly exit from the EU. Her plan to do a backroom deal to put Harriet Harman or Ken Clarke in No 10 smacks not only of establishment stitch-up – it is also a constitutional nonsense, given it falls to the leader of the opposition, who has twice won a democratic mandate from his party membership and whose party won 40% of the vote just two years ago, to construct an alternative government. But constitutional nonsense, otherwise known as the Fixed-term Parliaments Act – which is itself another Lib Dem gift to the nation – is why we’re in this mess in the first place.
AUG19	Now we know the cost of no deal, MPs must do whatever it takes	The term “Project Fear” must be expunged from the respectable political lexicon. Now that we know the full detail of the government’s Operation Yellowhammer assumptions about a no-deal Brexit, these two words – scornfully applied for three years to all warnings about Brexit – have no meaningful place in the present political emergency. “There’s a lot of scaremongering around,” declared the energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, in dismissive response to the Sunday Times’ reports on the leaked Yellowhammer document. Really? These, after all, are the government’s own assessments, not the panicked assertions of ultra-remainers.
AUG19	Jeremy Corbyn wants a general election, but is his party ready to fight one?	Be careful what you ask for. Labour relentlessly demands a general election, and may attempt to bring one about in the autumn, but is the party in good shape to fight what will be one of the most critical campaigns in our modern history? When I put this important, yet neglected, question to one senior figure in the party, he responded with blunt candour: “No, we’re not ready. Not remotely ready.” Let’s break it down into five components: candidates, leadership, messages, mobilisation and money. In each category, Labour faces difficulties. Some are relatively mild. Other handicaps are severe and hard, even impossible to address in the very little time that may be left before an election is upon us.
AUG19	Salvini wants to lead Italy. He may be about to get the chance	We are witnessing the beginning of act two in the drama of Italian populism, and it is a showdown between the protagonists who made phase one happen. Since the election of 2018, Matteo Salvini’s League has grown stronger, and it has had enough of its coalition partner, the Five Star Movement. It now feels it can claim sole leadership of the country, with Salvini as prime minister. It’s a development that Steve Bannon, the theoretician of the US populist wave that elected Trump in 2016, foresaw. The day after the coalition was formed, Bannon said of Salvini and the Five Star leader, Luigi Di Maio: “They will govern together, but Salvini is the real leader, because Di Maio resembles [Emmanuel] Macron.” This was always a tactical alliance, because in the end populism is based on there being only one leader.
AUG19	It’s the moral panic de rigueur – but they can’t make me feel bad about being trans	There’s a strange dissonance inherent in being a living, breathing, three-dimensional trans person at a time when the concept of your existence is framed as an abstract topic for debate – one you’re forced to reluctantly show up for, despite never agreeing to. As trans people become the moral panic de rigueur, as a narrative emerges so deliberately sensationalised, it remains obvious that those who would seek to erase trans people from public life have never spoken to a trans person in their lives.
AUG19	Peter Fonda, the easy rider who tested the hippy dream	Add today, high up the list of those iconic images of the 1960s, that of Peter Fonda in floral shirt and outrageous sideburns, riding free on his Harley, to a soundtrack of Steppenwolf’s Born to be Wild. John Kay’s growl was a battle hymn for those “looking for adventure” along the open road down which Wyatt, Billy and George (Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson) unleashed themselves. And they, Fonda above all, represented the quintessence of that era – its creative tumult, idealism, loss and self-absorption – on screen.
AUG19	Revealed: Boris Johnson's secret weapon for a no-deal Brexit	How many small plastic toy egg casings could be hidden in, for example, a Michael Gove? And, if we knew this figure, and had an accurate idea of potential volunteer multiple plastic toy egg couriers, could we extrapolate from it the volume of goods that might be secretly transported, in this fashion, both in and out of our ring-fenced island nation? And why is knowing this number an important part of planning for the no-deal Brexit that our uncooperative friends in George Soros’s Europe, and the traitorous MPs who collaborate with them, are cruelly forcing on us through no fault of our own? A civil servant I was in Woodcraft Folk with 43 years ago regularly texts me about bizarre developments in the National Centre For No-Deal Planning, despite risking her job to do so. “They’ve got us hard at work finding out how we get components and medicines and essential items into the country, if or when the supply lines break down. Don’t forget to stockpile toilet roll, Stewey! It may end up being the only viable form of currency!! LOL!!!”
AUG19	Facial recognition is now rampant. The implications for our freedom are chilling	Last week, all of us who live in the UK, and all who visit us, discovered that our faces were being scanned secretly by private companies and have been for some time. We don’t know what these companies are doing with our faces or how long they’ve been doing it because they refused to share this with the Financial Times, which reported on Monday that facial recognition technology is being used in King’s Cross and may be deployed in Canary Wharf, two areas that cover more than 160 acres of London. We are just as ignorant about what has been happening to our faces when they’re scanned by the property developers, shopping centres, museums, conference centres and casinos that have also been secretly using facial recognition technology on us, according to the civil liberties group Big Brother Watch.
AUG19	Spinning conspiracy theories won’t help us prevent another Chernobyl	Did it really happen? Was it really so bad? Is it true that they were so unprepared? These are the questions I have heard the past few months in connection with the stunning success of the miniseries Chernobyl. It brought to life the tragedy of people who lived through, were affected by and, yes, caused the world’s worst nuclear disaster. My book Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy, published in May 2018, one year before the broadcast of the miniseries, tells the story of the disaster on the basis of recently released archival documents, which I checked against people’s diaries, memoirs and interviews. Thus, on the factual level, I can provide some answers to the accuracy of the miniseries. But inquiries I’ve received in the past few months also made me think about the bigger question of what is true in our current understanding of the Chernobyl disaster, its causes, development and consequences.
AUG19	The Philadelphia story couldn’t be told today…	Many years ago, a friend’s mother asked her if her husband was going to accompany them to the playground. “No, Mum,” my pal replied, with what the cynical might assume was false brightness. “He’s seen the kids go down a slide before.” Now, in these times when, as enraged libertarians like to point out, one can hardly crack a common-or-garden joke without being sent to the stocks, she’d probably be fined for perpetuating a negative gender stereotype.
AUG19	Last week, I gazed on a truly wild land... and saw art reflected back	Achmore is a nondescript hamlet on the A858 that cuts across the isle of Lewis and Harris in the Outer Hebrides. This is a gnarled, fractured landscape, swaddled in wind and rain, and built out of some of the oldest rocks on Earth – Lewisian gneiss, the bedrock of the island, is some 3bn years old, two-thirds the age of Earth itself. We had gone to Achmore to search out an ancient stone circle. There are dozens of these, including the most famous one at Calanais, scattered across Lewis’s melancholic moorland. The Achmore stone circle was disappointing, with little to catch the eye. But then we turned to look south. And almost gasped. For Lewis’s forbidding landscape, caught in a delicate light suffused through the late-afternoon cloud, had been transformed, becoming draped in an ethereal, almost unreal, beauty. Dozens of lochans – small lochs – dappled the foreground. Behind them, where the hills of Harris rose, were layer upon soft layer of pastel colours, from gold through green to blue, laid like chiffon scarves across the horizon.
AUG20	Donald Trump’s UK trade promises are hot air – his aim is Brexit chaos	As the UK races towards a potential no-deal Brexit, President Donald Trump is cheering it on. But Brexit – especially without a deal in place with the European Union – would be bad for the US-UK special relationship and would make the UK a much less important US ally. The ramifications of Brexit – in particular without a deal with the EU that pleases everyone – could be explosive. It could hurt the UK economy at a time when Trump’s trade war and economic policies are increasing the risk of a global recession, and threaten the very integrity of the UK amid growing signals that Northern Ireland and Scotland would consider breaking away. Boris Johnson appears willing to drive Britain off this cliff come hell or high water, threatening a no-deal Brexit and saying that the UK will leave the EU by the end of October, “do or die”. Everyone hopes that the UK finds a way out of this mess, but the past few years haven’t provided much evidence to believe that it will end well.
AUG20	Tory MPs face a crisis of career, conscience and credibility over no deal	Privileging career prospects over the call of one’s conscience can terminally damage political credibility. That is the message those Conservative MPs working to prevent a no-deal Brexit will want their colleagues to hear when they go back to work in September. Soon our elected representatives will have left the poolside and returned to the faded grandeur of Whitehall. Meanwhile those who stayed in Westminster this August, including the vast majority of ministerial special advisers, have been bracing themselves for the great Brexit battle 2.0. (Actually, it’s more like 10.0 – even giving Windows a run for its money. But never mind.)
AUG20	What’s the best remedy against anti-vaxxers? Reverse public health cuts	The UK is a world leader in vaccine research and provision and an early adopter of many new vaccines. This has had a profoundly positive effect on the nation’s health, affording protection to our children and decreasing rates of infectious disease. Unfortunately, immunisation has been prominent in the headlines recently for all the wrong reasons. Immunisation rates have now decreased to the point where, in England, we no longer achieve the World Health Organization’s required level of 95% coverage in any of the routine childhood vaccinations at the correct time point. This is a travesty not only for the children who miss out on vaccination and are susceptible to catching the disease, but also for people who can’t have vaccinations – babies, people undergoing cancer treatment – who gain indirect protection from high immunisation rates preventing disease spread.
AUG20	The real consequence of a no-deal Brexit is not short-term shock – it’s a long recession	A couple of days before the UK voted to leave the EU, the official remain campaign, Stronger In, released a bulletin of what it imagined the news headlines to be the next day in the event of a leave vote. Job losses would ensue, it said; prices would rise, the pound would plummet, and the UK would be stuck in a protracted negotiation process for the next decade. (Tellingly, the issue of the Irish border wasn’t mentioned.) Since the vote, sure, life is worse in the UK than it was in 2016 – but it’s hard to pin that on Brexit, as a sense of national decline is at least partly why a majority voted to leave in the first place. Indeed, aside from the parliamentary absurdities of the past three years and the slide in sterling’s value, it’s fair to say that the predicted catastrophe hasn’t really happened. The principal group of people whose lives have been immediately disrupted by Brexit are EU citizens and the victims of increased racist hate crimes. Shamefully, that doesn’t seem to be reason enough to give us pause as a nation – and so we’ve pressed on.
AUG20	You can’t replace the GP with an algorithm – so don’t try to, Matt Hancock	The health secretary has announced a proposed overhaul of NHS health screening that could scrap GP consultations for millions of people, replacing them with online programmes and AI. The idea is that the one-size-fits-all system for routine health MOTs offered to those over 40 has become old hat. Those between the age of 40 and 74 are currently called into their GP surgery every five years for checks on weight, cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure. This is to see whether patients are at risk of problems such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and stroke. Now Matt Hancock says we need to be utilising technology and sophisticated data collection to direct help to those most in need. These changes may see in-person checks being reserved only for those deemed high risk, with everyone else expected to rely on predictive online algorithms.
AUG20	Heard the one about the older comedian who was given a fair chance of success?	I’m writing this from a damp Edinburgh flat, having abandoned my comfortable London life for a month at the fringe, which is like a month-long freshers’ week, but with finals every day. My show Invisible, about life at an age when the world ghosts you, came about because I turned 50 and didn’t like the cut of Yann Moix’s jib – the French author said last year that women over 50 are invisible and too old to love. (I’ve spent my whole life trying to be invisible to men like him.)
AUG20	Big tech firms need to stop reducing LGBT+ people to their sex lives	Here’s a question: how comfortable would you feel typing the word “lesbian” into a search engine in the office? Or maybe while a parent pottered about behind you? Or even, perhaps, not in incognito browsing mode? If your answer is “not very”, then you’re probably aware that it’s a term that has more often than not returned salacious results. It’s the online reflection of the far-too-frequently sexualised, real-life reaction to female sex-same relationships.
AUG20	Being an EU citizen in the UK was hard enough. Now Priti Patel has made it worse	Being an EU citizen living in the UK for the past three years has largely had the same rhythm as an undergraduate degree: relax, relax, panic for a week, enter a deep state of denial, relax, relax and repeat. We have either been forgotten about for months at a time, breezily told that everything will be fine (but we shouldn’t bother filling our pretty little heads with the fine print), or reminded that our main function resides with the services we provide to Britons. EU citizens are mostly great when we pick your fruit or treat your gran; we may choose other professions, but should have the decency to stay quiet if we do so.
AUG20	Denying single women IVF is a cruel policy that belongs in the past	When I look at my newborn son, whose eyes crinkle as he smiles, and his older sister who wakes each morning asking to give him cuddles, I find it hard to believe that the NHS would describe our family as a “burden on society”. But, because I’m a single mother who used fertility treatment and a sperm donor to conceive my children, this is how NHS South East London sees us.
AUG20	I folded cardboard at Blockbuster, and found inner peace amid the boredom	This is a long shot, but did you by any chance rent Titanic on VHS around September 1998? Yes? Was it from a branch of Blockbuster somewhere in suburban north Kent? Yes? Amazing! We have so much in common. Because I spent several weeks of that summer folding and packing the display cases for those videotapes, and shoving them in the back of a lorry. Just to walk you through the process, I would start with the flattened display case (Kate and Leo facing upwards), pop it on the cardboard housing, fold-fold, big Sellotape, flip, big Sellotape, shove it in the lorry. It actually wasn’t unlike burying someone at sea. In exchange for this task I was paid more than £4 an hour – a princely sum in pre-minimum wage Britain, especially for a teenager with a chronic CD habit.
AUG21	If you can’t abide Jeremy Corbyn, learn from the moral of Ed Miliband	In that moment you could feel British politics lurching out of its rut. Labour was about to pick its next leader – and instead of choosing the favourite, the old Tony Blair tribute act, voters were throwing a giant spanner in the works. They wanted the slightly gawky leftwing underdog. They wanted a transformed party, a bigger politics. They wanted Ed Miliband. So much has changed this decade that it seems absurd to consider how at its start, in 2010, a 40-year-old father of two and whiz on a Rubik’s Cube was considered the biggest threat to the British establishment. Did that really happen? Yes, confirm the archives. He was Red Ed, a “Marxoid creep” (the Daily Mail, of course), the man with the sneaky plan to turn the country into some socialist banana republic.
AUG21	Donald Trump’s UK trade promises are hot air – his aim is Brexit chaos	As the UK races towards a potential no-deal Brexit, President Donald Trump is cheering it on.

AUG22	I’m not surprised Olivia Laing is sharing her book prize money – I did the same	When I read this week that Olivia Laing would be sharing her James Tait Black prize winnings with her fellow shortlisted novelists, I was less surprised than some. Not because I know Laing (I don’t), but because her decision made sense. In 2017, I donated half my winnings for the International Dublin Literary award to establish a new prize for debut translators, the TA First Translation prize. The previous week, Jessica Cohen won the Man Booker International prize and announced that half of her £25,000 would be going to B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights NGO. What we spend money on – especially in a business where there isn’t enough to go around – is a statement of what we value.
AUG22	Meritocracy is a myth – so don't judge people on their GCSE grades	On exam results days, there’s now something of a social media tradition of those long out of the school system sharing stories of success despite a disappointing set of results. In some cases it’s an honest attempt to reassure those who’ve not hit the high grades that their future is one still full of potential; for Jeremy Clarkson it’s just an annual excuse to show off. And while the sentiment from many is admirable – of course exams taken in your teens should not define your life – there’s no denying that when 16-year-olds across the UK open their GCSE results tomorrow, much will be determined by what they find inside. Without the right grades, colleges and sixth forms might reject you; the doors to competitive degree courses and universities will either be a little more open or resolutely slammed shut.
AUG22	I wrote a sketch about Muslims at airport security. Guess what happened next	I know it’s coming – the double-take at my face, the auxiliary taps on the keyboard, the indiscreet scribble on my boarding pass. I find myself thinking a familiar thought: thank God I came early. On what seemed like a packed flight from London to Los Angeles – I was the only person pulled aside for “random additional security screening”.
AUG22	So we’d be happier as empty-nester parents? That’s rubbish	Christoph Becker and his colleagues at Heidelberg University in Germany have discovered that people with kids are actually happier than people without – so long as the kids have left home. Their analysis of 55,000 people aged 50 and older from 16 European countries revealed that people with children who had fled the nest had greater life satisfaction and fewer symptoms of depression than those without children. But according to an even newer cross-sectional survey of parents, this is a load of pants. Using the established qualitative research method of the one-to-one interview, I asked my partner and the mother of my children what she thought. Certainly not true for us, she said. I then extended the focus group by asking myself what I thought – nah, bollocks, I told myself.
AUG22	Just as in 1914, the Brexit buildup is making calamity feel inevitable	The historian AJP Taylor argued that Europe was plunged into the first world war by the inexorable operation of train timetables. He was not ignoring historic rivalries between the continent’s great powers, nor truncating the sequence of diplomatic failures that turned competition into military confrontation. But at a critical moment, carefully laid mobilisation plans could not be deactivated. Escalation to calamity proceeded metaphorically and literally on rails. Even with a century of hindsight it is impossible to discern a point of no return in the runup to the first world war
AUG22	‘Self-care’: how a radical feminist idea was stripped of politics for the mass market	What do professional golfers, radical queer feminists and Instagram lifestyle influences have in common? They are all devotees of “self-care”. While the earlier self-help movement focused on improving yourself, the relatively new self-care movement focuses on preserving yourself. It’s lifestyle advice for an age of diminished expectations, where most people have given up on getting to the top and the best they can hope for is to get through the day. Self-care is self-help for a time when about a third of the population will suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder during their lives. Self-care is a remarkably flexible term. It includes nearly any activity people use to calm, heal and preserve themselves in the face of adversity. Some common forms of self-care include getting enough sleep, eating well, physical exercise, meditating and doing things you like such as watching an 80s teen film. Other suggestions for self-care include tracking your menstrual cycle, having date nights with yourself, doing craft activities such as crochet, learning the art of saying no, and “consciously unfollowing” people on social media.
AUG22	Yes, contemporary capitalism can be compatible with liberal democracy	Is contemporary capitalism compatible with liberal democracy? The glib answer, though not wrong, is that it had better be. There are no known examples of fully socialized economies with a liberal democratic regime. The more considered answer is that it can be, but only with the public policies that make it so. The relationship between liberal democracy and capitalism changes over time, as do the policies needed to make them mutually supportive. Not for the first time, changes in the structure of capitalism have lately moved faster than the policies required to domesticate them. Liberal democratic governments are scrambling to catch up.
AUG22	Ignore the sneering: young people’s rage is an age-old sign of failed politics	In the documentary Everybody in the Place, the Turner prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller delivers a talk to a group of sixth-form politics students about late-80s acid house in Britain. As well as documenting the massive cultural changes that took place, he draws a clear line between the decline of industrialisation, the miners’ strike, sound-system culture and the rise of dance music. As Deller shows old footage of whey-faced ravers in bucket hats and sports gear dancing in fields and warehouses, the students look on with a blend of bafflement and fascination. It’s weird, one of them says, that no one has a phone. Another film, also out now, reports on a youth movement born from political and social disenfranchisement, and a desire for a new way of living. Woodstock – Three Days that Defined a Generation tells the well-documented story of the hippy era and the 1969 music festival that took place in the shadow of Vietnam and civil rights unrest. “We were looking for answers,” says one attendee. “We were looking for other people that felt the same way as we did … If 400,000 people could get together and have absolutely no violence, absolutely no conflict, I felt like we could bring all of that love back into society – and change the world.”
AUG22	Donald Trump’s UK trade promises are hot air – his aim is Brexit chaos	As the UK races towards a potential no-deal Brexit, President Donald Trump is cheering it on. But Brexit – especially without a deal in place with the European Union – would be bad for the US-UK special relationship and would make the UK a much less important US ally. The ramifications of Brexit – in particular without a deal with the EU that pleases everyone – could be explosive. It could hurt the UK economy at a time when Trump’s trade war and economic policies are increasing the risk of a global recession, and threaten the very integrity of the UK amid growing signals that Northern Ireland and Scotland would consider breaking away. Boris Johnson appears willing to drive Britain off this cliff come hell or high water, threatening a no-deal Brexit and saying that the UK will leave the EU by the end of October, “do or die”. Everyone hopes that the UK finds a way out of this mess, but the past few years haven’t provided much evidence to believe that it will end well.
AUG23	Boris Johnson should call the DUP’s bluff and create a border in the Irish Sea	As Boris Johnson journeyed back from this week’s desperate trip to Germany and France, he might have reflected on his hero Churchill and those “dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone.” Somehow those totems of Britain’s archaic colonisation of Ireland refuse to release their stranglehold on British politics. And here was Johnson at their mercy, being lectured by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron on how to govern them. It was intolerable. Johnson got no joy in Berlin or Paris. Merkel’s meaningless 30-day “talks” period was greeted with ecstasy by his Tory press claque. But Macron merely pointed out that nothing had changed. The steeples were still there, telling London what not to do.
AUG23	Yes, parliament can block a no-deal Brexit – if it can just agree on how	Read this morning’s headlines, and you’d be forgiven for thinking the highest-stakes Brexit meetings this month are taking place in Berlin and Paris – as Boris Johnson trails round European capitals meeting his German and French counterparts. But this is all for show. Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron don’t need to meet Johnson in person to hear about his hardline demand that the backstop be altogether removed from the withdrawal agreement. And no amount of cordiality from Germany’s chancellor changes the fundamentals of the standoff: Europe will not drop the backstop unless there is a practical, workable alternative on the table – which there isn’t. The impasse continues.
AUG23	My fiancee is in an Iranian prison, a victim of the depravity of international relations	As I write, my fiancee, Aras Amiri, is being held in an Iranian jail on false charges of espionage. A British Council employee, she’s caught in the middle of two global powers who refuse, or don’t know how, to talk to each other. Aras is an Iranian citizen, and by fabricating untruths (lies that the Iranian ministry of intelligence knows to be utterly false), and imprisoning her through a bogus trial and an appeal without legal representation, the Iranian government is simply imprisoning its own citizen, shooting itself in the foot to spite an enemy. It is no coincidence that Aras’s appeal was rejected and her 10-year sentence confirmed on the same day that a Gibraltar court made its decision on the release of the Grace 1 tanker, a ship that British troops hijacked at the behest of the US government.
AUG23	Why are children forced to choose between the arts? The Ebacc must go	All children should be required to take at least one arts GCSE and there should be no restriction on taking more than one. This year there has been a modest increase in the number of children taking art itself – 9% up on last year – but a fall elsewhere: music and drama are down, as is design technology, with uptake a staggering 23% down on last year. These figures show one thing very clearly: that politicians should stay out of the pathways pupils choose throughout their education. I am excited by the increase in pupils taking visual art, but I am dismayed that some children who are good at art as well as drama, or art as well as music, have had to choose one subject over the other because of the structure of Michael Gove’s Ebacc wheeze, whereby even if a child can find a school that offers a timetable where art and music do not conflict, then only one subject will be counted in the Ebacc league table.
AUG23	How a trip to Peppa Pig World taught me the value of nostalgia	I felt bad about what I was going to do – drag my children to a town off the south coast where I used to go on holiday as a child – and I thought they deserved a reward for indulging me. At the end of the trip, there would be a two-day pass for Peppa Pig World, vaguely on our way back to London and as tedious for me, I assumed, as the experience of eating crab sandwiches on the front at Ventnor would be for them. The entire vacation this summer has featured this kind of unstated trade-off; for my twin four-year-olds, the price of the fun fair, the endless cave-in to demands for sweets and ice-cream (and some heavy lifting in the Sainsbury’s toy aisle), was two cathedrals, a museum about Roman Britain and a trip up a 14th-century bell tower, featuring 249 steps and some commentary about the tomb of King John. But the Isle of Wight was the big one: four days devoted entirely to the experience of watching me wander, misty-eyed, around small gift shops and a lot of extremely long walks along the cliffs.
AUG23	How will Britain treat EU citizens after Brexit? They need to know – and so does business	In Boris Johnson’s first speech to parliament four weeks ago, he made an unambiguous vow to the 3.2 million EU citizens living in the UK. Thanking them for their contribution to British society, the new prime minister assured EU citizens that under his government they would have the “absolute certainty” of their rights being protected. But a string of reports in the past week has led to increasing alarm among individuals and employers that this promise is in now in doubt. This risks sparking confusion and disarray in the run-up to 31 October. The muddle arises from reports that home secretary Priti Patel has been pressing for an immediate end to free movement in the event of no deal. This appears to mark a significant shift in policy. Until now, the government has said that in a no-deal scenario, EU citizens will generally continue to be able to come to the UK to live and work until the introduction of a new system in January 2021. While their legal status will change, in practice the main difference is that they will have to apply for European temporary leave to remain for stays of more than three months. Given this status is freely open to all EU citizens, provided they pass certain criminality checks, a version of freedom of movement will in effect continue for at least another year.
AUG23	Britain and Italy are now the terrible twins of Europe	For most of the time since 1945, the politics and government of Britain and Italy have seemed like polar opposites. True, both were important European powers. True too, each had a place among the world’s major economies. Even now, Britain and Italy will be among the select group of economically powerful nations whose leaders will gather in the Second Empire splendour of Biarritz’s Hotel du Palais this weekend for the latest G7 summit. In the past, that was where the similarities began to ebb away. In politics, Britain was famously stable while Italy was infamously not. British governments were domestically strong, while Italian governments were weak and short-lived. In Britain, leftwing politics was rooted in industrial unionism, while Italy possessed the largest, most modern-minded and most alluring communist party in the west. When Britain looked in the mirror it saw the embodiment of probity and practicality, while Italy was all too often synonymous with crime and corruption. While Britain maintained its autonomy by refusing to join the eurozone, Italy enthusiastically embraced its upper mid-table place in the EU and its membership of the single currency was shamelessly engineered.
AUG23	A new poll shows what really interests 'pro-lifers': controlling women	According to self-identified “pro-life” advocates, the fundamental divide between those who want to outlaw abortion and those who want to keep it legal comes down to one question: when does life begin? Anti-abortion advocacy pushes the view that life begins at conception; the name of their movement carefully centers the conceit that opposition to abortion rights is simply about wanting to save human lives. A new poll shows that’s a lie. The “pro-life” movement is fundamentally about misogyny.
AUG23	Far-right violence is on the rise. Where is the outrage?	Mohammed Saleem was murdered by a terrorist, and yet you’ve probably never even heard of him. It was April 2013, and the 82-year-old was walking home from evening prayers at a mosque in Small Heath, Birmingham. A Ukrainian neo-Nazi terrorist – who had bombed three mosques – stabbed him three times from behind. “He was a very beautiful, educated man who empowered all of his five daughters – and his sons as well – to pursue education, and loved and appreciated everything Britain gave him,” says Maz Saleem, his daughter. “I’ve spent six years tirelessly campaigning for him to be recognised in a mainstream platform.” In the past decade, across continents, white supremacists have repeatedly chosen the same targets for shootings, stabbings, bombings and car attacks.
AUG23	Boris Johnson is playing politics with Northern Ireland’s ‘delicate balance’	Control and consent are intimately related. Where consent exists and is freely given, statements of control are unnecessary. The government is determined to deliver on Vote Leave’s promise to “take back control” – to assert sovereignty on behalf of leave voters. But the complicated consent structures of the UK’s most complicated corner, Northern Ireland, are once again getting in the way. On the evidence of the prime minister’s letter to Donald Tusk on Monday, the government is not minded to let that stop them.
AUG24	Poor Prince Andrew is ‘appalled’ by Epstein. Let that be an end to it	It’s basically your classic men-of-the-world vignette. Lying in business dress in the New York mansion of his friend Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew is receiving a foot massage from a young, well-dressed Russian woman. Other men are in the room while this is happening, and they include Epstein (also being foot-massaged by a Russian woman) and the literary agent John Brockman, who runs a foundation connecting scientists and intellectuals with billionaires. As the young Russians work on their feet, Andy is complaining about his lot. “In Monaco,” he says, according to Brockman’s account, “[Prince] Albert works 12 hours a day but at 9pm, when he goes out, he does whatever he wants, and nobody cares. But, if I do it, I’m in big trouble.” Waa waa waa. What could be a more effective heartstring-tugger than “other European princes have it better than me”? It’s right up there with Chandler’s line from Friends: “My wallet’s too small for my 50s, and my diamond shoes are too tight!”
AUG24	Greening your life is all very well – but only a global climate strategy will fix this	Judging by the latest opinion polls, the public is ripe for some green austerity. Ipsos Mori says that 85% of Britons are concerned about climate change, with 52% admitting they are very concerned. These are the highest figures since the pollster started tracking opinion in 2005. Given the spate of extreme weather-related events, and the pictures of the torching of the Amazon rainforest, such concern is both logical and predictable. In this country, the climate deniers have been put to flight. What the polls don’t show is whether the public is willing to translate this concern into action; whether similar levels of concern are present in less prosperous parts of the world; and whether it is possible to translate individual concerns into collective political action. Here, the message is a lot more mixed. The furore over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s private jets are a case in point. People don’t like being lectured to, particularly when those doing the lecturing fail to live by their own ethical code.
AUG24	How is Boris Johnson’s Britain viewed in other G7 countries? Our panel responds	A nation of islands shaped by limited space and imperial ambitions, garden aesthetics and ceremonial teas – and stoic, stiff-lipped reserve in the face of adversity: Great Britain, or Japan? For many Japanese, Britain has long been something of a western mirror and model nation, a land whose geographical and cultural character were recognisable and achievements often admirable: a doppelganger off the coast of another continent and equally rich with tradition, history and parochial pride. At least, until Brexit.
AUG24	After a month, Johnson has exceeded Tory expectations – now the hard part begins	Three years ago, Boris Johnson was the butt of the joke among Conservative MPs. After his spectacular failure to become prime minister, he was thrown a political lifeline by Theresa May making him foreign secretary, yet there was little evidence that theirs was a relationship of mutual respect. At her first Conservative party conference as prime minister, May used her keynote speech to poke fun at his reputation for being a chaotic and inconsistent politician. “When we came to Birmingham this week, some big questions were hanging in the air. Do we have a plan for Brexit? We do. Are we ready for the effort it will take to see it through? We are. Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days … ? Just about.”
AUG24	In Bolsonaro’s burning Brazilian Amazon, all our futures are being consumed	The Amazon is the centre of the world. Right now, as our planet experiences climate collapse, there is nowhere more important. If we don’t grasp this, there is no way to meet that challenge. For 500 years, this has been a place of ruins. First with the European invasion, which brought a particularly destructive form of civilisation, the death of hundreds of thousands of indigenous men and women and the extinction of dozens of peoples. More recently, with the clearance of vast swaths of the forest and all life within it. Right now, in 2019, we are witnessing the beginning of a new, disastrous chapter. The area of trees being cleared has surged this year. In July, the deforestation rate was an area the size of Manhattan every day, a Greater London every three weeks. This month, fires are incinerating the Amazon at a record rate, almost certainly part of a scorched-earth strategy to clear territory. Why is this happening now? Because of a change in power.
AUG24	Boris Johnson’s cheerleaders are delusional – no good Brexit deal is possible	Ten days before David Cameron’s disastrous Brexit referendum in 2016, a group of EU diplomats asked me for my prediction. Ignore the narrative that remain would sweep to inevitable victory, I told them: Britain is heading directly for the exit. Perturbed – this was not what other journalists were telling them – they explained what would happen if so. There would never be a favourable deal for Britain. This was an existential question for the EU: they could not incentivise other nations to leave. Their electorates already resented special treatment for Britain, from the rebate to its exemption from Schengen. They had their own domestic anti-EU and anti-immigration political forces to contend with, none of which they wished to encourage. And if their countries suffered any economic damage because of Brexit, then their voters would be even more resentful towards Britain and even less willing to offer concessions. Strikingly, there were no dissenters from this united position.
AUG24	An election is coming – and only all-party cooperation can stop no deal	With a snap general election on the horizon, the campaign machinery is moving full speed ahead. As leader of the Women’s Equality party, for the past few weeks I have been speaking to leaders and strategists from across the political spectrum in an effort to stop us from crashing out of the EU. That means I’ve been privy to the jostling that is currently taking place as the mainstream parties iron out their game plans for winning votes and seats. What I have seen doesn’t fill me with confidence. A focus on yesterday’s polling data, the minutiae of legislative process and plans to unveil big name candidates without big ideas behind them will only get us so far. Because standing for election should mean just that: truly standing for something. People across the country may soon be reluctantly opening their doors to enthusiastic canvassers ready to explain why a vote for so-and-so is the surest means of delivering Brexit. Or avoiding Brexit. Or securing a better Brexit deal. Those voters who are willing (or eager) to accept no deal have a relatively straightforward choice ahead of them, but for those who want something better, the options are cloudy at best.
AUG24	When calling out environmental hypocrisy is nothing but a cynical ploy	Ever since Al Gore first launched his climate crusade, the sight of any given public figure making the case for action, anywhere other than in their own home, has frequently been met with the following genre of response: if you care so much, how come you took a plane? If you didn’t take a plane, how much did the alternative cost? How much steel does a train use these days, anyway? Wouldn’t it be cheaper, ergo greener, not to go anywhere? Recently the cacophony has become deafening. Take, for example, the case of Prince Harry and Meghan’s use of private jets, and what it says about their environmental credentials. Once we might have understood that the rich would say and do things in their own rich fashion, and it was worth it for those things to be done; now it seems wealth is used to discredit ethical arguments by the wealthy. Groups are disbarred from collective ambition because their privilege sets them outside the collective.
AUG24	Sorry, Mr Trump – Greenland’s no go. But can I interest you in our little island?	People say that news these days is unexpected and baffling, but really could there be a more predictably 2019 story than “Donald Trump wants to buy Greenland”? It has all the boring trappings of a typical Trump story – gobsmacking ignorance, casual racism, colonialist attitudes towards the treatment of indigenous people, a cold-hearted, transactional view of human life, and ending with him calling a woman in power “nasty”. If the news were a binge-worthy drama, this would be a mid-series episode that The AV Club would rate C-: “a worryingly formulaic outing that makes you fear the writers have run out of ideas.” The whole idea was a nonstarter anyway – Greenland is a proud, independent region. What kind of self-respecting island nation would willingly accept being purchased by the United States? If Trump wants to buy somewhere, he needs to find somewhere that’s been entirely stripped of pride, dignity and joy to the extent that it is now completely incapable of self-governance. A country so humiliated and degraded that it would happily grovel at the feet of an expansionist empire if it just promised the slightest iota of stability.
AUG24	Too many women have pain during sex. Let’s break the taboo about it	Like so many, I adore Fleabag. She’s outrageous, with a sexual animalism that I love to see in female characters on-screen. With Fleabag, Phoebe Waller-Bridge fearlessly draws out female desires that women have long buried under mounds of unwarranted shame. Now that her theatre run is enthralling London, I’m reminded that we’re in a time when female sexual enjoyment is finally celebrated. But there’s another side to women’s sexual experiences that is rarely represented on-screen – and yet it affects so many. What about women who experience pain during sex? It’s an angle that doesn’t fit in with steamy sex scenes in films – and it definitely wouldn’t have a place on shows such as Love Island.
AUG25	If Boris Johnson wanted Britain to lead the world, he’d stop hedging his bets and back HS2	The foundations of the dynamic economies of the 21st century will be massive agglomerations of people. In the new era of the learning machine, anything that is routine – from a production line to the legal processes surrounding buying and selling a house – will be performed by a robot. What will drive economic activity instead are myriad face-to-face interactions, from education to medicine, which can’t be done by machines but can be done by people living in vast, highly-connected urban areas that foster such interactivity. This trend is already clear – think Tokyo and Tokyo Bay, San Francisco Bay, the M25 area in London, the Beijing orbital rings. In an age of capitalism with robots, the advantage of such areas is going to become even more marked. Essentially, the more an economy can agglomerate, the more it will take off, especially if it is supported by fit-for-purpose public interventions and investment.
AUG25	Sure, defend Meghan Markle from racists, but let’s not bow to the monarchy	Take a feudal relic. Add a splash of glamour. A pinch of wokeness. And a dash of hypocrisy. Stir in a lashing of racism. Squeeze out the last dregs of nuance. And dump it all into the ferment of social media and tabloid gossip. What do you get? A surreal debate about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, the royal family, racism and wokeness that seems to have turned more heads than one of the duchess’s £60,000 outfits. The latest episode in the soap opera began when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their three-month-old son, Archie, took a private jet to fly to the south of France to holiday in Elton John’s villa. Cue outrage about the hypocrisy of a couple who make much of their environmental credentials. And counter-outrage from those who insist that the criticism is unwarranted and cover for bigotry.
AUG25	Age shall not weary Dorothy Byrne’s wisdom... or her sharp tongue	Soulful laments for the passing of a golden age of broadcasting freedom, for a time when news editors and documentary-makers were kings, are fairly standard at the Edinburgh television festival. Back then, the newsrooms were full of smoke and dynamism. Decisions were made on the hoof, with no recourse to compliance rules nor balance guidelines. So Dorothy Byrne’s startling MacTaggart lecture last week was a true tonic. This accomplished messenger from the past, a woman who, unusually, still has a top job in television, reminded us it was really not such fun in those frontier days. Yet she was very funny about it.
AUG25	Economics will stay a man’s game while women are kept out of the equation	Keep the home fires burning! After the apocalyptic vision of post-Brexit Britain revealed last week in the leak of Operation Yellowhammer, we learn that the government will spend £4m on “local resilience forums” across England (and £1.7m for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) supporting Brexit preparations for public services. The reasonably sane response might be – what public services? Central government funding for local government will have fallen by 56% in the 10 years to 2020. Or, to put a more human face on it, 1.4 million older people are not receiving the home care they need, 155 women and 103 children are turned away by refuges every day and hundreds of libraries, youth services, Sure Starts and day centres are closing weekly.
AUG25	So used are we to a borderless Europe we’re not ready for the coming shock	The blame game is upon us. Since it is hard to believe that Boris Johnson could be so naive as to think that the European Union will reopen the withdrawal agreement or ditch the Irish backstop, it seems likely that he is actively pursuing a no-deal Brexit. But it is obviously in the prime minister’s interest to be seen as the innocent party, especially in the context of a general election that now seems highly likely. And so, in his recent letter to Donald Tusk, Johnson wrote: “This government will not put in place infrastructure, checks or controls at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.” Few outside the UK take such a claim seriously. If the UK were to follow such a course of action, it would be in breach not only of its World Trade Organization obligation to treat all its trade partners equally but of sundry other international obligations and agreements. The British government’s own Yellowhammer report, which was leaked last week, concluded that attempts to avoid a hard border in Ireland would be “unsustainable”.
AUG25	Scottish golf’s biggest handicap? Its elitist clubs. But change is in the air	It’s difficult to be good at golf when you have a swing like an industrial digger gouging trenches. When I was young, I tried so hard to be good at golf. However, my JCB technique was just one of a complex cocktail of technical challenges I faced when surveying the first hole before another wretched round. Weekend golfers deploy a curious lexicon when describing the entrails of a bleak day out on the course. They talk regrettably about having a poor “touch around the greens”, but at least you have to reach the vicinity of the green to have a touch. Long before then, I’d conceded the hole while knee deep in heather. Others talked about “getting up and down in two”. My shots often went up but rarely came down within anyone’s range of visibility. My golfing phrase-book consisted of “fore”, “play through” and “I’ll just take another ball”. I developed a keen interest in the flora and fauna of streams and hedgerows. On an average round of golf I was a major threat to nesting field birds and soon took to leaving the others at the ninth hole and waiting for them in the clubhouse. If I hadn’t quickly renounced this game and all its empty promises, I’d have developed profound alcohol issues and the RSPB would have issued “Wanted” posters.
AUG25	Jennifer Beals: The L Word’s alpha female is going straight to the top	The first trailer for The L Word sequel, Generation Q, was released last week, teasing its return to TV screens in December. Ten years after The L Word’s run ended, I expected to be cynical about its 2019 incarnation. Right now, in the world of entertainment, there are more planned comebacks than Fleetwood Mac have managed in their entire career. With mooted revivals of everything from The Matrix to Home Alone to Beverly Hills, 90210, you could read an issue of Empire magazine from the 1990s and assume it had come out last week. Generation Q (I’m trying to get on board, but it still sounds breathlessly perky, like a kids’ cartoon or a supermarket clothing line) is all about the young people, as the title suggests, and appears to be far less glossy and polished than its elite older sibling. Of the three original characters returning to LA’s lesbian scene, every fan will have their favourite. Shane is back, as is her haircut, and Alice, too, but Jennifer Beals’s Bette promises to make the biggest splash.
AUG25	May I have a word about… Boris Johnson’s linguistic prowess	Is it really any wonder that there is so much consternation in Europe at the negotiating tactics employed by the prime minister over Brexit and the blasted backstop? His full linguistic prowess was on display before his meetings last week with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron: “We can’t get it through parliament as it is. So I’m going to go at it... with a lot of oomph.” For good measure, he added that there needed to be a “total backstop-ectomy” if there is to be any chance of a Brexit deal.
AUG25	Poor Prince Andrew is ‘appalled’ by Epstein. Let that be an end to it	It’s basically your classic men-of-the-world vignette. Lying in business dress in the New York mansion of his friend Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew is receiving a foot massage from a young, well-dressed Russian woman. Other men are in the room while this is happening, and they include Epstein (also being foot-massaged by a Russian woman) and the literary agent John Brockman, who runs a foundation connecting scientists and intellectuals with billionaires. As the young Russians work on their feet, Andy is complaining about his lot. “In Monaco,” he says, according to Brockman’s account, “[Prince] Albert works 12 hours a day but at 9pm, when he goes out, he does whatever he wants, and nobody cares. But, if I do it, I’m in big trouble.” Waa waa waa. What could be a more effective heartstring-tugger than “other European princes have it better than me”? It’s right up there with Chandler’s line from Friends: “My wallet’s too small for my 50s, and my diamond shoes are too tight!”
AUG25	How luxury hotels such as Biarritz’s Hôtel du Palais have helped shape history	Few hotels in the world can claim a more storied past than the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz, where the G7 rich nation summiteers will sit in splendour to discuss world poverty this weekend. Guarded by hundreds of riot police, Emmanuel Macron and his guests will meet inside what the French newspaper Libération this week called their “gold bunker” – the ornate Second Empire hotel that stands on the beach at the heart of a luxury Atlantic coast resort town that is still, as Libé put it in the original Franglais, “une des capitales françaises du bling-bling”. Boris Johnson will not be the first serving British prime minister to set foot in the hotel that was once a favourite of Napoleon III and Queen Victoria. That’s because the Hôtel du Palais occupies a special niche in British political history. It is the only building outside this country in which a prime minister has ever kissed hands and been asked to form a government. This happened in April 1908, when King Edward VII, who was a regular at the hotel, summoned the Liberal chancellor of the exchequer, Herbert Asquith, from London to succeed the terminally ill Henry Campbell-Bannerman in Downing Street.
AUG26	To beat Trump in 2020, Democrats will need to get down and dirty	The 2020 US presidential election is going to be about native entitlement. It’s going to be about race and immigration and deportation and Israel and every other wedge issue Donald Trump can summon to split the vote into “us” and “them”. He will become Chief Native, swelling his supporters’ sense of dominion over others less white. The campaign has already started; his social media presence has gone from ungainly swiping to a more coherent regular punching. He has in effect launched a cyber-bullying offensive. Trump will reduce people to tears, from black TV anchors worn down by his racist attacks to Rashida Tlaib, reeling from the unexpected emotional shock of her Palestinian grandmother being dragged in the mud of Trump’s bear pit. He will tell Jews how to vote and nurture antisemitism while pretending to give a damn about Israel so that he can smear Muslim opponents. What was a prominent theme in the 2016 campaign, going after Muslims and immigrants, will become the only theme.
AUG26	A bumpy no-deal Brexit could turn panicking MPs against Johnson	Are you ready for a no-deal Brexit? Have you stockpiled enough toilet paper? Built a small fort of tinned tomatoes, just in case? Over the next few weeks, government adverts will start warning the British public, businesses and neighbouring countries to prepare for Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, even though the official position of the government is that it still wants an agreement with Brussels. Ministers insist that they are now preparing properly for this sort of departure on 31 October, and that leaked documents predicting chaos are out of date, wrong, and being released by political opponents who want to scaremonger. They point to the extra £2.1bn being spent on protecting the supply of medicines, on ports and important freight routes, and on preparing local authorities. They argue that Boris Johnson’s administration is taking no deal seriously, unlike Theresa May and her chancellor, Philip Hammond.
AUG26	As a lost child in Turkey I found refuge on an imaginary mountain	I was born in France to Turkish parents. A small flat in a tower block, sunlight through the curtains pierced by swirls of cigarette smoke. The strong smell of Gauloises, Turkish and Syrian tobacco packaged with French style. Immigrants, students, workers … leftists, mostly. Reading Althusser and Fanon but not so much De Beauvoir, passionately arguing about the revolution they believed was soon to come. When I think about my first home that’s how I see it in my mind’s eye. Shortly afterwards my parents broke up. My father stayed in France and my mother brought me to Turkey. To her, this was the motherland. To me, it was a new country. Some of my earliest memories are interlaced with a sense of placelessness. 
AUG26	Homophobic? Maybe. But at least Midnight Cowboy showed me gay men on screen	Midnight Cowboy moseys into UK cinemas again next month on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, and with it comes another opportunity to ask whether this is a film about homophobia or a homophobic film. At the risk of sounding perverse, I really don’t mind. My feelings toward the film were formed by seeing it in my early teens, when I already knew I was gay and hankered after images of other gay men on screen without caring whether they were problematic or toxic – words, incidentally, that would never have been used in that context when I first saw it in the mid-1980s. In its portrayal of the friendship between two New York City street hustlers – the budding gigolo Joe Buck (Jon Voight), tall and sweet as an ice-cream sundae, and the stunted, snivelling chancer “Ratso” Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) – the picture hints at the inexpressible desires in any bromance. Ratso bandies the word “faggot” around and mocks Joe for the campness of his cowboy duds. Evidently the homophobe doth protest too much, for we have been privy to Ratso’s fantasies in which Joe runs shirtless with him along the beach.
AUG26	I will never forget my grandma's last days, surrounded by people who were half shaman, half scientist, and all good	I knew it was coming; I had known it was coming for years. I had seen my friends go through it, and I had spent many hours thinking deeply about what would happen. Comforted by theories on the nature of consciousness, seduced by feasible rationales for an afterlife, sobered by the practical science of what was really going to happen, I was prepared. And then she died. My nana had been ill for a long time. Her final diagnosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, came 12 years before she died, although the prognosis was no more than four. She had come close so many times that we had started calling her “the boomerang”. But when she went into hospital for the last time, although in our heads we constructed logical expectations of her coming back to us, in our hearts we knew she wasn’t coming home.
AUG26	Exasperation mingles with regret as Europe tries to deal with Brexit	On an unfavourable day, viewing Brexit-era Britain from the outside is like watching a goldfish circling the castle ornament in its bowl. The country seems short of memory, hazy of sight and prone to fluttering around kitsch visions of the past. The reporting of Boris Johnson’s tour of Europe was a case in point. Eurosceptic tabloids celebrated the supposed infectiousness of the prime minister’s optimism: “Ja, we can,” ventriloquised the Daily Mail over a photo of Angela Merkel sharing a drink with him. On Friday, the newspaper covered his return from a meeting with Emmanuel Macron with a shot of him raising his hands over his head in victory. By contrast, some Remainers saw in Merkel’s comment – “we could also find [a solution] in the next 30 days, why not?” – an attempt to mock or troll the prime minister. They rolled their eyes at film footage seemingly showing Macron urging Johnson to get his feet off a table during their meeting in the Élysée Palace.
AUG26	The world is run by comedians, but is anyone laughing?	Hello, I’ll be standing in for David Mitchell this week, and Stewart Lee next. I’d like to apologise for this in advance: regular readers of this column have become used to scintillating satire from these two, delivered via crisp, witty prose. What do I have to offer in return? Nothing but grim jeremiads about the dreadful state we’re in – and pretentious, jargon-laden analyses about how we got here. True, I too was once a well-known light entertainer on national television, but in recent years I’ve fallen victim to the worst character trait of the ageing farceur: a desire to be taken … seriously – an inclination that has, quite rightly, coincided with my gently smelly slide down into Stygian obscurity. Bobbing about down here, I’ve begun to suspect that my status in our septic, MRSA-ridden isle exists in an inverse correlation to that of Her Highness’s current first minister. It’s a truth universally acknowledged that, in search of his destiny as “world king”, Boris Johnson turned to television to build his base, and in particular to the satirical news show Have I Got News for You. Throughout a number of barnstorming appearances, Johnson cemented his reputation as a charming and self-deprecating Old Etonian, whose tousled blond mop nonetheless surmounted a mind like a steel trap. Even at the time, commentators remarked on how bizarre it was that serving politicians were prepared to go on the show and risk being eviscerated by their fellow panellists – however, by perfecting his routine (in Marxist terms, his “praxis”), Johnson enacted the dialectical relation between politics and comedy that has since typified our era.
AUG26	Swearing has its place in journalism – when used sparingly and skilfully	It is difficult to discuss coarse language without using some. So, if reading on, be warned. Our style guide says the Guardian is “more liberal than any other newspapers, using language that most of our competitors would not”. The editorial guidelines say: “Respect for the reader demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend. Use swearwords only when absolutely necessary to the facts of a piece, or to portray a character in an article; there is almost never a case in which we need to use a swearword outside direct quotes. The stronger the swearword, the harder we ought to think about using it … and never use asterisks, which are just a cop-out.”
AUG26	Racist abuse in the real world is in decline, so why not on Twitter?	Britain is a much less racist country than the one I grew up in. Yet I have received more racist abuse in the last four weeks than the previous 40 years. This paradox can be explained in a single word: technology. More specifically, Twitter. It helps to explain why, last week, social media once again became the key battleground for tacking racism. Growing up, my experiences of racism were pretty banal. If you called me a “paki” in the playground, you could expect a sarcastic lecture about the need to get an atlas, as my dad is from India. Nobody ever hit me but as a football-mad teenager in the 1980s, I heard shocking racism, which was eventually stamped out by the mid-1990s. Monkey chanting in the ground has given way to hatred on social media – see the racist abuse against Paul Pogba of Manchester United and other leading black players which hit the headlines last week.
AUG26	How can children thrive when they are squeezed into cramped homes?	Personal space is a political issue. Analysing data from the English Housing Survey, supplemented by a Comres poll of families in overcrowded housing, the National Housing Federation (NHF) reports that 130,000 families are living in one-bedroom homes. An estimated 1.3 million children live in overcrowded homes, defined as children sleeping in the same room as two or more siblings, their parents or a teenager of the opposite sex. Just 6,000 homes were built in 2018 for social rent, despite at least 145,000 being needed. Some children are sleeping three to a bed, with adults sleeping in kitchens, halls and bathrooms to free up space. There are 96,000 more children living like this than a decade ago. An estimated 92,000 children are thought to be sofa-surfing with their families and not even registering in the figures.
AUG27	Biarritz was an empty charade. The G7 is a relic of a bygone age	The G7 summit in Biarritz, now thankfully concluded, told us a lot about the world we live in. Unfortunately, very little of it was useful or vaguely hopeful. As the presidents and premiers of the world’s wealthiest countries posed for back-slapping group photos, and their partners sampled croissants at a charming “traditional Basque bakery”, fierce fires raged untended and unquenched across the international landscape – not to mention in the Amazon rainforest. It was a low-yield meeting whose main achievement was avoiding a repeat of last year’s bust-up. It was as though these summiteers, conflabbing while the world burned, belonged to a different, distant era when the US president, for example, was a figure commanding instant respect; when multilateral diplomacy worked; when the postwar internationalist vision was not obscured by nationalist demagoguery; when, if the western democracies decided to do something together, it actually had a good chance of getting done. But those times have passed.
AUG27	Bantering blonds and cringeworthy kisses: G7 was the dinner party from deepest hell	You know how people ask that question: who would be your dream dinner-party guests? The G7 summit is that in reverse: featuring a group of people, many of whom are so odious you’d crawl under a tablecloth to avoid them if you saw them in a restaurant. And then log on to TripAdvisor to warn other punters never to set foot in the place. True, they’re not all awful – but the ratio isn’t great. Here are the highlights and lowlights from Biarritz (which, until last week, Trump thought was a burger option at McDonald’s).
AUG27	To beat Trump in 2020, Democrats will need to get down and dirty	The 2020 US presidential election is going to be about native entitlement. It’s going to be about race and immigration and deportation and Israel and every other wedge issue Donald Trump can summon to split the vote into “us” and “them”. He will become Chief Native, swelling his supporters’ sense of dominion over others less white. The campaign has already started; his social media presence has gone from ungainly swiping to a more coherent regular punching. He has in effect launched a cyber-bullying offensive. Trump will reduce people to tears, from black TV anchors worn down by his racist attacks to Rashida Tlaib, reeling from the unexpected emotional shock of her Palestinian grandmother being dragged in the mud of Trump’s bear pit. He will tell Jews how to vote and nurture antisemitism while pretending to give a damn about Israel so that he can smear Muslim opponents. What was a prominent theme in the 2016 campaign, going after Muslims and immigrants, will become the only theme.
AUG27	Bury’s demise is a grim warning that small-town Britain is still being left behind	The threatened expulsion of small town Bury from the English Football League – which could happen if the owner, Steve Dale, does not conclude a sale of the club by 5pm on Tuesday – has been a touch more emotional for me than many of the football traumas I have investigated as a journalist over the past 20 years. I grew up in north Manchester, five miles down the road, and went to school in Bury. Twice a day I used to pass the club’s Gigg Lane ground and wonder at it from the top of the 35 bus: a proper football home, bedded in with all its history behind a pleasing line of trees. In these crisis-stricken months for Bury, a club founded in 1885, many people have rightly pointed with bewilderment to English football’s violent inequalities; to Manchester City and United 10 miles away, owned by overseas billionaires, making multimillionaires of their players and managers. Supporters have despaired at the gaping holes in football’s governance, its painfully limited “fit and proper persons test” for owners, so long campaigned for but that still fails to protect beloved clubs from needless ruination.
AUG27	All hail Ben Stokes for giving the nation a moment of sporting relief	The prime minister is making stuff up about pork pies and the president of the United States wants to nuke hurricanes, but amid the late summer madness, we – we the people – have Ben Stokes. On a blazing bank holiday weekend for the ages, the hero of Headingley near single-handedly (for we must not forget the bespectacled, brilliant Jack Leach) provided a moment of respite from the catastrophic chaos the powers that be seem all too happy to unleash upon their citizenry. Just to be clear, here is what the immigrant Ben Stokes is not: he is not a distillation of the “Dunkirk spirit”, to be co-opted by nostalgic disaster merchants keen to claim credit for all that is good and wander back off to the champagne tent to inspect their portfolios when it goes tits up. He is, rather, an elite sportsman – an expert, if you will – who spectacularly adapted his play to navigate a way through the trickiest of situations. Unlike those in potentially analogous circumstances, Stokes had the time he needed: but what he still had to find were skill, nerve and, perhaps most importantly, respect for the game he was playing and the opponents he faced. There’s a lesson there. And after a period of calculated defensiveness, he got busy.
AUG27	Fires are devouring the Amazon. And Jair Bolsonaro is to blame	As the world watches in horror and terror as the Amazon burns, scientists have made clear that the cause, principally if not entirely, is human activity. Here in Brazil, that human activity has human names and faces: those of Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, and his extremist environment minister, Ricardo Salles. They have not merely permitted these devastating fires, but have encouraged and fueled them.
AUG27	Sexist attitudes towards sex are cheating women of orgasms – and worse	We may like to think we’re quite sexually free and equal these days, but an End Violence Against Women Coalition/YouGov survey of nearly 4,000 adults finds that two-fifths of people think men want sex more than women do. And between a third of and half of us think it is more likely that in heterosexual couples men will initiate and orgasm during sex, and decide when sex is finished, than women. In contrast, women are believed to be much more likely to refuse sex and to “go along with sex to keep their partner happy”. The 'orgasm gap' exists solely in heterosexual sex – lesbians are not having this problem
AUG27	What is autism? How the term became too broad to have meaning any more	The word autism means a lot of different things to different people. To some, it conjures an image of the socially awkward eccentric who, besotted by a narrow set of interests, eschews small-talk and large gatherings in favour of solitude. To others, it’s a profoundly life-limiting disorder that consumes every waking hour of a family’s life, a medical disability that entails unpredictable bouts of aggression resulting in torn upholstery, cracked skulls and savage bites. Severely autistic people have a life expectancy of 36 in the United States and 39.5 in Europe, while their parents and care-givers often experience PTSD and stress similar to that of combat veterans. Mildly autistic people, on the other hand, though far more prone to depression and suicide, can go on to lead productive and fulfilling lives, often blending imperceptibly into the wider population despite their idiosyncracies and social difficulties. Many people now self-identify as autistic as though it were a fashion label rather than a debilitating disorder
AUG27	Rejection is the norm for authors. So why do we hide it?	If there’s any universal truth, it’s that rejection happens to all of us at some point – especially in publishing. Most writers have entertained at least one 3am fantasy about an editor coming crawling back. Even Animal Farm was rejected by Faber & Faber, a decision now (understandably) regretted. Orwell’s rejection is just one of many that have made their way into legend. Extravagant rejections of authors, from JK Rowling to Vladimir Nabokov, fascinate all of us. We like to remember that geniuses are fallible, and that nobody gets it right every time. But apart from these famous stories, we don’t talk about the everyday experience of rejection in the arts, and its role in the creative process. By venerating these big stories of rejection we make rejection itself feel remarkable, when it’s actually the norm.
AUG27	Dominic Cummings reminds me of Yanis Varoufakis – he could face the same fate	Covering the Greek crisis for BBC Newsnight in 2015 meant spending long days in a very hot Athens, eating too much room-service kebab and trying to stay on top of a series of twists and turns in Greek and European politics while all the time keeping an eye on the financial markets. The fundamental question was: will Greece do a deal or will it crash out of the euro? At the time, I had no idea that my crash course in European standoffs would prove useful to understanding what has emerged as the key question in British politics, Brexit: deal or no deal.
AUG28	Johnson’s schools ‘revolution’ is all about an imminent election. Here’s why it’s fake	What’s driving Boris Johnson’s new schools programme, revealed exclusively in the Guardian today? The answer lies not in Downing Street, but 170 miles up the M1, with a revolt in a Cheshire market town. You don’t expect mutiny in Nantwich, but it was here a Tory shires revolt took place. In February 2017 the main square of the town was packed with locals protesting about the cash crisis in their schools. Their outrage made national news, and it chimed with other shaming stories that were spilling out of classrooms: of cash-strapped headteachers begging pupils to bring in their own loo roll; of teaching assistants getting laid off in droves and staff setting up food banks to feed their own pupils.
AUG28	The IMF is hurting countries it claims to help	When people think of the damage that wealthy countries – typically led by the US and its allies – cause to people in the rest of the world, they probably think of warfare. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died from the 2003 invasion, and then many more as the region became inflamed. But rich countries also have considerable power over the lives of billions of people through their control over institutions of global governance. One of these is the International Monetary Fund. It has 189 member countries, but the US and its rich-country allies have a solid majority of the votes. The head of the IMF is by custom a European, and the US has enough votes to veto many major decisions by itself – although the rich countries almost never vote against each other.
AUG28	Corbyn’s summit shows a no-deal Brexit is avoidable if MPs put tribalism aside	Good news from the bubble of party politics: Britain’s opposition leaders have today decided to engage and cooperate rather than facilitate national food and medicine shortages in nine weeks’ time. Many commentators suggested that Jeremy Corbyn’s meeting with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Change UK and Greens would yield little but grandstanding and bad temper. On the contrary, participants have described a positive and constructive session, with further summits planned. Their joint statement stresses the “urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence”.
AUG28	Did Liverpool’s Sun boycott result in a remain vote? It’s a neat, if flawed, theory	No one surely believes that when a newspaper tells its readers ahead of an election how to vote they simply do as they are told. There is no evidence whatsoever to show a direct correlation between what is published and what happens at the ballot box. Instead, media academics who have tried to divine the political impact of the press during elections, particularly the populist tabloid variety, have found it necessary to untangle a complex web of influences in order to explain why people voted as they did.
AUG28	I worked for Tim Bell. He was not the monster of leftwing caricature	Tim Bell was famously Margaret Thatcher’s favourite PR guru. It’s not hard to see why. He mixed a ridiculously easy and seductive charm with wit and free-market views. He operated at the height of the then critical nexus between global CEOs, top politicians and journalists. His death marks the end of a “golden ? public relations era that spanned almost half a century, and Bell was one of its leading lights – and his particular star always shone brightly – for good and bad. I know something about Bell because I worked for him for three years in the mid-1990s. It was an odd thing to do for someone who had worked in Gordon Brown’s office. I was in my late 20s, had a young family and little money, and I was intrigued to learn about my supposed enemy. Bell of course knew New Labour was coming. He hated having to prepare for it, but took me under his wing with genuine warmth nevertheless.
AUG28	Business will not forgive or forget the great Brexit betrayal of trust	We’ll easily cope,” breezes the no-deal prime minister. “This is a great, great country.” Indeed it is. Most inhabitants would certainly agree. But to love your country is not to think it greater than others, nor incapable of making grievous mistakes. Britain has not, as yet, made the fateful error of actually electing Boris Johnson and his cabinet of undesirables. Nor did it vote for a no-deal Brexit. But on he drives, accelerating towards the abyss. It’s that insouciant ignorance that drives businesses mad; the devil-may-care fecklessness, ignoring the boring details. Andrea Leadsom, our improbable business secretary, writes in the Sunday Telegraph that she has met firms of all kinds and guess what? “They were overwhelmingly positive about our future.” She ends: “Britain’s best years for business and for all our people lie ahead.”
AUG28	Johnson’s plan for ‘Brexit heroes’ in the Lords will reverberate for years to come	Arise, Lord Tim of Wetherspoon’s. Try on this ermine for size, any economist prepared to go against almost the entirety of your profession in arguing that a no-deal Brexit would be just terrific for Britain. The prime minister is reportedly drawing up a list of so-called “Brexit heroes” to be rewarded with peerages, although the word “hero” here is arguably being stretched to breaking point: the plan is apparently to ennoble a bunch of leading leavers after 31 October, in a clear rebuke to a House of Lords that has so far proved decidedly sceptical about the idea of leaving the EU at any price. Well done, everyone involved in dragging Britain into this godawful mess! Now here’s your reward: the chance to get a whole new set of life-changing political judgments wrong, for generations to come.
AUG28	The Hong Kong Way protest shows enchantment is a powerful weapon	It almost felt like magic. A few people standing on the street were joined by a few more; people lining the footpath of one block connected to those on the next block. And suddenly, there they all were. Hand in hand, chanting slogans and singing songs. On 23 August, the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way – a human chain linking the capitals of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to demand the Baltic republics’ independence from the Soviet Union – more than 200,000 people came out on to the streets of Hong Kong to form the “Hong Kong Way”. From the crowded streets of Wan Chai on Hong Kong island, to the famous waterfront of Tsim Sha Tsui, to the suburbs of the New Territories, to the peak of Lion Rock, people linked hands in a continuous human chain that some said measured 60km in total. This was just the latest action in Hong Kong’s ongoing anti-government protest movement calling for democratic reforms. As a protest action, it was incredibly effective: entirely peaceful, a striking visual spectacle, and a very physical manifestation of the broad support for the movement from across the community. People of all ages and from all walks of life, families with young children, the elderly – all joined the chain and put paid to any suggestion that these ongoing protests were just a few hot-headed young student agitators. But perhaps most importantly, the Hong Kong Way created a moment of enchantment.
AUG28	Republican Joe Walsh is challenging Trump – but that is nothing to celebrate	Donald Trump has been very good for a lot of very bad people’s careers. Take Sean Spicer, for example. Spicer lied through his teeth during his stint as White House press secretary and has been rewarded with a gig at Harvard and a spot on Dancing With the Stars – where, presumably, he will continue to prance around the truth. His successor, Sarah Sanders, is joining Fox News. Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted only 10 days as Trump’s communications director, has reinvented himself as a high-profile critic of his former boss. The latest odious person to scramble aboard the Trump gravy train is Joe Walsh, a rightwing talk-radio host and former congressman. On Sunday, Walsh announced he would challenge Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination because “we all know [he] is unfit” to lead – which is a dramatic change of tack from 2016, when Walsh tweeted: “On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?”
AUG28	Forget a second referendum. Labour has to back revoking article 50	You can tell there’s a general election coming, because that’s the subtext to everything else that happens. Boris Johnson uses the G7 summit to grandstand to the domestic tabloids. Meanwhile the fractious coalition of anti-no-deal forces meets today to try and form a coherent plan to stop Britain crashing out of the EU – and to force an election. If the object was to fight no deal through parliamentary process, the only people you would need in the room would be Dominic Grieve and Keir Starmer, with maybe somebody taking notes for John Bercow. But today’s get-together, convened last week by Jeremy Corbyn, is as much about a general election, which few people now doubt will happen sooner rather than later. Given that, it would have been better to enter the room in the spirit of anticipated unity, rather than publicly set out your red lines beforehand, as Jo Swinson has done. She reportedly wrote a letter to Corbyn yesterday, arguing that his insistence on leading a temporary government of national unity would be likely to scupper a vote of no confidence in the government.
AUG29	A civil war state of mind now threatens our democracy	An “outrage”, a “coup”, an “abomination”, a country tumbling into “failed state status”, Britain a “banana republic”, Boris Johnson a “dictator”. Parliamentarians stretch the limits of their vocabulary to express disbelief that this could happen in Britain, the “cradle of democracy”. Rewrite the history books, tear up Bagehot’s The English Constitution, as the Queen and privy council sign the prorogation, neither the “dignified parts” not the “efficient parts” function any longer. This country that self-identified so smugly as stable, tolerant and moderate, with a crown to symbolise traditions honed down the centuries, is revealed as fissile, fragile and ferociously divided. A constitution that relied on gentlemanly governments’ willingness to bow to parliament has evaporated, blown away now it’s led by a man who doesn’t give a damn for parliamentary sovereignty: taking back control is for him alone. He is ready to destroy anything that threatens his ambition.
AUG29	Boris Johnson is trashing the democracy fought for with the blood of our ancestors	Call the suspension of parliament what it is: a coup d’état by an unelected prime minister. Brexit, we were promised, was about restoring the sovereignty of the House of Commons and taking back control of our laws. That institution is now to be shut down, its ability to pass legislation neutered. Just days now remain for elected representatives to have any say over the greatest upheaval since the guns fell silent in the second world war. It must be, and will be, resisted. We didn't vote to leave without a deal. That wasn't the message of the campaign I helped lead
AUG29	The cat is out of the bag – Boris Johnson’s shutdown is unconstitutional	One of the gravest dangers to any society is “outrage fatigue”. The symptom of this condition is when so many people have been so angry for so long that terrible abuses of power now seem almost normal. Over a decade since the financial crash, after nine years of crippling public spending and tax cuts, and three years on from the bitterly fought EU referendum, poor leadership leaves our country in a state of polarised peril. This is frightening for people all over the United Kingdom, but it poses the biggest threat to the most vulnerable – and now to democracy itself. The idea of shutting down parliament (no need to dress it up with the fancy language of prorogation) so that a hard-right, minority government can facilitate a “crash-out” Brexit on 31 October, was first suggested during the Conservative leadership campaign by Dominic Raab in June. Boris Johnson has refused to rule it out ever since. So last weekend’s reports of leaked emails between No 10 and the attorney general were hardly a bolt from the blue.
AUG29	Johnson has wrongfooted opponents of no deal. An election surely looms	Given that Westminster has spent weeks debating the possibility of Boris Johnson proroguing parliament, it was surprising how surprised MPs were when he actually did it. Even his own cabinet ministers were rather taken aback, having returned to Whitehall on Tuesday expecting to spend the week in meetings with the Treasury about their spending review settlement. Now, they’re preparing for an election, which would be the result of a successful vote of no confidence in the government, forced through by MPs determined to thwart Johnson’s manoeuvring. Even if that scenario does not unfold, he is likely to call one immediately after Britain has left the EU on 31 October. The MPs most unsettled by the announcement are the ones who have spent the summer plotting tactics to use against Johnson. These anti-no deal MPs, who exist more as a diaspora than a coherent group, love plotting among themselves, but have an amusing distaste for anyone who plots against them in return. As one Johnson ally puts it: “The anti-no deal alliance have been so used to setting the weather recently. Instead, they’ve had the weather reset, so it’s raining on their parade, and they don’t like it.”
AUG29	Topless Poldark already looks quaint in our era of equal-opportunities nudity	Blockbuster Sunday night dramas have a habit of making headlines with male nudity. Perhaps there is something about seeing the weekend out with a bang. The last time viewers got flustered over a pair of buttocks was for Richard Madden in Bodyguard, and, before him, Tom Hiddleston in The Night Manager. The recent Poldark finale didn’t feature any topless scything, but the Daily Mail waved it off to sea with a front page paying testament to “the briny sorrow of never seeing Ross soaping up in his bath again” – with a picture of him scything topless anyway. Because, well, one for the road.
AUG29	Boris Johnson’s intention is clear: he wants a ‘people v parliament’ election	Boris Johnson’s plan to prorogue parliament ahead of a Queen’s speech on 14 October is intended to provoke parliamentarians into blocking a no-deal Brexit, or triggering a general election through a vote of no confidence. Both are feasible in the time available. The last time parliament stepped in to block no deal earlier in the year, the necessary legislation was passed in just three days. Johnson has deliberately left enough time for parliament to seize control again. That’s because Johnson’s real objective is to use Brexit to win a general election, rather than use a general election to secure Brexit. By forcing the hands of his opponents, he has defined the terrain for a “people versus parliament” election. Expect him to run on “Back Boris, Take Back Britain”. He will say that the only way to definitely leave on 31 October is to give him a parliamentary majority to do so. The man of Eton, Oxford and the Telegraph will position himself as the leader of the people against the hated establishment and “remainer elite”.
AUG29	Politics-as-usual can’t fix the climate crisis. Maybe it’s time to try a citizens’ assembly	The climate crisis demands an urgent, realistic and sustained response from governments around the world: such a response will inevitably require sacrifices from all of us. And there lies the rub for our systems of representative democracy. How can politicians facing short-term constraints (particularly the need to be re-elected every few years) be expected to take the necessary decisions that require long-term and, probably, quite painful change on the part of the citizens who get to vote for them?
AUG29	Labour desperately needs a pro-EU vision – not just a plan to block no deal	Boris Johnson is not a skilful manager, except of expectations. He impressed dignitaries at the G7 summit in Biarritz with a capacity for seriousness that used to come as standard in prime ministers. Johnson sets the bar low, then clears it. He steered a traditional British diplomatic course between Europe and the US. His style is a flattering tribute to Donald Trump but on the substance – Russia, Iran, the climate emergency – the UK still sides with Germany and France. That balancing act will be harder outside the EU, and the messier the Brexit, the wobblier the tightrope. Johnson needs a trade deal with Washington. It is the totem pole around which Tory Eurosceptics perform their frenzied anti-Brussels war dances. But Trump does not distinguish between commerce and state power. He will set the price of a deal at total loyalty in foreign affairs and surrender to US corporate interests. The UK must switch regulatory and strategic alignment from European to US standards, and thereby forfeit privileged access to the vast market on its doorstep. Few Brexiteers understand what that means in practice. The UK voice will be heard in Brussels from the wrong side of a closed door – and in Washington from the end of a tight leash. That is what a hard Brexit looks like once the bombastic rhetoric is stripped away. Theresa May worried that the price was too high; Johnson doesn’t care. This dramatic pivot in Britain’s global orientation is easily overlooked because the contrast in political style between the new prime minister and his predecessor is more conspicuous. May was ready to swallow the Northern Irish backstop because she was not horrified by the prospect of perpetual European alignment that it implied. For Johnson, ending that alignment is the whole point.
AUG29	Johnson’s schools ‘revolution’ is all about an imminent election. Here’s why it’s fake	What’s driving Boris Johnson’s new schools programme, revealed exclusively in the Guardian today? The answer lies not in Downing Street, but 170 miles up the M1, with a revolt in a Cheshire market town. You don’t expect mutiny in Nantwich, but it was here a Tory shires revolt took place. In February 2017 the main square of the town was packed with locals protesting about the cash crisis in their schools. Their outrage made national news, and it chimed with other shaming stories that were spilling out of classrooms: of cash-strapped headteachers begging pupils to bring in their own loo roll; of teaching assistants getting laid off in droves and staff setting up food banks to feed their own pupils.
AUG29	The media has become gossip, clickbait and punditry. This threatens democracy	Walter Cronkite once said that “journalism is what we need to make democracy work.” He was absolutely right, which is why today’s assault on journalism by Wall Street, billionaire businessmen, Silicon Valley and Donald Trump presents a crisis – and why we must take concrete action. Real journalism is different from the gossip, punditry and clickbait that dominates today’s news. Real journalism, in the words of Joseph Pulitzer, is the painstaking reporting that will “fight for progress and reform, never tolerate injustice or corruption, [and] always fight demagogues”. Pulitzer said journalism must always “oppose privileged classes and public plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor, always remain devoted to the public welfare, never be satisfied with merely printing news, always be drastically independent, never be afraid to attack wrong, whether by predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty”.
AUG30	Only one person can avert a no-deal Brexit. And that’s Boris Johnson	This is not well done. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, displays cowardice and mendacity in insulting parliament with enforced suspension, and then in claiming that it has nothing to do with Brexit. It has everything to do with Brexit. It is not just an insult. It is a lie. Theresa May, the leader whom Johnson treated abominably, stood in the House of Commons, day after day, pleading for support in honouring the vote on the 2016 Brexit referendum. She tried to ease the United Kingdom out of the European Union with a compromise deal respecting the diverse views of a divided nation. She was inept and she failed.
AUG30	Proroguing parliament sets a horrifying precedent. I’m going to court to stop it	Like hijackers of a plane, Boris Johnson’s ministers and acolytes are trying to keep everyone calm by giving as much as possible the impression of normality. This is the way of people seizing power by force, but let’s be clear: there is nothing that is normal about what they are doing. They are subverting our democracy in a way that is unprecedented. Elected representatives are being told to shut up about the inconvenient truths and logistics of a ruinous no-deal Brexit. Worse, Johnson is trying to deny them the right to take their seats in what was once called the “mother of parliaments” in the run up to 31 October. The Johnson hijackers are saying that the prorogation of parliament ahead of a Queen’s speech is what always happens – and that it is no more than a normal convention and precedent in our unwritten constitution. But there is no convention or precedent for a five-week prorogation. In the last 40 years, parliament has never been prorogued for longer than three weeks. In most cases it has been prorogued for only a week or less, for example for 3 days in 2015, 5 days in 2016 and 6 days in 2017.
AUG30	Has Brexit destroyed party loyalty? Ruth Davidson’s resignation will show us	Your party leader embarks on a course of action that appears to threaten the constitution in order to achieve an objective that will severely damage the country. What should dissenting Tories do now? Turn against the leadership – even bring down the government and let in Labour? The old, emotive choice of party or country is back. Meanwhile, Ruth Davidson resigns the leadership of the Scottish Conservatives. She says her new family comes first. But no one believes the timing is unconnected with Boris Johnson’s bid to stifle dissent by proroguing parliament. Whatever she says, most people think Davidson has made her call.
AUG30	Parliament had failed on Brexit long before this prorogation	“A constitutional outrage”, declared the Speaker, John Bercow; “a very British coup”, said the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Not to be outdone, Nicola Sturgeon added “the day any semblance of British democracy died”. Some have compared the situation to 1628, when Charles I prorogued parliament before dispensing with its services entirely. But Charles I was not, unless the history books are grievously mistaken, faced with the problem of implementing the outcome of a referendum. It is time perhaps to tone down the rhetoric and consider the facts. The five-week prorogation appears longer than it is because it includes the three weeks of the party conference season, when parliament does not normally sit. Parliament therefore loses two weeks. In 2014 there was a longer prorogation of 20 days, though that included the period of the European parliament elections and the Whitsun recess.
AUG30	Welcome to the US, Greta. With your help we can save the planet and ourselves	Dear Greta, Thank you for travelling across the Atlantic to north America to help us do the most important work in the world. There are those of us who welcome you and those who do not because you have landed in two places, a place being born and a place dying, noisily, violently, with as much damage as possible.
AUG30	Why comparisons between Boris Johnson and Charles I aren’t just lazy rhetoric	When a prime minister who hasn’t faced a general election gains the assent of an unelected monarch to prorogue parliament, it is inevitable that some parallels will be found with Charles I’s dismissal of MPs in the mid-17th century. Only yesterday, Labour’s Margaret Beckett made exactly the comparison, noting that it didn’t end well. But are there really any similarities, or is this just lazy history and easy rhetoric?
AUG30	My children are teaching me to love the housing estate I fled	Don’t let anyone ever tell you that you have to come from a place to belong there. Just because the place you grew up in lives inside you, it doesn’t mean you have to like it, or defend it, or define every other place against it. Birmingham, where I come from, inhabits my accent and underlies my compulsive self-deprecation, but apart from that, my Brummie-ness feels like an accident. (Even so, I’m obsessed with it.) The centripetal Midlands happens to be where the Welsh, Irish and English strands of my family combined, having moved, as humans do, where there are prospects for a better life. The centre drew them in, then cast them to the periphery as Birmingham built outwards in concentric circles following the first world war. I grew up in Chelmsley Wood, on a vast estate built on green belt land outside the city boundaries where, a Birmingham Post reporter predicted in 1971, “the city will feel a million life-miles away” to the children who would come to be raised there.
AUG30	Why does the far right love Fred Perry? Mainstream fashion is its new camouflage	The Fred Perry brand found itself in the unwelcome spotlight this week when one of its brand ambassadors tweeted that he would no longer wear Fred Perry clothing in the US, now that the self-described “western chauvinist” Proud Boys group have adopted the black-and-yellow striped polo shirts as their unofficial uniform. The company has repeatedly distanced itself from the Proud Boys, describing them as “counter to our beliefs and the people we work with”. But the problem is bigger than Fred Perry alone. There are dozens of other brands today that are either intentionally selling clothing with far-right messaging or have been co-opted by the far right because of the symbolic resonance of their logos. This isn’t entirely new: the British brand Lonsdale became popular in German far-right scenes decades ago, for example, when youth discovered that a half-zipped bomber jacket over a Lonsdale T-shirt displayed the letters “NSDA” – the first four letters of the German initials of the Nazi party.
AUG30	My film is bridging cultural divides. This gives me hope in such polarised times	There is a polarisation in today’s political culture that led me to seek solace in screenwriting, after almost 25 years as a journalist. I found the entrenched tribalism alienating and decided instead to explore the world of fiction and film. I thought I would be distracted from the question of our divided culture, but in fact I found potential clues for how to bridge the very divide I was fleeing from. I have spent the last six weeks travelling across Britain and the US, promoting Blinded By the Light. The film, directed by Gurinder Chadha, is a fictionalised retelling of my memoir, Greetings from Bury Park. It tells what is ostensibly a very personal story. It is located in a specific time and place – Luton in 1987 – and it is about a teenage British Pakistani boy whose life feels constrained by his class, culture and community until he discovers the liberating power of the music of Bruce Springsteen. The film is uncompromising in its cultural specificity – and given its subject matter, one would assume it would mostly appeal to British Asians who lived through the 1980s, Bruce Springsteen fans, and in particular, Asian Bruce Springsteen fans who lived through the 1980s. What I had not appreciated was the power of storytelling to engender empathy.
AUG30	Children deserve food, care and a home. This ought to be beyond dispute	Imagine we’re building a country. Our hypothetical nation is a society like any other, made up of people – parents, nurses, pensioners and toddlers. It will need infrastructure, laws, services and taxes, and a set of values to guide us on how to arrange each of them. Now imagine a whiteboard with bullet points of our first priorities. What’s the first that comes to mind? Hospitals? Schools? I propose one: to keep children safe. No matter what else we manage as a country, protecting kids from harm seems a simple place to start. After all, what kind of country can’t even manage that?
AUG31	Sajid Javid cowers behind net curtains as Cummings ‘gets ready’ for the final act	Barely three months ago, the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, gave a speech in which she explained that “Being in a job gives a person dignity”. Does it always though, Amber? There is currently no job in the UK with less dignity than cabinet minister. Desperate people are doing things for crack rocks round the back of disused warehouses that are significantly more dignified than signing up to Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament, even when you said it was the last thing you’d ever do about 10 minutes ago. So who are they, this prorogue’s gallery? In one sense, they’re anyone who hasn’t resigned when a minority government lies in order to execute this dick move – which is to say, literally all of them apart from George Young, a whip in the Lords who quit on Thursday. To put that in perspective, Young once reportedly described the homeless as “the people you step over when you are coming out of the opera”. So anyone who hasn’t walked from this government has been morally outclassed by that guy.
AUG31	This reckless confrontation with parliament is just what millions of voters want	And so one of the longest running dramas in British political history reaches yet another act. Some of the cast are locked into much the same roles as ever: Gina Miller is once again striding off to the courts; the great urban remain armies are turning out with their homemade placards, while the People’s Vote campaign sends out emails signed by Michael Heseltine; front-rank Tory politicians are apparently prepared to trade in whatever faint principles they once claimed to hold dear, in the hope of holding their party together, whatever the price. Other characters seem to be changing. Jeremy Corbyn and his aides may have belatedly discovered the art of reaching out to people beyond their inner circle. Militant Labourites who have mostly affected indifference about Brexit and told us that parliament was a rat’s nest of ruling class interests stuffed full of centrists are suddenly barging their way to the front, suddenly convinced that the traditions of representative democracy might actually be worth defending.
AUG31	FE college helped me become chancellor. I want others to expand their horizons too	As a former student of Filton Technical College in Bristol, I am determined we treat further education colleges with the seriousness they deserve. College – and my economics teacher Charalambos Stamboulieh – helped make me who I am today, the first FE chancellor of the exchequer. I attended a comprehensive school in Bristol; my eldest brother, Tariq, had left school at 16 and gone straight into work. Nobody in my family had attended university. But then I started hearing about university from my cousin it sounded pretty appealing, and I wanted to keep my options open.
AUG31	‘Gay gene’ theories belong in the past – now we know sexuality is far more fluid	It turns out that genetics is almost as complicated as love and sex. New research has shown that the long fabled “gay gene” does not exist; that a variety of different genes contribute to same-sex attraction, and that several other factors are in the mix too. For many LGBTQ people – myself included – the very notion of this study sets off big queer alarm bells, though it should be noted researchers worked closely with LGBTQ groups. As early as 1993, the Daily Mail – and mock it all you like, it’s one of the country’s main newspapers – published an article under the headline “Abortion hope after ‘gay genes’ findings”. In the age of supposed “designer babies”, what if the hatefully inclined chose to make sure their unborn child wasn’t gay or bisexual?
AUG31	Here in no-deal ops, we know vandalism when we see it. And this is it	Prorogation is actually not a bad word for helping to describe the casual cruelty with which our political biosphere is being systematically gaslighted. Like the moral fabric of any self-respecting cabinet minister, this word is exceedingly flexible. It can be a noun when describing Boris Johnson’s evolution from bumbling amateur to bumbling pro rogue. It can be an adjective, too. As in, do you think people like Dominic Cummings should be the heart of government? “Why yes, I’m actually pro-rogue.”
AUG31	Only one person can avert a no-deal Brexit. And that’s Boris Johnson	This is not well done. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, displays cowardice and mendacity in insulting parliament with enforced suspension, and then in claiming that it has nothing to do with Brexit. It has everything to do with Brexit. It is not just an insult. It is a lie. Theresa May, the leader whom Johnson treated abominably, stood in the House of Commons, day after day, pleading for support in honouring the vote on the 2016 Brexit referendum. She tried to ease the United Kingdom out of the European Union with a compromise deal respecting the diverse views of a divided nation. She was inept and she failed.
AUG31	With hajj under threat, it's time Muslims joined the climate movement	According to research published last week by US scientists, hajj is set to become a danger zone. As soon as next year, they say, summer days in Mecca could exceed the “extreme danger” heat-stress threshold. The news comes just weeks after over 2 million people completed their journey of a lifetime. The environmental threat to the holy pilgrimage is a panic button for British Muslims like me, signaling that the climate crisis is endangering an age-old sacred rite. Hajj is a pillar of Islam that I’ve yet to undertake, and the physical endurance required will only become more gruelling in coming decades – scientists predict that heat and humidity levels during hajj will exceed the extreme danger threshold 20% of the time from 2045 and 2053, and 42% of the time between 2079 and 2086.
AUG31	My summer of cutlery: how packing Sheffield steel checked my privilege	What is it about a place that, once you have left it, draws you back, however unwillingly? Thirty years ago, in the summer of 1989, the so-called second summer of love, I had completed my first year at university and dragged myself and my spider plant back home to Sheffield, both of us exhausted and a little less euphoric than when we had set off. Gone, seemingly, were the drizzly, cold summers of the recent past: by July, 1989 seemed to be on the same path as the drought of 1976. It was a year of upheaval: the year my personal nemesis, Margaret Thatcher, would make a historic speech on climate change to the UN, only the day before the fall of the Berlin Wall. That summer, the US rock giants REM’s “eco-rage” album Green dominated the airwaves, along with the little-known Manchester indie band the Stone Roses, who a couple of months earlier had released their eponymous debut.
AUG31	Johnson wants us to feel outrage. Let’s take back control – starting with ourselves	What did you feel? Maybe it was anger, fury, fear. Perhaps it was excitement, hope, a certain thrill. It is unlikely that you experienced the announcement of parliament’s prorogation in purely cerebral, intellectual terms: it is hard to remain numb in the face of such drama. We are emotional beings and the emotions we felt were entirely natural and human. There is nothing wrong with them. But in all likelihood, whatever you felt was precisely what you were expected to feel. For the people in No 10 care only that you felt something. And they will be delighted with their latest wheeze, which has already served its purpose: to create outrage and entrench opinion. The ferocity of the reaction is all part of the plan. It is time for those of us who are opposed to it to become smarter and wiser in how we deal with all this.
AUG31	Imaginary friends are a sign of a lively, creative mind. But they are leaving us	When I was three, I had a very good friend named Gemma. She was fearless where I was fretful, rebellious where I was conservative and dextrous where I was clumsy. She was also entirely imaginary. With Gemma’s help and support, I almost made it to the top shelf of the bookcase before my parents found me – and “Gemma said it was OK!” did not save me from a telling off. Gemma was also very fond of Discos crisps and Bourbon biscuits, and I became very good at smuggling them into my bedroom for her. I can’t remember when or how I “met” Gemma, and, perhaps sadder still, I don’t remember the last time I “saw” her. Even though my brain created her, she inspired me to go on adventures I would not have had the confidence to embark upon without her. So it saddened me to see the results of a recent survey showing 72% of nursery workers believed children have fewer imaginary friends than they did five years ago, with 63% believing this to be a result of increased screen time.

SEP1	Shop less, live more – save the planet. It doesn’t sound that bad to me	Women love shopping, don’t they? Everyone knows we were born to do it; that left to our own devices we like nothing better than spending all day in some changing room, leaving our menfolk slumped outside in abject boredom, praying for it to be over. Except it’s not true, or certainly not for all women, and almost certainly never has been. Only 29% of women actually say they enjoy shopping, according to the retail analysts Mintel; for most of the rest it’s somewhere between actively anxiety-inducing (especially for anyone uncomfortable with stripping in front of a mirror) and merely rather boring. Too much advice about going green involves pushing slightly less toxic alternatives to things we don’t particularly need
SEP1	Ruth Davidson’s decision was personal, but her departure is a loss for all of us	I’m racing across the central belt to cover Ruth Davidson’s resignation, a row for missing an important email from my son’s nursery ringing in my ears, when I realise I’ve been reporting on women’s difficulty balancing work and family for what feels like two centuries. No wonder I’m feeling so ruddy tired. It’s the sheer unwieldy intractability of the dilemmas posed. It’s like getting stuck behind a motorhome on a Highland road: the progress is teeth-grindingly slow, you get tired of hearing yourself complain, then suddenly you’re forced to reverse into a ditch. At a press conference in Edinburgh on Thursday, the now former Scottish Conservative leader, who is widely admired for transforming her party’s fortunes north of the border, explained that she was leaving frontline politics because she had been “a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend”, and that the birth of her son last October had caused her to “make a different choice”.
SEP1	I thought I’d relish getting back to work after summer. I thought wrong	It has been a brutal re-entry into normal life after summer, and no one is handling it particularly well. Unlike previous years we seemed, on first glance, to be doing so well. Air travel with four-year-olds is infinitely easier than with three-year-olds. We were lucky with immigration and sailed through in 10 minutes. And travelling from London to New York – east to west – the jet lag is a breeze. And then we all went back to work. The burden of keeping someone’s needs in mind when committed elsewhere is one my mother’s generation had no word for
SEP1	MPs can push no deal, but it’s civil servants who will have to make it work	Try to imagine what life is like now in the civil service. You have spent the summer explaining to your family and friends that holidays have been put off so you can work on no-deal planning – you need to understand and manage the customs issues, supply chains and other business requirements, plus readiness to ensure smooth running at our ports. In addition you have been told to prepare a spending review, a budget and a programme for the next session of parliament to be announced in the Queen’s speech. And, of course, some of you are working on getting a deal so we can leave the EU in an orderly fashion. My guess is that you have been thinking creatively about how to resolve the backstop issue but must have been disheartened to hear that many ERG members now say that even this will not be enough to gain their support. They want other changes that may be even harder to get approval for from the EU. For some of them – and clearly Nigel Farage is in this camp – the only acceptable Brexit is a no-deal version.
SEP1	A ‘Brexit bonanza’ for UK fishing? That’s a fishy tale with an unhappy ending	One man’s fish is another man’s poisson. Not for much longer, it seems. French fishermen are growing alarmed. They fear a no-deal Brexit will exclude them from “British” waters where they have fished for centuries. The same applies to fishers from Ireland, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany.

SEP2	Tories against no deal must now choose between career and conscience	Space analogies are commonplace in 10 Downing Street these days. Boris Johnson has said proof the UK can leave the EU on 31 October could be found in the 1969 moon landing. In Dominic Cummings’s first meeting with government aides, he gave them a presentation on the lessons they could learn from John F Kennedy’s space programme. Now there’s an official Apollo dashboard in operation – a traffic light-system signal available to more than 200 ministers, No 10 staff and aides. They are supposed to access it to track no-deal preparedness and flag when a project is in trouble and requires extra attention. The spreadsheet is also on the prime minister’s personal laptop.
SEP2	Term is starting – and English schools must tackle their arts emergency	A new school year is about to begin. This means that I might soon arrive at a school and do a poetry workshop with some younger teenagers. It could well go like this. They make it clear that they don’t like poetry. I tell them poetry comes in hundreds of different shapes, sizes, rhythms and moods; one way we can make poems is in a group and without writing anything down. For example, the people who are in charge of us in life have ways of showing they are fed up with us, angry with us, or through which they try to control us; punish us, even. What do such people say? I suggest they go into pairs and say these kinds of things to each other – in role, as parents, teachers, carers. We select the best lines. Then I say, can we create this into a scene? They suggest that all the lines should be said to just one of them sitting in a chair; the rest stand in a semicircle around him, and as they each say their line they point at the boy in the chair and then step back, while the semicircle repeats a chosen chorus. We have made a snapshot of one aspect of their lives. It has rhythm, structure, solo and chorus, movement and mimesis. Later they can perform it for others, write a transcript of it and “publish” it on a school blog. We can talk about what we have made: what worked? Was it like any other poems or plays?
SEP2	The sheer scale of the crisis facing Britain’s decrepit constitution has been laid bare	Representative democracy is never easy. It’s been obvious for decades that the eight-word British constitution established in 1689 – what the crown assents in parliament is law – is a decaying, time-worn construct on which to protect and advance today’s democracy. It may have seemed “glorious” in the 17th century to hit upon the-then revolutionary notion that the crown can continue, but only if it delegates its monarchial sovereignty to whoever commands a majority in parliament. But it’s a wheeze that today too easily collapses into a highly centralised executive acting dictatorially because of its monarchial authority – and becomes toxic if that dictatorial dimension becomes legitimised by the “will of the people” in a referendum. A constitution with a bias to being an elective dictatorship, as Lord Hailsham famously characterised it, too easily slides into dictatorship by referendum. It is only unwritten, uncodified understandings that protect the body politic from regressing to government with minimal checks, balances and accountability. They in turn depend upon a political class that, whatever its differences, accepts common rules of the game, especially making sure that any recourse to direct democracy by referendum is firmly subordinated to rule by parliament.
SEP2	The French should go easy on Shakespeare over Agincourt	I see Shakespeare’s been at it again. This time he’s helped to get us in trouble with the French, the very dernière chose we need right now. But we must hope that Brigitte Macron, who last week opened the newly revamped Centre for Medieval History in Agincourt (yes! The French still refurbish museums!), will have mercy on us. More, at least, than Shakespeare’s Henry V, who shut up the gates of mercy so that “the flesh’d soldier, rough and hard of heart / In liberty of bloody hand shall range / With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass / Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants”. And that was before he even went into battle. Shakespeare’s vision, according to historians, did not quite accord with the reality – particularly in its portrayal of English troops, galvanised by their gung-ho monarch, securing victory against far greater French numbers. In fact, they argue, there was less of a chasm in manpower than previously thought, and certainly not the five-to-one of myth; nor were Henry’s archers drawn from quite the impoverished ranks of society that has been suggested. The director of Agincourt’s museum, Christophe Gilliot, hopes that the renovated museum will encourage us to reject the cliches, and thereby usher in a new era of Franco-British cooperation and understanding.
SEP2	We know life is a game of chance, so why not draw lots to see who gets the job?	The sweaty palms, the swotting, the tricky question that prompts your heart to plummet: job interviews are no one’s idea of a good time. The other side of the equation is hardly fun either: days out of a busy schedule spent interviewing candidates, some of whom you know within a couple of minutes you would never offer a job. Interviews are time-consuming for all involved. But we persist in doing them because recruitment decisions are some of the most important we take in the workplace and it follows we should invest time and energy into a robust recruitment process, right?
SEP2	We have become a land of permanent crisis. This suits the blustering liars of Brexit	Boris Johnson’s lies encapsulate Britain’s democratic decay. They are the bluster of a man who holds parliament and political accountability in contempt. They reveal the corruption of a Brexit movement that has no purpose now other than to secure an empty victory, whatever its original intentions and whatever damage it does to the traditions of Britain’s democracy, once thought to be indestructible and now revealed to be as ephemeral as dust in the wind. Do I need to justify the above? It’s what they want you to do. They come out with a big brassy lie and then insist that you so lose yourself in the thickets of a detailed rebuttal no one can follow your argument. But for the record and because I must, when the Observer revealed last Sunday that Johnson was planning to shut down parliament to stop it thwarting a no-deal Brexit, Downing Street spin doctors led by Robert Oxley, Johnson’s press secretary, said the report was “entirely false”.
SEP2	America’s opioid catastrophe has lessons for us all, about greed and racial division	‘We’ll build a wall to keep the damn drugs out.” So insisted Donald Trump at a rally last year to launch the White House’s initiative to stop opioid abuse. For Trump, at the heart of America’s opioid crisis lie open borders, illegal immigrants and foreign drug cartels. Brad Beckworth, an Oklahoma state attorney, takes a different view. The drugs to which so many in the state are addicted, he told a court in July, “didn’t get here from drug cartels. They got here from one cartel: the pharmaceutical industry cartel.”
SEP2	Stop whining, empty nesters. Your child going to uni is not about you	As a fresh contingent of British kids gears up for university, who should we be most concerned for – them or their parents? I ask because sending a child off to university seems to have morphed from an exciting rite of passage (for the child) into some dark, angst-ridden melodrama starring the parents. How do they feel about it? Are their hearts broken? Will they cope? This is usually accompanied by emotional accounts of parents staring forlornly into their child’s empty bedroom, perhaps weeping on to a favourite toy from childhood, or bravely talking about taking up new challenges to “fill the void”. What emerges is a sense almost of competitive empty nest syndrome. “I’m sad about my child leaving for university.” “I’m even sadder.” “I’m practically suicidal.” And on it goes. Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the most bereft of us all?
SEP2	Ruth Davidson departs to focus on family. That decision is only hers to make	She is not the first working mother to walk away from a dream job and sadly she won’t be the last. But few do it with the blunt candour of Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader who resigned last week. Since having her son, Finn, she said, the idea of disappearing on the campaign trail for weeks on end filled her with “dread”. Not for her the sugary euphemisms about putting family first; instead, she evokes the visceral, animal tug of anxiety at being too far away. Sometimes, too far means being in a different time zone, listening helplessly to your child cry down a phone line. Sometimes, even being in the same room isn’t quite close enough. Everyone has a different threshold, and it can easily change from day to day, but still, too far is too far, and you know it when you feel it. Yet even to say her decision is understandable is to enter a minefield.
SEP3	Boris Johnson is using threats against his MPs: they should ignore him	Not often do MPs make great personal sacrifices. They can drift along obeying their whip, hoping some small ministerial plum rolls their way if they behave. The Commons is a comfortable place – those tea rooms, those bars. Mixing with pleasant pals of similar ideological ilk, assiduous work in safe constituencies – many MPs have barely troubled the national news in decades on the back benches. Until now. Here comes a rare moment with a vote on a nation-changing question of such gravity that it takes their beliefs beyond the reach of whips. They may think ahead, to the time when post-Brexit national decline is beyond dispute in the history books, and that grandchild asks: “Why didn’t you stop it?” What can they say then? “I never thought Boris Johnson would really do it. He said it was just a negotiating ploy, but he drove us over the edge.”
SEP3	Boris Johnson may relish the street protests, but here’s why they must go on	The protest that took place last Wednesday evening, on the day the prime minister prorogued parliament, was part-organised by Another Europe is Possible. I was on the conference-call planning it, and we argued about whether or not “coup” was the right word, whether to start at 5pm or 6pm, whether to protest daily or concentrate on the Saturday. We talked about demo-fatigue and sound systems, the far right – who, inexplicably, were marched by police straight through the #StopTheCoup march at the weekend – but nobody argued about whether or not we should be protesting. The debate on our current crisis has concentrated on proroguing, but it is no more than the instrument of what has occurred: the executive has moved against the parliament. Not tricked it, outwitted it, bullied it, or won it round – moved explicitly against it. You cannot find precedent for this in the debates surrounding the Falklands war, or the national government of 1931; you’re squarely on the territory of the English civil war. To watch it happen and accede to it with silence would be unpatriotic, an act of bad citizenship.
SEP3	Ireland stands united against Westminster’s arrogant Brexiteers	Bodies fall and winged spirits rise in a towering sculpture in Dublin’s Garden of Remembrance – dedicated to the people who gave their lives for Irish freedom. Eight years ago, a reigning British monarch bowed her head and stood in silence before this tribute. At a state dinner in Dublin Castle, dripping in diamonds, she called us “friends ? in our own language. The country was still reeling from recession, with waves of young Irish people still emigrating, many to the UK. David Cameron, the man who would gamble with Britain’s future and lose, prophesised that the visit would “set the seal on what is already a very strong relationship between our two countries, but a relationship I believe can get even stronger still ?.
SEP3	We, the peoples of the Amazon, are full of fear. Soon you will be too	For many years we, the indigenous leaders and peoples of the Amazon, have been warning you, our brothers who have brought so much damage to our forests. What you are doing will change the whole world and will destroy our home – and it will destroy your home too. We have set aside our divided history to come together. Only a generation ago, many of our tribes were fighting each other, but now we are together, fighting together against our common enemy. And that common enemy is you, the non-indigenous peoples who have invaded our lands and are now burning even those small parts of the forests where we live that you have left for us. President Bolsonaro of Brazil is encouraging the farm owners near our lands to clear the forest – and he is not doing anything to prevent them from invading our territory.
SEP3	Could language be the key to detecting fake news?	The internet represents the biggest explosion of data in human history. There’s more out there, and more access to it than ever before. The information ecosystem is a bit like a tropical rainforest: luxuriant, dense and fiercely competitive. As such, it contains its fair share of predators and poisonous plants. Deliberately misleading articles, websites and social media posts can come about for lots of different reasons: they might be trying to influence elections or policies; they might represent a form of cyberwarfare between states; they might be aimed at raising someone’s profile and influence, or discrediting their opponents. Or they might simply be about making money, relying on the attention-grabbing nature of outrageous lies to generate ad revenue, as in the case of the “digital gold rush” that saw a small Macedonian town register more than 150 pro-Trump websites during the 2016 presidential race.
SEP3	A dark appetite for adventure is driving Britain’s hardline Brexit folly	Who is really setting the agenda on Brexit? The politician wielding the most leverage has never, in his entire career, held a parliamentary seat, let alone a cabinet position. He runs a party that isn’t a party, with no MPs, no members and no manifesto. But Nigel Farage holds the fate of the government in his hands. Farage has found himself somewhat overshadowed in recent weeks, as all eyes have been drawn to the new power in Whitehall, Dominic Cummings. But with his threat to stand Brexit party candidates against the Tories unless the government delivers a no-deal Brexit, it is Farage who has blown wide open a long-brewing crisis in the Conservative party. If they don’t give him what he wants, he will hand the next election to Jeremy Corbyn. Most Tories, absurdly, fear Corbyn more than no deal.
SEP3	Tories against no deal must now choose between career and conscience	Space analogies are commonplace in 10 Downing Street these days. Boris Johnson has said proof the UK can leave the EU on 31 October could be found in the 1969 moon landing. In Dominic Cummings’s first meeting with government aides, he gave them a presentation on the lessons they could learn from John F Kennedy’s space programme. Now there’s an official Apollo dashboard in operation – a traffic light-system signal available to more than 200 ministers, No 10 staff and aides. They are supposed to access it to track no-deal preparedness and flag when a project is in trouble and requires extra attention. The spreadsheet is also on the prime minister’s personal laptop.
SEP3	Life began for me as a queer teenager amid the happy excesses of Great Yarmouth	I ricocheted across Britain from the fishing working class of Aberdeen where I was born. Up and down the country we went, taking in mining villages in Northumbria, Canterbury, North Lanarkshire and finally Norfolk, by the time I was 15. My childhood involved more than nine primary schools (I eventually lost count), five secondary schools and more council houses, B&Bs and private slum flats than anyone’s should. The woman I am is the sum of all the challenges, kindnesses and observed tenacity from those less written-about streets, as much as it is the product of my adventures in an adulthood spent nomadically in Hanoi, Buenos Aires, Berlin and Budapest. But Great Yarmouth is the town that made me and broke me in equal measure. The name will conjure up the smell of hot, sugared doughnuts, the adrenalin fizz of cascading 2ps in neon-lit arcades
SEP3	Term is starting – and English schools must tackle their arts emergency	A new school year is about to begin. This means that I might soon arrive at a school and do a poetry workshop with some younger teenagers. It could well go like this. They make it clear that they don’t like poetry. I tell them poetry comes in hundreds of different shapes, sizes, rhythms and moods; one way we can make poems is in a group and without writing anything down. For example, the people who are in charge of us in life have ways of showing they are fed up with us, angry with us, or through which they try to control us; punish us, even. What do such people say? I suggest they go into pairs and say these kinds of things to each other – in role, as parents, teachers, carers. We select the best lines. Then I say, can we create this into a scene? They suggest that all the lines should be said to just one of them sitting in a chair; the rest stand in a semicircle around him, and as they each say their line they point at the boy in the chair and then step back, while the semicircle repeats a chosen chorus. We have made a snapshot of one aspect of their lives. It has rhythm, structure, solo and chorus, movement and mimesis. Later they can perform it for others, write a transcript of it and “publish” it on a school blog. We can talk about what we have made: what worked? Was it like any other poems or plays?
SEP4	The Brexit ultras cheer him, but the Boris Johnson pantomime will end	Brexit is not the first thing Boris Johnson has found difficult, but it might be the first difficult thing he cannot simply abandon. The path by which he arrived in Downing Street is strewn with jettisoned jobs, principles and relationships. He finds other people’s needs burdensome, and is used to shrugging them off. But now he is yoked to an onerous national duty. His discomfort was obvious in parliament today. Johnson’s traditional repertoire of glibness and bluster served him poorly as his authority and his majority melted away. The first significant test of his command of the Commons resulted in humiliation. He was defeated by a majority of 27, forfeited control of the legislative agenda, desperately threw a general election gauntlet across the chamber and watched helpless as the leader of the opposition dodged it. 
SEP4	Justine Greening’s decision to quit shows Tory centrists are running out of options	Justine Greening has had enough. The staunchly pro-European former cabinet minister, comprehensive schoolgirl and passionate advocate of social mobility has contemplated a future inside a Conservative party that no longer seems to have room for people like her, and chosen to walk away. Threatened with the loss of the whip for voting to take control of the Commons order paper to block Boris Johnson pursuing a no-deal Brexit, she announced that she wouldn’t stand again for Putney. For good measure, she hinted that if a no-dealer is chosen to contest the south-west London seat instead then they’re likely to lose; any successor, she explained, would have to represent her constituents, and most of them voted to remain. Her clear message was that even if Downing Street wins this battle, it could easily lose the war. They’ll know that if all the moderates melt away then Nigel Farage will essentially have won
SEP4	Boris Johnson is threatening his own MPs, but I’ll be voting to stop no-deal Brexit	Ever since Theresa May’s premiership, I have become suspicious of the “lectern moment”. That is when the prime minister steps outside Downing Street to address the nation on Brexit. This week with Boris Johnson was no different. Like many, I was left puzzled by the prime minister’s speech on Monday. When he spoke of the “clear vision for our desired future relationship with the EU” that we now supposedly have, I could not help but ask myself what this vision was, and whether it really exists. There seems to be a disconnect between the words uttered outside No 10, and the reality we now face as a country. Given what we know, it would be utterly reckless and irresponsible to proceed on this path
SEP4	To the Tory rebels: hold your nerve, put your country first, and defeat Johnson	I don’t have enough fingers to count the things Nick Boles and I disagree on. The independent MP for Grantham and Stamford only recently resigned the Conservative whip over the party’s refusal to compromise over Brexit. But I can only concur with his clear explanation of the crisis within his former party: “Johnson is truly Britain’s Trump. There is no institution, no relationship and no international commitment that he is not willing to sacrifice to achieve a no-deal Brexit. He is turning the Conservative and Unionist party into the English National Party. He must be stopped.” The only coherent thing to do in the face of such orchestrated chaos and confusion is to put the national interest first
SEP4	Why are all the motherhood memoirs so white?	I am more than a little obsessed with reading memoirs about motherhood. It is not inexplicable, for I have three young children of my own, aged five and under. In this intense period of parenting, whereby my tired head spins sometimes from simply trying to remember to call the right one by the right name and endlessly loading the washing machine, reading these individual experiences of mothers has helped me feel less alone. Less afraid. I’ve been spoilt for choice – you can’t help but browse a bookstore without stumbling upon yet another first-person account of motherhood. In the last year especially, motherhood memoirs have become as much of a trend as thrillers with the word “Girl” in the title once were. I’ve certainly noticed, and read, many more memoirs on motherhood since expecting my youngest child, now two, than when my eldest child was born five and a half years ago.
SEP4	The AfD is gaining strength in Germany. A reformed EU can stop it	As migrants from Syria poured into Germany throughout the summer of 2015, Angela Merkel responded with the reassurance: “We can manage this.” The phrase came to define Merkel’s chancellorship, setting her apart from the rest of the European elite for its humanitarian commitment to the refugee crisis. For the far right, Merkel’s welcoming response symbolised all that was wrong with Europe. They declared her out of touch with ordinary, working people. Across European capitals moderates were also incandescent . Some rejected the approach in principle, advocating “securing” EU borders instead. Others saw it as a well-intentioned but muddled gesture, a gift to the far right.
SEP4	Don’t buy the bluff. Here’s the truth about no-deal Brexit	No-deal Brexit has never loomed larger than in the current moment. Boris Johnson has said that Britain will leave the European Union on 31 October. His entire political strategy is based on the credibility of his threat to follow through, regardless of whether he has come to an agreement with the remaining 27 members. As a result, the need to understand what no deal may mean in practice has become increasingly urgent. At the UK in a Changing Europe, we have tried to address this: our report on it is out on Wednesday. We don’t have any inside information. We’re not privy to material that others do not have. But we do have a team of scholars who have spent their careers studying the relationship between the UK and the EU, and so are well placed to consider the potential implications if the UK were to leave in this manner.
SEP4	Should Labour back a general election under any circumstances?	If rule number one of opposition is “Never turn down an election” then rule number two ought to be: “Don’t label an opportunity to replace the government as ‘pointless’” – particularly if you’ve spent the past four years railing against Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, arguing that the left enjoys the comfort of opposition, and would rather be a party of protest and rallies than a serious party with aspirations of government. Oh, how the tables have turned. There is absolutely no justification for a Labour MP wanting to keep Boris Johnson in No 10, but by refusing to back a general election that is precisely what they’re doing. The EU27 will not agree to any meaningful changes to the withdrawal agreement unless the government changes and the negotiating principles change with it. So to stop a no-deal Brexit – even if article 50 is extended – we will in all probability have to win some version of a public vote: either a general election that elects a Labour government, or a second referendum with an option to remain.
SEP4	How much destruction is needed for us to take climate change seriously?	News of Hurricane Dorian’s first casualty came early on Monday morning from the Bahamas Press. A seven-year old boy named Lachino Mcintosh drowned as his family attempted to find safer ground than their home on the Abaco islands. Dorian is reportedly the strongest hurricane to have ever hit the Bahamas and the second most powerful Atlantic storm on record. Five deaths have been reported so far, and more are likely. The Bahamian MP and minister of foreign affairs, the Honorable Darren Henfield, offered a bleak update form the area he represents to reporters: “We have reports of casualties, we have reports of bodies being seen.” Rising temperatures don’t make hurricanes more frequent, but they do help make them more devastating. Each of the last five years have seen Category 5 storms pass through the Atlantic, brewed over hotter than usual waters. How many more people have to die before political leaders treat climate change like the global catastrophe it is?
SEP4	This prorogation crisis shows why the UK needs a written constitution	Who would have thought that a niche constitutional verb would be the word of the moment? We’ve known this mess was coming for months, but it doesn’t make it any less galling as the word prorogue dominates the debate. So are the prime minister’s actions unconstitutional? I think so – and there is a case at the Scottish court of session due to be heard on Tuesday to determine that question. But the fact is we can’t know for certain because the UK constitution is a fluid interpretation of codes, conventions and case law. Despite having influenced many constitutions around the world, we are one of only a handful of countries without such a written document of our own. The European Communities Act 1972 and the Human Rights Act 1998 come close in terms of placing limits on executive power, but both are under immediate threat from the current occupants of No 10.
SEP5	Javid’s giveaways don’t come close to reversing austerity’s bitter legacy	The end of austerity is here, Sajid Javid tells us. The “page is turned”. If only it really were that easy to erase the damage done during a decade of public services stripped bare. No department will suffer further cuts and all their budgets will keep pace with inflation. It’s good news that “the biggest increase in spending for a decade” means no new punishment will be inflicted on the public realm. An election is on the way and voters won’t take it any more. They need no focus groups to tell them people put the NHS, schools and police top of their priorities. The deep school cuts led to the firing of teachers and teaching assistants; stopped music, drama, art and school trips; closed breakfast clubs for hungry children; and left headteachers begging parents for pencils and glue. The damage emerged into the light of day to Theresa May’s political discomfort in the 2017 election. Now the annual funding is restored, but 10 years of spending are lost for ever.
SEP5	We know how Johnson wants to play this election. The signs are it’s not working	Imagine the scene in parliament late last night: a scruffy man with a ruffled open shirt, swinging a plastic carrier bag, staggers up to the escalator near the Palace of Westminster, yelling wildly at the leader of the opposition: “Jeremy, let’s have an election!” Corbyn was on a phone call, but a bewildered phalanx of shadow ministers clocked who it was: “career psychopath” (in the words of David Cameron) Dominic Cummings, the UK’s co-prime minister. “I thought he was a drunk tourist,” reports Cat Smith, one of the shadow ministers present last night. A drunk tourist is an apt description for Cummings: intoxicated with his own overblown reputation and sense of destiny; a man with foul-mouthed contempt for a party he’s simply passing through, subjecting it to a reign of terror in order to secure his precious Brexit project.
SEP5	Britain is mired in democratic crisis – but it goes much deeper than Brexit	Growing up, I learned that leaders who threaten democracy normally came decked out in khaki green, in front of troops toting shiny hardware. They commandeered broadcast studios, captured national buildings and imposed curfews on the streets. What is happening in Britain this week looks nothing like those grainy TV pictures, but it nonetheless marks an assault on our democracy. The government wants to shut down parliamentary democracy, claiming it is acting for the good of parliamentary democracy. From within No 10 Dominic Cummings threatens to end the career of elected MPs. And David Gauke, the Conservative MP who just six weeks ago was secretary of state for justice, wrote to his former government colleagues on Monday to ask them to obey the rule of law.
SEP5	An election is on the cards. So what do the polls tell us?	With the government shorn of its majority, and the Brexit deadline looming, the odds of an imminent election have dramatically reduced. So it’s worth examining the current state of the parties in the polls. What’s important to bear in mind, of course, is that polling provides a snapshot of public opinion at the time the poll is taken, and we are currently living in a highly volatile political situation. It’s possible that people’s minds will change when faced with the reality of an actual general election, and the parties experience the pressures of the campaign, as we saw in 2017. Not only that, but it’s very difficult to say precisely where the election will be fought and won. The key battlegrounds may not be the easily identifiable marginal seats where results were decided in the past.
SEP5	Hong Kong’s protesters have scored one for democracy, but the struggle is far from over	Hong Kong’s courageous demonstrators have won a significant victory – but the struggle to halt stealthy, long-term Chinese efforts to curtail legally guaranteed freedoms in Britain’s former colony is by no means over. Their protest campaign has come to symbolise the wider, global confrontation between authoritarian and democratic, law-based forms of governance – and that epic battle, too, has a long way to run. By agreeing on Wednesday to officially withdraw the proposed extradition bill that first sparked the protests in June, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, has finally done what she probably wanted to do weeks ago – but was prevented from doing by Beijing. In leaked remarks last week, Lam admitted making “unforgivable” mistakes that plunged Hong Kong into an unprecedented post-1997 crisis. Yet it is clear that her freedom of action was severely limited. Lam would almost certainly have resigned by now, had her Communist party masters let her. But they feared that any attempt to quit would be seen around the world as a sign of their weakness and indecision – and so are insisting, for now at least, that she stay in post. But Lam’s position has been fatally weakened. If and when calm returns, Beijing is expected to replace her.
SEP5	To my merciless, brutal period: it’s time you and I talked	I am standing in a draughty, picturesque church on an icy Saturday in December, wearing four-inch gold glittery heels and silently cursing you as you churn up my insides without a thought for the occasion. Try as I might to focus on my friend, the gleamingly beautiful bride, and stand stoic during the hymns she’s painstakingly chosen for us to chorus, all I can think is: will you please fuck off? And when can I rip off this fascinator, my heels, dress, tights and, while I’m at it, my skin? The need for delicious wedding champagne to dull your grip is getting increasingly urgent. Yeah, I’m talking to you. My pushy, aggressive, attention-seeking period. The very same period that has no sense of timing or mercy. OK fine, due to the wonder of the pill you do arrive on time, mostly. But you pay no heed to how you transform me from a fast-walking, talking vibrant being into a husk who craves warmth, trousers that have lost their elastic, and copious amounts of fat chippy chips doused in vinegar.
SEP5	As an MP I’ve been called a traitor and worse, but I will still fight no-deal Brexit	Westminster feels like a cauldron of fraught emotion. Not just in the chamber, the corridors, and the streets surrounding parliament, but among colleagues, with individual consciences wrestled over with increasing regularity. I was elected in 2017 on a staunch “stop Brexit” mandate by the people of Oxford West and Abingdon, so my voting decisions are straightforward, but I sympathise with those like Ken Clarke, Sir Nicholas Soames and my new colleague, Dr Phillip Lee. It is not easy to walk away from a party that you have aligned yourself with for decades. Many of them say their parties have left them, the moderates, behind. That’s a feeling echoed by much of the electorate. Anxiety permeates the areas in which all MPs work and live. Protesting is a fundamental aspect of our democracy, and I will always encourage this course of action, but it can be intimidating. MPs put ourselves at the behest of the British people, certainly, but we are not infallible or devoid of sensitivity. Though the Liberal Democrats have been clear and consistent, while walking between appointments in Parliament Square, I have been called a traitor, and worse. We are often warned not to exit the parliamentary estate unaccompanied and we are besieged with threats and abuse online. It is not a healthy environment in which to work, but it does reflect the strength of emotion that is splintering our society. What provides me with the strength and conviction to walk proudly among protesters so angry about the policies I endorse is the support I absorb when I am in my own constituency. Whenever I am at home, I am met with smiling faces, and words of thanks, even hugs.
SEP5	Boris Johnson’s electoral gamble risks wrecking the Tory party	When some of the best-known Conservative figures of the last half-century are booted out of their party, when a new prime minister loses his first parliamentary vote and his governing majority on the same day, when historians are referring to this as a “revolutionary moment”, you know something of great significance is going on. But what exactly is it? What we are witnessing is another round in the same historic struggle that powered the English civil war of the 17th century: the contest between the executive and the legislature. At its simplest, the House of Commons has voted – once again – to take control of the Brexit process, in order to prevent the UK crashing out of the European Union with no deal on 31 October. That’s the substance of the bill that MPs will vote on, and are likely to pass, today, having cleared the procedural hurdle in dramatic fashion last night. The comparisons with the 17th century are not hyperbolic, because what this move represents is a bid by the legislature – parliament – to grab powers that have traditionally been the preserve of the executive.
SEP5	Boris Johnson's blustering strategy has fallen at the first hurdle	Tuesday night’s result is a defeat that Boris Johnson has worked tirelessly to secure. From proroguing parliament to furiously provoking rebels on his own side, Johnson created this moment of crisis. That’s because his political strategy aims to force a general election before Britain leaves the EU – and to use Brexit to win it. In a single day, Johnson managed to drive one Tory MP to walk across the chamber to join the Liberal Democrats, others to announce they would not seek re-election, and more to walk through the opposition lobbies with Jeremy Corbyn. It is quite the political feat. In his personal life and his political career, Johnson has shown himself to be a risk-taker. But while a general election is a huge risk, for him there is a greater risk of inaction. Johnson has no viable negotiating strategy for Brexit itself and yet he invested all his political capital in meeting the October deadline. For all the bluster about no-deal, the reality is that the chaos it would cause means the only gamble for the Tories bigger than a general election before Brexit is one afterwards.
SEP5	History will be kind to Heathrow climate protesters who stop us flying	Obedience is dangerous: it has facilitated every form of institutional oppression and violence. Every advance in justice, peace and democracy has been made possible by disobedience. Ethical progress is unlikely when we do only what we are told. We owe our right to vote, our freedom from servitude and subjection, our prosperity and security to people reviled in their time as lawbreakers and reprobates. Breaking the law on behalf of others is a long and honourable tradition. Next week, a few dozen unaffiliated activists intend to start something they call Heathrow Pause. They will each fly a toy drone within the restricted zone around Heathrow airport. The drones will fly nowhere near the flight paths, and never above head height, ensuring they present no risk. But any drone activity forces the airport to suspend all flights. The activists know they face arrest and possibly long prison sentences. 
SEP6	Johnson thinks a ‘culture war’ will win crucial working-class votes. He’s wrong	Not long after the referendum in 2016, some neighbours suddenly erected a big wooden fence around their front garden. Well, it seemed sudden. Our postman jokingly called it “the Brexit wall”, and although the two events may have been entirely unconnected, the fence took on a symbolism it was probably never intended to have. Whether it was there for reasons of privacy, security, or simply to have something for the ivy to grow on, we’ll never know. I don’t like to ask. But the fence reinforced my belief that community life has never been, and never will be, as straightforward as some dewy-eyed nostalgics would like to present it. That thought recurred this week, as the country staggers towards a general election. Whenever it does finally take place, both the Tories and Labour will make a pitch – in the Midlands and the north of England particularly – on the presumption that the leave vote represented a desire to take things back to how they supposedly once were.
SEP6	The prime minister revels in war rhetoric, but could end up its victim	Boris Johnson wants war. He knows Britons love war, especially with Europe. He and his allies have turned a technical debate about trade policy into a Battle of Britain. They suggest ludicrously that the national economy faces an existential threat from Europe. They forget that in times of war countries seek to cohere, not descend into partisan strife. A single-issue general election, as Johnson now wants, would be irresponsible. His job as prime minister should be to get a deal on Brexit and not stall one, as he is blatantly doing. The most eerie Commons performance this week was by the minister for no deal, Michael Gove. He was like an air raid warden from Dad’s Army. He had plans for supplies of medicines and food. Trucks were assigned to country lanes. Guards were reinforcing Dover. Two billion pounds will pour into farms, fisheries, manufacturing and hospitals. No expense will be spared, no cost too great, to keep the dastardly foreigner from our shores. MPs purred. They loved it. Last weekend was the 80th anniversary of the start of the second world war, and I counted 20 programmes about Nazis on British television.
SEP6	We scientists must rise up to prevent the climate crisis. Words aren’t enough	As scientists, we tend to operate under an unspoken assumption – that our job is to provide the world with factual information, and if we do so our leaders will use it to make wise decisions. But what if that assumption is wrong? For decades, conservation scientists like us have been telling the world that species and ecosystems are disappearing, and that their loss will have devastating impacts on humanity. Meanwhile, climate scientists have been warning that the continued burning of fossil fuels and destruction of natural carbon sinks, such as forests and peatlands, will lead to catastrophic planetary heating. We have collectively written tens of thousands of peer-reviewed papers, and shared our findings with policymakers and the public. And, on the face of it, we seem to have done a pretty good job: after all, we all know about the environmental and climate crises, don’t we?
SEP6	Johnson is acting like a winner. But reality may have other ideas	When a football team loses its first four games of the season, the manager’s job is on the line. Could the same thing happen with Boris Johnson’s prime ministership? It seems unlikely, so soon after the ousting of Theresa May. And yet politics, like football, is a results-driven game. This week, Johnson lost four big votes in the Commons. Last week he lost Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson too. On Tuesday he threw 21 MPs out of his party. On Thursday he even drove his own brother out as well. The damage that Johnson is willing to inflict on politics appears limitless. But it may also extend to Tory prospects in the general election he is so keen to hold.
SEP6	Boris Johnson may not get an election. But he can still avoid asking for a Brexit delay	One consequence of the topsy-turvy landscape created by Brexit is that we currently have a prime minister who says he doesn’t want an election pushing for one and an opposition leader who has spent much of the past two years calling for one refusing to immediately back a snap poll. As Boris Johnson put it – with glee – to Jeremy Corbyn in the chamber on Wednesday night after the prime minister’s motion for a general election failed to win sufficient support: “This is the first time in history that the opposition has voted to show confidence in Her Majesty’s government. ? The Labour leader has suggested he won’t back the election he craves until he is certain the imminent threat of a no-deal Brexit has been averted. A debate is ongoing within Labour as to when that can be known – whether there can be an election before an extension has been agreed, or whether it needs to come after.
SEP6	The promised Tory tax cuts will only mean more austerity in the long run	If I have been ill and I say I am better, does that mean I am better than I was or that I am no longer ill? The same ambiguity applies to the phrase “the end of austerity”. If you took this to mean that the public sector had stopped shrinking, then in overall terms you would be correct. But you would be completely wrong to think the austerity that began in 2010 had been significantly reversed. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, plans for government spending as a share of GDP to rise from 38.1% in this financial year to 38.6% in 2020-21, while this ratio was planned to fall slightly under Philip Hammond. However, the same figure was 44.9% at the end of the Labour government. Nearly all areas of spending are still below 2010 levels in real terms. Overall public spending has stopped being squeezed, but it is still much smaller than it once was.
SEP6	Boris Johnson is a hostage in No 10. No wonder he fears a long contest	Boris Johnson’s strategy is coming apart. He had no plan for a deal. He promised not to call a general election. He feared the consequences of no deal. So in an ideal world, which is the only one he had planned for, he would have had an election forced upon him by Jeremy Corbyn. Instead, he had to go to the House of Commons and ask for one under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, which requires a two-thirds majority. His request was rejected, leaving him a hostage prime minister, with no meaningful option available that doesn’t lead him into the territory of compromise, which would jeopardise his offer: the man who beats the Brexit party by being even more uncompromising than them.
SEP6	Johnson should beware – forcing a crisis rarely ends well for aspiring strongmen	Genuine national crises, where everyday life is disrupted and the status quo buckles or crumbles, don’t come along often in a usually stable, sometimes boring country like Britain. Over the last half century, there have arguably been less than half a dozen: the three-day week in 1974, the winter of discontent of 1978-9, the riots and recession of 1981, the financial crisis of 2007-8, and the current, accelerating meltdown – constitutional, economic, and cultural – around Brexit. Such episodes are a nightmare for many people, but others yearn for them. Once, these catastrophists were mostly found on the revolutionary left. Now they increasingly come from the right.
SEP6	At last, a generation of schoolchildren will grow up knowing it’s OK to be LGBT	Students across the country are heading back to school this week, and while this might not seem momentous, for Stonewall, this school year marks the beginning of the end of a decades-long campaign to get an inclusive education system in England. In September 2020, new regulations for teaching relationships and sex education (RSE) in English schools come into force. It will be a landmark moment – a whole generation will attend schools that not only accept LGBT people and same-sex relationships, but also celebrate and offer support on the issues that young LGBT people face. The guidance means that primary schools will teach about different families, which of course includes LGBT families. Contrary to what’s been said by some online and in the media, this is just about showing kids that families can have two mums or two dads. Or to put another way: different families, same love. 
SEP6	Javid’s giveaways don’t come close to reversing austerity’s bitter legacy	The end of austerity is here, Sajid Javid tells us. The “page is turned”. If only it really were that easy to erase the damage done during a decade of public services stripped bare. No department will suffer further cuts and all their budgets will keep pace with inflation. It’s good news that “the biggest increase in spending for a decade” means no new punishment will be inflicted on the public realm. An election is on the way and voters won’t take it any more. They need no focus groups to tell them people put the NHS, schools and police top of their priorities. The deep school cuts led to the firing of teachers and teaching assistants; stopped music, drama, art and school trips; closed breakfast clubs for hungry children; and left headteachers begging parents for pencils and glue. The damage emerged into the light of day to Theresa May’s political discomfort in the 2017 election. Now the annual funding is restored, but 10 years of spending are lost for ever.
SEP7	Think Boris Johnson is toxic to voters? Don’t be so sure	Boris Johnson has blown it, surely. Even the man who invariably gets away with murder – rising above things that would sink any mortal politician – can only push the Tory faithful so far. Or so I thought, at any rate, the night it emerged that police had been called to his girlfriend Carrie Symonds’ flat by worried neighbours. Whatever happened between them – and the police went away satisfied it was nothing but a lovers’ tiff – the episode seemed at best embarrassing and distinctly un-prime ministerial. Surely older Conservatives, pens poised over leadership ballot papers, would worry about the risks of putting such a volatile character into No 10.
SEP7	Dazed and confused, Johnson stumbles into the twilight zone with a police escort	Why do people still call it a Tory “split” on Europe? It’s not a split: it’s an episiotomy. The Tory episiotomy on Europe went septic this week as Boris Johnson expelled 21 MPs, including two former chancellors and his hero Winston Churchill’s grandson; lost his own brother in a tale we’ll call Cain and Far More Able; and gave a speech so hallucinatorily bad it whiteyed a policewoman. At the current rate, even Robert Caro will only need a week to write this Johnson biography. Then again, Johnson might get a majority, and we’ll look back on these as the good old days. More on the prospect of that banter-apocalypse later.
SEP7	On the stage, Alexander Litvinenko gets the justice he was denied in life	The character is called Mr President. He’s a fussy little man who walks briskly down a red carpet. The Russian national anthem is a clue, as are the golden Kremlin doors. Yes, it’s Vladimir Putin, making an appearance on a London stage in A Very Expensive Poison, Lucy Prebble’s reimagining of the story of the dissident Alexander Litvinenko’s murder by Russia’s FSB spy agency, based on my 2016 book. Reece Shearsmith plays Mr President with dark charm. He addresses the audience directly. “Whenever you tell a story you tell a lie, ? he begins. He offers an alternative version of Litvinenko’s ghoulish killing. Instead of being poisoned with radioactive tea, Litvinenko lives out a happy family life in a cottage with his cat Yuri, Putin says. On the banks of the Volga. In the background a dog barks. The scene is marvellously chilling. Mr President is compelling. He has the best lines, including a gag about the only “crime ? being the cost of the theatre programme and the Old Vic makeshift loo arrangements, and we laugh with him. But does this make us complicit in his deeds? Mr President is everywhere and nowhere. He offers quips from the balcony. He appears at Litvinenko’s death bed, robed in a hazmat protection suit.
SEP7	The three questions that will decide the next general election	When answers are in short supply, sometimes the best we can do is try to ask the right questions. Some of those dive into legal and constitutional arcana, as experts try to work out how Boris Johnson can climb out of the hole he has spent this last week digging ever deeper for himself. Now that the opposition parties have refused to accede to his cunning plan for an October election, and will next week see passed into law their demand that he seek an extension of Britain’s EU membership, he’s left with a series of unpalatable alternatives – from breaking the law to resignation to tabling a motion of no confidence in himself. Still, even if it’s later rather than sooner, polling day is coming. So here goes with the three questions that will decide the next election and, with it, the fate of Brexit.
SEP7	For the Bahamas, hurricanes like Dorian are now an existential threat	We had gone through this countless times. On the eve that Dorian made landfall in the Bahamas, we knew the drill. Board up your home, secure your belongings and stock up on food, water, non-perishable items and the good snacks. Bahamians had faced down the merciless beatings of Hurricane Andrew, Frances, Jeanne, Wilma, Joaquin, Matthew, Irma and more. We thought we knew the score. But no one could anticipate that mother nature could be this angry and cruel. Once the water subsides, the debris is cleared and the bodies are counted, what hope will be left for the Abacos and Grand Bahama?
SEP7	Switzerland was sent into scientific exile. No deal could mean the same for Britain	Switzerland has been touted as a model for the UK, post-Brexit. It is an independent state that determines its own laws, controls its own borders, and through its status as an associated country has access to many key elements of EU membership – including the institution’s leading science and research programmes. But Switzerland’s recent experiences should sound a warning about the importance of cross-border ties, and about how future collaborations between the UK and the EU could be jeopardised if a no-deal Brexit materialises this autumn.
SEP7	Boris Johnson has shown why Britain’s constitution must be reformed	Recent events in British politics have stretched the capacity of our constitutional norms to their limits. But what have they collectively taught us? They highlight worrying weaknesses – but also some less-discussed strengths. Two key features lie at the heart of the British constitution. One is the centrality of parliament; the other is that key aspects depend on politics, not law. Sadly, the weaknesses in such a system have now been demonstrated – by an officeholder who rejects convention and seeks to push powers to their legal limit. Suddenly, a previously stable system has shown itself to be fragile.
SEP7	Britain is behind the slaughter in Yemen. Here's how you could help end it	Nothing can diminish the threat of a disorderly Brexit, or the significance of Boris Johnson’s recent anti-democratic prorogation of parliament. That those stories lead the news is no surprise. But when our government provides crucial support to a campaign of indiscriminate killing in Yemen that has claimed the lives of thousands of people, and this is treated as a footnote in our politics rather than a national scandal, it is plain that something has gone badly wrong. This week a report by UN experts warned that Britain could be complicit in war crimes through its arming of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervening in Yemen’s civil conflict. The report is the latest in a long line from the UN and the world’s most respected NGOs documenting a consistent pattern of violations. The experts note that leading arms providers like the UK “have a specific influence” on the belligerents “and may be held responsible for providing aid or assistance for the commission of international law violations”.
SEP7	The Home Office’s message to EU citizens living here: we want you to stay	EU citizens are part of the fabric of the UK. They are our friends, our family, our colleagues. Our country has been made all the richer for their contribution. Whether you are an Italian living in Manchester, a Pole in Leicester or a Portuguese national in my constituency of Great Yarmouth, you help to make our great country one of the most vibrant and diverse in the world.
SEP7	Johnson thinks a ‘culture war’ will win crucial working-class votes. He’s wrong	Not long after the referendum in 2016, some neighbours suddenly erected a big wooden fence around their front garden. Well, it seemed sudden. Our postman jokingly called it “the Brexit wall”, and although the two events may have been entirely unconnected, the fence took on a symbolism it was probably never intended to have. Whether it was there for reasons of privacy, security, or simply to have something for the ivy to grow on, we’ll never know. I don’t like to ask. But the fence reinforced my belief that community life has never been, and never will be, as straightforward as some dewy-eyed nostalgics would like to present it. That thought recurred this week, as the country staggers towards a general election. Whenever it does finally take place, both the Tories and Labour will make a pitch – in the Midlands and the north of England particularly – on the presumption that the leave vote represented a desire to take things back to how they supposedly once were.
SEP8	The Observer view on the best way to defeat Boris Johnson	“A no-deal Brexit could cause far more damage to our future economic success than a Corbyn government, the former chancellor Ken Clarke told the Observer this weekend. It is an extraordinary sign that the Conservative party has imploded beyond the point of no return that someone who until days ago was its longest-serving MP would now rather see not Boris Johnson, but a man whose politics he has staunchly opposed for decades as prime minister. The party’s crisis was compounded last night by cabinet minister Amber Rudd resigning the Conservative whip. “I cannot stand by as good, moderate Conservatives are expelled,” she said.
SEP8	The Observer view on Putin’s ongoing corruption of democracy	Vladimir Putin’s regime has done all in its power to skew and distort the results of Sunday’s nationwide regional elections in Russia. This is no surprise. The Kremlin has become notorious in recent years for its efforts, both brazen and underhand, to subvert democracy at home and abroad. With general elections approaching in Britain and the US, a close eye needs to be kept on Russia’s president. Recent events surrounding Moscow’s municipal election campaign should serve as a warning to all who value free and fair polls. Early on, the regime excluded all opposition candidates in a bid to ensure victory for United Russia, the ruling party. That crude intervention provoked mass protests on a scale not seen since 2011-12, when Putin won a third presidential term by what were widely regarded as fraudulent means.
SEP8	Politics should be about getting things done – not creating drama	A prime minister willing to die in a ditch. A machiavellian adviser snared by his own ambition. Bloodletting and purges. Brothers falling out. An opposition leader trapped by his own indecision. It’s been a week of high political drama. Journalists and politicians have revelled in the brinkmanship, the bluffs, the clash of characters, the arcane plots. There will no doubt be a TV drama. And probably a David Hare play, too.
SEP8	Why western liberals have long picked the wrong historical hero	Lost in the library of a small American college has lain a text by one of England’s foremost philosophers that no one knew he had written. “Reasons for tolerateing Papists equally with others”, a work by the early Enlightenment philosopher John Locke was discovered in the archives of St John’s College in Annapolis, Maryland, by the independent scholar JC Walmsley. The find, announced last week, has been greeted with excitement by both philosophers and historians. It is significant, too, in throwing light upon political debates that have as much relevance now as they did 400 years ago. Locke is central to modern politics because of his foundational role in liberalism. His Two Treatises on Government was highly influential in the development of liberal democracy. A Letter Concerning Toleration, published in 1689, is a key text in furthering notions of free speech and religious toleration. Both works shaped the thinking of Thomas Jefferson and other leaders of the American Revolution and underlay their commitment to the separation of church and state.
SEP8	The vices that led Johnson to the top are useless when it comes to wielding power	The self-image of the public-school ethos from which Boris Johnson springs is best expressed in Thomas Hughes’s high-Victorian novel, Tom Brown’s School Days. But Johnson’s own model is surely not the honourable Tom but the contemptible cad Harry Flashman, as he is so hilariously reimagined in George MacDonald Fraser’s The Flashman Papers. The arch-bounder was sometimes suggested as an avatar for David Cameron but he is surely a better match for Johnson. He rises inexorably to become Sir Harry Flashman VC and brazenly informs us that “all my fame and glory has been earned by accident, false pretence, cowardice, doing the dirty, and blind luck”. Flashman makes his career in the military and explains: “Some human faults are military virtues, like stupidity, and arrogance, and narrow-mindedness.” We may take assurance from the very fact that Johnson is prime minister that the same goes for politics. Some human faults – mendacity, cynicism, opportunism, bluster, recklessness – are political virtues. But only up to a point. Those qualities have taken Johnson to the pinnacle of power. Shamelessness is practically a requirement for high office. But as we have seen in a dramatic week, the vices that allow you to take power are not much use when you have to wield it – at least not yet and not in a country whose battered democracy retains some life.
SEP8	If there’s a cardinal sin to be made, count on the Catholic church	A grim little vaudeville act is currently touring some of Scotland’s Catholic parishes, featuring the remains of Thérèse of Lisieux, a long-dead French nun. Thérèse died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 in 1897 and was canonised in 1925, becoming Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face. By all accounts, this young woman developed an exemplary devotion to her faith and was the author of some beautiful (if slightly ripe) spiritual tracts. I’m not sure she deserved the fate of having some of her remains bumped in and out of cars and through the hills of South Lanarkshire and Paisley for the devoted titillation of the faithful. These relics of Saint Thérèse are considered to be “first class”, this being the ultimate seal of Vatican authentication. To be accorded this distinction, they must be parts of the bodies of the saints, such as fragments of bone, skin, blood, hair or ash. Apparently, poor dead Thérèse (or parts thereof) has been getting ferried like this throughout the Catholic world since 1994. Is there no one to call a halt to this unedifying distortion of faith? Can we not let this blameless lassie rest in peace?
SEP8	What Harvey Weinstein looks like doesn’t matter – it is the evil lurking within	Should Harvey Weinstein’s physical appearance matter? Watching Ursula Macfarlane’s devastating recent documentary Untouchable: The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein, I felt renewed admiration for all the courageous women recounting the alleged attacks, all denied by Weinstein. However, I was also struck by how much interviewees, generally, mentioned Weinstein’s appearance – his ugliness, his weight, his repulsiveness. Which seemed strange. Surely Weinstein’s unattractiveness isn’t the issue? Weinstein’s appearance should be completely irrelevant. “Ugly” people attract beautiful people. And it isn’t as though women feel any less attacked if a good-looking man does the attacking. Some sexual predators are good looking (look at “handsome” serial killer Ted Bundy), but they’re still preying on women. Predators are just predators – being attractive doesn’t seem to stop them, nor does it excuse them. Why then is there so much emphasis on Weinstein’s ugliness?
SEP8	Why ruin Stonehenge to shave a few seconds off a car trip?	For the past four years, a disaster has been threatening of such calamitous proportions that, should it ever come to term, future generations will rub their eyes in wonder that a Conservative government – a Conservative government – could ever have let it occur. At stake is much that Tories are supposed to hold dear: the ancient fabric of the country; fiscal responsibility; Britain’s good name. Yet ministers seem content to sit on their hands. As a result, with the clock ticking down towards an October deadline, a grotesque act of vandalism threatens. We are facing a desecration: the desecration that is the Stonehenge road tunnel.
SEP8	The law must step in to fill the gap left by a wounded parliament	In The Usual Suspects, Kevin Spacey has a line for all Remainers laughing at the sight of Boris Johnson striding to power and then tripping over his shoelaces and falling flat on his face. He tells of a “gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob. They realised that to be in power, you didn’t need guns or money or even numbers. You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn’t.” If they broke even gangsters’ lax conventions – not just kill a rival but his wife and kids – they would dominate. Johnson is showing a ruthlessness no one has seen in British politics. “When are you fucking MPs going to realise we are leaving on 31 October? We are going to purge you,” the Mail reported Dominic Cummings screaming at Greg Clark. Cummings and Johnson duly purged not just the former business secretary but two former chancellors of the exchequer, Winston Churchill’s grandson and 18 other “fucking MPs” who refused to do as they were told.
SEP8	James Middleton (and Ella the dog): no need to mooch with a pooch for companionship	It takes a lot for me to muster up enthusiasm for a Middleton, but last week, James brought a noteworthy date to the GQ awards: his cocker spaniel Ella. I’m not sure if anyone on the red carpet took the opportunity to shout: “Who are you wearing?” at the dog, but allow me: she sported a flattering black jacket with a fetching tartan sort-of kilt, with Pets as Therapy in a blocky white print on the back. In January, Middleton wrote eloquently and at length about his experience of depression; in the piece, he explained how vital his dogs, and particularly Ella, had been for his recovery. Middleton volunteers for Pets as Therapy and Ella is a fully fledged therapy dog. Whenever I hear about support animals, I think of an unforgettable New Yorker feature from 2014, in which writer Patricia Marx explored the growing numbers of officially sanctioned “emotional support animals” by trying to take a snake, a turkey and an alpaca with her into restaurants, museums and shops (not at the same time). It is a brilliant, witty piece and one of my all-time favourites. It revelled in the absurdity of the ease with which a psychologist could deem a peacock, for example – banned from a United Airlines flight in 2018 – necessary for emotional support.
SEP9	Britain is facing a stark choice. So why are so many people tuning out?	As parliament tumbled through last week’s drama, I was in the north-west of England, trying to divine the public mood. (What we found is about to appear in the Guardian’s Anywhere But Westminster video series.) I spent a lot of time in Bury, the large town 12 miles to the north of Manchester whose two constituencies recently returned Labour MPs, although Bury North was held by the Tories between 2010-17. The previous year, 54% of voters in the wider metropolitan borough had supported Brexit. Though it was not hard to find people whose belief in leaving the EU remains undimmed, the prevailing mood seemed to mix weariness with disconnection, and a sense that Westminster’s convulsions were just one more story of crisis and chaos. “I’m just confused,” one woman told me. “I’ve stopped watching any of it.” One man folded both the Brexit mess and the loss of his job as a refuse collector into a much wider story – of cuts to the borough council (which, since 2010, has lost 61% of its annual budget) and the collapse of Bury football club, a woeful example of a beloved local institution ruined by financial mismanagement and mountains of debt.
SEP9	Without MPs like Amber Rudd, the Tories won’t survive	Conviction often has its own contagious energy. When Dominic Cummings was briefly director of strategy for the then party leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2002, there were occasional lunches for journalists at what was then still called Conservative Central Office in Smith Square. Cummings would sit at one end of the table in open-necked shirt and jeans, bellowing about the inadequacy of the Conservative party; while IDS, in pinstripe suit, sat meekly, head bowed, at the other end, like a deeply unhappy vicar being berated by an evangelical member of the parish council. It was easy to forget that, technically at least, Duncan Smith was the one in charge. Even now, after Boris Johnson’s disastrous week – capped by the dramatic resignation of Amber Rudd last night – many are still mesmerised by Cummings and his cunning plans. Not unreasonably, they recall his choreography of Vote Leave’s victory in 2016. Less reasonably, they persuade themselves that the present mayhem is all a necessary prelude to eventual glory, citing the Leninist maxim that “worse is better”.
SEP9	Like Macbeth, Johnson is too stepped in blood to turn back. Where next?	Because Boris Johnson has such a notoriously casual relationship with the truth, there is a tendency not to take him seriously, even on the occasions when he is probably speaking with an unforked tongue. So there has been a lot of derision for his declaration that he would “rather be dead in a ditch” than ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline. Seriously? Even if instructed to do so by the legislation that will be written into the statute book this week? Would he break the law, a ditch no previous occupant of his office has chosen to expire in? That, I think, is ultimately unlikely. He wouldn’t like the food in prison. So might he resign as prime minister rather than carry out parliament’s orders? Yes, I think he might do that. He would not want to quit. He may not have realised yet that the positions he has taken will compel him in that direction. But I think we may get to the point where resignation from Number 10, taking his government with him, ends up being his least worst option. He has been boxed by parliamentary votes that will not let him have a no-deal Brexit. He has been coxed by the opposition refusing him an election. The one thing they can’t stop him doing is quitting as prime minister and taunting the Commons to find someone else to carry out its instruction. Deposing himself may turn out to be the most powerful card left in his hand.
SEP9	Mugabe’s death can be the start of Zimbabwe’s healing process	Zimbabwe’s founding leader, Robert Gabriel Mugabe, has died. The widespread reaction to his death has revealed starkly the divided legacy he leaves behind. From one viewpoint he is Zimbabwe’s founding father, the man who led his comrades through an armed struggle for the liberation of Zimbabwe’s black majority from Rhodesian white-minority rule. His achievements in those early, heady years of independence were exemplary, with emphasis on health, education and women’s empowerment, thus opening up possibilities to many Zimbabweans, particularly the rural poor, who were shut out from Rhodesia’s opportunities. From another viewpoint, he is the hero who became a villain, his 37-year rule characterised by massive human rights abuses, from the Gukurahundi massacres and persecution of supporters of the rival Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo just after independence, to the persecution of perceived enemies, both in the opposition and within his own party, whom he considered threats to his power. Even the land reform programme, much admired across Africa for restoring land to its rightful owners, was implemented amid chaos and violence.
SEP9	Was the old Guardian better than today’s? I can now make a direct comparison	I have scouted for ages for an issue that would allow a comparison of Guardian journalism across time. What might be concluded from a look at print-only, black-and-white coverage alongside today’s converged, paper-and-screens coverage? Was the remembered paper really so much better than today’s, as readers sometimes lament to me? I needed subject matter that was sufficiently prominent, consequential and open to this kind of exercise, even if the samples were separated by decades. The chance came last week with the UK parliamentary drama over Brexit. The scene resembled the four days in October 1971 when the UK parliament debated and approved Edward Heath’s Conservative government’s “decision of principle to join the European Communities on the basis of arrangements which have been negotiated”. Labour whipped its MPs to vote against; 90 rebelled, and the motion passed 356 to 244. Recriminations swiftly followed. The House of Lords approved by 451 to 58 as “brother passed brother in the Labour party on the way to the lobbies with none of the acrimony of their Commons counterparts”, reported the Guardian.

Journalists and politicians have revelled in the brinkmanship, the bluffs, the clash of characters, the arcane plots. There will no doubt be a TV drama. And probably a David Hare play, too.
SEP9	Robert Mugabe was once a hero of the left. What can we learn from his descent into tyranny?	If democracies have learned anything, it is that one man or woman in control of a country for decades never works. Having come to power by fighting against the previous regime, with spells in prison or exile, charismatic leaders can only sustain their power as that charisma fades by progressively tightening control. Challengers, typically embodying some combination of fresh ideas, new social forces and a desire to end abuse, are held down by ever fouler means. Even if the state purports to be a democracy, elections are rigged, the media muzzled and opposition politicians harried or even killed. Inevitably, the economy suffers: there is a lack of investment, growing shortages, government rationing and rampant inflation. As the despot gets older, there is a fight for the succession, but without rules, process or accountability, so that it becomes a raw and destructive battle between factions. The need for orderly succession is an overlooked and powerful argument for democracy, as those conniving in the strutting power of presidents Putin and Xi will one day discover.
SEP9	What Harvey Weinstein looks like doesn’t matter – it is the evil lurking within	Should Harvey Weinstein’s physical appearance matter? Watching Ursula Macfarlane’s devastating recent documentary Untouchable: The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein, I felt renewed admiration for all the courageous women recounting the alleged attacks, all denied by Weinstein.

SEP10	The real cost of cheap US chicken? Chlorination is just the start	As sugar was to the 18th and 19th centuries, so chicken is to the 20th and 21st centuries. It has been turned into one of the defining commodities of our era. A luxury until it underwent its industrial revolution from the 1960s on, it is now ubiquitous. Today, questions about how poultry is produced, by and for whom, and to whose profit, take you to the heart of the global trade system. So there is no escape from the debate about chlorinated US chicken. Politicians, perhaps bemused at having to repeatedly discuss something so mundane and dirty as contamination by chicken excrement, try to downplay concerns. President Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, treated the issue as a joke recently when he visited the newly installed Boris Johnson to offer solidarity in the form of a quick and easy US-UK trade deal. Others have elevated the chicken argument with a flourish of Latin, as Daniel Hannan did when he gave a speech in praise of Gallus gallus domesticus and the huge contribution its industrialised progeny have made by providing cheap protein to the world’s poor.
SEP10	Britain could lead the fightback against nationalist populism	Britain is fast approaching a democratic showdown. The Brexit saga may yet prove to be among the worst of the current worldwide horde of nationalist populisms, or it could offer the best example of a democracy fighting back. To seize the chance of the latter will require exceptional wisdom from voters who want Britain to be true to itself. The claim that British populism could be among the worst may seem like another example of Britons arrogantly overestimating their own importance. Worse than Viktor Orbán’s demolition of democracy in Hungary? Worse than what Donald Trump can do to international order? Yet no other populism is likely to dismantle the very country it claims to be saving. The end of the United Kingdom is a probable outcome of the hardline Brexit towards which Boris Johnson is steering the country like a demented racing driver. Brexit would also very significantly weaken both the European Union and the transatlantic alliance.
SEP10	Proroguing parliament is bigger than Brexit. It’s a display of political power	What do political leaders hope to achieve by breaking with constitutional rules and conventions? As government policy becomes increasingly hard line, from talk of proroguing parliament to ignoring its laws at the risk of jail, much of the coverage has focused on the goals this may serve. Whether as part of a negotiating strategy intended to force the hand of EU partners by showing how close a no-deal Brexit could be, or as a way to weaken domestic opposition and run down the clock, constitutional transgression can be read as a way to get things done. But breaking with norms can also be an end in itself. Rather than being about achieving specifics, it can be a way of signalling broader ideas – about the nature and authority of executive power, and about politics itself. In the name of getting a task done, leaders can seek a wider redefinition of themselves and the landscape around them.
SEP10	Camping satisfies our urge to escape. But we take our baggage with us	The Oxford philosopher GA Cohen thought that a camping trip was a good model of what socialism might look like. When we go camping, claimed Cohen, “there is no hierarchy among us; our common aim is that each of us should have a good time, doing, so far as possible, the things that he or she likes best”. During a camping trip all the campers have control of the means of production. “Even if they are privately owned things, they are under collective control for the duration of the trip,” Cohen explained. A camping trip becomes an occasion when “people cooperate within a common concern that, so far as is possible, everybody has a roughly similar opportunity to flourish, and also to relax, on condition that she contributes, appropriately to her capacity, to the flourishing and relaxing of others”. If things go as they should, “even most anti-egalitarians accept – indeed, take for granted – norms of equality and reciprocity”.
SEP10	If Boris Johnson quits, MPs should back Jeremy Corbyn to avoid no deal	Who’s afraid of Jeremy Corbyn? Unthinking, knee-jerk Corbynphobia is a danger in the precarious weeks ahead, as the country’s fate hangs by that red thread. As parliament is brutishly banished by Boris Johnson after failing to secure an election, both sides retire to plot feverish ploys and counterploys for the Brexit endgame. Johnson’s crew brief that they have scores of cunning loopholes to escape the paralysing parliamentary vice that stops him crashing the country out of the EU with no deal on 31 October, even defying the law. But the rebel alliance of opposition parties and Tory refugees is confident there is no trapdoor he can slip through without parliamentary consent.
SEP10	In Brussels, the goodwill Boris Johnson fostered is slowly ebbing away	The attention of Brexit-watchers has understandably been focused on Boris Johnson’s disastrous week in parliament and the exact timing of any election. But key to what happens next is, of course, the EU’s position. When UK (and European) commentators talk about the EU’s stance on Brexit, they almost invariably conclude that “nothing has changed”. Europe’s unity is paramount. Ireland will not be sacrificed. The withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. Even suggesting that Germany’s deteriorating economic conditions may give Berlin some pause for thought is tantamount to heresy. The EU’s Brexit position is fixed in time and space. 
SEP10	Charging migrant women for maternity care puts us all to shame	Rarely have I felt more ashamed of Britain than when having to provide passport details before my first ever midwife appointment. There, alongside my name and address, close to the section about smoking and family history, I was asked to prove – what, exactly? That I was British enough to deserve a healthy pregnancy?
SEP10	I don’t want to strike, but British Airways has left me with no choice	Why are pilots earning six-figure salaries going on strike? On the face of it, I do a highly respected and sought-after job and I am paid handsomely for it. Yet this week I am going to strike, and I feel hugely conflicted. My heart feels that I do not want to inflict a strike on British Airways, to which I have given the lion’s share of my working life; or on my passengers, for whom I make safety and commercial decisions every working day. Pilots tend to work until retirement for the better airline employers, so we have a deep practical and emotional connection to our airline’s wellbeing. Passenger safety, along with our own and the other crew members’ safety, affects every decision, action and thought while we are at work; so to decide to destroy the plans of travellers – which we know include highly important life and business events – goes against every fibre of my working soul.
SEP10	The London arms fair is an inexcusable disgrace – it’s a stain on the nation	This week’s London arms market – decorously called a “fair” – is a national disgrace and the protesters currently calling attention to it are right. It is a shameless marketplace for global death and destruction, vitiating any work done by British diplomacy in support of a more peaceful world. The best apology the government can offer is that it “supports jobs”. The same line of argument applies to membership of the EU – and yet the government doesn’t support that job supporting measure.
SEP10	Britain is facing a stark choice. So why are so many people tuning out?	As parliament tumbled through last week’s drama, I was in the north-west of England, trying to divine the public mood. (What we found is about to appear in the Guardian’s Anywhere But Westminster video series.) I spent a lot of time in Bury, the large town 12 miles to the north of Manchester whose two constituencies recently returned Labour MPs, although Bury North was held by the Tories between 2010-17. The previous year, 54% of voters in the wider metropolitan borough had supported Brexit. Though it was not hard to find people whose belief in leaving the EU remains undimmed, the prevailing mood seemed to mix weariness with disconnection, and a sense that Westminster’s convulsions were just one more story of crisis and chaos. “I’m just confused,” one woman told me. “I’ve stopped watching any of it.” One man folded both the Brexit mess and the loss of his job as a refuse collector into a much wider story – of cuts to the borough council (which, since 2010, has lost 61% of its annual budget) and the collapse of Bury football club, a woeful example of a beloved local institution ruined by financial mismanagement and mountains of debt.
SEP11	Johnson can’t escape the clutches of May’s zombie Brexit deal	In schlock horror movies there is a moment when the monster, assailed by every weapon and presumed dead, lurches back to life. And so Theresa May’s Brexit withdrawal agreement comes crawling from behind the closed doors of parliament, where it was killed at least three times. Boris Johnson says he wants a deal and there is neither time nor diplomatic goodwill sufficient to craft a new one. Erasure of the backstop – the Brexiteers’ big demand – is not available. As a candidate for the Tory leadership, Johnson boasted that Brussels would yield once confronted with a UK government prepared to quit the bloc with no deal at all. Conversations in Paris and Berlin have disabused him of that notion.
SEP11	The insidious ideology pushing us towards a Brexit cliff-edge	At first sight it’s incomprehensible. Why risk everything for a no-deal Brexit? Breaking up their own party, losing their parliamentary majority, dismantling the UK, trashing the economy, triggering shortages of food and medicine: how could any objective, for the Conservative and Unionist party, be worth this? What good does it do them? Yes, some people will benefit. To judge by recent donations to the Conservative party, some very rich people approve of Boris Johnson’s policies. A no-deal Brexit might favour hedge funds that thrive on uncertainty, financiers seeking to short the pound, vulture capitalists hoping to mop up cheap property if markets collapse. But the winners are likely to be greatly outnumbered by the losers, among whom are many powerful commercial interests.
SEP11	Margaret Atwood’s new work is full of feminist hope. But don’t dumb it down	In these dark and difficult political times, I often find myself craving clarity, looking for explanations and reassurances – and rarely, if ever, finding what I seek. When I got my hands on a precious copy of Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments a couple of days ago I was surprised by the almost physical hunger I felt to step back into Gilead. Obviously, I’m not alone, and one reason why this dystopia has hit the spot for many of us is its clarity. I’m not saying that there isn’t complexity of plot in Atwood’s creation, but in Gilead there is also a great deal of moral certainty. There is good, and there is evil. There is oppression, and there is resistance. The appearance of handmaids in their red cloaks has put heart into me at various protests over the past couple of years. I have photographed them at women’s marches in London and seen them gather in courtrooms in the US. Although they are a symbol of a possibly terrifying future, they are also a symbol of shared understanding, which gives me hope. And The Testaments, unlike The Handmaid’s Tale itself, is a truly hopeful tale. It reassures us that we are right to fear our enemies and right to resist them, and it reassures us that totalitarianism can be seen off.
SEP11	The Lib Dems’ plan to revoke article 50 is as undemocratic as the race to no deal	Today the Liberal Democrats have moved from being a party supporting a second referendum on EU membership to one that simply wants parliament to revoke article 50 at the earliest opportunity. This type of polarising behaviour mirrors the no-deal extremists on the other side of the debate and illustrates exactly why British politics is stuck in deadlock. Jo Swinson’s decision is nonsensical for two reasons. First, it flies in the face of everything the party has ever stood for. How can any Lib Dem politician look their constituents in the eye, refer to themselves as a “democrat” and then pledge to overturn the biggest democratic exercise this country has ever seen, without even having the courtesy to first ask the public if they have changed their mind? It is as astonishing as it is hypocritical.
SEP11	With parliament out of the picture, what happens next?	Parliament is now suspended for five weeks, and the outcome of Brexit is as uncertain as ever. The deadlock means we are almost certainly heading for a general election, but the route towards one offers only stark options for both government and opposition – and risks putting severe strain on our constitution. Parliament has spoken unambiguously on its opposition to a no-deal Brexit by passing a new law mandating an extension. However, Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted that he will not ask to delay Brexit beyond 31 October. At the same time, he has also said he will adhere to the law. This is an obvious contradiction.
SEP11	Theresa May’s resignation honours list is another sign of our rotting political system	When Theresa May first began to recruit staff for No 10, she made one thing very clear. Anyone joining government in the new, ostentatiously workmanlike, post-Cameron era shouldn’t be doing so hoping to get a gong out of it: they would, the new prime minister is said to have warned, be lucky to get “so much as a chocolate biscuit” at the end. The sentiment encapsulated everything that was meant to have changed since the old Etonian set cleared their desks – so much so that she eventually wheeled it out in public. At an awards dinner she joked that David Cameron’s former spin doctor, Craig Oliver, had confessed to retching into a bin when he heard the referendum result; when he became Sir Craig, everyone else knew the feeling. For many, the most sickening aspect of May’s own resignation honours list will be the sight of a woman praised for her work on domestic violence giving a knighthood to a cricketer convicted of it. But the political honours she dished out are, in their own way, just as capable of undermining any remaining legacy. Worse still, they fuel the corrosive belief that all politicians are the same; that even those who promise to be different eventually revert to type. Who imagines Boris Johnson will be any more immune to the temptation of abusing the honours system, given recent threats to stuff the Lords with pro-Brexit peers?
SEP11	The real cost of cheap US chicken? Chlorination is just the start	As sugar was to the 18th and 19th centuries, so chicken is to the 20th and 21st centuries. It has been turned into one of the defining commodities of our era. A luxury until it underwent its industrial revolution from the 1960s on, it is now ubiquitous. Today, questions about how poultry is produced, by and for whom, and to whose profit, take you to the heart of the global trade system. So there is no escape from the debate about chlorinated US chicken. Politicians, perhaps bemused at having to repeatedly discuss something so mundane and dirty as contamination by chicken excrement, try to downplay concerns. President Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, treated the issue as a joke recently when he visited the newly installed Boris Johnson to offer solidarity in the form of a quick and easy US-UK trade deal. Others have elevated the chicken argument with a flourish of Latin, as Daniel Hannan did when he gave a speech in praise of Gallus gallus domesticus and the huge contribution its industrialised progeny have made by providing cheap protein to the world’s poor.
SEP11	Britain could lead the fightback against nationalist populism	Britain is fast approaching a democratic showdown. The Brexit saga may yet prove to be among the worst of the current worldwide horde of nationalist populisms, or it could offer the best example of a democracy fighting back. To seize the chance of the latter will require exceptional wisdom from voters who want Britain to be true to itself. The claim that British populism could be among the worst may seem like another example of Britons arrogantly overestimating their own importance. Worse than Viktor Orbán’s demolition of democracy in Hungary? Worse than what Donald Trump can do to international order? Yet no other populism is likely to dismantle the very country it claims to be saving. The end of the United Kingdom is a probable outcome of the hardline Brexit towards which Boris Johnson is steering the country like a demented racing driver. Brexit would also very significantly weaken both the European Union and the transatlantic alliance.
SEP11	Media bias is OK – if it's honest	Most people distrust the media, and most people are right. It’s healthy to question what you’re being told – that’s the mark of an intelligent and independent populace. And the media in the United States are, in fact, “biased” in many ways. Not always toward the left or right, but frequently toward reaffirming the worldview of an insular establishment, as Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky pointed out years ago in Manufacturing Consent. It should be obvious that there can’t be such a thing as a neutral journalist. We all have moral instincts and points of view. Those points of view will color our interpretations of the facts. The best course of action is to acknowledge where we’re coming from. If we show an awareness of our own political leanings, it actually makes us more trustworthy than if we’re in denial about them.
SEP11	Proroguing parliament is bigger than Brexit. It’s a display of political power	What do political leaders hope to achieve by breaking with constitutional rules and conventions? As government policy becomes increasingly hard line, from talk of proroguing parliament to ignoring its laws at the risk of jail, much of the coverage has focused on the goals this may serve. Whether as part of a negotiating strategy intended to force the hand of EU partners by showing how close a no-deal Brexit could be, or as a way to weaken domestic opposition and run down the clock, constitutional transgression can be read as a way to get things done. But breaking with norms can also be an end in itself. Rather than being about achieving specifics, it can be a way of signalling broader ideas – about the nature and authority of executive power, and about politics itself. In the name of getting a task done, leaders can seek a wider redefinition of themselves and the landscape around them.
SEP12	Adaptation isn’t enough. We’ve got to throw everything at the climate crisis	When we’re faced with threats of inundation, our reaction has traditionally been to build walls. Sea-level rises, storms and floods have been held back with solid barriers, seawalls and dykes. We have used walls to keep out people, too: the fact that this has failed throughout the ages has not stopped its recent revival in the United States. The climate crisis threatens global sea-level rises of well over half a metre if we fail to act, while tidal storm surges will reach many times that height. Fiercer and more frequent hurricanes will batter us, and millions of people who live in areas where crops have failed and wells run dry will be forced to flee their homes. But walls will not work with the climate crisis, even if the temptation to try to keep out the consequences, rather than dealing with the causes, is as strong as ever.
SEP12	Why it’s time to take the Liberal Democrats seriously again	Beneath the soaring arches of Westminster Abbey at Paddy Ashdown’s memorial service on Tuesday, it was sometimes tempting to imagine Britain’s liberal tradition regaining something of its former eminence. As the service came to an end, and with a theatricality fully worthy of the former Liberal Democrat leader himself, a valedictory Last Post was followed by a summons to action in the Reveille. A sense of resumed purpose was unmistakable in the sunlit chatter outside the abbey. The Liberal Democrats have been marginalised by most commentators for many years. It is easy to see why. Tarnished in leftwing eyes by austerity and in rightwing ones by pro-Europeanism, the post-coalition electoral implosion of 2015 reduced the party from 57 Commons seats to a mere eight. Fewer people voted Lib Dem in the 2017 election than for the Lib Dems or their predecessors in any election since 1970.
SEP12	Is it the end of the road for the Conservative party?	In his only working week presiding over a full House of Commons, Boris Johnson was defeated in three successive votes in a single day, lost two members of his cabinet team – one a very senior colleague, the other his little brother – relinquished control of the order paper, and was threatened with the prospect of prison if he ignores new legislation mandating a delay to Brexit. That’s got to be some sort of ruinous record. It prompted many commentators to claim that Johnson is a busted flush and even prompted speculation that the Conservative party itself may be reaching the end of the line, at least in its traditional form. I would not bet on that just yet.
SEP12	Tom Watson is wrong. We need an election first – and then a second referendum	Anti-Brexit MPs, from the Tories’ Oliver Letwin to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, have hit the airwaves arguing that the country should resolve Brexit before deciding on its next government. However, this push for a second referendum ahead of a general election is doomed to failure. As the indicative votes process showed, there is no majority in this parliament for a second referendum – or indeed for any particular outcome. So demanding one before a general election is an act of political pique.
SEP12	Chaos is being normalised. It is all part of Boris Johnson’s pernicious plan	On Saturday, for the first time in living memory, neo-fascists were chanting the name of the serving prime minister. Supporters of the English Defence League and the Democratic Football Lads Alliance wandered around Whitehall some drunk, harassing random remain protesters and shouting into the faces of journalists until, inevitably, they attacked the police. It’s part of an unnerving trend that’s emerged in the past two weeks: the normalisation of chaos.
SEP12	Margaret Atwood’s new work is full of feminist hope. But don’t dumb it down	In these dark and difficult political times, I often find myself craving clarity, looking for explanations and reassurances – and rarely, if ever, finding what I seek.

It reassures us that we are right to fear our enemies and right to resist them, and it reassures us that totalitarianism can be seen off.
SEP12	The insidious ideology pushing us towards a Brexit cliff-edge	At first sight it’s incomprehensible. Why risk everything for a no-deal Brexit? Breaking up their own party, losing their parliamentary majority, dismantling the UK, trashing the economy, triggering shortages of food and medicine: how could any objective, for the Conservative and Unionist party, be worth this? What good does it do them? Yes, some people will benefit. To judge by recent donations to the Conservative party, some very rich people approve of Boris Johnson’s policies. A no-deal Brexit might favour hedge funds that thrive on uncertainty, financiers seeking to short the pound, vulture capitalists hoping to mop up cheap property if markets collapse. But the winners are likely to be greatly outnumbered by the losers, among whom are many powerful commercial interests.

And so Theresa May’s Brexit withdrawal agreement comes crawling from behind the closed doors of parliament, where it was killed at least three times.

It is as astonishing as it is hypocritical.
SEP12	Jeremy Corbyn is wise to emulate Harold Wilson’s pragmatism on Europe	It is said of Harold Wilson that he epitomised the quip: “If you can’t ride two horses at the same time, you shouldn’t be in the circus.” He was often criticised for putting pragmatism before principle in his 13 years as Labour leader, but it was an attribute that served him well in preventing the party from tearing itself apart on Europe in the 1970s. When Wilson won a fourth general election on 10 October 1974, he faced the challenge of navigating Labour’s deep divisions on whether or not to reverse the 1972 decision to join the common market. The party’s election manifesto had promised the British people a “final say” on Britain’s membership without committing itself one way or another to a recommendation. “It is as yet too early to judge the likely results of the tough negotiations which are taking place,” it said.
SEP13	Boris Johnson has no right to call himself a one-nation Conservative	I have been around long enough to know that I should not always be surprised or shocked about what is written in the Sun newspaper. But it was reported yesterday that Boris Johnson was telling cabinet colleagues he was “basically a Brexity Hezza” – with the newspaper helpfully explaining this was a “reference to Tory wet Michael Heseltine who battled rightwing PM Margaret Thatcher”. The quotes have not been denied and I assume they were well sourced. Part of me is even a little flattered, not least because there is a side to the prime minister that I like. He succeeded me as MP for Henley and I got to know him. More importantly, as mayor of London, he once showed a capacity to govern in the tradition of one-nation conservatism.
SEP13	The Brexit crisis is political. Its resolution must be political too	Boris Johnson is looking like Saint Sebastian, pierced with a thousand arrows but with a saintly smile on his face. Next week more judges join in the archery, as the supreme court begins his prorogation case. Who knows what damage they might do? Their task is simple. The purpose of a supreme court is not to avoid politics but to set its rules, to frame it in law. This week’s Scottish judges were right. The advice given by the prime minister to the monarch must be reviewable where its implications are plainly constitutional. Johnson’s potentially deceptive advice to the Queen on proroguing parliament must be open to review – not just condemnation – if his ulterior motive was to curb parliamentary freedom. If the court refuses to intervene, whatever it decides, it will be inviting future monarchs to dispute the advice, thus sucking them into politics. The supreme court must adjudicate.
SEP13	Rape is becoming decriminalised. It is a shocking betrayal of vulnerable women	If I were a rapist, I would be laughing all the way to my next victim in the context of today’s news that rape prosecutions are at their lowest level in a decade. And if I was raped today, it pains me to say that I wouldn’t dream of reporting that rape to the police. As a lifelong feminist campaigner against male violence, I feel more pessimistic about the prospect of ending rape – which is what any civilised society should aim for – than I did 40 years ago. For decades, the proportion of reported rapes that end in a conviction has been dismally low. But things are getting worse: today’s statistics show that although the number of rapes reported to the police has doubled in the last year, the number of rape cases charged and prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has fallen dramatically. Out of 54,000 reports of rape in 2017-18 (thought to be a fraction of the rapes actually committed), only 1,925 ended in a conviction.
SEP13	Marie Claire wasn’t all fluff. It filled a crucial gap in women’s lives	Lucinda Chambers had not, she said, read Vogue for years. The magazine was too full of ridiculously expensive clothes that felt irrelevant to ordinary women’s lives, she complained, and besides, the glossies always left her feeling faintly anxious that her life wasn’t up to their standards. It’s hardly an unusual take on women’s magazines, long accused of encouraging readers to go shopping by preying on their insecurities, save for one crucial detail. Chambers had been running Vogue’s fashion pages for the previous 25 years, and let rip only after being sacked. An army of influencers is giving away for free large chunks of what magazines once sold, with little regulation
SEP13	A four-day working week is common sense – but the state must make it happen	The future means working less. This is the new common sense that has emerged in Britain and across the globe in recent years. We’ve seen a flurry of books pushing for a shorter working week, trade unions such as the Communications Workers Union winning reductions in hours for its members and “4 Day Week” campaigns created both inside and outside the Labour party. Almost every week a new company announces that it operates with a four-day week or is at least trialling it. Whether it’s a data design company such as Normally, a marketing company such as Pursuit Marketing or a call centre like Simply Business, a four-day week is quickly becoming a sign of best practice. The Monday to Friday working week we inhabit today is, of course, a social and historical construct. While it might appear as a “natural” configuration of time, the reality is that our 37-hour working week, and the weekend, are the result of labour movements of the 19th and 20th centuries demanding limits to the toil that industrialism had imposed upon them. American unions famously won the weekend, Australian unions won the eight-hour day and working class pressure here in Britain resulted in the two-day weekend being firmly normalised after the second world war.
SEP13	Central banks were always political – so their ‘independence’ doesn’t mean much	Independent central banks were once all the rage. Taking decisions over interest rates and handing them to technocrats was seen as a sensible way of preventing politicians from trying to buy votes with cheap money. They couldn’t be trusted to keep inflation under control, but central banks could. And when the global economy came crashing down in the autumn of 2008, it was central banks that prevented another Great Depression. Interest rates were slashed and the electronic money taps were turned on with quantitative easing (QE). That, at least, is the way central banks tell the story.
SEP13	Passionate politicians took us into Europe. A poisonous press is dragging us out	In the bare ruined choirs of the prorogued parliament, one small event carried on unhindered. The scrutinising committees are banned, the prime minister shut parliament to avoid interrogation by the mighty Commons liaison committee as he hid from PMQs. But this one small elegiac meeting went ahead: Lord Giles Radice launching his little red book, A Love Affair With Europe. There they were, older noble lords of passionate pro-European persuasion assembling to mourn the passing of a long-held dream. For 50 years Radice was one of those who toiled unceasingly for the UK to join, and to love, the Europe of peace and prosperity – a beacon of democracy.
SEP13	A general election is coming – the left must keep its focus on marginalised voters	With the prorogation of parliament, and the government set on a no-deal Brexit, it’s easy to feel powerless. And yet this is not the time to feel helpless. A general election may have stalled but one is inevitably on its way. Those of us who wish to remove Boris Johnson and his hard-right ilk from power will need to organise with laser focus, not only setting out an inspiring vision for a fairer society but targeting its message to reach the public. At the 2010 election, there was a 23 percentage point gap between the turnout of the richest and poorest income groups
SEP13	My son is one of Kashmir’s ‘disappeared’. When will India tell the truth about their fate?	The Eid this year was like no other. We could not even offer the obligatory sacrifice because of the total siege by India of Kashmir. When my son Yasir went to fetch bread in the morning and didn’t return promptly, I started pacing with worry outside the house. What if the security forces manning every corner had roughed him up, or even worse? My fear is the fear of every single person living in shock in Kashmir and wondering “What next?” Eventually he returned, explaining that the delay was due to long queues at the only bakery open in the entire area. But unlike Yasir, my son Javaid has never returned.
SEP13	Johnson’s ugly rhetoric thrills the far right, but he’s playing with fire	For the first time in our history, we have a prime minister whom the far right regard as their leader. Last Saturday, far-right thugs at a demonstration in Westminster lunged at remainer and leftwing activists as they chanted, “We’ve got a lamppost just for you” and, “We love you, Boris”. The jailed fraudster and thug Tommy Robinson has declared, “We back Boris”, commending him for taking on Tory rebels and Labour “traitors”, while one of his key allies has promoted a video clip featuring Johnson with his thumbs up, captioned “The people’s prime minister” and “Parliament vs the People”, and accompanied by a football stadium-style chant of “Boris for England!” While Margaret Thatcher whipped up fears of Britain being “rather swamped by people with a different culture”, and held out the “prospect of an end to immigration”, the National Front – the dominant far-right movement of the time – never saw her as one of its own. If Johnson is privately concerned about becoming the pin-up for a resurgent far right, he has shown no signs of it. Instead, he and his co-prime minister, Dominic Cummings, casually play with matches, even though they know that Britain is a tinderbox.
SEP14	We can revive Britain’s high streets. But developers stand in the way	Anyone who has walked down a British high street recently will not be surprised by the latest news on their dire state. A report by the Local Data Company and PricewaterhouseCoopers reveals that chain-store closures are at their highest level since their audit began in 2010. On Britain’s top 500 high streets, 1,234 shops shut in the first half of 2019. This is the new reality. Former anchor tenants have either sunk (BHS, Toys R Us) or, like M&S, Debenhams and House of Fraser, are shutting stores to stay afloat. At Topshop, New Look and Monsoon, a company voluntary arrangement (financial first aid for ailing brands) is this season’s must-have accessory.
SEP14	Even the Tories admit it: only duty free can get us through	Now wanted north of the border for a prorogation scam, prime minister Boris Johnson went on the run this week with a series of alarming public appearances. Tuesday found him in a primary school, as per the timeworn political practice of ministers using inappropriate venues as backdrops. You know the sort of thing: “It’s great to come to this wonderful early years centre and announce 10 new active nuclear warheads, each capable of snuffing out 300,000 human futures in an instant.” The reality was somehow even more unsettling, as Johnson wandered miles off script to wistfully inform the kiddies: “I’m afraid I didn’t do enough work at university. My strong advice is: don’t waste your time at university. [sigh] Don’t get drunk, don’t do … not that you would … but use it well … I frittered too much time at university, I’m afraid to say …” An excruciating pause. Shortly after, a boy no older than seven put his hand up and went: “Are we leaving Brexit with a deal or no deal?”
SEP14	Why, this year, Last Night of the Proms will be woke	In recent years we seem to have reached peak wokeness, but not entirely for the right reasons. I first heard woke as an adjective from the US, alongside the rise of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. The term “stay woke” was used as an empowering slogan that encouraged people to be vigilant to the injustices in society, especially racism. But as the word grew in popularity, the licence to use it in any which way expanded and its meaning became diluted. It was in response to this woke-washing that I decided to call my piece for tonight’s Last Night of the Proms “Woke”. [When I was young] I remember feeling a sense of otherness – where were all the other black and minority-ethnic children?
SEP14	My nameless village, now lost in time	I went to a school in Pakistan’s Punjab province called government primary school, Chak 2/4-L. Chak means village; 2/4-L is the name of my village, 2/4 the number of the canal feed that irrigates it, and L because it’s on the left side of the canal. Most villages along the canal had named themselves after a local legend or a landmark. We never bothered. I always assumed that our people were so hardworking they forgot to name where we lived. I don’t mean to romanticise hard labour, but my people were always busy cultivating their land. The land was fertile, but fertile land requires even harder work: you must irrigate it at midnight and pick your vegetables before dawn. And there were rewards. If you owned two acres of land you could send your sons to university and give water buffaloes to your daughter in their dowry; if you had no acres but owned a buffalo you could still send your son to school and your daughter to a Qur’an class.
SEP14	This political crisis now goes far beyond Brexit – our very democracy is at stake	The sensation has become so rare, it took a moment to realise what it was. But following Wednesday’s ruling by Scotland’s highest civil court that Boris Johnson’s suspension of parliament was unlawful, the feeling was unmistakable. It was optimism. Admittedly, it was optimism in its weakest form: not the confident certainty that all would turn out for the best, but rather a fragile flicker of hope that things might not be so bad after all. Coupled with MPs’ success in both outlawing a no-deal crash-out from the European Union on 31 October and forcing the release of the Yellowhammer papers outlining the government’s own assessment of the calamity such a Brexit would inflict on the country, a hopeful thought took root. Maybe, just maybe, the British constitution was working as the textbooks say it should. Here was an independent judiciary and independent legislature doing their jobs: acting as a restraint on an overmighty executive.
SEP14	Hero or villain? Bercow’s notoriety is a consequence of parliament’s crisis – not its cause	On Monday, only hours before the drama of parliament’s prorogation, John Bercow announced he would retire as Speaker before the next election. Downing Street had declared war on him in the Sunday papers, briefing that it would break convention and seek his removal from his seat at the next election. Instead, Bercow has sought to undercut the government by giving the current parliament, habituated to autonomy and rebellion against the whips, a vote on his successor. Bercow’s ‘constitutional vandalism’ is unlikely to trouble any government with a majority
SEP14	Never mind ‘tax raids’, Labour – just abolish private education	The British class system is an organised racket. It concentrates wealth and power in the hands of the few, while 14 million Britons languish in poverty. If you are dim but have rich parents, a life of comfort, affluence and power is almost inevitable – while the bright but poor are systematically robbed of their potential. The well-to-do are all but guaranteed places at the top table of the media, law, politics, medicine, military, civil service and arts. As inequality grows, so too does the stranglehold of the rich over democracy. The wealthiest 1,000 can double their fortunes in the aftermath of financial calamity, while workers suffer the worst squeeze in wages since the Napoleonic wars. State support is lavished on rich vested interests – such as the banks responsible for Britain’s economic turmoil – but stripped from disabled and low-paid people. The powerful have less stressful lives, and the prosperous are healthier, expecting to live a decade longer than those living in the most deprived areas.
SEP14	Johnson is sure he would win an election. A closer look at the polls says otherwise	In October 1924, British voters went to the polls. It was an unstable time: over the previous two years, as one inconclusive election followed another, the country had got through three prime ministers. This time, however, the result was decisive: Stanley Baldwin won the biggest Conservative landslide in British history. The story will no doubt provide comfort to Boris Johnson as he seeks to win his own snap election. But a Conservative majority in 2019 is by no means guaranteed; Johnson faces many more obstacles than Baldwin. Many observers have focused on the Lib Dems’ impact on the Labour vote. That’s a mistake
SEP14	We have to avoid 'integration' becoming another form of racism	I will never forget the day I joined an English Defence League march in Chelmsford, Essex, in the run-up to the Brexit vote. I went as a journalist, and I wasn’t expecting it to be a comfortable experience. But the most shocking moment was not what I predicted. Instead of threatening me with directly racist slurs, a senior figure at the march told me he wasn’t fussed by my presence. “You’re OK,” he said. “You speak English properly. You know our ways. You’re like us. It’s the others we have a problem with.” By “others”, he meant Muslims – the EDL’s most frequent target – or any other visible minorities he deemed to have made insufficient effort to assimilate into British culture. It struck me as the most chilling and insidious form of racism of all: he was, in effect, saying, “People who come to England are acceptable to the extent they attempt to mimic us.” Underpinning that is a confidence in one culture’s inherent superiority over others. It’s for exactly this reason that it is becoming more widely recognised that assimilationist thinking – the idea that a particular culture is preferable, and that others should therefore adopt it – is a racist ideology. 
SEP14	Justin Welby has apologised for Amritsar. But Britain still won't face the reality of empire	It was a remarkable sight: the archbishop of Canterbury, clad in purple, prostrating himself before the memorial to the Amritsar massacre. And his act of public penitence, on Tuesday, has once again thrust this colonial atrocity into the public limelight, 100 years after it took place. Justin Welby’s heartfelt apology provided a stark contrast to the mealy-mouthed politics that have so far characterised the centenary commemorations. The Amritsar massacre remains one of the most notorious acts of brutality in the history of the British empire. On 13 April 1919, colonial troops under the command of Brigadier General Reginald Dyer opened fire on a large unarmed gathering of Indian civilians at Jallianwala Bagh in order to quell what was incorrectly believed to be an imminent uprising. The shooting lasted 10 minutes, leaving between 500 and 600 people dead and at least three times as many wounded. The massacre permanently alienated most Indian nationalists, including Gandhi, who in 1920 for the first time called for outright independence from Britain. Months after the massacre, CF Andrews, a Christian priest and close friend of Gandhi, helped interview survivors and gather evidence for the independent inquiry into the events. As he described it, “Each act has been in very truth an act of penance, of atonement, an act of reparation for my country.” Nothing could be more damaging to the myth of British exceptionalism than having to publicly apologise for the Raj
SEP15	Against very familiar rivals, Jo Swinson will be the wild card of the election	David Steel once told a Liberal conference to “go away and prepare for government”. They went away and remained in opposition. Vince Cable once said that he could imagine himself becoming prime minister. Which is where that idea stayed: in his imagination. Nick Clegg did take them into government during the coalition years, an experience that ended with the Lib Dems losing all but eight of the 57 MPs they started with five years earlier. So they have had fair warning about the perils of dreaming of breakthroughs. They usually don’t come true. On the rare occasions when they do, the consequences for the party can be terrible. But dream they always will and never more so than now.
SEP15	The games industry shouldn’t be ripping off children	Last week, MPs called on the government to classify online loot boxes as gambling and in the process highlighted a scandal: the $137.9bn (£110bn) gaming industry makes much of its profit by ripping off children. Young people are being nudged, enticed and coerced not only to carry on playing but also paying. Loot boxes – mystery objects in virtual treasure chests that players pay to open – resemble nothing so much as a lottery. Gamers spent $30bn on them worldwide in 2018, a figure that has been predicted to rise to $50bn in the next five years.
SEP15	From India to Britain, every citizen is harmed by anti-migrant hostility	In the Indian state of Assam, the authorities are building detention camps for “illegal immigrants”, most of whom are Indian citizens. In South Africa, hundreds of Nigerian workers have been airlifted home as anti-migrant violence spirals out of control. Two different events in two different countries, but each a glimpse of the malevolent trends transforming politics globally. While neither event has received much attention in Britain, consumed as we are by all things Brexit, both throw light upon developments here, too.
SEP15	The con artist and her mark – the very modern morality tale of Caroline Galloway	For any victim of a scam, the most brutal part is this thought: it could only work because in some way or other, you were asking for it. You had to invite the vampire over the threshold before they could suck you dry. The successful con artist is a true artist, with an instinctive grasp of character that makes the average fiction writer look like an unsophisticated child. The con artist knows all your petty, humiliating wants. Your thirst for unearned wealth. Your hunger for approval. Your terrible pride, which means that, even when your bank account is empty and your hopes are broken, you’ll still swear loyalty to the person who scammed you rather than admit your weakness to the world.
SEP15	Fixing a tattered reputation like Harvey Weinstein’s is dirty work, but pays so well	Odious Harvey Weinstein is, of course, chief villain of the brilliant and deeply satisfying new book, She Said, by the New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey. It details how, in 2017, they finally unmasked the alleged – his trial is pending – serial rapist. Shortly after publication, however, much interest has alighted on another, less familiar figure in this story, who was once as fully committed as Weinstein to silencing and shaming survivors, intimidating reporters and rebuilding his good name: a US lawyer called Lisa Bloom. At the same time as it offers inspiration and guidance to investigative reporters in pursuit of powerful bullies, She Said – with its startling new evidence about Bloom’s involvement – also supplies a priceless introduction, for novices, to the business of reputation management.
SEP15	I left Russia to escape Putin’s assault on reason. Now I fear the UK is on the same path	Nothing is true and everything is possible. That was my one-line attempt to sum up the politics and propaganda that enveloped Russia at the start of the 21st century. It was a world where politicians no longer cared whether they were caught lying; where old ideologies were dead and conspiracy thinking had become the new way to explain the world; where all the old political categories (socialist and liberal, conservative and communist) seemed utterly meaningless and it was unclear what political parties stood for; where warped nostalgia and vague emotive calls to “Raise Russia From Its Knees” had taken over from any rational idea of the future. The same pathologies of public opinion I saw in Putinist Russia are now prevalent here
SEP15	To see how extremism has taken root in Britain just look at Islington North	At the general election in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North, a candidate will stand from a party with a history of supporting IRA atrocities. But it won’t be the Labour party. It will have roots in a conspiracist Leninist sect that denied the existence of the concentration camps in to which “socialist” Serbs herded Bosnian Muslims. But much of the media will be too compromised by past endorsements to expose it as they exposed the Communist party of Britain and the other conspiratorial factions that guide Labour. Its candidate told a critic: “This is such a retarded argument that you are now forever fixed in my mind as a drooling, fuckwitted sack of shit.” But he is not one of the charming Twitter “outriders” for the Labour leadership.
SEP15	As Jesy Nelson revealed, fame is no defence against toxic online attacks	The recent documentary from Little Mix’s Jesy Nelson, Odd One Out, should be placed in a time capsule to show future generations the pain of being a young 21st-century woman dealing with cyberbullying. While social media is a key promotional tool of the pop industry, and fame has a price, this doesn’t excuse the way that Nelson was tortured about her looks and weight. Still, her experience usefully demonstrates how young people – even famous, successful ones – can be tricked into tending their own online misery. There’s nothing original about casual cruelty but these days, it’s turbo-boosted by social media platforms that allow people to unleash darkness, then pop out for a pizza as though nothing has happened. It’s not the spite that’s new – it’s the ease of it, the grotesque lack of accountability.
SEP15	Insights... even the mere sight of a policewoman can lead to a fall in crime rates	Friday brought very grim news, with data from police forces showing that domestic violence-related killings reached a five-year high last year. The victims in the majority of the 173 homicides were women. But what is to be done? The government is promising to return to domestic abuse legislation when parliament returns, and policy discussions often make the link to knife crime, given the number of such murders involving knives.
SEP15	Diageo’s short measures are an insult to Johnnie Walker’s workers	In the wilderness of post-Brexit Britain, ruthlessness and cunning, backed by financial muscle, will prevail. Many good days to bury bad news will dawn and corporate Britain will gather for the feast. In this jungle, there are few beasts more ruthless and cunning than Diageo, one of the biggest drinks manufacturers in the world. In 2012, Diageo ended 192 years of whisky production at its Johnnie Walker bottling facility in Kilmarnock. Until that day, Johnnie strode cheerfully through this town, becoming one of the largest employers in North Ayrshire. He was sustained in turn by generations of skilled and resourceful workers who helped secure Diageo’s position as the most successful drinks company on the planet. No matter. Diageo decided that 700 local jobs and two centuries of dedicated service to its profits margins counted for nothing.
SEP16	Cameron may have fought Brexit. But it was his policies that made it happen	Here he comes, wielding the delayed memoirs that will finally go on sale on Thursday, about to star in the two-part BBC documentary that premieres the same day, and committed to the bare minimum of public appearances. In the midst of such a huge national mess, David Cameron seems to be fulfilling a role that will be familiar to any devotee of country music or TV soap opera: that of the estranged, emotionally constipated husband, who left behind the domestic carnage he created and then hesitantly returned, lost as to what to say but desperate to somehow make amends. The media has a habit of reducing complex and confounding questions about recent history to a single supposedly momentous event or decision, and so it is proving this time. With Tony Blair and his legacy, everything still supposedly centres on Iraq; in Cameron’s case, 95% of the weekend’s headlines were focused on what he now says about the promise, delivery and conduct of the referendum of June 2016. “I should have done more to mix criticisms of the EU with talking about its very real achievements,” he writes, a sentence that is surely a shoo-in for the understatement of the decade. The two big leave campaigns, he says, were “a cauldron of toxicity”. Boris Johnson backed his side – no, really – “to benefit his political career”, and Michael Gove was transformed into “a foam-flecked Faragist”. His anger and contrition, however, don’t encompass the vote itself: putting our membership of the EU to the public, he reaffirms, was “necessary and, I believe, ultimately inevitable”.
SEP16	Why do we cling to the myth of the evil genius? Because the alternative is worse	At the peak of the media’s fascination with Steve Bannon, and before it became clear that his route to the White House was less the application of evil genius and more a question of a peripatetic opportunist striking it lucky, one issue dominated – why does he wear two shirts at the same time? The speculation reached fever pitch towards the end of 2017 when this minor sartorial deviation became yet another marker of his special talents. He had “baffled” DC fashionistas. “There is something hideously irresistible about Bannon,” the Financial Times commented as recently as July. “Is it the blend of a dishevelled public image – he wears two shirts simultaneously and looks as if he cuts his hair with a combine harvester – with scandalising political views?” The only right answer to the question is of course: who cares? He was an unelected official with no accountability but enough power to promote the racial profiling of Muslims via a travel ban which was yanked into the courts by concerned citizens and lawmakers. It didn’t matter what he wore while families were being separated, due process was violated and legal residents were denied entry.
SEP16	There’s nothing normal about this beast of a government	How grimly symbolic of the times in which we live that it is necessary to correct the prime minister on his reference to comic book characters. Only a couple of years ago, Boris Johnson was urging the Tory party conference, in pseudo-Churchillian phrases, to “let the [British] lion roar”. Now, in an interview with the Mail on Sunday, he is invoking more primitive and aggressive imagery. If he fails to get a new Brexit deal with the EU, he will simply ignore the legislation requiring him to seek an article 50 extension: “The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.”
SEP16	Dishing out more drugs won’t stop the pain. Doctors need new tools	Growing concern about the prescription of drugs that cause dependence has been backed up by a recent report from Public Health England (PHE). The agency discovered that in 2017-18, 13% of adults in England received at least one prescription for opioids such as morphine or oxycodone (although this represented a slight downturn in prescribing after a long upward trend). Other drug classes were implicated too, with 25% of adults prescribed one or more of the following drugs: benzodiazepines (such as Valium), z-drugs (sleeping pills such as Zopiclone), gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin, prescribed for neuropathic pain) or antidepressants. The fear is that the UK is following in the footsteps of the US, where overprescribing is said to have led to a full-blown “opioid crisis”. But where does this leave those who live with severe or chronic pain and are dependent on opioids to function day-to-day? GPs, like me, and pain specialists need lots of time and a toolbox of interventions to properly treat those who suffer. But in the current cash- and time-poor environment, is it any wonder that they dole out prescriptions instead?
SEP16	Starting school can be a traumatic experience – for the parents	There is so much to worry about, said Gertrude Stein, you might as well not worry about any of it. But then again she never dropped two children off at school for the first time. Mine started last week and while one was fine, the other stood in the doorway of her new classroom looking tiny and lost and very alarmed and did the thing that, in extremis, parents fear more than tears: no tears. Looking on from the corridor, I felt something lift up and leave my body like the spirits in Ghost. Controlling anxiety is the great labour of our age and one with no discernible end. I try to divide my fears into categories: those with controllable outcomes (there is a mouse in our skirting board), those with no solution but that I consider manageable (why do I persist in buying jeans that are too small when I know I’m too lazy to return them?), and those that form part of a great, amorphous cloud of dread that hovers just over the horizon (where will it end? Why do we live like this? If there is a God, why did He allow Instagram to happen?).
SEP16	Against very familiar rivals, Jo Swinson will be the wild card of the election	David Steel once told a Liberal conference to “go away and prepare for government”.

But dream they always will and never more so than now.
SEP16	The games industry shouldn’t be ripping off children	Last week, MPs called on the government to classify online loot boxes as gambling and in the process highlighted a scandal: the $137.9bn (£110bn) gaming industry makes much of its profit by ripping off children. Young people are being nudged, enticed and coerced not only to carry on playing but also paying. Loot boxes – mystery objects in virtual treasure chests that players pay to open – resemble nothing so much as a lottery. Gamers spent $30bn on them worldwide in 2018, a figure that has been predicted to rise to $50bn in the next five years.
SEP16	Age should be no barrier to high office. Worn-out ideas are another matter	Which country has the oldest leader? Officially it is Malaysia, whose current president, Mahathir Mohamad, weighs in at an impressive 94 years. Yet the unassailable winner of this contest is North Korea, because although the nation’s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, is a mere youth of 35, his father, Kim Il-sung (who inconveniently died in 1994), still holds the title “Eternal Leader”, making North Korea the world’s only necrocracy. The age of national leaders, or candidates for high office, has never been automatically regarded as an issue for concern. When Winston Churchill became prime minister for the last time in 1951, he was 76. Nelson Mandela was 75 in 1994 when he became South Africa’s first democratically elected president. His unique moral authority and the historic drama of the moment meant that few people fretted about his age.

SEP17	Swinson’s remain extremism has given Labour a golden opportunity	Brexit is the disrupter that breaks things and shape-shifts as it scythes through the political life of the nation. Look at its unexpected landing zone this week after the Liberal Democrat conference. The Tories and the Lib Dems have adopted two startlingly extreme positions – Boris Johnson heading for no deal, damn the consequences, versus Jo Swinson’s revoke now, to hell with the will of the people. Both stands are alarming: one ignoring the economic fate of the nation, the other risking riots over the denial of democracy. Suddenly Labour is the moderate, thoughtful one: only another referendum has the authority to abandon or confirm the decision of the first, after three years of hellish impasse. If Swinson was trying to position the Lib Dems midway between the extremes of Hulk Johnson and Corbynism, her revoke blunder takes her party out on another distant limb. Her abrasive rejection of ever working with Jeremy Corbyn is another error: her better role should be as enabler, bringer together a progressive alliance. Caroline Lucas does that tone well.
SEP17	The world ignored the warning signs – and now the Middle East is on the brink	Like a furious maelstrom, roiled by opposing currents, the crisis in the Gulf gains in intensity and destructive power almost by the day. On Sunday, Donald Trump said the US was “locked and loaded”, ready to respond to attacks on an oil facility in Saudi Arabia, in which it believes Iran was involved. But warning bells, akin to those used to alert fog-bound mariners steering towards rocks, have been ringing out for months. They have mostly been ignored. The daunting bill for multiple acts of political insouciance, measured in lives and petrodollars, is now coming due. Trump is even trying to sell the Saudis nuclear technology. What would you think, were you in Iran’s shoes?
SEP17	Inheritance tax would be scrapped by the Brexit party – good news for the very rich	There are bad ideas, really bad ideas, and there’s abolishing inheritance tax. This is the new top priority announced by the Brexit party – one of only two policies it has beyond Brexit. Scrapping inheritance tax is a very expensive pledge: it raised £5.3bn for the Treasury last year. And it’s particularly expensive when there’s a political consensus that we need to spend more – earlier this month a Conservative government set out proposals to increase the size of the state, at the price of binning their fiscal rules.
SEP17	Cameron may have fought Brexit. But it was his policies that made it happen	Here he comes, wielding the delayed memoirs that will finally go on sale on Thursday, about to star in the two-part BBC documentary that premieres the same day, and committed to the bare minimum of public appearances.

SEP17	Labour cannot out-remain the Lib Dems. Thankfully, it doesn’t need to	The Liberal Democrats, at their Bournemouth conference this week, are in triumphant mood. This year has witnessed the strange rebirth of the party as the champions of remain. And its latest commitment, to revoke article 50 without a further referendum, is a naked attempt to outflank Labour among highly motivated remainers. The Lib Dems have become the standard bearers for a form of elite politics where commitment to Britain’s membership of the EU eclipses all other matters. This affliction is also found in parts of the Labour party, where many self-identifying “moderates” have seized upon Brexit in the absence of locating anything else to believe in. No matter that ordinary voters have a much wider set of concerns about their lives, from wages to public services to climate change.
SEP17	Johnson’s cynical ‘tough on crime’ talk shows the depth of his incivility	The thesis that Boris Johnson is a liberal in Tory clothing is shot to ribbons. His latest proposals on crime, leaked by a “Whitehall source”, are a shameless lurch to the wilder shores of rightwing populism. In next month’s Queen’s speech, he will apparently “get tough” on crime by increasing the severity of sentences. He wants “life to mean life” for child murderers, together with more prison places, simpler stop-and-search and less early release. His source says “most people think all parties and the courts have lost the plot on sentencing”. Johnson will act “aggressively”. The source – we assume Dominic Cummings or a minion – offers no authority for “most people”. It also turns out that the proposed changes are almost all within the competence of the existing judicial system – and are in reality all for show. There is no call for them from within or outside the prisons. The worsening of prison violence and mental health, and the 70% recidivism rate among young offenders within a year, is glaringly due to austerity cuts since 2010. As the chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Tom Winsor, has written, reacting to Johnson’s proposals, “the cost [of crime] in treasure, blood and human suffering” is caused by the failure of prevention, not the laxity of punishment. We must ask if the new draconianism is approved by Michael Gove, who as justice secretary in 2016 called for a drastic cut in the prison population?
SEP17	Why do we cling to the myth of the evil genius? Because the alternative is worse	At the peak of the media’s fascination with Steve Bannon, and before it became clear that his route to the White House was less the application of evil genius and more a question of a peripatetic opportunist striking it lucky, one issue dominated – why does he wear two shirts at the same time?

SEP17	Norway is in denial about the threat of far-right violence	“Never again,” Norwegian politicians pledged, after the terrorist attacks perpetrated by rightwing extremist Anders Breivik on July 22 2011, the worst in the nation’s history. Yet just last month, an armed 21-year-old Norwegian, Philip Manshaus, stormed into a mosque in Bærum outside Oslo and opened fire, his actions inspired apparently by Breivik as well as recent terror incidents in New Zealand and El Paso. Norway is generally portrayed in the international media as a haven of peace, prosperity, happiness and equality. So why has it produced so much violent rightwing extremism in the past decade?
SEP17	There’s nothing normal about this beast of a government	How grimly symbolic of the times in which we live that it is necessary to correct the prime minister on his reference to comic book characters. Only a couple of years ago, Boris Johnson was urging the Tory party conference, in pseudo-Churchillian phrases, to “let the [British] lion roar”.

But in the current cash- and time-poor environment, is it any wonder that they dole out prescriptions instead?
SEP18	Only Labour will give the people a final say on Brexit	Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are threatening to drive our country over a no-deal cliff edge in six weeks’ time. He has no mandate for that and is opposed by a majority of the public. Since he became prime minister in July, Johnson has been defeated on every vote he has put to parliament. Now his undemocratic manoeuvrings and his decision to close down parliament and avoid accountability are being challenged in the supreme court. Johnson’s visit to Luxembourg on Monday was a further humiliation. The prime minister went to Europe with no plan and no proposals, and did his best to hide from scrutiny while he was there. Three years ago Johnson backed Brexit because he thought it would boost his political career – writing one article in favour of remain and another backing leave. Now he’s backing no deal because he thinks it’s politically expedient – to win back votes from the Brexit party and keep his Tory Brexit ultras on board. At the same time he needs to look like he’s trying for a deal to hold his cabinet and parliamentary party together.
SEP18	Britons in Europe are being hung out to dry. In Luxembourg, they found their voice	If it was meant to highlight Boris Johnson’s tendency to flee the consequences of his actions, then the trick almost worked. The Luxembourg prime minister’s decision to face the press with an empty podium where his British counterpart should have been, rather than let him move their press conference away from noisy protesters, has delivered the diplomatic burn that Xavier Bettel presumably intended. But in truth, it won’t change anyone’s mind.
SEP18	Pitting climate justice against remain won’t make Brexit go away for Labour	Atmospherically speaking, Brexit will certainly dominate Labour’s conference, as it has for the Liberal Democrats, and will for the Tories. All the conversations outside the hall, in fringe meetings, on beaches, in pubs, either side of the karaoke (activists love microphones, no one knows why) will revolve around it. The “Love Corbyn, Hate Brexit” tote bags will have been updated. “Remain, Reform, Revolt” on one side, and – optimistically – “Labour can stop Brexit” on the other; there will be no shortage of views as to how. Labour is, with or without Jo Swinson’s missteps, plainly the party of remain: in its membership and its voters; in its stated policy of backing a second referendum; in most of its MPs and the bulk of its shadow cabinet; in its visceral reaction to Boris Johnson and his crash-and-burn fantasies. Yet the leadership is still clinging to the dated electoral calculation that it can only win if they pick up votes from both leavers and remainers, and the idea that it is possible, if you’re clever enough, to simultaneously support both outcomes.
SEP18	White, male and middle class: why Britain’s political parties must change	Regardless of the recent endless political convulsions and intrigue, one thing is certain: party conference season is going ahead as usual. Whether that’s a cause for celebration among the MPs and journalists schlepping to events in Bournemouth, Brighton, Manchester, Newport and Aberdeen in quick succession remains to be seen.
SEP18	For Palestinians, Israel’s elections promise nothing but defeat	When Boris Johnson announced his plan to suspend parliament, I was visiting Orkney with my wife, Penny. It was the last week of a month-long stay in Scotland, and it took a day for the news to reach us. We were having tea with some English friends on 29 August when they heard what had happened. They began to fume: he’s done it again. They worried how this would undermine their country’s democracy. It was a curious twist: I am usually the one bearing bad news about the state of my country. For a brief moment, we traded anxieties – although mine were of a more existential nature. Even in Scotland, the bad news from home was constant: the expansion of Israeli settlements, the threat of annexation, and the steady tally of death and injury in Gaza, all eating away at what remained of my Palestine. A few days later, just after Johnson had expelled 21 MPs from his party, we flew home. The driver who picked us up from the airport took the usual circuitous route to get us to Ramallah, crossing three checkpoints on the way. At each one, we held our breath and hoped the soldiers were not in a bad mood. As always I felt the shock of returning home, seeing our parched hills at the end of summer and my noisy, crowded city; I had a sudden and pervasive sense of precariousness.
SEP18	Swinson’s remain extremism has given Labour a golden opportunity	Brexit is the disrupter that breaks things and shape-shifts as it scythes through the political life of the nation.

SEP18	The beauty of a Green New Deal is that it would pay for itself	In September 2007, as credit was “crunched” and the financial crisis began to unfold, a group of economists and environmentalists, including the future Green party MP Caroline Lucas, met regularly in my small London flat. Supping on comfort food and wine, we argued furiously while drafting a plan we hoped would transform the economy and protect the ecosystem. We called it the Green New Deal. Little did we know that the ideas we seeded then would be adopted by a shooting star of the Democratic party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as part of her bid for a New York congressional seat in 2018. Fast forward to 2019 and the Green New Deal is now at the centre of the 2020 US presidential campaign. Bernie Sanders last week declared the climate crisis a national emergency and launched his version of the deal – a $16.3 trillion plan that includes massive investment in renewable energy, green infrastructure for climate resilience and money for research.
SEP18	The world ignored the warning signs – and now the Middle East is on the brink	Like a furious maelstrom, roiled by opposing currents, the crisis in the Gulf gains in intensity and destructive power almost by the day. On Sunday, Donald Trump said the US was “locked and loaded”, ready to respond to attacks on an oil facility in Saudi Arabia, in which it believes Iran was involved. But warning bells, akin to those used to alert fog-bound mariners steering towards rocks, have been ringing out for months. They have mostly been ignored. The daunting bill for multiple acts of political insouciance, measured in lives and petrodollars, is now coming due. Trump is even trying to sell the Saudis nuclear technology. What would you think, were you in Iran’s shoes?
SEP18	Inheritance tax would be scrapped by the Brexit party – good news for the very rich	There are bad ideas, really bad ideas, and there’s abolishing inheritance tax. This is the new top priority announced by the Brexit party – one of only two policies it has beyond Brexit. Scrapping inheritance tax is a very expensive pledge: it raised £5.3bn for the Treasury last year. And it’s particularly expensive when there’s a political consensus that we need to spend more – earlier this month a Conservative government set out proposals to increase the size of the state, at the price of binning their fiscal rules.
SEP19	Will Corbyn’s Brexit referendum strategy work? Our panel responds	Neutral! In mid-national crisis how does a party campaign on the great issue of our time with a leader who won’t say where he stands? Everything about the idea is preposterous. What do canvassers say on the doorstep? We’re a bit split and our leader refuses to say. Jeremy Corbyn in today’s Guardian accuses Boris Johnson of backing no deal simply because it’s politically expedient. But Corbyn’s fence-sitting is no different. No one expects straight-dealing from Johnson: double-dealing is priced in. But it’s dangerous for Corbyn to flaunt callow political calculation. Honesty is his USP. What else was he doing all those wilderness back-bench years voting against his own government 500 times, if not standing up for unpopular principle? He was always a leaver, remain voters will assume, while leavers will not be convinced either by his umpire’s disguise.
SEP19	If the world ran on sun, it wouldn’t fight over oil	We are sadly accustomed by now to the idea that our reliance on oil and gas causes random but predictable outbreaks of flood, firestorm and drought. The weekend’s news from the Gulf is a grim reminder that depending on oil leads inevitably to war too. Depending on how far back you want to stand, the possibility of war with Iran stems from a calculated decision by Tehran or its Houthi allies to use drones and missiles on Saudi installations, or on the infantile rage that drove President Trump to tear up a meticulously worked out and globally sponsored accord with Iran and to wreck its economy. But in either case, if you really take in the whole picture, the image is rendered in crude, black tones: were it not for oil, none of this would be happening.
SEP19	Our quiet county has nothing against McDonald’s. But we prefer our own burgers	Rutland is a funny place. When I moved back here five years ago and told my London friends where I was going, the response was mostly: “Where?” A mere 18 miles at its longest point, it is England’s smallest county. Our motto is multum in parvo, meaning much in little. Things we have little of are speed cameras, a functioning mobile phone signal, change and McDonald’s: we are the only county in England not to host a branch. Or we were, because Ronald’s corporate gaze has finally swivelled in our direction. The company has expressed a desire to set us on a par with all other counties, submitting a planning application to build a “freestanding restaurant with drive-thru facility” on a patch of empty ground just outside Oakham, the county town. This has ignited fires of rebellion in an area not known for hostility – even our castle isn’t a proper one. There hasn’t been a battle here since Empingham, in 1470, unless you count some unpleasantness over our temporary loss of independence to neighbouring Leicestershire, and we won that one too.
SEP19	Whatever Iran’s role in the Saudi attack, the regional status quo is unsustainable	Saturday’s attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities at Abqaiq represent a potential tipping point in regional and international relations. Although many questions remain, and Iran has officially denied responsibility, the likelihood of its involvement at some level is high. Regardless of the precise details, there is already a range of serious geopolitical implications to consider. If Tehran is responsible, this clearly demonstrates that Iran’s asymmetric military capabilities can pose a serious threat to the strategic interests of the west and its partners in the region. Oil-supply vulnerabilities are no longer limited to the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for exports and a repeated flashpoint over the years. After all, with this strike on a land-based facility, Saudi oil production reportedly dropped by about 50%. 
SEP19	How a parent’s bid to save their school exposes the rotten core of our democracy	Some defenders of democracy tog themselves up in suits, joust over case law and star on the teatime news. Others raise two boys single-handedly in a market town in Essex, carry a smartphone with a perma-cracked screen, and do their best work in the dead of the night when the kids have gone to bed and there’s finally a bit of peace and quiet. Like Shaunagh Roberts. Roberts doesn’t hang out in courtrooms and can’t quote Latin, yet her battle shines as bright a light on our corroded politics as any case in the supreme court. I’ve been writing about it in these pages for over a year: how she and an entire community are fighting this government and one of its central dogmas to save their local school. And now we can exclusively reveal that in the past few days, Roberts has forced the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, into a historic climbdown. Her victory is to be celebrated, even while it raises other profound questions about what kind of democracy we live in.
SEP19	Suddenly, it’s OK to be German and to talk about race	When I was growing up there was no racism in Germany. In the 1980s every child learned at school that race was a construct that fascists had used to justify segregating and killing people. So if race didn’t exist, it naturally followed that racism didn’t exist either. If you wanted to talk about it people looked at you as if you were the Nazi. All this is changing. It is dizzying to watch my motherland grapple with the concept of race. And, to be honest, to grapple with it myself because when you stop speaking about something you stop thinking about it eventually too. So we’re all walking on eggshells; the discussion about racism is on the agenda but we’re whispering “race” as if it were a dirty word. Except for members of Alternative für Deutschland, the far-right party, who keep pushing the boundaries of what you can and can’t say, and at every opportunity tout their worries about “other races” outbreeding white Germans. Germans of colour, meanwhile, worry about the AfD’s success in winning a quarter of the votes in recent state elections in Saxony and Brandenburg.
SEP19	The NHS saved Mum - but I saw a system on life support	A week ago the NHS saved my mum’s life. She had been prescribed some new blood pressure medication which caused her sodium levels to plummet dangerously. Clinicians in A&E ran blood tests, identified the problem and treated it, restoring the balance of minerals so that her sodium was once again coexisting in harmony with her potassium and the various other things floating around in the blood that we take for granted until something goes wrong with them. The staff were, without exception, kind, competent and respectful. So what’s the problem? My mum is the perfect case study for just how good the NHS is at saving lives and looking after older people. But the bits in between, the cement that glues the bricks, is crumbling into dust. And like the climate crisis this erosion is speeding up with disastrous consequences.
SEP19	Britons in Europe are being hung out to dry. In Luxembourg, they found their voice	If it was meant to highlight Boris Johnson’s tendency to flee the consequences of his actions, then the trick almost worked. The Luxembourg prime minister’s decision to face the press with an empty podium where his British counterpart should have been, rather than let him move their press conference away from noisy protesters, has delivered the diplomatic burn that Xavier Bettel presumably intended. But in truth, it won’t change anyone’s mind.
SEP19	Pitting climate justice against remain won’t make Brexit go away for Labour	Atmospherically speaking, Brexit will certainly dominate Labour’s conference, as it has for the Liberal Democrats, and will for the Tories. All the conversations outside the hall, in fringe meetings, on beaches, in pubs, either side of the karaoke (activists love microphones, no one knows why) will revolve around it. The “Love Corbyn, Hate Brexit” tote bags will have been updated. “Remain, Reform, Revolt” on one side, and – optimistically – “Labour can stop Brexit” on the other; there will be no shortage of views as to how. Labour is, with or without Jo Swinson’s missteps, plainly the party of remain: in its membership and its voters; in its stated policy of backing a second referendum; in most of its MPs and the bulk of its shadow cabinet; in its visceral reaction to Boris Johnson and his crash-and-burn fantasies. Yet the leadership is still clinging to the dated electoral calculation that it can only win if they pick up votes from both leavers and remainers, and the idea that it is possible, if you’re clever enough, to simultaneously support both outcomes.
SEP19	White, male and middle class: why Britain’s political parties must change	Regardless of the recent endless political convulsions and intrigue, one thing is certain: party conference season is going ahead as usual. Whether that’s a cause for celebration among the MPs and journalists schlepping to events in Bournemouth, Brighton, Manchester, Newport and Aberdeen in quick succession remains to be seen.
SEP20	The Tories are learning that Boris Johnson is electoral Marmite	Life is just too short, Siobhan McArdle said, to be a chief executive in the NHS right now. In an unusually blunt resignation letter earlier this month, the outgoing leader of the troubled South Tees hospitals foundation trust said her hospitals had delivered millions in so-called “efficiency savings”, but now the cupboard was bare. The trust had already been severely criticised by regulators for a bed shortage that was hurting patients; it couldn’t, she suggested, keep cutting without care suffering. It’s rare for a hospital boss to throw in the towel so publicly, but many in the NHS will understand where she was coming from. The number of patients waiting for NHS surgery is now at its highest since records began in 2007. One in 11 NHS posts are lying vacant as staff quit and aren’t replaced. If we didn’t have a winter crisis last year, or not in the classic sense of patients piling up in corridors, that’s arguably because what was once an acute seasonal shortage of beds has become a chronic one rumbling all year long. For months all this has rather puzzlingly failed to get much political traction. But now, thanks to the father of a very sick baby girl, it has.
SEP20	There’s a side to Eton that you won’t read about in David Cameron’s memoirs	David Cameron publishes his memoirs today, in which he looks back on his time at Eton college; and back on the drug use that, had he been from a different background, might have landed him in jail. Eton is proud of its political leaders. This can be seen from the fact that, in one of its most famous rooms, you can find the bust of every student who has gone on to become prime minister. Eton must ask itself, though, whether it is proud of the kind of leader that it is producing. It must also ponder why, if it truly sees itself as a school of leadership, there are more and more people who regard it and similar institutions as utterly unfit for purpose. A few weeks ago, like thousands of other people, I shared a photo of Jacob Rees-Mogg on social media. The photo, an image of him reclining in the House of Commons as he listened to his furious opponent in a debate about Brexit, seemed to be the very image of entitlement. At a time when the country’s economy and social fabric were under unusual strain, there was Rees-Mogg, apparently revelling in the bedlam.
SEP20	For the sake of life on Earth, we must put a limit on wealth	It is not quite true that behind every great fortune lies a great crime. Musicians and novelists, for example, can become extremely rich by giving other people pleasure. But it does appear to be universally true that in front of every great fortune lies a great crime. Immense wealth translates automatically into immense environmental impacts, regardless of the intentions of those who possess it. The very wealthy, almost as a matter of definition, are committing ecocide. A few weeks ago, I received a letter from a worker at a British private airport. “I see things that really shouldn’t be happening in 2019,” he wrote. Every day he sees Global 7000 jets, Gulfstream G650s and even Boeing 737s take off from the airport carrying a single passenger, mostly flying to Russia and the US. The private Boeing 737s, built to take 174 passengers, are filled at the airport with around 25,000 litres of fuel. That’s as much fossil energy as a small African town might use in a year.
SEP20	Thousands of rape victims are being denied justice. The CPS and police must do better	Crime statistics can often be lacklustre and impenetrable, but in recent weeks they have painted a vivid and shocking picture of how our criminal justice system is letting down rape victims at every stage. Today’s new figures, published by the Guardian – which show that thousands of rape allegations have been recorded inaccurately by the police over the last four years – are only the latest evidence that there are serious inconsistencies in how different police forces are handling rape allegations. If reports of rape are being filtered out before any real investigation has taken place, this not only raises huge concerns about how victims are being treated, but increases the risk that rapists are going unpunished, free to rape again. The latest figures from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), published last week, show that despite a significant increase in the number of rapes being reported each year, there has been a terrifying drop in the number of alleged perpetrators being prosecuted. This situation is prompting victims’ groups to argue that rape is being effectively decriminalised by the very people upon whom victims rely to enforce the law, because so few cases are actually taken to court. This year, from 58,657 reports of rape, only 1,758 accused perpetrators were even charged with an offence, let alone convicted, which raises the question of what on earth the criminal justice agencies are doing.
SEP20	The climate crisis isn’t just causing extreme weather. It’s fuelling extreme politics, too	In the past three weeks, we took the pulse of citizens in eight countries in the Americas and western Europe whose governments will prove critically important to global efforts to tackle the climate emergency. Our findings were unambiguous – tackling climate breakdown was deemed the most important priority for government, ahead of terrorism, the economy and migration. In all the countries except the US, the majority of those surveyed said that the climate emergency was the number one issue, and that governments had to do more.
SEP20	Poland wants its citizens to leave the UK. It should support those who call it home	In common with European countries – and increasingly the UK itself – Poland does not know quite what to make of Brexit. This is evident in the Polish ambassador Arkady Rzegocki’s letter to his compatriots on Tuesday, which reveals a conflict between the consular duty of care for Polish citizens amid the uncertainties of the protracted Brexit process and the political ambition of the Polish government to tempt back some of the 900,000 Poles who have migrated to the UK.
SEP20	There is no longer any justification for private schools in Britain	A few years back, I finished a PhD on how to tackle Britain’s unequal life chances – which, among other measures, included abolishing private schools. Dusty academia seemed the home for this sort of proposal, one that has long filled endless papers but never quite makes it off the page and into reality. That is no longer the case. In a few days, the Labour party will debate the future of private schools. The grassroots group Labour Against Private Schools (Laps) will bring a motion to the annual party conference in Brighton calling for the full integration of state and private schools, including nationalising the endowments of the hugely wealthy public schools. It has support from six constituency parties so far and the backing of senior party figures, with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, putting his weight behind the motion this week. A leaked memo to the Telegraph last week noted that the party is already considering making a manifesto pledge to remove tax breaks from the sector – while leaving the door open to getting rid of the schools altogether.
SEP20	Unbelievable – at last, a rape drama that gives victims a voice	When Cersei Lannister was raped by her brother, Jaime, next to the corpse of their dead son in the fourth season of Game of Thrones, even longstanding viewers inured to the scenes of sexual violence in the series found cause for concern. In the book, by George RR Martin, the scene had been consensual, but in the dramatised version a weeping Cersei says no and tries to push her brother off. The episode’s director, Alex Graves, shrugged off criticism. When asked if the scene constituted rape, he said, “Yes and no … There are moments where she gives in, and moments where she pushes him away.” It’s typical of the attitude often taken by film-makers that, if it serves the plot (in this case, to remind us of Jaime’s ruthless streak), then sexual violence is justifiable.
SEP20	Will Corbyn’s Brexit referendum strategy work? Our panel responds	Neutral! In mid-national crisis how does a party campaign on the great issue of our time with a leader who won’t say where he stands? Everything about the idea is preposterous. What do canvassers say on the doorstep? We’re a bit split and our leader refuses to say.

SEP20	This election should be about much more than just Brexit	The Brexit debacle is an obnoxious man following you everywhere, clashing cymbals that drown out anything you say or think. Don’t try to speak louder: he’ll just clash them harder. But if a “Brexit election” is upon us – one entirely and narrowly framed by Britain’s relationship with the European Union – then our current turmoil is merely the appetiser for much worse to come. That is the plan of Boris Johnson’s unelected co-prime minister, Dominic Cummings: sweep up the Brexit party vote, drown out a Labour domestic agenda that proved popular in 2017, and fragment the anti-Tory vote with the willing assistance of the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson. There are those who treat the Brexit crisis as though it has landed from a clear blue sky: many were jelly-kneed at the admirable 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, claiming that it represented, as former New Labour spin-doctor Alastair Campbell put it, a Britain that was “modern, vibrant, dynamic, outward-looking, multicultural, confident, welcoming, successful, united”. It was no such thing: the Tory/Lib Dem government was busy offloading the costs of a crash caused by big finance on to the backs of those who had nothing to do with it: slashing and privatising services, scapegoating migrants – two months before Windrush Britons were valorised in the thanksgiving ceremony, the “hostile environment” immigration policy had been introduced – and ravaging the welfare state. But the Brexit result produced one consensus: that it could not be understood without examining what Theresa May termed “the burning injustices”.
SEP21	Climate change is morally wrong. It is time for a carbon abolition movement	Human-induced climate change is a moral wrong. It involves one group of humans harming others. People of this generation harming those in future generations. People in the developed world harming those in the developing world. Each of us is emitting carbon that is harming those caught in climate-driven superstorms, floods, droughts and conflicts. And there’s the greatest moral wrong of all – the mass extinction event we have triggered that harms all life on Earth. Yet until recently, climate change has not been argued as a moral issue. Rather, it has been presented as a technocratic problem, a cost-benefit problem, where the costs of action must be weighed against the benefits of avoiding disaster. The debates have been around taxes, jobs, growth and technologies. While such debates are important – there are better and worse ways to tackle the climate crisis – the effect has been decades of inaction, denial and delay. When something is a moral wrong, particularly a deep, systemic moral wrong, we don’t wait around debating the optimal path or policy; we stop it.
SEP21	I’m a young climate striker – and here’s why Labour must adopt a Green New Deal	For the first time in my life, climate breakdown is high up on the UK’s political agenda. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the Amazon fires and the hottest day on record in the UK have meant we can no longer ignore the fate of the planet we live on. But there’s another reason we’re talking about the climate crisis. For the past six months, young people like myself have taken to the streets month after month, calling for urgent climate action and demanding an internationalist Green New Deal – an immediate change to the cataclysmic system that created, enabled and perpetuates the climate crisis.
SEP21	Boris Johnson has to deliver a Brexit deal. And now he may be on track to do it	The good ship Brexit surges forward, jagged rocks and whirlpools on all sides. Non-papers are on the table. The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, says: “We can have a deal.” The French and the Finns have given Boris Johnson until the end of the month to show “if his deal exists”. He wants to wait until after the Tory conference in two weeks, or even until the EU summit in four. What on earth is going on? I still believe Johnson is on track to pull off a coup. He has an obvious problem, but with an obvious solution. Earlier this year he promised to leave the EU by 31 October “do or die … no ifs or buts”. This pledge was for no other purpose but to win the Tory leadership. It worked. Given his reputation as a liar, he really has no alternative but to deliver. Yet he needs help from Brussels. Otherwise he must endure the humiliation of a further Brexit delay.
SEP21	No We Can’t? How liberal pessimism could return Trump to the White House	Elizabeth Warren was in New York this week, on the stump in front of large crowds in Washington Square Park. The contender for the Democratic party presidential nomination talked about corruption in the White House and the need for sweeping, dramatic change; she repeated her proposal, if elected, to impose a 2% tax on the country’s highest earners and she namechecked an early-20th-century labour movement spearheaded by women. After the rally, people stood in line for an hour to take photos with her. All of which invited only one possible response: I think Donald Trump’s going to win. Electoral pessimism on the left in the United States is a finely balanced game that, depending on your view, acts either as a check to complacency or a self-defeating hedge that guarantees the very result it’s seeking to avoid. For many, predicting a second term for Trump goes back to the experience of watching George W Bush win a second election when John Kerry was a strong favourite. Hope is all well and good, but what about superstition?
SEP21	Today’s sex workers, like their Victorian sisters, don’t want ‘saving’	On Tuesday, Sheffield council’s licensing committee voted to renew the licence of the Spearmint Rhino lap-dancing club until next April. Lap-dancing clubs in the UK are legally required to reapply for their licence, and the city’s Spearmint Rhino has been successful in doing so every year since it opened in 2003. But this year, what is usually a routine procedure became a lightning rod for highly charged debates around sex work and feminism. Over the past 12 months, the Spearmint Rhino has been the target of a coalition of feminist groups who have campaigned against its licence being renewed, on the grounds that strip clubs sexually objectify women and act as a prostitution grooming ground for vulnerable young women. 
SEP21	The west’s self-proclaimed custodians of democracy failed to notice it rotting away	Anglo-American lamentations about the state of democracy have been especially loud ever since Boris Johnson joined Donald Trump in the leadership of the free world. For a very long time, Britain and the United States styled themselves as the custodians and promoters of democracy globally, fighting a great moral battle against its foreign enemies. From the cold war through to the “war on terror”, the Caesarism that afflicted other nations was seen as peculiar to Asian and African peoples, or blamed on the despotic traditions of Russians or Chinese, on African tribalism, Islam, or the “Arab mind”. But this analysis – amplified in a thousand books and opinion columns that located the enemies of democracy among menacingly alien people and their inferior cultures – did not prepare its audience for the sight of blond bullies perched atop the world’s greatest democracies. The barbarians, it turns out, were never at the gate; they have been ruling us for some time.
SEP21	It’s taken years, but at last there’s real hope for meaningful climate action	It’s been more than 10 years in the making, and is the top demand of the youth strikers gathering on Friday for the UK’s largest ever climate protest – which is why Friday is also the first attempt in Britain to put legislation in place to make a Green New Deal a reality for our country. Working with the Labour MP Clive Lewis, I am launching the full version of a Green New Deal bill (formal title, the decarbonisation and economic strategy bill), which sets out a transformative programme driven by the principles of justice and equity. It aims to move our economy away from its harmful dependence on carbon, at the scale and speed demanded by the science, and to build a society that lives within its ecological limits while reversing social and economic inequality. Our country needs investment and a worker-led just transition. Too many areas have been all but abandoned by Westminster over the past 30 years: industries shut down with nothing to replace the jobs lost; people ignored and disempowered. I’m struck by the opportunities our country is missing, compared with the bold action taken by others. In Spain, for example, the closure of the coalmines comes with a £221m investment package, agreed with the unions, which includes environmental restoration of mining areas and reskilling of miners for green industries. UK workers want to be part of the sustainability revolution and we are denying them the chance.
SEP21	Facial recognition technology threatens to end all individual privacy	The pernicious growth of the surveillance state continues with the imminent rollout of live facial recognition cameras across Britain. That is why this week I signed a statement, alongside a cross-party group of MPs, experts and civil liberties campaigners, calling for a halt to facial recognition trials to give parliament the chance to debate it properly. There is a point at which crime-fighting measures cease to challenge the guilty and become a threat to the innocent. That point has come with unfettered facial recognition. Over the past few years six forces, including the Metropolitan police, have trialled facial recognition, with spectacularly poor results. After surveilling hundreds of thousands of people, the Met has made  a mere handful of arrests using this technology in the past four years. Indeed, 81% of the “suspects” caught by the cameras were simply innocent bystanders not on the police’s watchlists. Two of the trials even had an error rate of 100%.
SEP21	It’s no surprise a woman was the first to swim the Channel four times	On Tuesday morning, 37-year-old Sarah Thomas from Colorado, US, became the first person to swim the Channel four times without stopping. In just over 54 hours of swimming, and 130 miles, she redefined what an endurance athlete could be for a generation: until this week, only four swimmers had ever managed to make the journey three times without stopping.At an age when most of us are thinking about how little exercise we can get away with, and only a year after going into remission from breast cancer, she completed the feat with minimal fuss, emerging to a treat of champagne and M&M’s, with the comment, “I’m pretty tired right now.” Rather more tartly, her mother called her “a freak of nature”. But those of us who follow outdoor swimming will understand that it isn’t actually that surprising that it was a woman who accomplished something so dramatic. Because women have been quietly dominating outdoor endurance swimming for some time now. A combination of obvious and not-so obvious factors currently means that across average times of male and female Channel crossings, the average female time is faster than men’s.
SEP21	The polling industry doesn’t measure public opinion – it produces it	The polls keep coming, one after another. But the polls are all over the place. For example, they can’t agree on where the competing parties stand. One gives the Tories a 10-point lead, another gives Labour a 2% lead. Polling has never been an exact science, but political volatility, the growth of new polling firms and the extraordinary ubiquity of conflicting polls, has put it under new strains and new scrutiny. Polling was once a specialised sector of market research. Now it is a niche area of the much bigger data industry, using the same Bayesian techniques of probabilistic analysis that stock markets employ in financial forecasting. Its customers include huge financial firms that can extract commercial advantage from the slightest margin of predictive accuracy.
SEP22	For authoritarians, stifling the arts is of a piece with demonising minorities	Early this month, Brazil’s leading literary event, the Bienal do Livro Rio, found itself at the centre of the country’s culture wars when a comic book was ordered to be confiscated by the authorities. The book in question was Avengers: The Children’s Crusade, which in one scene showed two fully-clothed men kissing. The gay kiss so upset Rio’s mayor, Marcelo Crivella, who once called homosexuality “a terrible evil”, that he ordered the book to be removed by police in order “to protect children”. Crivella, a former bishop, belongs to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, which is known for its statements that homosexuals and bisexuals are possessed by a female devil. Crivella has also argued that Hindus hold “unclean spirits” and Catholics are “demonic”. The evangelical organisation has hundreds of branches and is one of the major forces behind the electoral success of the country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. The church’s founder, the billionaire Edir Macedo, by far Brazil’s richest pastor, according to Forbes magazine, claims that “prostitutes, homosexuals and bisexuals are always possessed by pombagiras”, Afro-Brazilian spirits associated with witchcraft.
SEP22	Baby Anoush offers a modish twist to past experiments in childrearing	Regardless of their reasoning, the very ambition of the gender-neutral experiment embarked upon by parents Hobbit Humphrey and Jake England-Johns surely deserves some sort of recognition. As they have explained in a much-studied BBC interview, the parents of an adorable 17-month-old called Anoush have already taken gender neutrality far beyond anything usually practised by enlightened carers and educators. Where less enterprising parents have rested their gender-neutral/-free hopes in, for instance, the liberating avoidance of stereotypical toys and clothing, and of traditionally girl/boy activities and endearments, England-Johns and Humphrey not only shun sex-identifying pronouns on behalf of their infant, but conceal his or her biological sex from family members.
SEP22	The Queen above politics? Not when Cameron and Johnson come calling	The Queen is a sham head of state. She cannot act as a constitutional president and force rival politicians to look for ways out of a national emergency. She cannot insist that the prime minister obeys the rules, because there are too few rules in Britain and too many woozy, unenforceable conventions. Elizabeth II’s strength came from being “above politics”. Now even that pose – how can a head of state be above politics? – has been exposed, as Buckingham Palace’s “displeasure and annoyance” at David Cameron reveals. It is not angry because he “dragged the Queen into politics” but because he revealed that she happily got stuck in without the need for dragging.
SEP22	Justin Trudeau – not so much racist as slight and ineffectual	As a Canadian living in Britain, I’m pretty sure nobody on either side of the Atlantic really believes Justin Trudeau is a racist. Certainly not an afro-wig wearing, Banana Boat-singing, face-blacking one. Though, admittedly, he did do all those racist things and possibly more – it’s hard to know because he says he can’t remember. If we know one thing about Trudeau, it’s that he loves people, all people. Especially “racialised Canadians”, as he now calls them, using the parlance of the day. Trudeau admires people of colour so much that when he found himself at a party dressed as Aladdin, he was happy to throw his arms around two genuinely racialised Canadians and grin boldly for the camera.
SEP22	Insights... efficiency is fine, but happiness at work is another kettle of fish	We are having a productivity crisis. More of us are working, but since the crash we’ve made almost no progress in getting more out of each hour. In part, that’s why we’ve had the longest pay squeeze in two centuries. But what affects our productivity? An answer has come from an unlikely source – fishmongers in Vietnam. And those of a sociable disposition are not going to like it. Many economists recognise the benefits of having similar companies in proximity. The story goes that “clusters ? of particular types of businesses lead to higher productivity because people learn from each other. But does this apply to proximity of workers within a firm? Not so much is the answer from intriguing research by the University of Hong Kong. The author took a seafood-processing plant in Vietnam and compared how many kilograms of fish were filleted when people were randomly allocated work stations as against choosing their neighbours. Ten per cent more fish were gutted when people were randomly allocated and less able to chat to their mates. But before employers start segregating staff it’s worth noting that people like to chat – the study found that workers would forgo nearly 5% of their wages to work around friends.
SEP22	We MPs know that Boris Johnson’s rhetoric is dangerous and divisive	As members of parliament, we have borne witness to a change in the way in which politics is conducted in this country that deeply concerns us. Of course, politics can involve heated debate and there is no doubt that we have both been involved in fiery and impassioned exchanges over the course of our political lives. Politics involves important decisions that can have life-changing impacts and it is unsurprising that such debates and discussions involve emotion on the part of those involved.
SEP22	The Mean Girls have had their day. Welcome to the new Machiavellians	Fifteen years after the release of Tina Fey’s cult film Mean Girls, where Lindsay Lohan’s central character battled her peers, the all-powerful Plastics, is it time to move on from the Mean Girls caricature? Researchers at Florida Atlantic University found that, far from being ostracised, Mean Girl types are the most popular social group. FAU followed more than 560 pupils aged around 13 for two years, placing popular adolescents into three categories: “prosocial (outgoing) popular”, “aggressive popular” and the “bistrategic popular”, or “Machiavellian”, with this latter group noted for being feared and loved. All very intriguing and it’s good to see the Machiavellian label covering both sexes, perhaps finally putting the Mean Girl where she belongs – on a dusty shelf with other oversold pop-culture relics.
SEP22	Even bankers are starting to think Corbyn might be the safe choice now	Beneath all the noise of Brexit, an unexpected question is being quietly asked in British politics as an election nears. Is a Jeremy Corbyn government actually the safe option? If you’ve been persuaded by the years of warnings from most of the media and countless politicians that such a government would be extreme, chaotic, authoritarian and doomed to failure, you may find this question ridiculous. If you’re still a Corbynista, then the notion of him as a stabilising premier for today’s turbulent Britain may be equally absurd. For many believers, the whole point of Corbynism has been the possibility that it might lead to “the most radical government in British history”, as the leftwing theorist and activist Jeremy Gilbert yearningly put it in 2017. Yet people in unexpected places are starting to consider a Corbyn government less risky than the alternatives. Earlier this month, Oliver Harvey, an analyst for Deutsche Bank in the City of London, told the Telegraph: “We see the magnitude of economic damage caused by a no-deal Brexit as much higher than [that caused by] policies proposed in the last Labour manifesto.” In the same article, Christian Schulz, an analyst for Citibank, noted approvingly that “Labour has become more decisively pro-EU”, while “a fiscally profligate no-deal Conservative government” had become less “enticing”.
SEP22	Rape victims should not be forced to hand over their phones. It feels like more abuse	As someone who has supported and advocated for survivors of sexual abuse within the criminal justice system for more than 10 years, I have witnessed how victims of rape and sexual abuse have become subject to “digital strip searches”. Since the collapse of a small number of high-profile rape trials due to failures in disclosure of digital evidence, it has become routine for the police to require victims to grant them access to their mobile phone and other digital data in order to take the case forward. My job as an independent sexual violence adviser is to provide support and guidance to anyone reporting rape or sexual abuse as they make their way through the criminal justice system. In the last couple of years, we have witnessed a very worrying escalation in digital disclosure requests by the police.
SEP22	The language of Brexit ‘betrayal’ is poisoning politics	For a few weeks it was all going well for the so-called remain alliance. As Boris Johnson strained every sinew to facilitate the most damaging Brexit possible, bitter opponents Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson teamed up with other party leaders to force, in law, a request to extend the process. They then agreed not to sanction an early election, against Corbyn’s natural instinct and arguably his party’s immediate interests. And then the truce broke. No sooner had parliament been prorogued than the centre and left parties forgot they were meant to be working together against a near-existential threat. The old rivalry resumed in earnest. Labour denounced the Liberal Democrats for their new “extreme” policy of seeking to revoke article 50 without a referendum. Swinson accused Corbyn of “betraying” remain voters for not personally committing to remain in a referendum.
SEP23	Forget Brexit. The new battle is over Jeremy Corbyn’s successor	Labour is a remain party,” Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, said on Saturday night to a room in Brighton that exploded. Emily Thornberry arrived at the People’s Vote rally wearing a blue top with a necklace of golden stars, calling for Labour to become the party of remain. Keir Starmer, John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Clive Lewis, Tom Watson: all of the high-ranking members of the shadow cabinet are openly remain. Some 90% of constituency Labour party motions on Brexit call for the party to campaign unambiguously for remain. It has the features of a showdown not between the leadership and the members but between a very tight inner circle – which no longer even includes McDonnell, the shadow chancellor – and everybody else. But atmospherically, it feels more like an ultimatum delivered in a rocky relationship. “Do this or I’ll leave” is never the starting point of the row, or even its apex. By the time that person says it, and means it, the balance of power has already shifted. Jeremy Corbyn must be wishing there was some way he could prorogue his own conference – maybe get the Queen involved. He appeared on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show on Sunday morning, categorically giving Labour’s Brexit stance before conference had even discussed it. That position was both trenchant and incredibly confusing. First there would be a general election, in which Labour would triumph; that hypothesis Corbyn was happy to discuss and build plans around. Then he would renegotiate a deal with the EU, according to five pillars; then he’d take that deal, set against remain, to the country for a people’s vote. Which side he would support himself, he couldn’t possibly guess, he told Marr, because it was a hypothesis. Labour, meanwhile, wouldn’t decide its final position until a “special conference”, even though it is in the middle of its annual conference.
SEP23	Britain’s common ground is lost. But there are glimmers of hope we can find it	“I’ve given up watching the news,” said the man in the other room. “It’s all lies.” We were both in a hi-fi shop in Bath – me immersed in an arcane conversation about amplifiers, while he asked for help with his internet-enabled flatscreen television. He was sixtysomething, with the look of someone being endlessly annoyed by the world, or what he saw of it. These days, he said, all his information about current affairs came from online videos. What, I wondered, was he watching? Claims of faked bombings in Syria? False warnings about the dangers of vaccines? Or labyrinthine theories about the global cabal intent on stopping Brexit?
SEP23	Saudi Arabia won’t attack Iran. But it may pay someone else to	There is a longstanding joke told in the Middle East about Saudi Arabia’s reluctance to fight its own wars. “Saudi Arabia will fight until the last Pakistani,” the punchline goes, in reference to the fact that Pakistani troops have long supported Saudi’s military endeavours. The punchline has expanded lately to include the Sudanese, a recent addition to the Saudi army’s ground troops. Saudi Arabia is accustomed to buying labour that it deems too menial for its citizens, and it extends that philosophy to its army.
SEP23	She holds the key to the Brexit deadlock. But will Arlene Foster dare use it?	You may not realise it, but Arlene Foster is one of the most powerful politicians in contemporary Europe. In the bizarre and tumultuous state of British politics, this fact is one that will stand among the most historically significant. It is an extraordinary situation. Foster is a member of a regional legislative assembly that hasn’t sat for nearly 1,000 days, the leader of a party with just 10 MPs, and the subject of an inquiry that may well see the end of her political career within weeks. But at this time, she holds the key to Brexit. And the stability of the pound, the constitution of the UK, the size of the European Union and the future of the continent are in no small way affected by her decisions.
SEP23	Suffering is not relative	A Guardian editorial online last Sunday was prompted by the imminent appearance of the memoir of a former UK prime minister, David Cameron. Its overarching assertion was that privileged people do not govern the UK well. Its theme was that because Cameron came from a privileged background, he lacked empathy for the people who suffered as a result of policies he pursued when in office between May 2010 and July 2016. A theme like that could generate strong views pro and con; many editorials do. It could involve a harsh character analysis; public figures must expect that. The way the editorial initially elaborated its theme was woefully misjudged. “I am personally completely devastated that it was ever published in any form in the Guardian, and that we caused distress to so many people,” the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, told me in one of our exchanges about what had happened.
SEP23	Tiny changes might seem insignificant. But they are how we save the planet	There is a celebrated line in Jared Diamond’s Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive, his bestselling study of ecocide and sudden social implosion. Referring to the “self-inflicted environmental damage” on Easter Island by deforestation, Diamond asked: “What did the Easter islander who cut down the last palm tree say while he was doing it?” While there has been much academic controversy about the accuracy of his shorthand for what happened on Easter Island, what remains, however, is a powerful and affecting metaphor, one ever more resonant in the midst of the escalating global climate emergency.
SEP23	What is it about Britain that has produced such a litany of failed leaders?	Britain faces a crisis of political leadership. Neither the right nor the left of politics is capable of throwing up a figure who can bind their respective coalitions together and sustain parliamentary majorities best to navigate Brexit or Remain and their aftermath. Faith in parliamentary democracy is plummeting; belief in strongman politics is rising; the view that there is an elite, of which the political class is a member, intent only on feathering its own nest and pursuing its own sectarian interests, is widespread.
SEP23	The failed Watson plot exposes what really scares Corbyn and his coterie	On the eve of the Labour conference, a poll was published that gave Jeremy Corbyn a negative personal approval rating of minus 60 points – yes, you read that right, minus 60 points. These are depths of unpopularity never plumbed by any opposition leader in the more than 40 years that pollsters have been recording this figure. Even Michael Foot wasn’t that disliked by the British public in the run-up to Labour’s landslide defeat at the hands of Margaret Thatcher in 1983. To have a candidate for prime minister who is that repellent to the country is a problem for Labour, especially when it is facing a general election. To Mr Corbyn’s allies, the answer is obvious – the deputy’s head must roll. The plot to oust Tom Watson by abolishing his post ought to be shocking and yet it is not that surprising to anyone who has been paying attention to the Labour party since it came under the control of Mr Corbyn and his friends.
SEP23	Boris Johnson’s confrontation: don’t lose sight of the real story	‘The problem with politicians and political activists is that they are trapped in their own little bubbles.” If there’s one complaint that defines our age, it’s the accusation that those involved in politics are too removed from “real” people. The trouble is, when political activists show that they have the same concerns as everybody else, the complaint gets turned on its head. “But that’s not a real person, that’s a political activist.” So it was with the confrontation last week between Boris Johnson and Omar Salem, the father of a sick child at Whipps Cross university hospital in London. Much of the debate about the confrontation has been less about Johnson or the state of the NHS than about Salem being a Labour party activist.
SEP23	For authoritarians, stifling the arts is of a piece with demonising minorities	Early this month, Brazil’s leading literary event, the Bienal do Livro Rio, found itself at the centre of the country’s culture wars when a comic book was ordered to be confiscated by the authorities. The book in question was Avengers: The Children’s Crusade, which in one scene showed two fully-clothed men kissing. The gay kiss so upset Rio’s mayor, Marcelo Crivella, who once called homosexuality “a terrible evil”, that he ordered the book to be removed by police in order “to protect children”. Crivella, a former bishop, belongs to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, which is known for its statements that homosexuals and bisexuals are possessed by a female devil. Crivella has also argued that Hindus hold “unclean spirits” and Catholics are “demonic”. The evangelical organisation has hundreds of branches and is one of the major forces behind the electoral success of the country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. The church’s founder, the billionaire Edir Macedo, by far Brazil’s richest pastor, according to Forbes magazine, claims that “prostitutes, homosexuals and bisexuals are always possessed by pombagiras”, Afro-Brazilian spirits associated with witchcraft.
SEP24	Labour has let the fight over Brexit distract it from defeating the Tories	The best and the worst of Labour are locked in mortal combat at their conference, less left and right, more the admirable and the despicable, often tussling within the souls of the very same players. This can be a detestable party, yet in its next breath the most uplifting, a soaring then plummeting rollercoaster to observe. Admirable visions of all that could be under a Labour government were spelled out in John McDonnell’s radical stream of policies to make bad working lives better. Some working conditions have reverted to brutish pre-union days: the care workers, delivery drivers, warehouse pickers, overworked and underpaid. Ken Loach’s latest harrowing horror movie, Sorry We Missed You, previewed here, is a heartrending depiction of the working wrongs that McDonnell addresses. Shorter working hours and better pay are only part of Labour’s intent to shift the share of income, power and wealth at least back to where it was 40 years ago. Labour’s Green New Deal is a double win, decarbonising energy, insulating homes and bringing green industries to areas in most need of good jobs. From speech to speech, on offer are remedies for the decade of stagnant wages.
SEP24	This election will transform Britain – its impact will last decades	With an imminent general election, both the main political parties are riven by rows over Brexit and how tough a line to take. Yet the lesson of the last election in 2017 was that the public gets to choose which issues really matter, not the politicians – and politicians forget at their peril that elections are about issues that are as broad as life itself. And this forthcoming vote could well be much more consequential than the last one: not just wider than Brexit, but bigger than it too. Brexit itself is merely the prism through which a much larger contest has been refracted. Over the past few years, the Brexit debate has shifted away from the question of whether the UK would secure a “good deal” or a “bad deal” from the European Union – as if we were haggling over the price of a secondhand car – towards a more isolationist impulse. Now the Brexiters argue we should walk away with a “clean break”.
SEP24	Of course Brexit matters to voters, but the left-right divide hasn’t gone away	We are a divided nation, torn apart by Brexit and unable even to have Christmas dinners together – or so the story goes. The 2016 referendum created a deep divide in British society around which people are increasingly positioning themselves. Some believe that this is now the defining feature of our political landscape. But while it is true that almost half of the British electorate identify “very strongly” with either leave or remain, and this can outstrip party identification, it would be wrong to imagine that any future general election will only be about this “new” politics. Older divides that have structured political behaviour in Britain for the best part of a century still have a major part to play. Looking at the values of those with very strong Brexit identities, it’s possible to see interesting “cross-pressures”. The positions people hold on subjects other than Brexit do not always line up as you might expect. This helps us to understand why someone with a strong remain identity might have ended up voting Conservative in 2017, or why someone with a strong leave identity may intend to vote Labour next time around. People’s stances on economic questions, for example, are often rooted in longstanding antagonisms that have not been entirely replaced by identities based on Brexit. Those who are very strongly attached to remain but voted Conservative in 2017 are the group most likely to have right-leaning views on the economy, for instance, while at the same time being more socially liberal than other Conservative voters. Likewise, those who identify strongly with the leave side but who voted Labour in 2017 are more likely to take leftwing economic positions, while being more socially conservative than their fellow party members who support remain.
SEP24	If world leaders choose to fail us, my generation will never forgive them	This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you are doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.
SEP24	I thought I’d made it when I got to Cambridge University. How wrong I was	I’ve always been a diligent worker. Having had a part-time job in a fish and chip shop throughout my A-levels, I know what hard work means. When I received my offer to study at Cambridge University I was congratulated by my colleagues for finally “making it”. In the warm heat of June, a few days before my last exam, I thought this would be the last time I would smell the fish in batter as it hit the sizzling oil. I reflected on the idea that Cambridge meant I was finally competing on a level playing field with socially and economically privileged students. Within my first four days at university, by which time tickets had already sold out for the winter ball, I realised this was not the case. Around me, students effortlessly parted with well over £100 for that one night out. I could only struggle to do the same, so I applied to work for half of the ball in order to enjoy the other half for free. It soon dawned on me that, for a working-class student, a Cambridge education did not give me equal status.
SEP24	Labour is finally reaching out to minority voters to help shape policy	The Jeremy Corbyn project wants to hear from people within minority communities across Britain. At last. Speaking at the Labour party’s annual conference in Brighton, Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities secretary, said, “I need help with my race and faith manifesto” and asked for ideas. The plan is for “nationwide listening events” with ethnic minority groups, intended to help shape party policy. And Labour wants to get the ball rolling with issues ranging from political representation to making public services more inclusive, as well as examining the legacy of slavery, colonialism and empire. Butler said a better understanding of this British history was a “vital component in the fight against the far right”, which she added was the fastest-growing terrorist threat in the UK. Her words are backed up by the police. In 2018, figures showed that hate crimes had more than doubled in the past five years. And earlier this year, a leading children’s charity found that children were whitening their skin to avoid this terrifying increase in racial abuse.
SEP24	The Trump-Ukraine scandal is a taste of how dirty the US elections will get	America has a grand tradition of the brazenly dumb criminal: the kind who is so desperately needy that he brags about his guilt. Back in the earliest days of the new media known as newspapers, a certain Chicago mob boss rose to fame by calling a press conference to proclaim everyone else’s guilt, if not exactly his innocence.
SEP24	Britain’s common ground is lost. But there are glimmers of hope we can find it	“I’ve given up watching the news,” said the man in the other room. “It’s all lies.” We were both in a hi-fi shop in Bath – me immersed in an arcane conversation about amplifiers, while he asked for help with his internet-enabled flatscreen television. He was sixtysomething, with the look of someone being endlessly annoyed by the world, or what he saw of it. These days, he said, all his information about current affairs came from online videos.

Keir Starmer, John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Clive Lewis, Tom Watson: all of the high-ranking members of the shadow cabinet are openly remain. Some 90% of constituency Labour party motions on Brexit call for the party to campaign unambiguously for remain.

Labour, meanwhile, wouldn’t decide its final position until a “special conference”, even though it is in the middle of its annual conference.
SEP24	Corbyn has committed to a people’s vote, so why do remainers still attack him?	Essential to the success of any struggle is to recognise when you have won. It is less than a year and a half since the People’s Vote campaign was founded. It has organised mass demonstrations, rallies, petitions; its grassroots have leafleted, chanted, sung and often rather pointedly made themselves heard on social media. Their demand was straightforward: any Brexit deal negotiated with the EU should be subject to a confirmatory referendum, with remain as the other option. And that campaign has achieved a dramatic success, compelling Labour to implement its policy if it wins an election. Yet where are the triumphant declarations or the rightly triumphalist victory parties? Labour’s leadership is savaged for inconsistency and zigzagging incomprehensibly, as though it is unique or politically bankrupt in its attempt to manage drastically shifting sands and an ever more polarising culture war. For those of us who campaigned for remain in the referendum, there was a particular problem: there was no mass movement on our side. The official remain campaign was a dire, corporate, status quo outfit that did not understand, and was institutionally incapable of relating to, a deep well of disillusionment in British society.
SEP25	The verdict is in: Boris Johnson is a liar. And he should pay the price	If Boris Johnson does nothing more, his name in history is already inscribed as the man who lied so hard he nearly broke the constitution. He certainly broke the law, as definitively interpreted by the supreme court today. Any leader with respect for the responsibilities that come with high office, and capable of shame, would immediately resign. Nothing in Johnson’s record suggests he is such a person. He clambered to Downing Street over the wreckage of his own former beliefs, ruined friendships and betrayed relationships. He has never recognised the imperative of truth, so takes no instruction from it now. The new pinnacle of Johnson’s career as a peddler of falsehood is his claim that parliament’s suspension earlier this month was procedural – a conventional legislative reboot ahead of a Queen’s speech to set out a new domestic agenda. No one believed him. His own ministers struggled to hold the line, blurting out the true motive, which was to limit MPs’ control over Brexit. By unanimous verdict, the country’s most senior judges ruled that prorogation did indeed have the effect of “preventing or frustrating” the legislature in pursuit of its constitutional duties – passing laws, holding ministers to account and, crucially, representing the public in Commons debates. The court noted that those functions were uniquely urgent, given the proximity of the Brexit deadline. The stymying deed had to be undone.
SEP25	The supreme court judgment is a devastating blow for a failed prime minister	The supreme court has delivered a comprehensive demolition of Boris Johnson’s government and its handling of Brexit. The unanimous judgment of the 11 justices, announced by Lady Hale this morning, amounts to a root and branch rejection of the prime minister’s attempts to rule without parliament, to take Britain out of the European Union by 31 October without a deal, and to contrive a premature general election. The judgment was incisive and without any waffle. It was very consciously written in the best tradition of British constitutional law, of which parliamentary sovereignty is the foundational rock. The immediate effect of the judgment is devastating for Johnson. It is expressed so cogently and unambiguously that it will be difficult for him to wriggle out of it – even though he is certainly foolish enough to try. Parliament will surely be recalled on Tuesday – since, as the judgment said, it has not been prorogued in the first place. Johnson’s efforts, to the extent that they exist at all, to negotiate a new or tweaked deal with the EU will be held up to the light. And, since Johnson spectacularly lacks a majority in the House of Commons, it is likely that the cross-party efforts to shape Brexit will be redoubled.
SEP25	The Gates Foundation shouldn’t legitimise Narendra Modi	It is one thing for a political leader to come to power in his country by exploiting the darkest nationalistic instincts of its electorate. It is quite another thing for such a man to be awarded an international prize and embraced as a statesman by the most powerful and influential country in the world. The former reflects a familiar and vexing paradox of democracy – its deliberate subversion from within. The latter is entirely gratuitous and speaks to the collapse of any sense of international political morality. The Gates Foundation has announced it is bestowing a prestigious annual award on prime minister Narendra Modi of India. And in advance of the UN general assembly meeting in New York, Donald Trump flew down to Houston, Texas, to welcome him at an event charmingly dubbed the “Howdy Modi” rally.
SEP25	Labour’s National Care Service should be for everyone, not just older people	On Monday John McDonnell set out Labour’s new flagship policy on social care. A Labour government would provide free personal care for people over 65 who need help with washing, dressing and eating and would invest an extra £8bn into adult social care over the next few years. The shadow chancellor also pledged to end the use of zero-hours contracts for care workers, and ensure they are paid a real living wage, including for time they spend travelling. As anyone who currently needs care or who has battled to get it for a loved one will know, this is the sort of policy that will transform lives. Governments have long neglected to find a long-term solution for social care in the context of an ageing population, and the crisis has spiralled during a decade of austerity. Since 2010, £7.7bn has been cut from adult social care budgets in England, leaving 1.4 million people without the care they need. This is affecting millions more as family carers (largely women) are forced to plug the gap left by the state. That the Conservative’s long-promised green paper on social care is still MIA is emblematic of how those relying on the system have been forgotten.
SEP25	So parliament is returning. But what happens next?	In its ruling on Tuesday that the “prime minister’s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect”, the supreme court has decided that parliament was never actually suspended two weeks ago. The clock is turned back to 9 September, the last day MPs sat. So parliament will return but, as prorogation did not take place, it is not being recalled. There will be no Queen’s speech, no new legislative agenda, no state opening. Business will resume. But, since this has never happened before, this is not business as usual. A degree of improvisation and innovation – with the government working with the opposition parties and Commons Speaker John Bercow – will be required to map out the days and weeks ahead. The government is expected to table a motion to secure a short conference recess. If MPs reject this, then the Conservative party conference in Manchester would take place while parliament sits – an unusual and, from Boris Johnson’s point of view, logistically unhelpful clash.
SEP25	Labour has let the fight over Brexit distract it from defeating the Tories	The best and the worst of Labour are locked in mortal combat at their conference, less left and right, more the admirable and the despicable, often tussling within the souls of the very same players.

SEP25	Labour is right to target private school privilege – but abolition isn’t the only answer	Labour’s general election gambit of declaring a so-called “class war” on Britain’s private schools is partly intended to distract from its own internecine struggles and Brexit woes. Delegates at the party’s annual conference in Brighton on Sunday voted to abolish fee-paying schools and redistribute their assets “democratically and fairly” for the benefit of all children.
SEP25	It's time to start impeachment proceedings against Trump	Donald Trump has a problem with elections. Seemingly lacking confidence in his ability to win them through honest and untreasonable means, he has repeatedly questioned the integrity of the American electoral system while seeking the help of foreign powers to tip the balance in his favor. From suggesting he might not accept the results of an election based on the lie that “millions of illegals” are able to cast votes to openly welcoming the help of Russia in 2016, Trump has made it clear that he cannot be trusted to oversee the presidential election of 2020. Sadly, in the months following the fizzle which marked the end of the Mueller investigation, this basic truth has slipped out of focus. A coalition of Republicans for whom Trump can do no wrong, Democratic lawmakers worried about the politics of impeachment and progressive commentators who claim that holding Trump accountable for his conduct is a distraction from the pocketbook issues which most concern voters has come together to urge the nation to move on.

SEP25	Jake Humm's death fills me with anger and despair – thousands like him are at risk	It is every parent’s deepest fear that they might lose their child. When that child is in supported living, and supposedly being looked after, losing them is not only a heartbreak, it feels like a betrayal. The story of Jake Humm, a talented young musician, fills me with despair and anger, not just because of his early and unnecessary death, but because it appears there were so many warning signs of his deteriorating state, and not enough done to protect him. It is tragic that he was only discovered in his room by staff two days after his death.
SEP26	Johnson’s plan is to turn his supreme court humiliation into rocket fuel at the polls	An angry and disturbingly pumped-up Boris Johnson’s response to the court in the recalled House of Commons tonight was an act of total contempt – for the courts, for parliament and ultimately for public and political decency. For the time being, Johnson still retains much of the formal power of the prime minister. But the role’s inner power, its moral authority, the holder’s ability to govern and his meaningful capacity to represent the country are practically shot. There is nothing tragic about this for Johnson personally. There is everything tragic for the country that never asked for him to become its leader. He can’t blame the judges, because he does not dare. He likes to blame MPs, because they are an easy target. But the real blame lies with himself and the Tory hard leavers.
SEP26	For Labour's grassroots, a radical agenda is finally within reach	Labour’s conference began as farce, but culminated in a triumphant affirmation of the most radical incarnation of Corbynism yet. The abortive attempt to remove the party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, enraged Jeremy Corbyn so much he broke with his near-cardinal aversion to swearing, and threatened to destabilise Labour’s last major pre-election opportunity to showcase its radical vision. The supreme court’s damning ruling against the prime minister reinvigorated morale and offered a necessary reminder of the frightening political stakes at hand, but it was a democratic insurgency at the conference – although sometimes colliding with old-style machine politics – that re-energised a Labour grassroots preparing to march into an existential political battle. Rather than policies cooked up by unelected advisers and thinktank wonks, the wisdom of members would be trusted instead
SEP26	Labour’s pledge to take on big pharma will save lives	Sixteen years ago I first saw the impact of pharmaceutical greed on people living with HIV in Tanzania. In order to maintain their profits, the companies that had developed effective medicines fought hard to prevent the sale of affordable generics. So while those with the condition in the US and Europe were getting lifesaving treatment, only a handful of the millions across Africa who needed it had access. Fast-forward to 2019, and campaigning has resulted in HIV treatment prices dropping from tens of thousands of pounds a year for each patient to about £50, and millions of people across the global south are alive today thanks to cheap, quality-assured generic medicines. But the problem at the heart of the current model of pharmaceutical innovation has not gone away. It is endangering the lives of patients in the UK and threatening the sustainability of health systems across the rich and poor worlds.
SEP26	The struggle for equality is real. The ‘woke police’ are a myth	There’s a lot of talk these days about new political tribes, so allow me to introduce another one: the “anti-woke”. The first curious thing to note about members of this group is that they define themselves in opposition to an identity that doesn’t actually exist. They are anti-woke, even though there is no “woke”. Woke – a term once used by African Americans to denote people who were alert to racism and social injustice – has been retired. As is often the case with black innovations, overuse by the white mainstream killed off its authenticity. Today, the person using the word is likely to be a rightwing culture warrior angry at a phenomenon that lives mainly in their imagination.
SEP26	Britain claims it protects girls from FGM. So why are we deporting them?	Today the family division of the high court ruled that it has no power to stop the home secretary from deporting a vulnerable girl at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM) to Bahrain or Sudan. Jasmine (not her real name) is 10 years old. As a barrister, I have seen how the government’s hostile immigration environment extends to refusing asylum claims on the basis of FGM, leaving girls and women liable to deportation to countries where this practice is prevalent, if not the norm. The government claims it is committed to supporting victims of FGM and prosecuting perpetrators. Yet when girls at risk of being cut claim asylum, they are turned away.
SEP26	Like it or not, Boris Johnson still has two paths to election victory	It’s the morning after. Yesterday was a ball, at least for remainers. But it was like the Duchess of Richmond’s ball before Waterloo; now, the real battle must commence. The supreme court did not rewrite the UK’s constitution on Tuesday, it merely enforced the conventions of the existing one. It reasserted, “Be ye never so high, the law is above you” – though it cited no particular law, rather the “rule of law” as interpreted by itself. The person who should be resigning is the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, for inducing the monarch to collude in a political device. We can only imagine how pompously he would now be demanding resignation were the culprit not him.
SEP26	Political highlight of the week? Actually, it was Labour's carbon game-changer	The most significant political moment of the last decade happened on Tuesday afternoon, not in the supreme court, but on a packed floor of the Brighton Centre during Labour party conference. Delegates overwhelmingly voted in favour of two motions backing a Green New Deal, a programme that will decarbonise the UK through a “radical policy package to increase social and economic justice”. One of the motions included a target for the UK to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030, and one did not – instead, calling for the UK to act as a world leader on climate change, and to establish a National Climate Service. The 2030 net-zero emissions target now has a very real chance of being included in the Labour party manifesto. Jim Pickard, chief political correspondent for the Financial Times, said the target was “one of the most radical policies by a mainstream political party in my lifetime”.
SEP26	Rewilding will make Britain a rainforest nation again	The forests still burn, but the world now looks away. In both the Amazon basin and the rainforests of Indonesia, the world-scorching inferno rages on, already forgotten by most of the media. Intricate living systems, species that took millions of years to evolve, are being incinerated in moments, then replaced with monocultures. Giant plumes of carbon tip us further into climate breakdown. And we’re not even talking about it. But underneath the grief and frustration, I also feel disquiet. We rightly call on other nations to protect their stunning places. But where are our rainforests? I mean this both metaphorically and literally. Out of 218 nations, the UK ranks 189th for the intactness of its living systems. Having trashed our own wildlife, our excessive demand for meat, animal feed, timber, minerals and fossil fuels helps lay waste the rest of the world.
SEP26	Ousting Netanyahu isn’t enough for Israel’s Palestinians. They want equality	In my hometown of Tira, an Arab community in central Israel, word spread on election day last week of many residents deciding to vote at the last minute. During the campaign’s final weeks, families watched as the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu launched ferocious tirades about the threat of a “leftist-Arab government”. He told his followers the Arabs “want to annihilate us all”, and that they were “stealing” the elections through rampant voter fraud (his legislative attempts to place surveillance cameras at Arab polling stations failed to get through the Knesset). Tira’s residents were no strangers to the prime minister’s history of racist incitement, but for many people his shocking escalations compelled a response. If they couldn’t stop him from winning, they thought, they would at least try to make his job as difficult as possible.
SEP26	Impeach Trump? The United States is now in uncharted waters	Nancy Pelosi, the US House speaker, might sympathize with the quote attributed to 19th century French politician Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin: “There go the people. I must follow them, for I am their leader.” For months following the release of the Mueller report, Pelosi had resisted pressure from within her caucus to begin impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. But now, with more than two-thirds of Democrats in the House of Representatives favoring impeachment in the wake of Trump’s Ukrainian scandal, she has reversed herself and announced a formal impeachment inquiry.
SEP27	You can’t be ‘impartial’ about racism – an open letter to the BBC on the Naga Munchetty ruling	Dear BBC, On 16 July 2019, President Trump tweeted that four congresswomen should “go back to the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came”. All four congresswomen are people of colour, all four are US citizens and only congresswoman Ilhan Omar was born overseas. These comments were widely acknowledged as racist in a broad spectrum of reputable international news outlets, including the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Sky News and the Guardian.
SEP27	Tory moderates may have to fight to get their party back	If Boris Johnson is capable of shame, then he should surely now be feeling it. He has brought this country to the point where an election is genuinely to be feared, no matter who wins, because of the violence that may follow; where MPs facing death threats will need all the courage they can muster just to go out campaigning, and decent voters will switch off from the spite and hysteria surrounding them. It should go without saying that Johnson’s dismissive response to the Labour MP Paula Sherriff, when she challenged his deliberately provocative talk of surrender and betrayal over Brexit, was awful. Having listened in the past to Sherriff matter-of-factly describe the threats she has faced from the far right, and the depressingly elaborate precautions so many of her colleagues must take just to go about their everyday life, I too feel rage bubbling up at the idea that this was somehow faux concern. But what if rage is what they want, those determined to turn this next election into some kind of political hunger games? For only when we are goaded beyond reason, red mist descending at the slightest provocation, can they get the reaction their divide-and-conquer strategy needs.
SEP27	The drama in parliament is irresistible for the media. But real politics is happening elsewhere	At this year’s London Marathon, a runner dressed as Big Ben got stuck under advertising hoardings as he reached the finish line. For the past couple of years, the real Big Ben has been clad in scaffolding, while business in the House of Commons has been intermittently interrupted by fires and water leaks. As the UK’s institutional politics crumbles, the gods are writing the metaphors for us. How can we make some sense out of our current tumult – this feverish period in which an old politics is imploding before our eyes and we can feel the birth pangs of contested futures?
SEP27	Lady Hale pulled pints? She’s all the stronger for it	For all the talk of an industry in crisis, you have to hand it to the British media for their ability to get to the nub of a story. It was, one imagines, with a gasp of triumph that the Daily Mail was able to deliver a stinging blow to the president of the supreme court, Lady Hale, she of the spider brooch and the damning verdict on our prime minister’s prorogation wheeze. Via a stunned headline, the paper was this week able to reveal that Hale, who graduated top of her class at Cambridge in law, who was the first woman to be appointed to the Law Commission, and the second to be appointed to the court of appeal, was in fact an “ex-barmaid”. Truly, we must applaud this mighty organ’s dogged commitment to truth and scrutiny. I do worry about what sort of precedent this sets, however. When the day comes that I achieve something of professional import that has implications on the very notion of democracy, will I too be put through the media wringer? I may not have a law degree or a seat on the most powerful court in the land but, like Hale, I am an ex-barmaid. I’m also an ex-waitress, dishwasher and tour guide, and – my personal nadir – a former milk factory worker required to wear a hairnet and fetching paper suit. These jobs were executed through my late teens and early 20s with varying degrees of competency and enthusiasm. I still maintain, however, that my three years working behind a bar were the best fun I’ve ever had in a job.
SEP27	Impeachment isn’t the answer to America’s political crisis	Donald Trump is facing impeachment, and a single phone call seems to have tipped the balance. During a conversation in July with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, he asked for help in the investigation of his likely opponent in 2020, Joe Biden, whose son had business dealings in the country. On Tuesday, Nancy Pelosi announced that impeachment proceedings would finally begin. But the release of the conversation summary or “memcon” between Trump and Zelenskiy on Wednesday left things a little hazier than expected.
SEP27	Racism is not a legitimate standpoint. When will the BBC learn that?	Journalism 101 tells us that if someone says it’s drizzling outside, and another that it’s dry, the job of the journalist is not to quote both but to find out which is true. But this week, the BBC upheld a complaint against the breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty for stating a truth as obvious as “water is wet”. Munchetty was found to have breached the BBC’s impartiality policy for her unscripted response to President Trump’s tweets telling four congresswomen of colour to go back home. “Every time I have been told as a woman of colour to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.” She said she felt “absolutely furious” about it. The BBC’s misguided response suggests that reacting to racism is worse than racism itself. All I saw was another woman of colour calling out racist remarks for what they were, and describing her own experiences. The clear message sent by this ruling is that whether or not something is racist is purely subjective. 
SEP27	The far right in Italy is blocked but not banished	In 2013, Matteo Renzi was Italy’s most popular politician. Pragmatic, liberal-minded, still in his thirties, he was a poster boy for the European establishment – living, breathing proof that the country had got its act together after the Silvio Berlusconi years. Then he became prime minister – the youngest in Italy’s history – and it all fell apart. In an attempt to dramatically extend the powers of his government, Renzi called an ill-judged constitutional referendum. He was heavily defeated and forced to resign. His fall from grace would prove fatal not only for his own reputation, but for that of Italy’s entire centre-left.
SEP27	Spain has a democratic problem – the people have outgrown its political system	In November, Spain will hold its fourth general election in four years. Only five months have passed since the last election, which had a turnout of more than 75% – the highest in 15 years. In an increasingly conservative Europe, it was a rare election result that lifted progressive spirits: Pedro Sánchez’s victorious Socialist Workers’ party looked as if it would almost certainly have to form a coalition government with Unidas Podemos, the newer, more leftwing party led by Pablo Iglesias. But since the election in April, the two have failed to reach an agreement. In the end, Sánchez preferred to risk another election rather than rely on a party that would put pressure on him from the left. The negotiations have been a sad spectacle, not least because the voters’ message in April had seemed so clear. On the night of the socialists’ victory, hundreds of ecstatic supporters outside the party’s headquarters chanted anti-fascist slogans and urged party leaders not to side with Ciudadanos, a rightwing technocratic party. They wanted a leftwing coalition, and it looked like a done deal: throughout the electoral campaign, Sánchez had claimed he would have no problem governing in coalition with Unidas Podemos.
SEP27	The struggle for equality is real. The ‘woke police’ are a myth	There’s a lot of talk these days about new political tribes, so allow me to introduce another one: the “anti-woke”. The first curious thing to note about members of this group is that they define themselves in opposition to an identity that doesn’t actually exist.

SEP28	Tory MPs beware: if you whip up an angry mob, they may end up angry with you	Drawn increasingly into darkness and rage, the UK government functions as a promotional tie-in for the controversial Joker movie. Out next week, kids. Think of it as a Tory conference chaser. For now, it’s great to see everyone’s favourite political incel break cover, as Dominic Cummings makes a series of appearances among the chaos to announce: “We are enjoying this.” Such a self-styled antihero. He used to think what happened to his Brexit was a tragedy, but now he knows it’s a comedy. The latest clip ends with Cummings blowing a kiss to the news cameras, a reminder that politics allows some people to play out a wishful version of themselves that would be laughed out of town anywhere normal. In any sane arena, Dominic is the answer to the inquiry: “What would happen if you shaved Quentin Tarantino’s head but kept everything else much the same?”
SEP28	Trump and Johnson are getting their comeuppance. But will it make them stronger?	Since 2016, Britain and the United States have grappled with a shared fate, facing down the conjoined twins of populism: Brexit and Trump. This week, at long last, came the first signs of a reckoning. After three years in which the winners of 2016 have mocked, pushed or trampled on the constitutional constraints that sustain a liberal democracy, the constitutions – on both sides of the Atlantic – struck back. The mechanisms are different of course, but the convergence of these two connected stories has been uncanny all the same. The 11 judges of the UK supreme court cancelled Boris Johnson’s unlawful suspension of parliament on the very day the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, put aside her previous misgivings and launched an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump.
SEP28	MPs of all parties must unite to rein in this reckless, divisive government	At the moment, our country is more unsettled, more divided, than I can ever recall. Ministers assure us they are moving towards a deal. The European Union tells us they are not – because no new or viable proposals have been put forward by the British government. The prime minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe. But we don’t see him sitting down in Brussels, hammering out an agreement. Lip service is paid to the unanimous judgment of the supreme court – that it was unlawful to prorogue parliament for five weeks – while the prime minister tells us the court was wrong and he was right. That is the cry of those found guilty of misdemeanours throughout the ages.
SEP28	Separation anxiety: why breaking up with your babysitter is hard to do	My children’s babysitter stayed over this week after I went out late one night. Since my children were born, we have seen her every day bar the weekends. Officially, we are now divorced; after the summer, my children were old enough to go to after-school club and our babysitter found a new job. In truth, I am finding it hard to let go. “I can’t let go!” I wailed to her this week. Wearily, she agreed to come back. She has contrived not to notice when I’ve come in late, wasted ('everyone does it in England,' I say defensively)

SEP29	Trump acts as if he is above the law. The law has begun to fight back	Nancy Pelosi’s decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, following reports that he used the power of his office to solicit interference by a foreign government in the 2020 US election, makes him only the fourth president in US history to have this notable distinction, with Bill Clinton in 1998, Richard Nixon in 1973 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. The picture changes by the hour, but the main story concerns Trump’s apparent offer to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to unfreeze $40m in (Congress-approved) military aid if he would investigate Joe Biden, the current frontrunner in the Democratic primaries. The conversation so shocked a member of the intelligence community that they filed an official whistleblower complaint. The White House then appears to have engaged in a cover-up, in part by keeping these conversations from officials who would normally have access to them, as well as allegedly moving the transcript of the call to a secret computer system (the Presidential Records Act of 1978, passed in response to the Watergate scandal, mandates that all presidential records must be officially preserved).
SEP29	End front-page falsehoods and regain the public’s trust	The postmortem on how we got ourselves into this mess will be long and complex. But at its heart will lie this simple proposition: good democracy relies on good information. What does “good information” look like? We might say: information that is not only true but also believed. And therein lies the problem. We’re no longer very willing to believe almost anybody. Most surveys of trust find very little faith in what government or politicians tell us. But there are also extraordinarily low levels of trust in most media. Nearly two-thirds of people say they can no longer tell good journalism from rumour or falsehoods. This is, to put it mildly, a disaster. Into this vacuum of unbelief and mistrust step liars and peddlers of fantasies. By all means call another referendum or election, but what makes anyone confident that the electorate will make a “better” decision than last time round? And I don’t just mean Brexit.
SEP29	Jennifer Lopez: a comeback of positively epic proportions	Like stories about how much everyone still loves Friends – could it be any more necessary to talk about how everyone still loves Friends? – Jennifer Lopez is everywhere. Last week, she was announced as co-headliner of the next Super Bowl half-time show, sharing that 100 million or so strong audience with Shakira. In a statement, she said it was a lifelong dream. “And now it’s made even more special not only because it’s the NFL’s 100th anniversary but also because I am performing with a fellow Latina. I can’t wait to show what us girls can do on the world’s biggest stage.” Lopez is enjoying a career renaissance of epic proportions. In a way, epic proportions are a big part of her story in the first place. She closed the Versace show during Milan fashion week with a revival of “that” green dress, 20 years after she wore it to the Grammys. So many people searched for it back then that it led Google to the creation of Google Images. She is also receiving that much-coveted Oscars buzz – not a bad turnaround for the woman who once uttered: “It’s turkey time! Gobble gobble, gobble,” widely considered the worst movie dialogue of all time – for Hustlers. She plays a blinder as Ramona Vega, a stripper turned con artist who either wants to wrap everyone up in her giant fur coat or drug them and fleece them, depending on which side of the transactions they are on. I went to see Hustlers the weekend it came out. I can’t remember the last time I sat in a cinema filled, and it was filled, almost entirely with young women. My friend Louis audibly gasped when J-Lo performed her pièce de résistance, a gravity-caressing pole dance to Fiona Apple’s song Criminal. He grabbed my hand and whispered: “She’s 50.” Nobody shushed him.
SEP29	Meet the new enemy of an ordered, happy society – the crying baby	Babies and toddlers, the game is up – good people (adult people) aren’t putting up with your antisocial behaviour any more. Japan Airlines has developed an app with a child icon, showing passengers where small children, aged between eight days and two years, are sitting, thus enabling them to sit as far away as possible from the nappy-wearing sociopaths of the skies. Or something like that. Maybe there’s an argument for hyper-frequent flying business people using such an app, but what about the rest of us – people who occasionally fly for a few hours a time? Is it socially acceptable to hate babies now – leastways, to sit coldly prodding a child icon to banish them from your presence? There’s something so intrinsically misanthropic about all this, I don’t know whether to laugh or ask for around-the-clock police surveillance on the people who use such icons. Certainly, it raises important ethical questions. Eight days, 24 months – how old is the child you’re prepared to vaporise from your flight experience? If there were an app to force young children to travel in a livestock cage in the cargo hold, would you use that too? Duct taping a kid’s mouth shut – where do you stand on that?

SEP29	Education needs an overhaul, but closing private schools is not the answer	The Labour party’s radical proposals to shake up England’s schooling system has thrust educational debate into the spotlight, shattering the post-millennial political consensus of what’s best for our children. A Labour government would dismantle the very foundations of the current education landscape – abandoning tests at the end of primary school, replacing the schools inspectorate, and abolishing private schools altogether. Labour claims it’s the party fighting for social justice rather than social mobility. It is certainly offering a different vision to that of the Conservatives, who want to create more places at selective grammar schools. But how do these policies stack up against the hard evidence? What’s undeniable is that we need to rethink the current approach to education. Amid stagnating social mobility, schools remain the great hope of levelling a grotesquely uneven playing field. But the achievement gap between poorer children and their better-off peers continues to be stark. Reviews of progress on narrowing the gap have adopted an increasingly futile tone.
SEP29	Brexit is giving Welsh nationalism a new popular appeal	The last time I visited family in north Wales, I was heartened to see the words “Cofiwch Dryweryn” (“Remember Tryweryn”) emblazoned on several walls. I had read about how the patriotic slogan was popping up, meme-like, all over the country, but I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes. Call me a misty-eyed Welsh nationalist if you like, but I felt quite emotional. Ever since I was a little girl and my father pulled over the car to show me where a village once stood, I had known the story of Capel Celyn, the community flooded in 1965 to create a reservoir for Liverpool in the Tryweryn valley, and how it became a nationalist cause. The repeated vandalisation of the original graffiti, which the poet Meic Stephens painted in the 1960s and which has now gained charity protection, has led to a kind of viral graffiti campaign, with Cofiwch Dryweryn appearing on walls and slag heaps, alongside roads and near beaches, and even on the side of mountains. It feels like the most significant display of Welsh pride that I have seen in my lifetime.
SEP29	Macron’s national debate on immigration plays into the hands of the French far right	Nearly halfway into his rocky first term as French president, Emmanuel Macron has concocted a new plan to bolster his flagging approval ratings: a sweeping national debate on immigration. Starting on Monday, the French parliament is slated to begin a wide-ranging discussion of French and European migration policy. It comes just weeks after Macron told legislators from his party, La République En Marche, that he believes immigration to be a major concern of working-class people – something they apparently “endure”, along with poverty and unemployment. “The question,” he told the parliamentarians, “is whether we want to be a bourgeois party or not.” It’s unclear what exactly will come of the debate. Just in case legislators are looking for inspiration, though, the president has floated a handful of his own ideas – and they give a sense of where this is headed. He has suggested that state medical aid for undocumented immigrants is too generous, that some are abusing the right of asylum, and that deportations sometimes take too long to process because of legal challenges. “France cannot host everyone if it wants to host people well,” Macron said on Wednesday.

Ministers assure us they are moving towards a deal. The European Union tells us they are not – because no new or viable proposals have been put forward by the British government. The prime minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe. But we don’t see him sitting down in Brussels, hammering out an agreement. Lip service is paid to the unanimous judgment of the supreme court – that it was unlawful to prorogue parliament for five weeks – while the prime minister tells us the court was wrong and he was right. That is the cry of those found guilty of misdemeanours throughout the ages.
SEP30	If Boris Johnson has a plan for Brexit he must reveal it now	At school, you can only tell the teacher so many times that the dog ate your homework. After a while, you have to produce it. Or admit you never did it in the first place. That is the position Boris Johnson finds himself in on Brexit. And whether it’s being accountable to parliament or to the public in an election after a vote of no confidence this week, it’s time he came clean on what his detailed plan is. Theresa May’s mistake was to promise “Brexit means Brexit” but then negotiate a “vassal-state” deal, as Jacob Rees-Mogg described it, that was the worst of all worlds and more unpopular than the poll tax. Johnson quit his cabinet position as he felt so strongly that May’s Brexit deal was a bad one. Brexiteers said it was because her heart wasn’t in it as a remainer. So it’s hardly surprising there is little trust left in the Brexit process.
SEP30	We were told capitalism had won. But now workers can take back control	Before the financial crisis of 2008 it was widely assumed class politics was dead. A rising tide, we were told, would lift all boats. In fact, unprecedented levels of credit creation and rising asset prices obscured the growing gap between the 1% and the rest. Now the bubble has burst, it is obvious whose interests are served by our economic model – and the class divides are sharpening once again. In 1992, Francis Fukuyama declared that history had ended, and capitalism was the last man standing. Margaret Thatcher had already stated that “there is no alternative” to the free market. The world fell under the spell of what Mark Fisher termed “capitalist realism” – it had become easier for most people to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.
SEP30	I used to think Boris Johnson could get a Brexit deal. Not after last week	I cannot recall a more critical week in British politics. It will decide whether parliament, the law and public opinion can hold the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to account, or whether a new poison has entered public life. We need constantly to remember that Britain faces no menace to its security or prosperity. It could by now be outside the EU with agreed terms of trade. This crisis is entirely the outcome of one man’s device to seize control of his party. From the moment Johnson began his final climb to power, his appeal has been crudely populist. He has discarded the core Tory tradition of fiscal probity with a welter of spending pledges and tax cuts, plus plans for immigration control and toughness on crime. On Brexit, he has distorted a near trivial “freedom to trade with the rest of the world” with claptrap about vassalage, sovereignty and patriotism. The idea that Brexit will bring a new dawn of national wealth is absurd. It is simply how Johnson became prime minister.
SEP30	Europe isn’t the enemy – demonising us is undermining Britain	Seventeen years ago Theresa May stunned her fellow Conservatives by telling their annual party conference that they were “just plain unattractive”. The Tories, she said, had become “the nasty party”. Today, from where I sit in western Europe, Britain itself looks just plain unattractive. It seems to have become “the nasty country”. I’m not saying the British people are any worse, or any better, than any other Europeans. I am saying its ruling political party is nasty, as is much of its press. The leader of the Conservative party, and therefore the prime minister, is a man who has personally taken nastiness to an entirely new level, yet is the country’s most popular politician. Ever since the UK voted to leave the EU, millions of other Europeans like me have been looking for signs that the country is coming around to its old, pragmatic self. It’s a version of Boris Johnson’s cakeism: you want to love Britain and you want to be honest about the kind of country it is now. These two positions have become impossible to hold at the same time.
SEP30	It’s open season for political thugs and the Tories gave them the pass	If a malign power wanted to push a peaceful country into political violence, it would follow the example of the British Conservative party. For violence to come from the fringe to the mainstream two conditions must be met: the taboos against violence must be undermined and the forces of order weakened. The Tories have met them both. Political violence needs authorisation from above. Politicians, intellectuals and religious leaders either issue a call to arms or, more usually, find reasons to “understand” and excuse. In the manner of the sexist judge saying women in miniskirts are “asking for it”, they divert attention from perpetrators and say victims have no one to blame but themselves.
SEP30	Boris Johnson seeks to divide and conquer with his incendiary rhetoric	There’s a case to be made that British democracy is not in dreadful trouble but working quite well. Or at least as well as can be expected in extreme circumstances. Even under the intense stress of the Brexit crisis, our spatchcock constitution is just about keeping it together. Exhibit One. The prime minister exploits the prerogative powers to attempt a prolonged suspension of parliament that is designed to prevent MPs from invigilating the government at a critical time. The supreme court coolly steps up to this challenge to democracy, delivers a unanimous and impeccably reasoned judgment explaining why the prime minister acted unlawfully, and parliament is back in business the very next day.
SEP30	Trump acts as if he is above the law. The law has begun to fight back	Nancy Pelosi’s decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, following reports that he used the power of his office to solicit interference by a foreign government in the 2020 US election, makes him only the fourth president in US history to have this notable distinction, with Bill Clinton in 1998, Richard Nixon in 1973 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. The picture changes by the hour, but the main story concerns Trump’s apparent offer to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to unfreeze $400m in (Congress-approved) military aid if he would investigate Joe Biden, the current frontrunner in the Democratic primaries. The conversation so shocked a member of the intelligence community that they filed an official whistleblower complaint. The White House then appears to have engaged in a cover-up, in part by keeping these conversations from officials who would normally have access to them, as well as allegedly moving the transcript of the call to a secret computer system (the Presidential Records Act of 1978, passed in response to the Watergate scandal, mandates that all presidential records must be officially preserved).
SEP30	Change will come to China, but not through following western ways	On Tuesday, 15,000 perfectly groomed military personnel, each between 5ft 9in and 6ft 1in tall, will march down Chang’an Avenue in Beijing. Some 170 aeroplanes and 580 ballistic missiles, drones, tanks, machine guns and other military kit will showcase the might of the People’s Republic of China. The parade marks the 70th anniversary of the day that Mao Zedong announced the founding of the People’s Republic from atop the Tiananmen Gate. It will inspire a sense of pride among Chinese citizens and worries among their neighbours, especially Taiwan.
SEP30	These radical ideas might seem utopian but at least they fire the imagination	Back in May, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, suggested that if Labour won the next election it would launch pilot schemes for universal basic income. The aim of UBI is to provide every citizen with regular unconditional payments to afford “basic security ?. It might seem an impossibly utopian notion – free cash for all, provided by the state – but it has fired the imagination of growing numbers of thinkers from across the political spectrum. Last week, at the Labour party conference, McDonnell unveiled his plans for universal provision, not of income but of services. Where UBI provides a regular cash sum to every individual, universal basic services, or UBS, provides universal, free access to services from health to education, from housing to transport. That, too, might seem utopian, but is an idea that, again, has gathered support in recent years.
SEP30	End front-page falsehoods and regain the public’s trust	The postmortem on how we got ourselves into this mess will be long and complex. But at its heart will lie this simple proposition: good democracy relies on good information. What does “good information” look like? We might say: information that is not only true but also believed. And therein lies the problem. We’re no longer very willing to believe almost anybody. Most surveys of trust find very little faith in what government or politicians tell us. But there are also extraordinarily low levels of trust in most media. Nearly two-thirds of people say they can no longer tell good journalism from rumour or falsehoods. This is, to put it mildly, a disaster. Into this vacuum of unbelief and mistrust step liars and peddlers of fantasies. By all means call another referendum or election, but what makes anyone confident that the electorate will make a “better” decision than last time round? And I don’t just mean Brexit.
OCT1	The Tories have split the country. No spending splurge can repair it	Look at the people here in Manchester at the Tory party conference, stare into their eyes and they look much as they always did – ordinary home counties folk, small business people, plus a few sharp-suited would-be spads. Not noticeably odd, yet these party members are the tiny group who have done for their country. Over the past decade, their Brexit fever has packed the Commons with Europhobes. These respectable law and order-minded patriots chose a dishonest, disreputable, disgrace of a man for prime minister, who will trash their constitution, mislead their monarch, and disrespect their judges to use “any means necessary” to get anything he wants. These ordinary people have turned into wreckers of what they used to hold dearest.
OCT1	The Tories can live with a Brexit extension – as long as someone else takes the blame	The best way to rouse drowsy delegates at the Tory conference is to declare, “Get Brexit done”. It is this year’s guaranteed applause line. No matter how clunking the speech or how flat the joke, uttering it gets the members clapping. In the bars and the receptions, it’s the same story – the phrase has people raising their glasses and cheering approval. The message is simple and repetitive: back Boris Johnson to get Brexit done and allow the country to move on and talk about something else. Normally a party comes up with a slogan for its conference and then focus-groups it. But there was no need with this slogan: it came out of the focus groups. No 10 and CCHQ were struck by how often voters said it in these groups, which Dominic Cummings sets such store by, and so decided to adopt it as their own.
OCT1	Is defeat inevitable for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement?	Who lost Hong Kong? It’s a question that should worry – and anger – western politicians and voters as they watch from afar the slow, merciless strangulation of the former British colony’s courageous pro-democracy movement. Once the grand panjandrums of China’s ruling Communist party have completed Tuesdays national day celebrations, additional, potentially fatal twists of their state security garrotte appear inevitable. The malign nature of Beijing’s looming actions may only be intensified by the large-scale demonstrations planned in Hong Kong to coincide with the People’s Republic’s 70th anniversary. Multiple protests and strikes are going ahead despite official bans, pre-emptive arrests, brutal police tactics and media intimidation. But they look destined to end in more damagingly futile violence, similar to that seen at the weekend.
OCT1	Boris Johnson’s unwinnable chess match is nearing its endgame	The go-to analogy for some when looking at the latest stage of the Brexit mess is three-dimensional chess, with multiple boards being played simultaneously. Political scientists, for their part, have tended to refer to “two level games”. The language is different, but the point is the same: to understand Boris Johnson’s predicament, you need to grasp the complex and contradictory trade-offs inherent in keeping power at home while managing international negotiations abroad. Parliament has boxed the prime minister in. He faces a stark choice: break the law; request an extension from the EU he has vowed never to request; resign; or attempt to secure a Brexit deal. All of a sudden, getting a deal seems the most attractive option. Amid all the noise from the Tory conference, the promise of concrete proposals from the UK this Thursday is a signal this reality has been digested by No 10.
OCT1	Greta Thunberg’s enemies are right to be scared. Her new political allies should be too	Greta Thunberg has made a lot of enemies. They are easy to recognise because their rage is so great they cannot help making themselves look ridiculous. Thunberg’s arrival in the US earlier this month set off rightwing pundits and then the president himself. The conservative provocateur Dinesh D’Souza compared her look to a Nazi propaganda poster; a Fox News guest called her a “mentally ill Swedish child” being exploited by her parents; and Trump mocked her on Twitter as a “happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”, after a speech in which she urgently laid out the dismal prospects for her generation’s future. These are the latest attacks, but they aren’t the darkest, or most unhinged. Arron Banks intimating that she might drown crossing the Atlantic in August might be the single worst example – or you can stare directly into the abyss by witnessing the depraved abuse Thunberg receives across the social media networks.
OCT1	Why Europe’s new populists tell so many lies – and do it so shamelessly	The torrent of lies that flows from the mouths of populists feels relentless: from Donald Trump’s routine lying about everything from Iran to the weather, to Boris Johnson’s fictitious £350m for the NHS, Turkey on the cusp of joining the EU or most sensationally misleading the Queen about why the UK parliament should be shut down. My research on populism elsewhere in Europe confirms that lying is a constant feature of populist politics. In France, Marine Le Pen lies about how her party spends public money and her (fake) Twitter accounts. Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, lies gigantically and systematically about the migration to his country. As for Italy’s Matteo Salvini – from migration to sanctions against Russia – as the song goes, if his lips are moving, he’s lying. 
OCT1	Brexit may feel apocalyptic – but radical new ideas are taking root	Who would now dare to find hope in among the Brexit nightmare? Halloween is just a month away, and there is still no sign of any breakthrough in negotiations. The Conservative party is dealing in dangerous rightwing populism, a development that looks all the more abject because its new leader has taken this turn solely in the interests of his own career. The idea that an election could end the mess is undermined by wildly uneven polls, many of which have pointed to another hung parliament. And after his behaviour in the Commons last week and lack of contrition since, the prospect of Boris Johnson somehow agreeing some kind of compromise deal and getting it through parliament with the help of Labour MPs now looks like a fantasy. If you want a vision of the future, imagine an upper-class voice yelling, “Get Brexit done” for ever, as the paralysis and failure deepens.
OCT1	This isn’t a crisis of ‘civility’ – it’s the right whipping up violence	There were “bad people” on “many sides”: this is how Donald Trump notoriously responded to the killing of Heather Heyer, an anti-fascist protester, by a far-right terrorist in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. As a debate rages over the deliberate use of incendiary language by the British right, it seems this moral equivalence has been imported. We are told that British politics is being menaced by a general lack of civility that threatens to fuel violence from all sides, and that both left and right have an equal responsibility to dial down the rhetoric. But this deflects from the real threat: a violent far right that is emboldened and fuelled by mainstream politicians – including from the prime minister’s office – and several media outlets.
OCT1	The Naga Munchetty row shows diversity is still about optics, not real change	There are, broadly, two designated roles for people of colour in the British media. The first is to be the “as a” person. You know the one: the person who is there to speak about their experiences of racism or discrimination “as a” black man or “as a” Muslim woman. The second is to simply to be there – bringing your talent, yes, but also to add diversity to a lineup. News presenter Naga Munchetty discovered last week that the BBC sees her as the latter. It’s happy to have black and brown faces, but only as long as they don’t wander off the reservation and actually attempt to bring their experiences to bear on their journalism.
OCT1	If Boris Johnson has a plan for Brexit he must reveal it now	At school, you can only tell the teacher so many times that the dog ate your homework. After a while, you have to produce it. Or admit you never did it in the first place. That is the position Boris Johnson finds himself in on Brexit. And whether it’s being accountable to parliament or to the public in an election after a vote of no confidence this week, it’s time he came clean on what his detailed plan is. Theresa May’s mistake was to promise “Brexit means Brexit” but then negotiate a “vassal-state” deal, as Jacob Rees-Mogg described it, that was the worst of all worlds and more unpopular than the poll tax. Johnson quit his cabinet position as he felt so strongly that May’s Brexit deal was a bad one. Brexiteers said it was because her heart wasn’t in it as a remainer. So it’s hardly surprising there is little trust left in the Brexit process.
OCT2	Sajid Javid says everyone wants to get Brexit done. That’s patently not true	You develop a certain immunity to the news these days. You can’t succumb to despair every time the prime minister lies or the leader of the House of Commons makes a debasing remark about parliament, there simply isn’t time. I find it quite surprising, now, to feel depressed by the Today programme. And yet on Monday the Saj did reawaken that political nerve, on a tour of the broadcast studios to preview his unmemorable conference speech. “Everyone on the doorstep,” the chancellor proclaimed, “is saying, ‘get Brexit done’. They don’t say, ‘cancel the result’. They don’t say, ‘have a second referendum’. They say, ‘get Brexit done’.” As a matter of observable fact, this can’t be right: what about the 6 million who signed the petition to revoke article 50? Or the 16 million-plus who voted remain? Or the young voters who came of age after 2016? And on and on. Sajid Javid would have been safer sticking to the formula deployed by the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly. He told an audience in Manchester this week that he had been “knocking on very traditional Victorian terraced houses” in Darlington, where he met a guy who said: “You’re that Tory. I’m going to vote for you lot.” It might not get past a creative writing tutor, but at least it’s not immediately falsifiable.
OCT2	While Johnson plays games, the EU prepares to move on	In a normal game of poker, a bluff cannot continue once it is called. But for Boris Johnson an exposed bluff can just be re-bluffed. The stakes get higher even when the poor hand lies open on the table. Before entering Downing Street, Johnson claimed that deficiencies in Theresa May’s Brexit deal were caused by failure of nerve, not weakness in the UK’s position. The theory was that Brussels needed to see kamikaze intent in British eyes: total commitment to quitting the bloc with no deal. Only then would the cowardly continentals yield. It is true that the EU wants a deal, because of the harm that Brexit without one would do. But the harm is asymmetric. In a no-deal scenario, the UK suffers more and, after a period of gratuitous pain, returns to negotiations with diminished leverage. It was never a real bluff because the economic cards were dealt face up.
OCT2	Johnson has run out of road. Other people’s outrage is all he’s got now	Boris Johnson is routinely dismissed as a liar for whom the truth is just another fling. So it is all the more perplexing that his bluster about a no-deal Brexit is taken seriously. The truth is that Johnson does not want a no-deal Brexit – and certainly not one that precedes a general election. Let’s start with the genesis of no-deal Brexit. It was an exemplar of Theresa May’s politics: a tactic invented to force her will on parliament rather than to engage in the hard graft of consensus-building political leadership. It was also an embarrassingly misguided attempt to threaten the European Union.
OCT2	Homelessness could happen to any of us – the numbers shame us all	It is the census that utterly shames us as a nation. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of people dying homeless is at an all-time high. An estimated 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, a 22% rise on 2017. The biggest rise was in drug-related deaths, up by 55% since 2017. This, in one of the world’s richest nations, is a moral emergency – and it demands emergency action. Since I lost my dad to a tragic lifelong struggle with drink, I’ve worked with Birmingham’s homeless community. What drives me is the simple realisation that so many people sleeping rough are self-medicating for trauma and distress with drugs and alcohol in exactly the same way my dad did.
OCT2	Chirac delivered little and left office under a cloud. Why does France now love him?	We French love to mourn our former presidents. Thousands queued to pay their last respects to Jacques Chirac as he lay in state at the weekend. Monday was a day of national mourning: the tricolour flew at half mast everywhere and a minute’s silence was observed even in schools. It is hard, though, to know which love is greater – the love of mourning the passing of former heads of state, or the love of loathing them with the fervour we held when they were in power. I remember all through the 1970s my mother calling Chirac “facho Chirac” because of his greasy, thinning pulled-back hair, his wannabe Charles de Gaulle style of speaking and his war-like conquest of the right and of Paris city hall. The French have an unusual relationship with power, specifically with our elected presidency. It is, some would say with good reason, a relationship that is borderline pathological
OCT2	The Tories have lost their ideology. Now they are merely the party of resentment	What does the Conservative party stand for in 2019? If you survey the central tenets of Tory ideology from the past 50 years, it is hard to find a single one that is still intact. The party of business is hellbent on undermining access to an export market of half a billion people. The party of law and order is now raging against the judiciary – with senior Tories being regularly asked whether their government intends to obey the law.
OCT2	Strong, smart teen girls have had enough. No wonder men like Trump are rattled	The president of the United States openly mocked a teenage girl. After dismissing the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg in person and earning her ire, he tweeted to his 65 million followers: “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!” Dismissive. Sarcastic. Mocking. Utterly typical. Is anyone surprised?
OCT2	We’re not ‘traitors’ or ‘remoaners’ – but this is a dark time to be a civil servant	There is a clear link between the provocative language used by ministers and other politicians and the increase of threats to public figures. Everyone knows it, which is why politicians of every stripe have asked urgent questions in parliament that all focused on Boris Johnson’s use of inflammatory language as a deliberate strategy. Instead of answering them, junior minister Kevin Foster shrugged off the concerns, and relentlessly bridged back to what has become the Tory party conference motto: “get Brexit done”. Only after that, we are told, will the hate and the division in our country subside, as if an election and a promised spending splurge could repair the damage that’s been done to our public square over three years.
OCT2	Labour’s pledge to scrap universal credit could end the era of blaming ‘scroungers’	Critics call it inhumane. Even its supporters talk of its colossal delays and waste. Now, universal credit has been given another blow as Labour announced the system would be scrapped under a Jeremy Corbyn government. Labour has not yet disclosed what this would fully entail – rather than a total scrap, it appears the basic structure would remain. But a £3bn package of emergency reforms seems enough to make the new model unrecognisable: from removing the tax-credit “rape clause” (whereby women have to show their third or subsequent child was conceived as a result of rape to be exempt from the two-child limit on receiving the credit), to introducing interim payments to cushion people from the debt-creating five-week wait. That the party has committed to scrap the system is a hugely significant step. The underfunding of Britain’s safety net has now gone beyond critical levels. Over the past decade, multibillion-pound cuts, combined with a toxic anti-welfare narrative, has upended the meaning of social security. Humiliation has replaced help, punishment put in place of compassion.
OCT2	Centrist politics will not defeat Boris Johnson’s rightwing populism	In his determination to deliver Brexit “do or die”, Boris Johnson is planning to launch an election campaign that will pit “the people” against “parliament”. He promises to take sovereignty back from the political elites – and return it to “the people”. The announcement of these tactics has caused alarm among those who fear democracy will be threatened by a “populist” politics of polarisation between “us” and “them”. But this fear of populism reveals something troubling about how we currently understand democratic politics. What most people seem to find shocking about Johnson’s strategy is that it involves an “us v them” confrontation – as if democratic politics could avoid conflict between irreconcilable political projects.
OCT3	This cowardly speech reveals Boris Johnson’s armoury is empty	Boris Johnson’s speech to the Conservative party conference was of a piece with his brief and tawdry prime ministership so far. The speech was a scam, an attempt to pretend that inconvenient realities can be wished out of existence by putting on a crowd-pleasing act. Yet these inconvenient realities include such things as the law of the land, the elected parliament, the European Union and the island of Ireland. Between them, these realities have enough clout to foil him. Today’s speech was hardly designed to reassure the undecided. Most prime ministers devote weeks to honing their message to their party conference. They probably take the occasion too seriously. Johnson is the precise opposite. He seemed to have cobbled together his speech over breakfast. There was no architecture or narrative to it.
OCT3	Labour’s message of ‘the many not the few’ can beat the Tories	For those bristling under a near-decade of Tory rule, what should disturb most about the Tories’ annual gathering? Priti Patel’s bitter broadside against the “north London, metropolitan, liberal elite” and her look of sadistic delight as she pledged to “end the free movement of people once and for all”? The crowd of Tory members, faces contorted with fury, angrily booing and jeering when a journalist dared to challenge Boris Johnson’s cruel appropriation of Jo Cox’s memory? Or what about when Johnson addressed a party reception and began a sentence about Jeremy Corbyn with “We’ll invite him to enter …”, and delegates finished his sentence with “traitors’ gate” and “a noose”? No. What should truly chill is that this gaggle – intoxicated with an authoritarian brand of nationalism – could win the coming electoral clash, and transform the country in their own image.
OCT3	I’ve seen how rash words can escalate into conflict. I fear it may happen again	Boris Johnson today announced that the Conservative government intends to propose a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, something that Theresa May, to her credit, went to enormous lengths to avoid in negotiations over Brexit. There is no doubt this proposal, while apparently welcome to the DUP, will be rejected by the EU and by the majority of people in Northern Ireland. This move and Johnson’s earlier suggestion, before becoming prime minister, that the border in Ireland was analogous to the border between Islington and Camden, makes me wonder if he understands how high the stakes are. I have worked for more than 30 years trying to help end armed conflicts, from Northern Ireland to Colombia. One thing that strikes me is how often countries slip into them by accident, not because the leaders want to start a civil war but because they get carried away with their cause – and feel justified in doing absolutely anything to win, without fully thinking through the consequences.
OCT3	The Tories’ ‘angry white men’ act is desperate and dangerous	In his just-published memoirs, David Cameron describes how in 2010 he finally broke New Labour’s grip on power to become prime minister. “We had changed the Conservative party, making it appeal once more to Middle England and making people in urban, liberal Britain feel that they could vote for us.” Wandering around this year’s Tory party conference, I sought some remnants of that legacy, even the ghostliest traces of the Cameron spirit. I came up empty. As the Conservatives plough toward the end of a decade in power that he bequeathed to them, the institutional memory of its leader of 11 years has been almost wiped clean. A new gang now runs the show, both in the secure zone at Manchester and across the land. They are redder of face, faster to jab fingers and they are fuelled by a vast resentment that demands constant replenishment. Forget Cameroonian optimism and progressive posturing: anger is the Conservatives’ new electoral strategy. An exaggerated, focus-grouped, nasty anger, to be sure; but not entirely artificial, nor without some justification. And it is my genuine fear that their anger could consume the entire country.
OCT3	The climate protest movement must not alienate Britain’s working classes	Next week thousands of Extinction Rebellion protesters will descend on Westminster, the latest example of direct action in a year when committed women, men and children across the world have pushed climate change to the top of the global agenda, where it belongs. Although London will again be the focal point, the movement mustn’t overlook the committed activists in places such as Bolton, Wigan, and Sunderland who are also spreading the message across the country. For the climate movement to succeed we have to build a broad coalition that covers our nation’s towns as well as our cities, and reaches out across class divides. Calls for individual action can’t just be modelled on the lifestyles of middle-class city dwellers. Telling people to get out of their cars can’t be the solution in those parts of the country where decades of chronic underinvestment have left us without public transport. In towns such as Wigan, jobs have disappeared as investment flowed into cities, creating lengthy commutes on public transport for most working-age people. Trains are overcrowded, deeply unreliable and ceased to function entirely for a large part of last year, while the buses are few and far between, and often more expensive than getting a taxi. Demanding people abandon their cars isn’t realistic if the alternative is a round trip of 42 miles a day on foot or by bike, just to get to work. Campaigns to tackle climate change need to link up with campaigns for better transport and fairer funding for it, particularly for buses.
OCT3	The Tories' tough talk on crime is shameless and cynical	In the spirit of the party conference season, let me start with a platitude: everybody wants dangerous criminals to be dealt with properly. But what “properly” actually means depends heavily on someone’s political perspective. The law sets out five purposes of criminal sentencing: rehabilitation; crime reduction (including by deterrence); reparation; protection of the public; and punishment. The problem with our current system, in the eyes of Boris Johnson’s government, is that there isn’t enough emphasis on punishment. So it was that justice secretary Robert Buckland QC trailed his conference speech by announcing in an interview with the Daily Mail that he was introducing “proper punishment” for “the most serious violent and sexual offenders”.
OCT3	I work in a crumbling NHS. Glitzy Tory promises won’t save it	As predictable as English downpours are the pools of water I have to sidestep in hospital corridors, caused by the leaking, rickety, 1950s roofs. One flood came from burst internal sewerage pipes. That was infinitely worse. It smelt exactly as you’d expect and caused an entire assessment unit to be closed for weeks. I’ve sat in doctors’ messes infested with cockroaches, and once looked up at the scuttling to find myself face to face with a rat. This is the grim reality of so much NHS real estate. Threadbare, dilapidated, in dire need of refurbishment. Staff struggle to care for their patients these days amid collapsing ceilings, crumbling buildings, broken boilers and unsafe fire cladding. Some 43% of NHS buildings are now more than 30 years old and an astonishing 18% predate the founding of the NHS in 1948. I’ve conducted ward rounds in huts that resemble the old codebreakers’ cabins of Bletchley Park. Freezing in winter, sweltering in summer – hardly a healing environment.
OCT3	Silence still surrounds the murder of my fiance, Jamal Khashoggi. Who will speak up?	Exactly one year ago, I stood outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, waiting for my fiance, Jamal Khashoggi, to come out with the marriage documents we needed to begin our life together. I was optimistic, even excited. Yet I never saw Jamal again. I did not expect to have my life transformed. I did not expect to have to alert the authorities to Jamal’s disappearance, or to find myself at the centre of a story that would shake the world. I did not expect, on a day that seemed unremarkable, to have my dreams shattered. By necessity I was put on a path, compelled to begin a campaign for justice for the man who was not only stolen from me but also taken away from those who read his work, and who admired him for his courage and his unrelenting commitment to the truth.
OCT3	Sajid Javid says everyone wants to get Brexit done. That’s patently not true	You develop a certain immunity to the news these days. You can’t succumb to despair every time the prime minister lies or the leader of the House of Commons makes a debasing remark about parliament, there simply isn’t time. I find it quite surprising, now, to feel depressed by the Today programme. And yet on Monday the Saj did reawaken that political nerve, on a tour of the broadcast studios to preview his unmemorable conference speech. “Everyone on the doorstep,” the chancellor proclaimed, “is saying, ‘get Brexit done’. They don’t say, ‘cancel the result’. They don’t say, ‘have a second referendum’. They say, ‘get Brexit done’.” As a matter of observable fact, this can’t be right: what about the 6 million who signed the petition to revoke article 50? Or the 16 million-plus who voted remain? Or the young voters who came of age after 2016? And on and on. Sajid Javid would have been safer sticking to the formula deployed by the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly. He told an audience in Manchester this week that he had been “knocking on very traditional Victorian terraced houses” in Darlington, where he met a guy who said: “You’re that Tory. I’m going to vote for you lot.” It might not get past a creative writing tutor, but at least it’s not immediately falsifiable.
OCT3	Ireland: no country for the young, creative or homeless	There’s a reason that “Was it for this?” remains one of WB Yeats’s most recited fragments of poetry in Ireland. The line comes from Yeats’s September 1913, which poured scorn on how the greed and hypocrisies of the business class had replaced the romanticism of previous Irish generations. Ireland’s modern dismay, however, is at rampant and growing inequality, and the way in which its cities and cultural spaces are being hollowed out by speculation, gentrification, poor or absent planning and squandered opportunities.
OCT4	A version of Theresa May’s deal is the only way out of the Brexit nightmare	So what now? Boris Johnson’s tactic of leaving Brexit to the last minute and then serving up a dog’s breakfast seems unlikely to work. Both Dublin and Brussels have effectively rubbished it. The offer to the EU is absurd. In place of Brexit’s promised “no border on the island of Ireland”, he offers two borders: a customs one on land and a regulatory one in the Irish sea. In place of “frictionless trade”, he offers a blizzard of bureaucracy and a gift to smuggling. In place of “take back control”, he offers a non-existent Northern Irish assembly a veto over British trade policy. As the prime minister’s first hesitant step into personal diplomacy, it is dire. The only sensible way forward must now be to separate Brexit on 31 October from the resolution of these fiendish trading arrangements
OCT4	This brutal judgment on pensions is blind to the reality of older women’s lives	Equality for women is not always a victory. Women and men’s entitlement to a state pension was equalised by law back in 1995, so women retire at 65 now, at 66 next year – just the same as men. Sounds fair? Not to women born in the 1950s whose lives were hard work and slim savings, with no chance to build up pensions: they expected to retire at 60 and draw their state pension. Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) took their case to court for compensation and today they lost. These implacable campaigners for the pension rights of nearly 4 million women born in the 1950s turn up at every political event and tail each Department for Work and Pensions secretary relentlessly to protest about pension changes that left many in penury. Politicians groan inwardly when they see them coming, but these women never give up.
OCT4	Northern Ireland’s abortion ban is finally crumbling. Even if some won’t accept it	In 2013, Sarah Ewart received a heartbreaking fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis for her much-wanted pregnancy. Faced with the prospect of a baby who might die during gestation or shortly after birth, she felt she couldn’t continue with the pregnancy. But in Northern Ireland abortion is illegal unless the mother’s health or life is at risk, so Sarah travelled to England for a termination. It was a journey she should never have had to make.
OCT4	Demagogues thrive by whipping up our fury. Here’s how to thwart them	Is this democracy’s death spiral? Are we, in this country and others, falling into a lethal cycle of fury and reaction, that blocks the reasoned conversation on which civic life depends? In every age there have been political hucksters using aggression, lies and outrage to drown out reasoned argument. But not since the 1930s have so many succeeded.
OCT4	Hillary Clinton says when life’s tough, ‘keep going’. I’m not so sure	At the theatre on Saturday night, I watched Diana Nyad, the long-distance swimmer, ignite an audience for over an hour. She recounted her record-breaking 111-mile swim from Cuba to Florida at the age of 64 after several failed attempts, and in the face of killer sharks, deadly jellyfish and huge waves. It was like listening to a one-woman version of the Iliad, an almost too perfect literalisation of inspirational metaphor. The subtitle of the show was “never, ever give up”, a well-worn sentiment that in Nyad’s hands was made thrillingly new. As it happens, the Clintons were in the audience at New York’s Minetta Lane Theatre that night. Afterwards on the pavement with one eye on the SUV convoy, theatregoers joked that Nyad’s words risked inspiring Hillary – God forbid – to have another crack at the White House. A few days later, Hillary and Chelsea appeared on the TV show Good Morning America to promote their book, The Book of Gutsy Women. To the question, “What’s the gutsiest thing you’ve ever done?” Hillary replied, “Ah, boy, I think the gutsiest thing I’ve ever done – well, personally, make the decision to stay in my marriage.” The bravest thing she’d done in public was run for president, she said, and in both scenarios the trick was to “just get up every day and keep going”.
OCT4	Teenagers need to know where love stops and abusive relationships start	Why are we always pointing to Instagram as the cause of mental illness in our teenagers? It’s frustrating that abusive relationships, and the trauma they cause, are rarely mentioned in discussions about the prevalence of mental health problems in young people. Research by Women’s Aid and Cosmopolitan has found that a third of teenage girls have been in an abusive relationship. And, if that isn’t shocking enough, when the remaining two-thirds were asked further questions, it emerged that 64% of them had, in fact, experienced abusive behaviour – they just didn’t realise it was abuse. Domestic abuse is normally associated with women cowering on the floor, as a violent husband waits to strike, or mothers covering up their black eyes with concealer before the school run. On the same day that the domestic abuse bill received its second reading in parliament, Age UK called for action to tackle domestic abuse of over-60s, whose needs it says are often overlooked by the law, policy and practice. The needs of teenagers in the heady throes of first love who are in emotionally abusive relationships also need to be recognised.
OCT4	This cowardly speech reveals Boris Johnson’s armoury is empty	Boris Johnson’s speech to the Conservative party conference was of a piece with his brief and tawdry prime ministership so far. The speech was a scam, an attempt to pretend that inconvenient realities can be wished out of existence by putting on a crowd-pleasing act. Yet these inconvenient realities include such things as the law of the land, the elected parliament, the European Union and the island of Ireland. Between them, these realities have enough clout to foil him. Today’s speech was hardly designed to reassure the undecided. Most prime ministers devote weeks to honing their message to their party conference. They probably take the occasion too seriously. Johnson is the precise opposite. He seemed to have cobbled together his speech over breakfast. There was no architecture or narrative to it.
OCT4	Labour’s message of ‘the many not the few’ can beat the Tories	For those bristling under a near-decade of Tory rule, what should disturb most about the Tories’ annual gathering? Priti Patel’s bitter broadside against the “north London, metropolitan, liberal elite” and her look of sadistic delight as she pledged to “end the free movement of people once and for all”? The crowd of Tory members, faces contorted with fury, angrily booing and jeering when a journalist dared to challenge Boris Johnson’s cruel appropriation of Jo Cox’s memory? Or what about when Johnson addressed a party reception and began a sentence about Jeremy Corbyn with “We’ll invite him to enter …”, and delegates finished his sentence with “traitors’ gate” and “a noose”? No. What should truly chill is that this gaggle – intoxicated with an authoritarian brand of nationalism – could win the coming electoral clash, and transform the country in their own image.
OCT4	In the twisted story of eugenics, the bad guy is all of us	How should we remember historical figures who we know have done terrible things? It’s a dilemma we face more often, as universities and public institutions critically examine their histories, reassessing the past with 21st-century eyes. And over the last year, University College London has been in the midst of a historical inquiry into its role as the institutional birthplace of eugenics – the debunked “science” that claimed that by selectively breeding humans we could improve racial quality. We tend to associate eugenics with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, but it was in fact developed in London. Its founder was Francis Galton, who established a laboratory at UCL in 1904. Already, some students and staff have called on the university to rename its Galton lecture theatre.
OCT4	I’ve seen how rash words can escalate into conflict. I fear it may happen again	Boris Johnson today announced that the Conservative government intends to propose a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, something that Theresa May, to her credit, went to enormous lengths to avoid in negotiations over Brexit. There is no doubt this proposal, while apparently welcome to the DUP, will be rejected by the EU and by the majority of people in Northern Ireland. This move and Johnson’s earlier suggestion, before becoming prime minister, that the border in Ireland was analogous to the border between Islington and Camden, makes me wonder if he understands how high the stakes are. I have worked for more than 30 years trying to help end armed conflicts, from Northern Ireland to Colombia. One thing that strikes me is how often countries slip into them by accident, not because the leaders want to start a civil war but because they get carried away with their cause – and feel justified in doing absolutely anything to win, without fully thinking through the consequences.
OCT5	Jennifer Arcuri came late to the party. But the Johnson franchise is unthinkable without her now	Kick back and pour yourself a tech-o-tini, because there’s a new political star in town – and she is finally talking. She’s talking in a Los Angeles supermarket car park for now, laughing merrily while holding a large carton of almond milk. But if her lawyer gets his way, she’ll be talking in a high-paying British newspaper this weekend. She is, of course, Jennifer Arcuri – model, infosec entrepreneur, and the businesswoman responsible for the technological education of Boris Johnson. On Thursday, a US attorney was fielding multiple calls attempting to broker a deal for her story. Asked if that would include her confirming a romantic relationship with Johnson, he replied: “It depends on your definition of romantic. ? Wow. Go on. “I’ve known Jennifer for 14 years. There’s a lot of scrutiny of Mr Johnson. Get in the queue — if you want her services, you have to pay for it. ? Ought he to be making his client sound like Lol Flanders? It’s not for us to judge.
OCT5	Peace in Ireland is precious. Brexit has made us forget that	It is one of the stranger aspects of the Brexit debate. When the plea is raised to remember the Good Friday agreement, to do nothing that might jeopardise the fragile peace that has held in Northern Ireland for two decades, that plea usually comes in a continental European accent. Of course, Irish politicians have been saying it loudly from the start, but this week it was striking to hear French, German, Dutch or Belgian voices explaining to British TV and radio audiences why the EU couldn’t possibly accept Boris Johnson’s revised Brexit plan because of the risk it posed to peace in a corner of the United Kingdom where a bloody conflict had raged within recent memory. You’d think Britons wouldn’t need to be reminded. An estimated 3,500 people were killed during the 30-year war we euphemistically referred to as “the Troubles”. That violence was the background hum of life on these islands – on the news most days – until the late 1990s, in Northern Ireland obviously but also in Britain. Pubs were bombed, along with department stores and shopping centres, even a party conference. As a schoolchild, I remember how routine it became for the tube home to be closed due to “a bomb scare”.
OCT5	For those who want to stop no deal, Jeremy Corbyn is the only hope	Departing Tory leaders have developed an odd and presumptuous habit of demanding that the leader of the opposition resign too. “As a party leader who has accepted when her time was up, ? Theresa May told Jeremy Corbyn in her final prime minister’s questions, preparing to leave her party to Boris Johnson and the country without a prayer, “perhaps the time has come for him to do the same. ? In 2016, David Cameron – who had called a referendum lost it, only to then break his promise and abandon the country in a moment of self-inflicted crisis – suggested Corbyn’s resignation would be a patriotic act. “It might be in my party’s interest for him to sit there. It’s not in the national interest. I would say, for heaven’s sake, man, go. ?
OCT5	Why the world needs an IMF for the climate crisis	Human civilisation is facing a crisis on a scale that we have not seen since the second world war. We must finally respond in a way that meets this immense challenge. The climate crisis is of our own creation, particularly that of the richest countries whose development has been based on exploiting natural resources without end. The casualties are piling up – some countries and entire communities, in particular island nations, are the most exposed and least prepared: after Hurricane Dorian, we have all seen the devastation in the Bahamas. 
OCT5	Trump is his own biggest enemy in the impeachment inquiry	Less than two weeks after his election, Donald Trump announced to the world that he was considering a crazed animal for his first secretary of defense. Nobody but Trump called the highly respected general Mad Dog. But that didn’t stop the maddest dog of them all. Jim Mattis, who told everyone he hated the nickname, eventually resigned because he wasn’t mad enough to follow the leader of this peculiar pack by trashing every US ally on the planet.
OCT5	I reported my friend for raping me. It was no surprise when the case was dropped	UK rape prosecution statistics make depressing reading, especially for the victims. News such as rape charges, prosecutions and convictions in England and Wales falling to their lowest levels in more than a decade, for example. Or the report showing that only 3% of rape claims in London result in convictions. Recently, even, prosecutors have been urged to adopt a more risk-averse approach to rape cases by taking a proportion of “weak cases” out of the system. These are just a few examples of the kind of news that still gives me a full-body adrenaline surge, that drains the blood from my face and leaves me feeling ill. Of course, I am all for an increased media focus on the failure of our justice system to prosecute those who commit acts of sexual violence, but on a personal level, I find the constant reminder disturbing – if that’s the right word.
OCT5	I’ve seen the child slavery of county lines up close. £20m won’t stop it	Most people I speak to don’t know what the term “county lines” means. I didn’t either, but when a child close to me became entrapped, I had no choice but to climb a steep and terrifying learning curve. “County lines” refers to the mobile phone numbers used by criminal networks to sell and distribute drugs around the country. The term sounds kind of street and clever. But it’s a sanitisation of what county lines drug gangs really represent: the slavery of our children and young people for the purposes of making vast amounts of money. Child slaves are being recruited in our communities, under our noses, in parks, town centres and outside schools across the country. Criminals actively target communities they deem to be easy targets: those with cut-to-the-bone services, thin policing and a belief that “this sort of thing doesn’t happen here”.
OCT5	Harry and Meghan are celebrities, but that doesn’t mean they owe us everything	The royal family does not much go in for the vulgarity of emotion. Princess Diana was expected to tolerate her husband’s infidelity in dignified silence, not go crying to Panorama. Her children would, in turn, be expected to walk dry-eyed behind her coffin. The family still mostly takes its lead from the Queen’s constitutional obligation to conceal her feelings, recognising that her rockiest moments have come when asked to reveal more than is comfortable – during Scotland’s independence referendum, or when the unexpected national wave of grief over Diana’s death left the family looking dangerously stiff. The younger royals have pushed the boundaries by discussing their mental health, but raw, unfiltered emotion is still regarded as suspiciously bad for business. Imagine the concern, then, at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s insistence on showing some.
OCT5	A version of Theresa May’s deal is the only way out of the Brexit nightmare	So what now?

Not to women born in the 1950s whose lives were hard work and slim savings, with no chance to build up pensions: they expected to retire at 60 and draw their state pension. BackTo60 took their case to court for compensation and today they lost. BackTo60 and Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) are implacable campaigners for the pension rights of nearly 4 million women born in the 1950s. Waspi turn up at every political event and tail each Department for Work and Pensions secretary relentlessly to protest about pension changes that left many in penury. Politicians groan inwardly when they see them coming, but these women never give up.
OCT6	The EU was crucial to securing peace in Ireland. This plan puts it in peril	One of the disconcerting things about Brexit is its capacity constantly to rewrite the script of political dysfunction. The latest government proposals won’t work. They do represent a significant concession, but create an incoherent muddle leading to a bizarre outcome. Northern Ireland would remain part of Europe’s single market but Britain would leave it. There would be regulatory checks down the Irish Sea but not at the Irish border. There would however be customs checks, so the border would not be open as now. And Northern Ireland’s membership of the single market could be unilaterally revoked by its assembly, which is not presently able to constitute itself, and so the whole plan is subject to the notorious vagaries of Northern Irish politics.
OCT6	Is architecture at last breaking through its own glass ceiling?	Some kind of congratulations are due to the Royal Institute of British Architects for choosing as this year’s winners of the royal gold medal for architecture the Irish practice Grafton. For Grafton Architects is run by two women, Shelley McNamara and Yvonne Farrell, which means that for the second time since Queen Victoria awarded the first such medal in 1848, it has gone outright to members of the same sex as the late queen-empress. On two other occasions, women have won the prize together with their husband-colleagues. This year, the RIBA could hardly have done otherwise, given a campaign by an action group called Part W to highlight the scarcity of women among the winners of the gold medal and the world’s other top awards for architecture. It is flabbergasting that this conversation still has to be had now, in 2019. Still, baby steps. The choice of Grafton can’t be faulted, either – they are outstanding architects.
OCT6	If Donald Trump goes down, he’ll try to take everyone with him	There are two ways of looking at Donald Trump’s astonishing response to the Democrats’ attempt to impeach him. Either Trump has finally lost the plot or else he has just guaranteed himself a stunning victory in next year’s presidential election. Whichever view is correct, both signal a rising sea of troubles for the US and the world. Suggestions that Trump has no idea what he’s doing were reinforced by some unhinged behaviour last week. His ranting about traitors, spies and low-life at a White House event was utterly bizarre, reviving claims that he is unfit for office.
OCT6	Europeans in Britain used to feel at home. Now they have their doubts	The liberal command to “celebrate diversity” misses that there is often little to celebrate. It takes a truly privileged and cosseted mind to imagine that identities are always a joyful embrace of essential natures. Minorities can be manufactured by the prejudiced and powerful who need outsiders for their supporters to define themselves against. If the prejudice and power did not exist, nor would they. Brexit Britain may not be up to much but it has become a world leader in creating identities no one needed or wanted. You would have been met with incomprehension in 2015 if you had declared yourself a “Leaver” or “Remainer” or talked about European Union nationals in Britain and Britons in Europe as if they were aliens, who must meet the exacting demands of a suspicious bureaucracy.
OCT6	It was gutsy of Hillary Clinton to stand by Bill. But it made political sense too	A woman who has been cheated on has a complex social role to play – she must be devastated, dignified and instantly unforgiving (banishing the sexual miscreant), as though she’s been given Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive to act out in some ghastly, very public round of emotional charades. No one knows this more than Hillary Clinton, who, in some eyes, committed a heinous feminist faux pas by forgiving her husband, Bill, for his multiple infidelities. Instead of the “Go on now, go – walk out the door!” narrative that is practically the cheatee-national anthem, Hillary “stood by her man”, even as she denied becoming a Tammy Wynette caricature. She has been relentlessly questioned, mocked and distrusted on account of this decision, arguably suffering more for her husband’s betrayals than he ever did. Now, interviewed with her daughter, Chelsea, about their new The Book of Gutsy Women, she cited “the decision to stay in my marriage” as the gutsiest personal thing she ever did. Just the gutsiest, Hillary – or also the smartest, the only outcome that made any kind of sense?
OCT6	Jonathan Safran Foer: I’ve got no beef with his plan to save the planet	Jonathan Safran Foer published Eating Animals in 2009. I didn’t read it until 2015, because I had a feeling that it would be persuasive and I would have to stop eating meat, which I found delicious, especially buttery, white-bread ham sandwiches and chicken shish kebabs. It took a long time before I was ready to have my last pepperoni pizza, but in choosing to pick up a book that I knew laid out the horrors of mass meat production, it was clear that I was almost there. And when I’d finished reading it, I simply stopped eating meat. The trade-off no longer seemed worth it. Safran Foer now aims to repeat that trick with We Are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast. Rather than focusing on the grotesque scale and inhumane practices of factory farming, he talks about the environmental impact of meat and dairy and offers practical suggestions for reducing our consumption of animal products instead. We hear again and again that in the US and the UK, to have any hope of slowing the climate emergency, we need to cut down on meat by 90% and dairy by 60%. Safran Foer’s idea is that we eat meat and dairy only in the evening. Easy.
OCT6	Jennifer Arcuri came late to the party. But the Johnson franchise is unthinkable without her now	Kick back and pour yourself a tech-o-tini, because there’s a new political star in town – and she is finally talking.

OCT6	Britain was complacent about the far right. Now it’s out in force	Once upon a time, the BBC banned fascists from its broadcasts. In 1935, when Oswald Mosley’s British Union was near its peak of popularity, organising rallies and marches across the country, the corporation stopped allowing him to appear on its programmes. The ban, unofficially supported by successive Conservative, Labour and coalition governments, lasted 33 years. Its rationale was straightforward: Mosley’s views were too extreme, his supporters too threatening, and his admiration for foreign authoritarians too strong for him to be allowed a prominent place in the national discourse. A line was drawn between what was acceptable and unacceptable in rightwing politics, and Mosley was on the wrong side of it. By the time the prohibition was lifted, in 1968, he was a bitter old man. It’s impossible to imagine such a sustained and effective ban on a big far-right figure being imposed in Britain now. Many of our politicians and much of our media have stopped setting, let alone policing, any boundaries between mainstream conservatism and rightwing populism and extremism. The BBC seems reluctant to characterise Donald Trump as a racist. Nigel Farage, despite never having been elected as an MP, has been a panellist on BBC One’s Question Time 33 times. Tommy Robinson has been interviewed on BBC Two’s Newsnight. Meanwhile Boris Johnson, and many of his ministers, party members and newspaper allies, have adopted the boot-boy phrases and demagoguery of the far right. As the home secretary, Priti Patel, told a thrilled Conservative party conference this week: “To the criminals, I simply say this: we are coming after you.” A stronger law-and-order state, she said, “is what the people want”.
OCT6	Labour is letting other people define its Brexit message. That has to change	When the coming electoral contest is settled, there will either be a government led by an anti-austerity Labour party committed to a referendum with remain on the ballot paper, or a hard-right Tory party committed to the hardest of Brexits. Everything else is noise. Unfortunately, there is a lot of noise, and Labour is partly responsible. The party’s new Brexit position – that a deal with the EU should be put to the British people, and the government will implement whatever decision they make – is entirely straightforward, or at least it should be. It was, after all, the sole demand of the People’s Vote campaign, which – until three months ago – did not even officially back remain, just a referendum to end the impasse. But Labour is failing to communicate its stance clearly, fuelling a perception that the policy is a contorted mess when it actually isn’t.
